9105,the potential for sustaining grape production and improving crop water productivity in semi arid areas through direct root zone irrigation drz has been demonstrated in recent studies however it has only been tested for red wine grapes in sandy soils to expand its application a field study was conducted to investigate the influences of drz with reduced irrigation rate on yield berry quality root growth plant water status and crop water productivity of white wine grape vitis vinifera l cv chardonnay grown in a silt loam soil within a semi arid region of washington state usa compared with the surface drip irrigation which has been applied for decades in the study area drz could improve the crop water productivity by 23 34 and reduce the irrigation amount by 16 23 without yield loss under variable weather conditions indicating the efficacy of the drz as a novel subsurface irrigation strategy concurrently drz restricted root distribution within 0 60 cm soil layers and significantly reduced root number and root length density were observed in 20 40 cm soil depth moreover grapevines under moderate water stress induced by drz accumulated more soluble sugar 8 8 increase in brix on average and yeast assimilable nitrogen 24 4 increase on average in berries we conclude that proper deficit irrigation applied through drz would be applicable to optimize the water use for production and efficiently alter the root distribution pattern of chardonnay grapevine cultivated in moderately permeable soils with improved berry quality keywords subsurface drip irrigation root growth yield fruit quality white wine grape data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction grapevine vitis spp is a valuable horticultural crop worldwide with a large portion of grapes produced for making wine grapevines are deciduous woody perennial plants which are usually propagated through dormant cuttings based on the purpose of cultivation and the color of skins when ripe wine grapes could be categorized as red e g cabernet sauvignon merlot and white e g chardonnay riesling wine grape cultivars in semi arid regions limited precipitation barely satisfies the demand for grapevine growth during the active growing season requiring supplemental irrigation for achieving satisfactory grape yield and berry quality medrano et al 2015 however water scarcity presents a challenge for vineyard productivity in some regions and is becoming a critical issue under mounting concerns about a warming climate and competing demands for water resources mirás avalos and araujo 2021 thus adopting efficient irrigation techniques is essential to improve water use efficiency wue for sustaining grape production in many dry winegrowing regions worldwide fraga et al 2018 malek et al 2018 deficit irrigation by inducing adequate water stress on grapevines through reduced amount of irrigation water has been widely demonstrated as an effective water management strategy in vineyards for saving water controlling excessive vegetative growth and improving wue for yield without sacrificing berry quality ayars et al 2017 buesa et al 2017 lópez et al 2007 ma et al 2019 stout et al 2017 williams 2014 deficit irrigation can be applied through both surface and subsurface irrigation techniques traditional surface irrigation techniques may involve lower infrastructural costs and easier access to maintain the systems however water applied to the soil surface contributes to evaporation which reduces wue for yield a critical issue especially in arid regions li and zhang 2017 compared to surface irrigation subsurface drip irrigation sdi has gained wider acceptance for some woody perennial crops e g almond french prune walnut in recent decades due to improved irrigation tools and its benefits in water conservation and weed control ayars et al 2015 however disadvantages associated with conventional sdi systems need to be overcome to optimize their benefits for example buried drip lines are difficult to monitor adjust or repair once installed moreover localized sdi may result in smaller wetting patterns with enhanced water infiltration which might negatively impact aboveground growth of woody perennial crops due to restricted root zone for water and nutrient uptake to address the issues mentioned above direct root zone irrigation drz has been recently introduced as a novel subsurface irrigation system and was initially tested in commercial vineyards of cabernet sauvignon vitis vinifera l one of the most popular red wine grape cultivars in loamy sand soil under a semi arid climate jacoby and ma 2018 with benefits as a sdi system e g reduce surface water evaporation suppress weed growth drz could also flexibly adjust installation position water delivery depth and irrigation rate for maximizing crop water productivity wpc yield per unit area per unit of water applied and potentially reducing soil water evaporation and infiltration ma et al 2019 compared to the surface drip irrigation sd drz improved grape yield by 9 12 without sacrificing berry quality while helping relieve water stress in grapevines during the harsh summer ma et al 2020a to enhance the benefits of drz and provide more empirical evidence for expanding its application studies are needed to evaluate the drz efficiency on water utilization growth and production of other grape cultivars e g white wine grapes under different environmental scenarios e g weather pattern soil type chardonnay vitis vinifera l is a green skinned grape cultivar used for producing white wine it has been the top produced white cultivar in washington state in recent years and one of the most popular white cultivars around the world washington state wine commission usa 2020 chardonnay production in southcentral washington relies on supplemental irrigation due to the semi arid climate with extremely limited precipitation in summer influences of water stress induced by deficit irrigation on red and white wine grape cultivars can be different for instance reduced canopy under moderate water deficit allows more exposure of berries to sunlight which helps red wine grapes achieve the favored color and taste but it may adversely create more color and character for white wine grapes than desired university of california drought management usa 2020 moreover deficit irrigation could enhance accumulation of anthocyanins in red grapevine but increase flavonol concentration only in white grapevine e g chardonnay chaves et al 2010 deluc et al 2009 thus specific studies on white wine grapes would help better evaluate the efficacy of drz and boost its benefits for water resource management this study aimed to investigate the influences of drz with reduced irrigation rate on root growth yield berry quality and wpc in a commercial vineyard of chardonnay in a silt loam soil compared to the commercial sd which has been applied for decades in this area we hypothesized that chardonnay grapevines irrigated through drz have 1 fewer roots distributed in the shallow soil profile with minor effects on grape yield and 2 improved grape quality and wpc 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and irrigation system the field trial was conducted from 2016 to 2018 in a commercial vineyard of two year old own rooted chardonnay near prosser wa 46 15 26 n 119 44 55 w the orientation of vineyard rows was north to south with a spacing of 2 7 m between rows and 1 8 m between vines three wire trellis was used to support grapevine growth with vertical distances of 100 cm 140 cm and 180 cm between soil surface and each wire soil on the experimental site was classified as warden silt loam 0 48 cm silt loam 48 152 cm stratified very fine sandy loam to silt loam usda nrcs web soil survey 2020 weather data e g precipitation temperature reference evapotranspiration were recorded through an automated weather station operated by the washington agweathernet statewide system located within 1 km from the vineyard agweathernet at washington state university 2020 the commercial sd system was installed with the vineyard establishment in 2013 and all grapevines in the experimental site were drip irrigated before treatments were applied before the growing season started in 2015 another surface drip line was established in each experimental row as part of tested drz and sd systems and grapevines under drz had acclimated to the new irrigation strategy for almost a year before the treatment impacts on yield and wpc were evaluated the vertical distance between the surface drip line and the soil surface was 30 cm for the drz system a length of pvc tube schedule 40 20 mm inner diameter was inserted to the 60 cm of soil depth for water delivery with a 15 cm length above ground one compensating emitter ceta antelco longwood fl usa with a flow rate of 2 l per hour was secured inside each of the pvc tubes and was connected to the surface drip line through feeder line the compensating emitter for both the sd and drz was approximately 40 cm away from the trunk and each vine had two compensating emitters with a total flow rate of 4 l per hour more details on the design and installation of sd and drz systems were described in our previous studies ma et al 2019 2020b 2 2 experimental design a randomized complete block design with three blocks i e replications was implemented in this study to assess the drz compared to the commercial sd each block involved all treatments which were randomly assigned to experimental units i e grapevines the irrigation rate for sd from bud break to harvest 167 3 217 2 mm per year was set by the vineyard manager based on weather condition and long term guidelines to achieve production goals two irrigation rates of drz were applied as high rate drz h 120 4 176 9 mm per year approximately 70 80 of commercial rate and moderate rate drz m 90 3 122 3 mm per year approximately 50 60 of commercial rate the amount of water was reduced in subsurface irrigation treatments to account for the lower evaporation from the soil pisciotta et al 2018 each experimental plot included fifteen vines with five vines in each of three contiguous rows measurements were taken on vines in the central row of each plot with two buffer rows alongside to avoid the interference from neighboring treatments 2 3 irrigation scheduling in each year grapevines were irrigated between phenological stages of bud break and harvest with treatments applied from fruit set to harvest fertilizers were evenly distributed ahead of fruit set through surface drip lines avoiding an interaction effect between fertilization and irrigation treatment on grapevine performance which is out of scope and will be addressed through future studies within each year irrigation was initiated around bud break which lasted for 12 h to replenish the soil moisture after dormancy for ensuring adequate leaf flower bud and shoot development and the second irrigation event was set for 24 h around flowering stage to optimize fruit setting thereafter no more irrigation was performed until fruit set when the irrigation was resumed with 12 hour water delivery each time involving nighttime period irrigation frequency 3 10 days interval was regulated by the vineyard manager by considering the weather soil moisture status and long standing guidelines generally irrigation was resumed when soil water content reached under 10 mm per 1 m depth of soil measured at 20 cm of soil depth in commercial sd plots supplementary fig 1 irrigation amounts were controlled through battery powered controllers 11 000 l series galcon kfar blum israel and recorded by small mechanical water meters d l jerman co hackensack nj usa no more irrigation was applied after harvest until the bud break of the next growing season 2 4 phenology dates for phenological stages of grapevine were recorded based on biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt und chemische industrie bbch scale for bud break stage 09 flowering stage 65 fruit set stage 71 veraison stage 81 and harvest stage 89 lorenz et al 1995 harvest dates were chosen by technical staff of the commercial vineyards according to visual assessment of the fruit development and measurements on total soluble solids brix grapes were harvested when berries were plump easily crushed without shrinkage and the brix values remained the same between two consecutive measurements 3 4 days interval 2 5 grape yield and berry quality analyses at harvest vines were individually harvested by hand and weighed on site within each experimental plot 2 3 clusters of grapes from each of three central vines in the middle row were randomly selected and delivered immediately to a commercial laboratory ets laboratories walla walla wa usa for quality analyses titratable acidity and total soluble solids were determined on a fourier transformed mid infrared analyzer using an iso 17025 accredited technique ph was measured according to the aoac international oma 960 19 method aoac 2005 yeast assimilable nitrogen yan was quantified by independent analysis of ammonia nh3 and alpha amino compounds αan and the equation is yan 0 8225 nh3 αan potassium was measured using an inductivity coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes except yan and potassium which were measured in 2017 and 2018 all other parameters were analyzed in three consecutive years 2 6 root growth monitoring one of three central vines in the middle row of each treatment plot was chosen for in situ root imaging thus each treatment had three replications of vines for analysis of root number and root length density rld defined as the root length per unit of root image area transparent acrylic tubes 80 cm long 6 35 cm inner diameter were installed at a distance of 30 cm with an angle of 15 to the vine truck which allowed to observe the roots within 0 60 cm soil layers the exposed top 8 10 cm of the root tubes was covered with aluminum tape and sealed with rubber caps to avoid disturbance from light on root growth and to prevent light scattering and interference for imaging three root images were taken at a dpi dots per inch of 300 along the length of each tube using the ci 600 in situ root imager cid bio science camas wa usa operated by a tablet computer with ci 600 software installed https cid inc com support ci 600 software the size of each root image was 21 5 cm long and 19 6 cm wide with approximately 0 8 cm overlap of adjacent images to guarantee the scan of entire root area of interest root images were analyzed individually by using rootsnap image analysis software version 1 3 2 25 cid bio science camas wa usa which was installed on a computer with a multi touch lcd screen allowing tactile root tracing details in operation of the root imager and root image analysis were described by ma et al 2019 root images were taken at four phenological stages in 2017 and 2018 flowering fruit set veraison and harvest increases in total root number and rld within each year were calculated and compared for grapevines under different irrigation treatments 2 7 midday stem water potential measurement to evaluate the differences in grapevine water status under different irrigation treatments the pressure bomb method scholander et al 1965 was used to measure the midday stem water potential ψstem md at phenological stages of fruit set and harvest in 2017 and 2018 one fully expanded leaf on the east side of each of three vines in the middle row of each treatment plot was randomly selected and covered with a plastic bag inside an aluminum foil exterior envelope then allowed to equilibrate for an hour prior sampling a razor blade was used to sever the petiole of an encased leaf then quickly removed from the bag and inserted into a scholander pressure chamber 3000 series soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa each leaf sample was pressurized with nitrogen gas to the point of sap movement from the cut petiole the same time the reading was immediately recorded 2 8 crop water productivity grape yield and total water use amount irrigation plus precipitation from bud break to harvest in each year were used to quantify wpc fernández et al 2020 which was calculated as wpc grape yield per ha total water use amount in kg ha 1 mm 1 2 9 statistical analyses the two way analysis of variance anova was used to test treatment effects of irrigation on root growth yield berry quality and wpc over the three growing seasons at p value 0 05 followed by the tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test as a post hoc test for comparing differences between treatments when a significant treatment effect was detected since an interaction effect between irrigation and season on wpc was found those data were analyzed separately by year statistical analyses were conducted using the r 3 4 3 statistical software package www r project org 3 results 3 1 weather condition different weather patterns occurred among the years of the study as illustrated in fig 1 the driest year was 2018 with a total precipitation of 135 59 mm which was 28 and 30 lower than the total precipitation in 2016 187 67 mm and 2017 194 98 mm respectively likewise precipitation before bud break was 56 11 mm in 2018 which was 21 lower than in 2016 70 86 mm and was 47 lower than in 2017 106 38 mm precipitations from bud break to harvest were similar between 2016 35 81 mm and 2017 36 30 mm which were approximately 130 higher than in 2018 15 49 mm fig 2 precipitation between fruit set and harvest was extremely limited within each year with no precipitation occurred from fruit set to veraison in 2017 and 2018 the wettest and coldest year was 2017 the annual temperature of which 10 9 c was 1 4 c lower than in 2016 12 3 c and was 1 1 c lower than in 2018 12 0 c average daily temperature before bud break in 2017 was 3 4 c lower than in 2016 and was 2 7 c lower than in 2018 however average daily temperature near the bud break 10 days prior to bud break was all above 10 c in each year the highest annual reference evapotranspiration for grass eto was found in 2018 1093 mm which was 28 mm higher than in 2016 and was 83 mm higher than in 2017 accumulated eto from bud break to harvest were similar between years less than 1 5 difference 3 2 phenology day of the year doy for each phenological stage were averaged across all treatments in order to map the development of chardonnay grapevines and compare the differences in occurrence of same phenological stages between years fig 1 in general delays of doy for phenological stages from bud break to harvest were recorded in 2017 7 20 days later compared to other two years which were similar with each other 1 5 days in differences bud break was 12 days and 7 days later in 2017 than in 2016 and in 2018 respectively also doy for harvest was later in 2017 doy 280 than in 2016 doy 260 and in 2018 doy 263 the number of days from bud break to harvest was longer in 2017 169 days than in 2016 161 days and in 2018 159 days 3 3 yield and berry quality compared to the sd the mean value of yields for grapevines irrigated through drz was 3 3 higher at high irrigation rate and was 6 1 lower at moderate irrigation rate across three growing seasons of the study although the differences in yields between irrigation treatments were not significant table 1 statistically significant differences in yield were found between growing seasons as the yield continued to increase significantly in three consecutive years no interaction effect on yield was found between irrigation treatment and growing season effects of irrigation treatment on grape quality were found across the growing seasons and the results are also shown in table 1 no significant differences in impact of irrigation treatment were found on titratable acidity and ph as the values were only slightly changed for grapevines irrigated through drz compared with sd irrigation treatment strongly influenced the concentration of total soluble solids in grapes as 1 8 higher brix was found in berries irrigated through drz at moderate rates than ones irrigated through sd although the increase in brix was found between two irrigation rates within drz the change was not statistically significant yan was higher under drz and significantly increased yan was found at moderate rate which was 24 4 higher than sd changes in potassium concentration were not significant between different irrigation treatments differences in quality parameters between growing seasons were also detected lower titratable acidity was found in 2018 which was 11 1 and 8 3 lower than in 2016 and 2017 respectively significantly reduced yan and potassium concentration were found in 2018 which were 21 0 and 19 1 lower than in 2017 respectively however no significant differences in ph and total soluble solids were detected between years no significant interaction effect between irrigation and growing season was found on any of the quality parameters 3 4 root growth root growth was significantly affected by irrigation treatments with significant differences in total root number and rld found at different phenological stages fig 3 generally rapid increases in both parameters occurred between fruit set and veraison sd yielded the highest total root number within 0 60 cm soil profile which was 10 2 48 7 and 75 7 86 2 higher than drz h and drz m respectively at harvest stage across two years fig 3a b likewise 28 4 77 4 and 73 4 112 5 increased rld were found on grapevines irrigated under sd compared to drz h and drz m respectively although the statistically significant differences were only found in 2017 fig 3c d irrigation treatments altered patterns of root distribution within 0 60 cm soil depth across two years of the study figs 4 and 5 generally roots were mainly distributed at 20 40 cm soil depth under sd as 46 2 59 8 of observed root number and 51 5 68 0 of rld were found within it however more roots were distributed at 40 60 cm soil layer under drz as increased root number and rld were observed with increased soil depth at harvest in 2017 and at all phenological stages in 2018 compared to sd grapevines irrigated through drz with high irrigation rate had 44 8 62 4 decreased root number and 48 3 66 1 decreased rld at 20 40 cm soil depth after treatments were applied and the significant reductions were found from harvest in 2017 to fruit set in 2018 fig 4d f and fig 5d f regarding the drz with moderate irrigation rate significantly reduced root number 68 7 78 5 was found since harvest in 2017 and significantly reduced rld 66 9 81 8 was observed between harvest 2017 and fruit set in 2018 compared to sd fig 4d f and fig 5d h no significant differences were found between sd and drz within 0 20 cm and 40 60 cm soil depths and between two irrigation rates under drz within each of three soil depths 3 5 midday stem water potential deficit irrigation applied through drz significantly reduced ψstem md in grapevines compared to the sd with commercial rate fig 6 no significant difference in ψstem md was found in grapevines before irrigation treatments were implemented fig 6a c at harvest drz with moderate irrigation rate resulted in significant decreases in ψstem md by 14 3 and 10 3 respectively in 2017 and 2018 compared to the sd treatment fig 6b d no significant differences in ψstem md were found between sd and drz with high irrigation rate and between high and moderate irrigation rates applied through drz at harvest in both years fig 6b d 3 6 crop water productivity drz with reduced irrigation amount enhanced wpc by 22 7 83 6 compared to sd with commercial irrigation within each year of the study fig 7 additionally significant increases in wpc were found in grapevines irrigated through drz with around 126 mm of water applied between bud break and harvest irrigation plus precipitation in the wet year of 2017 and the dry year of 2018 application of drz with high irrigation rate from bud break to harvest in 2016 and 2017 did not significantly increase wpc compared to sd however it significantly improved wpc by 34 0 in 2018 fig 7c 4 discussion enhancing crop water productivity wpc through regulated deficit irrigation is efficient for sustaining grape cultivation in regions with periods of heat and drought stresses ma et al 2020b nikolaou et al 2020 under current climate change scenarios direct root zone irrigation drz has showed its potential in highly permeable soils i e sandy soil for optimizing the use of water through reduced soil evaporation restricting the water available for weed growth and delivering the water directly to the rootzone of grapevine for timely uptake ma et al 2019 this study expanded drz application to chardonnay grapevines cultivated in a silt loam soil and found improvements in wpc with enhanced berry quality and minor negative effects on yield suggesting that the adoption of drz strategy with appropriate irrigation regimes would be also applicable on white wine grapes cultivated in moderately permeable soils the variable weather conditions between years influenced grapevine phenology bud break is highly sensitive to temperature and the onset of bud break is determined by the length of dormancy which is mediated by low temperature moncur et al 1989 thus the decreased temperature early in 2017 delayed bud break lower annual temperature might explain the delayed phenology and a longer period of active growth from bud break to harvest in 2017 according to studies of climate change on grapevine phenology costa et al 2019 tomasi et al 2011 with the lowest total irrigation amount applied compared to two other years previous studies on grape and other perennial crops reported the improvement of wpc through subsurface drip irrigation compared to surface drip irrigation sd martínez gimeno et al 2018 mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 paris et al 2018 pisciotta et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 which are consistent with our findings on chardonnay grapevine in this study wpc was increased by 23 34 and irrigation amount was reduced by 16 23 without yield loss for grapevines irrigated through drz under variable weather conditions indicating the efficacy of the drz system on optimization of wpc meanwhile measurements of midday stem water potential showed different levels of water stress in grapevines determined by irrigation treatment suggesting that mild to moderate water stress induced by drz deficit irrigation could sustain yield i e no significant reduction thus enhancing the wpc of chardonnay grapes which is in agreement with previous studies of deficit irrigation on grape production acevedo opazo et al 2010 chaves et al 2007 therefore finely tuning the irrigation regime would help maximize the benefits of drz a factor that partially accounts for the increase in overall productivity in yield during the period of study is attributed to the accelerating rate of growth and maturity of vines the vines were planted in 2013 as own rooted cuttings and were only beginning their second season when the study was initiated by 2018 the vines were achieving a level of production anticipated for a commercially viable planting besides the carry over effects of the deficit irrigation in previous years may also contribute to the treatment effects on yield in the current year ruiz sanchez et al 2010 irrigation influences plant rooting patterns which could be used as an efficient means to regulate root growth sharma et al 2018 in this study decreased root number and rld were found under drz which might be caused by decreased water availability in 0 60 cm soil profile thus restricted root distribution slightly increased yield was detected in grapevines irrigated through drz at high rate indicating that reduced root growth in top soil does not negatively influence grape production and that the drz with appropriate irrigation rate might encourage roots growing into deeper soil layers for water uptake which was also indicated by non significant difference in midday stem water potential of grapevines between sd and drz at high rate although the responses of roots to drz indicate the differences in soil water distribution one caveat is that the current results restrict our observation on roots within 0 60 cm soils and direct comparisons of soil water content between irrigation treatments are limited future studies will explore the rooting pattern of chardonnay below the 60 cm soil depth and will better clarify the relationship between root growth pattern and soil water distribution in response to drz the carry over effects of irrigation on root growth were found as roots appeared near the harvest stage in 2017 may still exist within the observational area at the beginning of growing season in 2018 thus significant differences in total root number and rld were detected before treatments were applied i e at flowering stage in 2018 with increases in root number across all treatments variations in root length between vines became more noticeable which to some extent diminished the statistical differences in rld between treatments in 2018 root growth pattern is dynamic as grapevines may develop deeper roots for water uptake with age i e from small cuttings to mature vines and with a prolonged period of drought in addition grapevine rooting depth shows a seasonal pattern with functional roots growing into deeper soil for water uptake as the growing season advances karakis et al 2018 therefore timely adjusting the delivery depth of water to the position where the most roots are distributed might be an efficient way to enhance the wpc however modifying the water delivery depth is time and labor consuming for conventional sdi system once the buried drip lines are installed especially in orchards in this scenario drz provides an easier way to modify the water delivery depth and position by adjusting the vertical irrigation tubes non destructive evaluation on root growth by minirhizotron technique allows for periodic root observation throughout the growing seasons it has proven to be an efficient method to calculate root production and estimate root dynamics majdi 1996 however only a portion of root zone could be observed in situ through a root imager inserted into a single transparent tube meanwhile the soil will be recolonized after the installation of minirhizotron tubes and the roots need to take a while to attain equilibrium moreover it is time consuming to periodically capture the root images with adequate resolution and manually analyze them with expertise thus development of the minirhizotron technique needs to focus on minimizing artifactual effects on root population and optimizing the image processing method generally a moderate water stress induced by deficit irrigation is more favorable for soluble sugar accumulation in berries with reduced berry weight and minor yield loss mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 which are consistent with our study titratable acidity and ph in berries strongly influence juice stability which might be regulated by irrigation mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 however impact levels of deficit irrigation on titratable acidity and ph reported by previous studies are not always consistent as deficit irrigation either showed no significant influence acevedo opazo et al 2010 or reduced titratable acidity combined with increased ph in berries within certain thresholds of water stress and periods of time ma et al 2019 romero et al 2010 in our study lower concentrations of titratable acidity and slightly increased ph values were found under drz with reduced irrigation rate however changes were not statistically significant indicating that decreased water availability only to a certain level could reduce the berry acidity which helps adjust the flavor of tartness yeast assimilable nitrogen yan consists of ammonium ions and free alpha amino acid which are key nutrient sources for yeast and influence the efficiency of fermentation hannam et al 2013 low yan concentration would result in wines with inferior aroma and flavor thus improving the accumulation of yan in berries will help enhance the wine quality walker et al 2022 the effects of irrigation on yan are not always consistent as previous studies reported in our study increased yan concentration was found with reduced irrigation rate which is in agreement with holzapfel et al 2015 and hannam et al 2013 however walker et al 2022 reported that increased irrigation rate had no significant impact on yan and keller 2005 reported that reduced irrigation amount might reduce the yan in berries the differences in variation of yan were not only due to the different water amounts applied by each study which significantly determined the level of water stress that grapevines experienced but was also resulted by different nitrogen management strategies which was another major factor influencing the yan accumulation in berries thus deficit irrigation applied through drz could be used as an efficient strategy to increase the yan concentration however it needs to be finely tuned by considering the appropriate amounts of water and nutrient input moreover significant influences of variable seasons on berries quality parameters indicate that other factors such as cultivar grapevine age soil trait and weather condition concurrently influence the grape quality mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 those aspects need to be considered when applying deficit irrigation as a useful tool to adjust the berry composition for achieving the desired flavor of final wine as an initial step to investigate the performance of drz in moderately permeable soil types and its influences on production of white wine grape cultivars in semi arid regions with variable weather patterns this study designated reduced irrigation rates to drz and compared them to the sd since the benefits of drz on chardonnay grape production and wpc in a silt loam soil have been revealed compared to the commercial sd regime more physiological aspects of chardonnay and other white wine grape cultivars response to drz as well as a comprehensive cost benefit analysis for drz compared to conventional sdi systems are worth further study for better elucidating the advantages of drz applied in different soil types and under unstable climatic scenarios 5 conclusion compared with surface drip irrigation sd direct root zone irrigation drz could improve crop water productivity of chardonnay grapevine by 23 34 and reduce the irrigation amount by 16 23 with enhanced berry quality and no negative effects on yield across varied weather conditions meanwhile reduced root growth was detected in 0 60 cm soil layers under drz and significantly decreased root number and root length density were observed in 20 40 cm soil depth indicating that drz could be used as an efficient means to regulate root distribution pattern of chardonnay in conclusion this novel subsurface irrigation technique could also be applied for vineyards of white wine grapes on moderately permeable soils in semi arid climates detailed physiological responses of different cultivars to drz especially for the relationship between rooting patterns and water distribution in soils as well as a comprehensive cost benefit analysis for drz compared to conventional subsurface drip irrigation systems are worth further study to better elucidate the advantages of drz applied under dynamic environments credit authorship contribution statement xm and pj

under variable weather conditions indicating the efficacy of the drz as a novel subsurface irrigation strategy concurrently drz restricted root distribution within 0 60 cm soil layers and significantly reduced root number and root length density were observed in 20 40 cm soil depth moreover grapevines under moderate water stress induced by drz accumulated more soluble sugar 8 8 increase in brix on average and yeast assimilable nitrogen 24 4 increase on average in berries we conclude that proper deficit irrigation applied through drz would be applicable to optimize the water use for production and efficiently alter the root distribution pattern of chardonnay grapevine cultivated in moderately permeable soils with improved berry quality keywords subsurface drip irrigation root growth yield fruit quality white wine grape data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction grapevine vitis spp is a valuable horticultural crop worldwide with a large portion of grapes produced for making wine grapevines are deciduous woody perennial plants which are usually propagated through dormant cuttings based on the purpose of cultivation and the color of skins when ripe wine grapes could be categorized as red e g cabernet sauvignon merlot and white e g chardonnay riesling wine grape cultivars in semi arid regions limited precipitation barely satisfies the demand for grapevine growth during the active growing season requiring supplemental irrigation for achieving satisfactory grape yield and berry quality medrano et al 2015 however water scarcity presents a challenge for vineyard productivity in some regions and is becoming a critical issue under mounting concerns about a warming climate and competing demands for water resources mirás avalos and araujo 2021 thus adopting efficient irrigation techniques is essential to improve water use efficiency wue for sustaining grape production in many dry winegrowing regions worldwide fraga et al 2018 malek et al 2018 deficit irrigation by inducing adequate water stress on grapevines through reduced amount of irrigation water has been widely demonstrated as an effective water management strategy in vineyards for saving water controlling excessive vegetative growth and improving wue for yield without sacrificing berry quality ayars et al 2017 buesa et al 2017 lópez et al 2007 ma et al 2019 stout et al 2017 williams 2014 deficit irrigation can be applied through both surface and subsurface irrigation techniques traditional surface irrigation techniques may involve lower infrastructural costs and easier access to maintain the systems however water applied to the soil surface contributes to evaporation which reduces wue for yield a critical issue especially in arid regions li and zhang 2017 compared to surface irrigation subsurface drip irrigation sdi has gained wider acceptance for some woody perennial crops e g almond french prune walnut in recent decades due to improved irrigation tools and its benefits in water conservation and weed control ayars et al 2015 however disadvantages associated with conventional sdi systems need to be overcome to optimize their benefits for example buried drip lines are difficult to monitor adjust or repair once installed moreover localized sdi may result in smaller wetting patterns with enhanced water infiltration which might negatively impact aboveground growth of woody perennial crops due to restricted root zone for water and nutrient uptake to address the issues mentioned above direct root zone irrigation drz has been recently introduced as a novel subsurface irrigation system and was initially tested in commercial vineyards of cabernet sauvignon vitis vinifera l one of the most popular red wine grape cultivars in loamy sand soil under a semi arid climate jacoby and ma 2018 with benefits as a sdi system e g reduce surface water evaporation suppress weed growth drz could also flexibly adjust installation position water delivery depth and irrigation rate for maximizing crop water productivity wpc yield per unit area per unit of water applied and potentially reducing soil water evaporation and infiltration ma et al 2019 compared to the surface drip irrigation sd drz improved grape yield by 9 12 without sacrificing berry quality while helping relieve water stress in grapevines during the harsh summer ma et al 2020a to enhance the benefits of drz and provide more empirical evidence for expanding its application studies are needed to evaluate the drz efficiency on water utilization growth and production of other grape cultivars e g white wine grapes under different environmental scenarios e g weather pattern soil type chardonnay vitis vinifera l is a green skinned grape cultivar used for producing white wine it has been the top produced white cultivar in washington state in recent years and one of the most popular white cultivars around the world washington state wine commission usa 2020 chardonnay production in southcentral washington relies on supplemental irrigation due to the semi arid climate with extremely limited precipitation in summer influences of water stress induced by deficit irrigation on red and white wine grape cultivars can be different for instance reduced canopy under moderate water deficit allows more exposure of berries to sunlight which helps red wine grapes achieve the favored color and taste but it may adversely create more color and character for white wine grapes than desired university of california drought management usa 2020 moreover deficit irrigation could enhance accumulation of anthocyanins in red grapevine but increase flavonol concentration only in white grapevine e g chardonnay chaves et al 2010 deluc et al 2009 thus specific studies on white wine grapes would help better evaluate the efficacy of drz and boost its benefits for water resource management this study aimed to investigate the influences of drz with reduced irrigation rate on root growth yield berry quality and wpc in a commercial vineyard of chardonnay in a silt loam soil compared to the commercial sd which has been applied for decades in this area we hypothesized that chardonnay grapevines irrigated through drz have 1 fewer roots distributed in the shallow soil profile with minor effects on grape yield and 2 improved grape quality and wpc 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and irrigation system the field trial was conducted from 2016 to 2018 in a commercial vineyard of two year old own rooted chardonnay near prosser wa 46 15 26 n 119 44 55 w the orientation of vineyard rows was north to south with a spacing of 2 7 m between rows and 1 8 m between vines three wire trellis was used to support grapevine growth with vertical distances of 100 cm 140 cm and 180 cm between soil surface and each wire soil on the experimental site was classified as warden silt loam 0 48 cm silt loam 48 152 cm stratified very fine sandy loam to silt loam usda nrcs web soil survey 2020 weather data e g precipitation temperature reference evapotranspiration were recorded through an automated weather station operated by the washington agweathernet statewide system located within 1 km from the vineyard agweathernet at washington state university 2020 the commercial sd system was installed with the vineyard establishment in 2013 and all grapevines in the experimental site were drip irrigated before treatments were applied before the growing season started in 2015 another surface drip line was established in each experimental row as part of tested drz and sd systems and grapevines under drz had acclimated to the new irrigation strategy for almost a year before the treatment impacts on yield and wpc were evaluated the vertical distance between the surface drip line and the soil surface was 30 cm for the drz system a length of pvc tube schedule 40 20 mm inner diameter was inserted to the 60 cm of soil depth for water delivery with a 15 cm length above ground one compensating emitter ceta antelco longwood fl usa with a flow rate of 2 l per hour was secured inside each of the pvc tubes and was connected to the surface drip line through feeder line the compensating emitter for both the sd and drz was approximately 40 cm away from the trunk and each vine had two compensating emitters with a total flow rate of 4 l per hour more details on the design and installation of sd and drz systems were described in our previous studies ma et al 2019 2020b 2 2 experimental design a randomized complete block design with three blocks i e replications was implemented in this study to assess the drz compared to the commercial sd each block involved all treatments which were randomly assigned to experimental units i e grapevines the irrigation rate for sd from bud break to harvest 167 3 217 2 mm per year was set by the vineyard manager based on weather condition and long term guidelines to achieve production goals two irrigation rates of drz were applied as high rate drz h 120 4 176 9 mm per year approximately 70 80 of commercial rate and moderate rate drz m 90 3 122 3 mm per year approximately 50 60 of commercial rate the amount of water was reduced in subsurface irrigation treatments to account for the lower evaporation from the soil pisciotta et al 2018 each experimental plot included fifteen vines with five vines in each of three contiguous rows measurements were taken on vines in the central row of each plot with two buffer rows alongside to avoid the interference from neighboring treatments 2 3 irrigation scheduling in each year grapevines were irrigated between phenological stages of bud break and harvest with treatments applied from fruit set to harvest fertilizers were evenly distributed ahead of fruit set through surface drip lines avoiding an interaction effect between fertilization and irrigation treatment on grapevine performance which is out of scope and will be addressed through future studies within each year irrigation was initiated around bud break which lasted for 12 h to replenish the soil moisture after dormancy for ensuring adequate leaf flower bud and shoot development and the second irrigation event was set for 24 h around flowering stage to optimize fruit setting thereafter no more irrigation was performed until fruit set when the irrigation was resumed with 12 hour water delivery each time involving nighttime period irrigation frequency 3 10 days interval was regulated by the vineyard manager by considering the weather soil moisture status and long standing guidelines generally irrigation was resumed when soil water content reached under 10 mm per 1 m depth of soil measured at 20 cm of soil depth in commercial sd plots supplementary fig 1 irrigation amounts were controlled through battery powered controllers 11 000 l series galcon kfar blum israel and recorded by small mechanical water meters d l jerman co hackensack nj usa no more irrigation was applied after harvest until the bud break of the next growing season 2 4 phenology dates for phenological stages of grapevine were recorded based on biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt und chemische industrie bbch scale for bud break stage 09 flowering stage 65 fruit set stage 71 veraison stage 81 and harvest stage 89 lorenz et al 1995 harvest dates were chosen by technical staff of the commercial vineyards according to visual assessment of the fruit development and measurements on total soluble solids brix grapes were harvested when berries were plump easily crushed without shrinkage and the brix values remained the same between two consecutive measurements 3 4 days interval 2 5 grape yield and berry quality analyses at harvest vines were individually harvested by hand and weighed on site within each experimental plot 2 3 clusters of grapes from each of three central vines in the middle row were randomly selected and delivered immediately to a commercial laboratory ets laboratories walla walla wa usa for quality analyses titratable acidity and total soluble solids were determined on a fourier transformed mid infrared analyzer using an iso 17025 accredited technique ph was measured according to the aoac international oma 960 19 method aoac 2005 yeast assimilable nitrogen yan was quantified by independent analysis of ammonia nh3 and alpha amino compounds αan and the equation is yan 0 8225 nh3 αan potassium was measured using an inductivity coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes except yan and potassium which were measured in 2017 and 2018 all other parameters were analyzed in three consecutive years 2 6 root growth monitoring one of three central vines in the middle row of each treatment plot was chosen for in situ root imaging thus each treatment had three replications of vines for analysis of root number and root length density rld defined as the root length per unit of root image area transparent acrylic tubes 80 cm long 6 35 cm inner diameter were installed at a distance of 30 cm with an angle of 15 to the vine truck which allowed to observe the roots within 0 60 cm soil layers the exposed top 8 10 cm of the root tubes was covered with aluminum tape and sealed with rubber caps to avoid disturbance from light on root growth and to prevent light scattering and interference for imaging three root images were taken at a dpi dots per inch of 300 along the length of each tube using the ci 600 in situ root imager cid bio science camas wa usa operated by a tablet computer with ci 600 software installed https cid inc com support ci 600 software the size of each root image was 21 5 cm long and 19 6 cm wide with approximately 0 8 cm overlap of adjacent images to guarantee the scan of entire root area of interest root images were analyzed individually by using rootsnap image analysis software version 1 3 2 25 cid bio science camas wa usa which was installed on a computer with a multi touch lcd screen allowing tactile root tracing details in operation of the root imager and root image analysis were described by ma et al 2019 root images were taken at four phenological stages in 2017 and 2018 flowering fruit set veraison and harvest increases in total root number and rld within each year were calculated and compared for grapevines under different irrigation treatments 2 7 midday stem water potential measurement to evaluate the differences in grapevine water status under different irrigation treatments the pressure bomb method scholander et al 1965 was used to measure the midday stem water potential ψstem md at phenological stages of fruit set and harvest in 2017 and 2018 one fully expanded leaf on the east side of each of three vines in the middle row of each treatment plot was randomly selected and covered with a plastic bag inside an aluminum foil exterior envelope then allowed to equilibrate for an hour prior sampling a razor blade was used to sever the petiole of an encased leaf then quickly removed from the bag and inserted into a scholander pressure chamber 3000 series soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa each leaf sample was pressurized with nitrogen gas to the point of sap movement from the cut petiole the same time the reading was immediately recorded 2 8 crop water productivity grape yield and total water use amount irrigation plus precipitation from bud break to harvest in each year were used to quantify wpc fernández et al 2020 which was calculated as wpc grape yield per ha total water use amount in kg ha 1 mm 1 2 9 statistical analyses the two way analysis of variance anova was used to test treatment effects of irrigation on root growth yield berry quality and wpc over the three growing seasons at p value 0 05 followed by the tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test as a post hoc test for comparing differences between treatments when a significant treatment effect was detected since an interaction effect between irrigation and season on wpc was found those data were analyzed separately by year statistical analyses were conducted using the r 3 4 3 statistical software package www r project org 3 results 3 1 weather condition different weather patterns occurred among the years of the study as illustrated in fig 1 the driest year was 2018 with a total precipitation of 135 59 mm which was 28 and 30 lower than the total precipitation in 2016 187 67 mm and 2017 194 98 mm respectively likewise precipitation before bud break was 56 11 mm in 2018 which was 21 lower than in 2016 70 86 mm and was 47 lower than in 2017 106 38 mm precipitations from bud break to harvest were similar between 2016 35 81 mm and 2017 36 30 mm which were approximately 130 higher than in 2018 15 49 mm fig 2 precipitation between fruit set and harvest was extremely limited within each year with no precipitation occurred from fruit set to veraison in 2017 and 2018 the wettest and coldest year was 2017 the annual temperature of which 10 9 c was 1 4 c lower than in 2016 12 3 c and was 1 1 c lower than in 2018 12 0 c average daily temperature before bud break in 2017 was 3 4 c lower than in 2016 and was 2 7 c lower than in 2018 however average daily temperature near the bud break 10 days prior to bud break was all above 10 c in each year the highest annual reference evapotranspiration for grass eto was found in 2018 1093 mm which was 28 mm higher than in 2016 and was 83 mm higher than in 2017 accumulated eto from bud break to harvest were similar between years less than 1 5 difference 3 2 phenology day of the year doy for each phenological stage were averaged across all treatments in order to map the development of chardonnay grapevines and compare the differences in occurrence of same phenological stages between years fig 1 in general delays of doy for phenological stages from bud break to harvest were recorded in 2017 7 20 days later compared to other two years which were similar with each other 1 5 days in differences bud break was 12 days and 7 days later in 2017 than in 2016 and in 2018 respectively also doy for harvest was later in 2017 doy 280 than in 2016 doy 260 and in 2018 doy 263 the number of days from bud break to harvest was longer in 2017 169 days than in 2016 161 days and in 2018 159 days 3 3 yield and berry quality compared to the sd the mean value of yields for grapevines irrigated through drz was 3 3 higher at high irrigation rate and was 6 1 lower at moderate irrigation rate across three growing seasons of the study although the differences in yields between irrigation treatments were not significant table 1 statistically significant differences in yield were found between growing seasons as the yield continued to increase significantly in three consecutive years no interaction effect on yield was found between irrigation treatment and growing season effects of irrigation treatment on grape quality were found across the growing seasons and the results are also shown in table 1 no significant differences in impact of irrigation treatment were found on titratable acidity and ph as the values were only slightly changed for grapevines irrigated through drz compared with sd irrigation treatment strongly influenced the concentration of total soluble solids in grapes as 1 8 higher brix was found in berries irrigated through drz at moderate rates than ones irrigated through sd although the increase in brix was found between two irrigation rates within drz the change was not statistically significant yan was higher under drz and significantly increased yan was found at moderate rate which was 24 4 higher than sd changes in potassium concentration were not significant between different irrigation treatments differences in quality parameters between growing seasons were also detected lower titratable acidity was found in 2018 which was 11 1 and 8 3 lower than in 2016 and 2017 respectively significantly reduced yan and potassium concentration were found in 2018 which were 21 0 and 19 1 lower than in 2017 respectively however no significant differences in ph and total soluble solids were detected between years no significant interaction effect between irrigation and growing season was found on any of the quality parameters 3 4 root growth root growth was significantly affected by irrigation treatments with significant differences in total root number and rld found at different phenological stages fig 3 generally rapid increases in both parameters occurred between fruit set and veraison sd yielded the highest total root number within 0 60 cm soil profile which was 10 2 48 7 and 75 7 86 2 higher than drz h and drz m respectively at harvest stage across two years fig 3a b likewise 28 4 77 4 and 73 4 112 5 increased rld were found on grapevines irrigated under sd compared to drz h and drz m respectively although the statistically significant differences were only found in 2017 fig 3c d irrigation treatments altered patterns of root distribution within 0 60 cm soil depth across two years of the study figs 4 and 5 generally roots were mainly distributed at 20 40 cm soil depth under sd as 46 2 59 8 of observed root number and 51 5 68 0 of rld were found within it however more roots were distributed at 40 60 cm soil layer under drz as increased root number and rld were observed with increased soil depth at harvest in 2017 and at all phenological stages in 2018 compared to sd grapevines irrigated through drz with high irrigation rate had 44 8 62 4 decreased root number and 48 3 66 1 decreased rld at 20 40 cm soil depth after treatments were applied and the significant reductions were found from harvest in 2017 to fruit set in 2018 fig 4d f and fig 5d f regarding the drz with moderate irrigation rate significantly reduced root number 68 7 78 5 was found since harvest in 2017 and significantly reduced rld 66 9 81 8 was observed between harvest 2017 and fruit set in 2018 compared to sd fig 4d f and fig 5d h no significant differences were found between sd and drz within 0 20 cm and 40 60 cm soil depths and between two irrigation rates under drz within each of three soil depths 3 5 midday stem water potential deficit irrigation applied through drz significantly reduced ψstem md in grapevines compared to the sd with commercial rate fig 6 no significant difference in ψstem md was found in grapevines before irrigation treatments were implemented fig 6a c at harvest drz with moderate irrigation rate resulted in significant decreases in ψstem md by 14 3 and 10 3 respectively in 2017 and 2018 compared to the sd treatment fig 6b d no significant differences in ψstem md were found between sd and drz with high irrigation rate and between high and moderate irrigation rates applied through drz at harvest in both years fig 6b d 3 6 crop water productivity drz with reduced irrigation amount enhanced wpc by 22 7 83 6 compared to sd with commercial irrigation within each year of the study fig 7 additionally significant increases in wpc were found in grapevines irrigated through drz with around 126 mm of water applied between bud break and harvest irrigation plus precipitation in the wet year of 2017 and the dry year of 2018 application of drz with high irrigation rate from bud break to harvest in 2016 and 2017 did not significantly increase wpc compared to sd however it significantly improved wpc by 34 0 in 2018 fig 7c 4 discussion enhancing crop water productivity wpc through regulated deficit irrigation is efficient for sustaining grape cultivation in regions with periods of heat and drought stresses ma et al 2020b nikolaou et al 2020 under current climate change scenarios direct root zone irrigation drz has showed its potential in highly permeable soils i e sandy soil for optimizing the use of water through reduced soil evaporation restricting the water available for weed growth and delivering the water directly to the rootzone of grapevine for timely uptake ma et al 2019 this study expanded drz application to chardonnay grapevines cultivated in a silt loam soil and found improvements in wpc with enhanced berry quality and minor negative effects on yield suggesting that the adoption of drz strategy with appropriate irrigation regimes would be also applicable on white wine grapes cultivated in moderately permeable soils the variable weather conditions between years influenced grapevine phenology bud break is highly sensitive to temperature and the onset of bud break is determined by the length of dormancy which is mediated by low temperature moncur et al 1989 thus the decreased temperature early in 2017 delayed bud break lower annual temperature might explain the delayed phenology and a longer period of active growth from bud break to harvest in 2017 according to studies of climate change on grapevine phenology costa et al 2019 tomasi et al 2011 with the lowest total irrigation amount applied compared to two other years previous studies on grape and other perennial crops reported the improvement of wpc through subsurface drip irrigation compared to surface drip irrigation sd martínez gimeno et al 2018 mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 paris et al 2018 pisciotta et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 which are consistent with our findings on chardonnay grapevine in this study wpc was increased by 23 34 and irrigation amount was reduced by 16 23 without yield loss for grapevines irrigated through drz under variable weather conditions indicating the efficacy of the drz system on optimization of wpc meanwhile measurements of midday stem water potential showed different levels of water stress in grapevines determined by irrigation treatment suggesting that mild to moderate water stress induced by drz deficit irrigation could sustain yield i e no significant reduction thus enhancing the wpc of chardonnay grapes which is in agreement with previous studies of deficit irrigation on grape production acevedo opazo et al 2010 chaves et al 2007 therefore finely tuning the irrigation regime would help maximize the benefits of drz a factor that partially accounts for the increase in overall productivity in yield during the period of study is attributed to the accelerating rate of growth and maturity of vines the vines were planted in 2013 as own rooted cuttings and were only beginning their second season when the study was initiated by 2018 the vines were achieving a level of production anticipated for a commercially viable planting besides the carry over effects of the deficit irrigation in previous years may also contribute to the treatment effects on yield in the current year ruiz sanchez et al 2010 irrigation influences plant rooting patterns which could be used as an efficient means to regulate root growth sharma et al 2018 in this study decreased root number and rld were found under drz which might be caused by decreased water availability in 0 60 cm soil profile thus restricted root distribution slightly increased yield was detected in grapevines irrigated through drz at high rate indicating that reduced root growth in top soil does not negatively influence grape production and that the drz with appropriate irrigation rate might encourage roots growing into deeper soil layers for water uptake which was also indicated by non significant difference in midday stem water potential of grapevines between sd and drz at high rate although the responses of roots to drz indicate the differences in soil water distribution one caveat is that the current results restrict our observation on roots within 0 60 cm soils and direct comparisons of soil water content between irrigation treatments are limited future studies will explore the rooting pattern of chardonnay below the 60 cm soil depth and will better clarify the relationship between root growth pattern and soil water distribution in response to drz the carry over effects of irrigation on root growth were found as roots appeared near the harvest stage in 2017 may still exist within the observational area at the beginning of growing season in 2018 thus significant differences in total root number and rld were detected before treatments were applied i e at flowering stage in 2018 with increases in root number across all treatments variations in root length between vines became more noticeable which to some extent diminished the statistical differences in rld between treatments in 2018 root growth pattern is dynamic as grapevines may develop deeper roots for water uptake with age i e from small cuttings to mature vines and with a prolonged period of drought in addition grapevine rooting depth shows a seasonal pattern with functional roots growing into deeper soil for water uptake as the growing season advances karakis et al 2018 therefore timely adjusting the delivery depth of water to the position where the most roots are distributed might be an efficient way to enhance the wpc however modifying the water delivery depth is time and labor consuming for conventional sdi system once the buried drip lines are installed especially in orchards in this scenario drz provides an easier way to modify the water delivery depth and position by adjusting the vertical irrigation tubes non destructive evaluation on root growth by minirhizotron technique allows for periodic root observation throughout the growing seasons it has proven to be an efficient method to calculate root production and estimate root dynamics majdi 1996 however only a portion of root zone could be observed in situ through a root imager inserted into a single transparent tube meanwhile the soil will be recolonized after the installation of minirhizotron tubes and the roots need to take a while to attain equilibrium moreover it is time consuming to periodically capture the root images with adequate resolution and manually analyze them with expertise thus development of the minirhizotron technique needs to focus on minimizing artifactual effects on root population and optimizing the image processing method generally a moderate water stress induced by deficit irrigation is more favorable for soluble sugar accumulation in berries with reduced berry weight and minor yield loss mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 which are consistent with our study titratable acidity and ph in berries strongly influence juice stability which might be regulated by irrigation mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 however impact levels of deficit irrigation on titratable acidity and ph reported by previous studies are not always consistent as deficit irrigation either showed no significant influence acevedo opazo et al 2010 or reduced titratable acidity combined with increased ph in berries within certain thresholds of water stress and periods of time ma et al 2019 romero et al 2010 in our study lower concentrations of titratable acidity and slightly increased ph values were found under drz with reduced irrigation rate however changes were not statistically significant indicating that decreased water availability only to a certain level could reduce the berry acidity which helps adjust the flavor of tartness yeast assimilable nitrogen yan consists of ammonium ions and free alpha amino acid which are key nutrient sources for yeast and influence the efficiency of fermentation hannam et al 2013 low yan concentration would result in wines with inferior aroma and flavor thus improving the accumulation of yan in berries will help enhance the wine quality walker et al 2022 the effects of irrigation on yan are not always consistent as previous studies reported in our study increased yan concentration was found with reduced irrigation rate which is in agreement with holzapfel et al 2015 and hannam et al 2013 however walker et al 2022 reported that increased irrigation rate had no significant impact on yan and keller 2005 reported that reduced irrigation amount might reduce the yan in berries the differences in variation of yan were not only due to the different water amounts applied by each study which significantly determined the level of water stress that grapevines experienced but was also resulted by different nitrogen management strategies which was another major factor influencing the yan accumulation in berries thus deficit irrigation applied through drz could be used as an efficient strategy to increase the yan concentration however it needs to be finely tuned by considering the appropriate amounts of water and nutrient input moreover significant influences of variable seasons on berries quality parameters indicate that other factors such as cultivar grapevine age soil trait and weather condition concurrently influence the grape quality mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 those aspects need to be considered when applying deficit irrigation as a useful tool to adjust the berry composition for achieving the desired flavor of final wine as an initial step to investigate the performance of drz in moderately permeable soil types and its influences on production of white wine grape cultivars in semi arid regions with variable weather patterns this study designated reduced irrigation rates to drz and compared them to the sd since the benefits of drz on chardonnay grape production and wpc in a silt loam soil have been revealed compared to the commercial sd regime more physiological aspects of chardonnay and other white wine grape cultivars response to drz as well as a comprehensive cost benefit analysis for drz compared to conventional sdi systems are worth further study for better elucidating the advantages of drz applied in different soil types and under unstable climatic scenarios 5 conclusion compared with surface drip irrigation sd direct root zone irrigation drz could improve crop water productivity of chardonnay grapevine by 23 34 and reduce the irrigation amount by 16 23 with enhanced berry quality and no negative effects on yield across varied weather conditions meanwhile reduced root growth was detected in 0 60 cm soil layers under drz and significantly decreased root number and root length density were observed in 20 40 cm soil depth indicating that drz could be used as an efficient means to regulate root distribution pattern of chardonnay in conclusion this novel subsurface irrigation technique could also be applied for vineyards of white wine grapes on moderately permeable soils in semi arid climates detailed physiological responses of different cultivars to drz especially for the relationship between rooting patterns and water distribution in soils as well as a comprehensive cost benefit analysis for drz compared to conventional subsurface drip irrigation systems are worth further study to better elucidate the advantages of drz applied under dynamic environments credit authorship contribution statement xm and pj

pdo led to the shortening of sunshine duration which was the key reason for the extension of drought propagation time 3 under scenario 1 the critical values of the agricultural drought response to meteorological drought duration and intensity were 4 9 and 0 9 respectively under scenario 2 the critical values increased to 5 1 and 2 0 revealing that the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought would slow down when groundwater rose to an appropriate position keywords irrigation groundwater table drought propagation drought response critical value data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought has become one of the most serious natural disasters in the world drought is classified into four categories meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought ams 1997 for agricultural management the spread and development of meteorological drought to agricultural drought is an issue of concern huang et al 2015 gao et al 2020 f w li et al 2020 r h li et al 2020 sattarl and kim 2018 because agricultural drought generally develops from meteorological drought therefore research on the correlation characteristics between agricultural drought and meteorological drought such as drought lag time critical duration and intensity of drought response will help to further understand the mechanism of drought transmission and provide basic support for the prediction of agricultural drought the research on drought lag time is the most extensive the time lag study reveals the propagation time of different drought types to a certain extent and is valuable for drought early warning however the resolution of the lag time in the literatures is basically on the monthly scale zhong et al 2020 tian et al 2022 for crops with short growth periods this time scale will obscure key drought characteristics such as the onset and duration of drought although the lag of drought propagation has been gradually studied the critical condition of agricultural drought response to meteorological drought is vague drought is not only constrained by natural factors such as meteorology and the underlying surface but is also affected by human activities some researchers have discussed the impact of human activities on drought lee et al 2019 wu et al 2020 halder et al 2020 noori and singh 2021 zhang et al 2013 but there are few studies on the propagation between meteorological and agricultural drought to accurately identify the evolution characteristics and occurrence laws of drought and further understand the drought propagation mechanism the shijin irrigation district was selected as the research area owing to the lack of long series of daily soil water content data in the study area the aquacrop model and meteorological data from 1951 to 2016 were used to simulate the soil water content the aquacrop model is a crop model proposed by the fao based on the response of crop yield to water delgoda et al 2016 farahani et al 2009 masasi et al 2019 since the calibration and verification of the model in shijin irrigation area have been described in previous studies f w li et al 2020 r h li et al 2020 li et al 2022 and the aquacrop model has been proved to have good accuracy it will not be repeated here the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and soil water deficit index swdi at the daily scale were calculated to characterize meteorological drought and agricultural drought respectively based on these two indicators the following three aspects were studied 1 the effects of irrigation and groundwater level changes on drought development and propagation 2 the dynamic change in propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought was studied through a sliding window for a set of data select a fixed length as the window and move forward in sequence to divide the original data into a series of data groups and 3 the critical value of agricultural drought response to meteorological drought was calculated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area as a large irrigation area in the haihe river basin the shijin irrigation district is located in the central and southern parts of hebei province the geographical location is shown in fig 1 the shijin irrigation district has a typical temperate continental monsoon climate the average annual evaporation is 1100 mm and the average annual precipitation is 507 2 mm the annual precipitation distribution in the irrigation area is extremely irregular with june to august receiving nearly 70 of the annual precipitation the average temperature in january is the lowest generally approximately 9 c with extreme lows reaching 22 c the average temperature in july is the highest generally approximately 32 c with extreme highs reaching 41 9 c summer maize is one of the main food crops in the shijin irrigation district the human activities related to drought in the shijin irrigation district mainly include groundwater exploitation and irrigation activities the long term overexploitation of groundwater in hebei province has led to a continuous and large scale decline in the groundwater level in the mid 1960 s the average groundwater depth was approximately 2 m after the 21st century the shallow groundwater depth dropped to below 10 m forming a serious funnel group fang and ren 2005 shijin irrigation district is in the jizaoheng funnel area the largest groundwater drop funnel in the country the area of cultivated land in the irrigation area is 268 thousand ha of which the effective irrigation area is 167 5 thousand ha the total length of the main irrigation canal is 134 7 km the designed flow is 100 m3 s and the average annual irrigation water is 552 million m3 therefore the study area is located in the strong human interference area with good typicality the measured average groundwater level in the shijin irrigation area is 19 4 m which is far above the water table of 2 m suitable for summer maize growth to study the influence of irrigation and groundwater level on the spread of drought the above three scenarios were set up 2 2 data the meteorological data of the luancheng meteorological station from 1951 to 2016 and crop data used in this study were from the china meteorological data network http www nmic cn including daily average

335 according to the primary and secondary relationships between roots stems leaves spikes and grains of summer maize and the process of vegetative and reproductive growth the whole growth process is divided into three stages seedling stage booting stage and flowering grain stage table 2 the irrigation schedule of summer maize is shown in table 3 2 3 data processing and analysis 2 3 1 meteorological drought indicator vicente serrano et al 2011 proposed the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei on the basis of the spi the spei takes the difference between rainfall and potential evapotranspiration as a simple climatic water balance and the difference satisfies the three parameter logarithmic distribution the spei not only retains the advantages of a flexible time scale and convenient calculation of the spi but also considers factors such as potential evapotranspiration however the temporal resolution in the literature is at the monthly scale which often blurs the key drought characteristics such as the starting time and duration of drought wang et al 2015 improved the temporal resolution to the daily scale to describe the characteristics of drought more clearly liang et al 2019 and wei et al 2018 proved that the daily scale spei was suitable for china and could accurately identify the characteristics and occurrence of drought to improve the accuracy and further explore the relationship between agricultural drought and meteorological drought the daily spei was used in this study the calculation method was as follows 1 according to data availability daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the physically based method of the penmanmonteith model the pm method requires large amounts of data involving values for solar radiation temperature wind speed and relative humidity pereira et al 2015 this method has been adopted by the fao as the standard procedure for computing potential evapotranspiration 1 et 0 0 408 r n

the three parameter log logistic probability distribution was adopted to normalize the cumulative sequence and the spei corresponding to each value was calculated 4 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where α β and γ

a suitable approach for agricultural drought monitoring martínez fernández et al 2015 proposed the soil water deficit index swdi which was expressed by surface soil water content and soil moisture parameters field capacity and wilting point however with the extension and expansion of crop roots the water pumping area of crops changed to describe the drought events accurately the soil water content in the effective root zone was employed to replace the surface soil water content in this paper martínez fernández et al 2015 found that drought occurred when the local surface soil moisture content was lower than the field capacity ma and zhou 2017 and li et al 2010 showed that the critical point of soil moisture of summer maize was 0 8 times the field capacity and the growth of summer maize was inhibited when the soil moisture was lower than the critical point the daily scale swdi was modified as follows 11 swdi θ 0 8 θ fc θ awc 10 where θ represents the daily effective root zone soil water content m3 m3 θ fc and θ awc represent field capacity m3 m3 and soil water load carrying capacity m3 m3 respectively the parameter values are shown in table 1 and 0 8 was the reduction coefficient of field capacity indicating that drought occurs when the soil water content was less than 0 8 times the field capacity the soil water carrying capacity θ awc is derived from the field capacity minus the wilting point θ wp as shown in eq 12 12 θ awc θ fc θ wp when the swdi was greater than 0 the soil water content was greater than 0 8 times the field capacity indicating that there was no agricultural drought therefore 0 was considered a threshold between arid and non arid conditions 2 3 3 theory of run based on the theory of run yevjevich 1969 a multithreshold method was used to extract drought characteristics and calculate drought duration and drought intensity in fig 2 y2 y1 and y0 were the thresholds to distinguish severe intensity light intensity and combined drought time respectively since the drought duration took day as the time unit it was considered that drought occurred when the discrete index series was continuously less than y1 above 3 periods if the index of adjacent subdrought events was less than y2 and the positive run between them was less than the threshold y0 the drought events were merged into one the length of the negative run in a drought event was the drought duration and the area of the negative run was the drought intensity according to drought levels and historical data meteorological drought and agricultural drought threshold y0 were 0 0 y1 were 0 5 0 4 y2 were 1 5 1 respectively fig 2 2 3 4 pearson correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient pcc was used to quantitatively measure the correlation between the daily swdi and spei at different scales the time scale of the spei corresponding to the maximum correlation coefficient was considered the lag time of agricultural propagation 13 pcc i 1 n φ i φ ρ i ρ i 1 n φ i φ 2 i 1 n ρ i ρ 2 where n represents the length of the variable sequence and φ i and ρ i denote the values of the two variable sequences the value range of pcc was from 1 to 1 they were positively correlated when pcc was greater than 0 and they were negatively correlated when pcc was less than 0 the greater the absolute value was the higher the correlation was 2 3 5 trend analysis the linear trend line was obtained by the linear regression method the spearman rank test was used to verify the dominance the spearman rank test was used for sequence order the rank correlation coefficient and statistic t were calculated as eq 13 and eq 14 respectively 14 r 1 6 i 1 n r i i 2 n 3 n where n is the sequence length and r i is the sequence number corresponding to the descending order of data the greater the rank correlation coefficient is the more obvious the trend 15 t r n 2 1 r 2 where t obeys the t distribution of freedom n 2 under the null hypothesis if t 0 and t tα 2 the sequence shows an obvious downwards trend under the selected dominant level α and vice versa 2 3 6 the kmo kaiser meyer olkin test kmo test is the measure of sampling adequacy proposed by kaiser meyer and olkin eq 16 if there is indeed a common factor in the original data the partial correlation coefficient between variables should be small when the kmo value is greater than 0 7 the data set is suitable for cause analysis 16 kmo i j r ij 2 i j r ij 2 i j r ij 1 2 k 2 where a i denotes influence factor 2 3 7 factor contribution rate the propagation time of meteorological drought to agricultural drought was affected by the underlying surface characteristics and meteorological factors because the underlying surface characteristics in the model simulation remained unchanged only meteorological factors were considered the change in propagation time y was expressed by the function determined by meteorological factor x i i 1 2 3 n as eq 17 17 y f x i i 1 2 3 n eq 18 can be obtained by linearization of logarithms on both sides of eq 17 18 ln y ln f x i i 1 2 3 n eq 19 obtained by multiple linear regression of eq 18 19 ln y i 1 n a i ln x i e where a i denotes the elastic coefficient of each influencing factor and e denotes the constant term of the regression equation the contribution rate of each influencing factor to the change in drought propagation time is 20 δ i a i x i x i y y where x i x i and y y represent the annual change rates of the influencing factors and propagation time respectively 2 3 8 cross wavelet transform cross wavelet transform combines the time domain and frequency domain of data series for correlation analysis based on wavelet transform and cross spectrum analysis the cross wavelet transform was conducted between meteorological factors and remote correlation factors to study the effects of solar activities and atmospheric circulation anomalies on drought propagation the cross wavelet transform of two specific time series x n and y n can be defined as w xy w x w y where represents the complex conjugate of x n and y n the cross wavelet energy is expressed as w xy the theoretical expressions of the cross wavelet power of two time series and its background power spectra p k x and p k y are as follows grinsted et al 2004 21 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p represents the confidence level of probability p corresponding to the probability distribution function defined by square roots of two x 2 distributions 2 3 9 drought response model the drought response critical value was calculated using the drought response model the response relationship model was divided into linear eq 22 and nonlinear models the nonlinear model included a logarithmic function eq 23 unary quadratic function eq 24 power function eq 25 and exponential function eq 26 22 y a bx 23 y c d ln h x 24 y i jx k 25 y p q x r 26 y e s t x w where x represents the characteristic value of meteorological drought y represents the characteristic value of agricultural drought and a b c d h i j k p q r s t and w are fitting parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of human activity on drought propagation in fig 3 the pcc of agricultural drought and meteorological drought under scenario 1 was the largest and the pcc under scenario 3 was the smallest irrigation remarkably weakened the correlation between agricultural drought and meteorological drought the time scale of the spei corresponding to the maximum pcc was considered the lag time of agricultural propagation the lag times under scenario 1 2 and 3 were 23 d 42 d and 30 d respectively compared with scenario 1 the occurrence of agricultural drought was prolonged by 19 d and 7 d after the groundwater level rose to 2 m and irrigation respectively the rise of groundwater and agricultural irrigation could effectively curtail the propagation time of meteorological drought to agricultural drought which was of great significance to alleviate agricultural drought and reduce crop yield and agricultural economic losses with the rise of groundwater the storage capacity of groundwater and the hydraulic connection with surface soil water increased when meteorological drought occurs crops cannot supplement water through meteorological precipitation while groundwater can be drawn through soil capillary forces to maintain the normal growth and development of crops thereby weakening the adverse impact of meteorological drought if the intensity and duration of meteorological drought were small a suitable groundwater level could even avoid the spread of meteorological drought to agricultural drought chen and hu 2004 gu et al 2002 when the soil moisture state began to change it was called the incubation period of agricultural drought when the meteorological drought continued to increase the groundwater level began to decline the soil aeration zone thickened and the water transport distance increased with increasing burial depth the influence of atmospheric evaporation and the ability of capillary water transport in the unsaturated zone were weakened the soil water content in the effective root zone was abundantly decreased in the initial stage of this process crops could reduce the water demand of crops through self regulation such as closing stomata to limit gas exchange reducing the photosynthetic rate and slowing the leaf growth rate to diminish the evaporation and diffusion of water from the cuticle at this time the impact of drought on crops was small which was considered the buffer period of agricultural drought with the continuous decrease in soil water content it was beyond the range of crop water balance regulation ability the water absorbed by crop roots has difficulty supplementing crop transpiration consumption and the water budget in crops is unbalanced thus damaging crop growth and development this moment was believed to be when agricultural drought began to occur pei et al 2013 irrigation activities were usually carried out during the buffer period of agricultural drought or after the occurrence of agricultural drought after irrigation the soil water content increased and the water supply could meet the crop water requirements so agricultural drought was relieved or alleviated under scenario 2 drought propagation interfered with the incubation period of agricultural drought compared with the former the intervention time under scenario 3 lagged behind and sometimes the optimal irrigation time might be missed it can be seen that the pcc on the time scale of 30 d was the largest under each condition in fig 3 therefore spei30 was applied to characterize the meteorological drought the calculation results of the spei30 and swdi during the growth period of summer maize are shown in fig 4 this result implied that the trends of agricultural drought and meteorological drought were consistent in the three cases agricultural drought under scenario 1 was the most serious and the mean value of the drought index under scenario 2 was higher than that under scenario 3 in general groundwater level rise had a better prevention or mitigation effect on agricultural drought in the whole growth period of summer maize 3 2 dynamic change of drought transmission time and cause analysis to study the dynamic change in drought propagation time the data of the summer maize growth period from 1951 to 2016 were divided into 36 groups with a 30 year sliding window due to the weak correlation between agricultural drought and meteorological drought under scenario 3 only the dynamic lag time of scenario 1 and 2 was analyzed and the results are shown in figs 5 and 6 the trend line was fitted by a one variable regression equation the slope represents the change rate of the propagation time the increase rate of lag time under scenario 2 was greater than that under scenario 1 the statistics t of scenario 1 and 2 calculated by the spearman rank test method are 5 1 and 2 5 respectively looking up the t distribution table by taking the dominant level α 0 05 when n 36 t0 025 36 2 02 t 0 and t t 0 025 36 the lag time in both cases demonstrated a significant upwards trend which meant that the occurrence time of agricultural drought in the growth period of summer maize was delayed after the meteorological drought there was more preparation time for alleviating or relieving agricultural drought the spread of drought was affected by different factors meteorological factors were the most direct factors for the generation and propagation of drought changes in meteorological factors would cause changes in crop water supply which in turn lead to or exacerbate the spread of drought the topography and soil conditions affected the conversion of atmospheric precipitation to soil water or groundwater to soil water and vegetation types affected rainwater infiltration and evapotranspiration thereby changing the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought due to the fixed crop species and the long term stability of the underlying surface characteristics such as terrain and soil in the aquacrop model simulation only meteorological factors had an impact on the change in drought propagation time the kmo kaiser meyer olkin test value between the impact factors was 0 798 and the sig is 0 000 it indicates that the variables are suitable for factor analysis the effects of precipitation sunshine duration relative humidity minimum temperature and maximum temperature on drought propagation time were discussed based on the data of meteorological factors during the summer maize growth period from 1951 to 2016 and considering 30 years as the sliding window the average values of 36 groups of data were calculated and arranged in chronological order precipitation sunshine duration and relative humidity showed a downwards trend while the minimum temperature and maximum temperature showed an upwards trend the multivariate linear regression equations of the drought propagation time and the meteorological factors under scenario 1 and 2 were expressed as y 1 5 076 x 1 3 07 x 2 0 79 x 3 1 104 x 4 1 12 x 5 20 386 y 2 7 443 x 1 6 324 x 2 1 927 x 3 0 403 x 4 0 444 x 5 77 412 and r2 values of 0 872 and 0 725 respectively the determination coefficient indicated that the interpretation rates of these five climatic factors for drought propagation time under scenario 1 and 2 reached 87 2 and 72 5 respectively due to the influence of groundwater the influence of meteorological factors on the drought propagation time was weakened the contribution rates of the five influencing factors to the drought propagation time are shown in table 4 the contribution rates of precipitation relative humidity and maximum temperature to the drought propagation time were negative while the contribution rates of sunshine duration and minimum temperature were positive decreases in precipitation and relative humidity and increases in maximum temperatures would shorten the drought propagation time and exacerbate droughts while decreases in sunshine duration and increases in minimum temperatures would curtail the drought propagation time and alleviate droughts the duration of sunshine affected the amount of solar radiation during the growing period of crops according to the theory of water vapor diffusion solar radiation provides energy for evapotranspiration the reduction in sunshine duration would reduce the amount of land evaporation and the water consumption of crops and slow the rate of soil moisture reduction in the propagation process from meteorological drought to agricultural drought therefore the drought propagation time was prolonged precipitation had a direct impact on soil water content the soil stored adequate water and the elastic space from meteorological drought to agricultural drought increased if the precipitation before drought was large therefore the decrease in precipitation reduced the water supply and shortened the drought propagation time the necessary condition for crop transpiration was the hydraulic gradient generated by the decrease in air humidity in plants the research results of guo et al 2014 indicated that when the humidity decreased the gradient between the atmospheric water vapor pressure and the water vapor pressure in the stomata of maize leaves increased which promoted transpiration the increase in root water absorbed by transpiration pull increased the water consumption of crops which aggravated drought temperature affected the drought propagation time by affecting stomatal conductance and the evapotranspiration rate stomata are the channel of plant transpiration and water loss research by zhao et al 2015 found that under drought stress stomatal conductance first decreased and then increased with increasing temperature ben asher et al 2008 pointed out that there was a critical temperature when the temperature was lower than the critical value the water use efficiency of crops increased with increasing temperature when the temperature was higher than the critical value the water use efficiency of crops decreased with increasing temperature therefore the influence of the rise in the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature on the drought propagation time was inconsistent the quantitative analysis results showed that the elastic coefficient of sunshine duration and the annual change rate during the study period were both large under the two conditions so the contribution rate to drought propagation time was the largest the annual change rate of relative humidity was the largest but the elastic coefficient was small that is the change in unit relative humidity had less influence on the propagation time therefore the contribution rate was the second largest the absolute value of the precipitation elasticity coefficient was the largest but the annual change rate was the lowest so the contribution rate was small in general the shortening of sunshine duration was the key reason for the propagation of drought propagation time it is worth noting the different effects of minimum and maximum temperatures on the drought propagation time the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature both showed an upwards trend but the contributions to the drought propagation time were opposite the increase in the minimum temperature would prolong the drought propagation time while the increase in the maximum temperature would shorten the drought propagation time remote correlation factors affected drought propagation by influencing meteorological factors to further understand the influence of solar activity and atmospheric circulation anomalies on drought propagation cross wavelet changes in remote correlation factors sunspot enso ao and pdo and meteorological factors precipitation sunshine duration relative humidity minimum temperature and maximum temperature were carried out to analyze the time frequency correlation between them the results are shown in fig 7 the red and blue represent the peak and valley values of the energy density respectively reflecting the locality and dynamic characteristics of the time frequency transformation the shade of color represents the relative change in the energy density the value enclosed by the black thick solid line passed the red noise test at the 95 confidence level the conical area below the thin black solid line was the cone of influence coi which denoted the area where the edge of the wavelet transform data had a greater influence the direction of the arrow indicates the phase of the two from left to right indicates the same phase and from right to left indicates the opposite phase there was no significant correlation between sunspots and relative humidity while sunspots had a main resonance period of approximately 8 13 years with other meteorological factors especially a significant negative correlation with precipitation in the whole study period enso had a main resonance period of approximately 1 7a with meteorological factors which is consistent with the enso variation period obtained by dash et al 2013 enso had a significantly negative correlation with precipitation and relative humidity and a significantly positive correlation with sunshine duration and temperature there was a main resonance period of approximately 1 7 years between ao and meteorological factors the influence of ao on sunshine duration and temperature was opposite to enso and the influence on precipitation and relative humidity was complex both positive and negative pdo had a main resonance period of approximately 1 10 years with meteorological factors and its influence on meteorological factors was similar to enso pdo had a negative correlation with precipitation and relative humidity and a positive correlation with sunshine duration and maximum temperature pdo had both a positive correlation and a negative correlation with minimum temperature as mentioned in the previous section the largest contribution to the variation in drought propagation time was the sunshine duration the main influencing factor of the sunshine duration was the atmospheric circulation anomaly from 1978 to 2002 the ao showed a significant upwards trend and enso showed a significant downwards trend liu et al 2004 the correlation between atmospheric circulation anomalies and sunshine duration demonstrated that sunshine duration had a downwards trend which was consistent with the previous conclusion taking the 1970s as the dividing line the pdo changed from a cold phase to a warm phase brabets and walvoord 2009 de paula et al 2015 found that the corresponding sunshine time under the cold phase was longer especially since the 21st century the alternation of the cold and warm phases of the pdo and enso has become faster and the fluctuation range has increased zhao et al 2014 resulting in intensified changes in meteorological factors such as sunshine duration in addition due to the largest elastic coefficient of precipitation in the contribution rate analysis it was also necessary to focus on its relationship with remote correlation factors cross wavelet analysis showed that sunspots and atmospheric circulation anomaly factors had a strong impact on precipitation and the influence of sunspots was the most obvious which was consistent with the conclusion of zou et al 2021 if the sunspots increased and the solar activity strengthened the precipitation changed significantly which was likely to aggravate drought and shorten the drought propagation time fig 8 continued fig 7 cross wavelet map of meteorological factors and remote correlation factors 3 3 critical values of agricultural drought response to meteorological drought to compare the meteorological drought and agricultural drought identified by the theory of runs 25 typical drought events were selected under scenario 1 and 2 the relationship model between agricultural drought and meteorological drought was constructed by the cross validation method the data samples were divided into two parts most of which were used for model construction and the remaining part of the data was used for model validation shao 1997 proved that when the ratio of the training set to the test set was greater than 2 the simulation effect was better therefore the first 18 events out of 25 typical drought events were used for modeling and the rest of the drought events were used for validation the fitting results of different drought response models are shown in figs 10 11 and table 5 the minimum determination coefficient of the fitting expression was 0 68 and the maximum was 0 92 all passed the test of 0 05 significance level indicating that agricultural drought was closely related to meteorological drought the statistical data of residual meteorological drought characteristics were substituted into each fitting function to obtain the agricultural drought characteristic values under the corresponding meteorological drought the verification results of the drought response model under scenario 1 and 2 are shown in table 6 the average relative errors of the linear function logarithmic function unary quadratic function power function and exponential function were 17 5 13 8 14 4 14 1 and 14 7 respectively the average relative error of the logarithmic function was the smallest therefore the simulation effect of the response model determined by the logarithmic three parameter logarithmic function was the best the results were consistent with wu 2017 and luo et al 2020 when the characteristic value of agricultural drought was 0 the corresponding characteristic value of meteorological drought was the critical value of drought response substituting into the logarithmic three parameter logarithmic function relationship the critical values of the duration and intensity for the response of meteorological drought to agricultural drought under scenario 1 were 4 9 and 0 9 respectively the critical values under scenario 2 were 5 1 and 2 0 respectively indicating that the response thresholds of agricultural drought to meteorological drought increased after the rise of groundwater level and the rise of groundwater level could slow down the spread of drought however crop yield under drought stress does not necessarily decrease appropriate drought stress in some growth periods instead promoted yield increases wan et al 2018 therefore further research on crop yield changes under drought stress is recommended to determine the drought turning point that caused crop yield to begin to decline the stress turning point combined with the response relationship of agricultural drought to meteorological drought would achieve accurate and efficient early warning of drought which will be the focus of future research 3 4 influence of drought on maize yield the maize yield and aboveground biomass under the three scenarios are shown in fig 10 the rise of groundwater level and irrigation significantly increased the maize yield with an average yield increase of about 17 and the distribution of yield was more stable and concentrated under scenario 2 and 3 the yield was the highest under scenario 3 because the artificial irrigation was targeted and the amount of water was large which could supply water quickly and made the crops get rid of drought so the yield increase effect was more obvious than the rise of groundwater level as shown in fig 11 the increase and decrease trends of surface biomass and yield were consistent surface biomass was an external indicator of the growth and development of maize and also an important material basis for the formation of yield showing a significant positive correlation with crop yield steduto et al 2007 scenario 1 had the largest number of drought events in the crop phenological period and the widest range of drought yield changes which was more representative therefore the yield of maize in different growth periods under meteorological drought index and agricultural drought index in scenario 1 was analyzed figs 12 and 13 when spei 0 swdi 1 under the same degree of drought conditions the lowest yield occurred when drought occurs at booting stage and the highest yield at flowering grain stage booting stage was the most vigorous growth stage of summer maize at this stage the vegetative organs grew vigorously the male and female panicoplasms began to differentiate the growth of reproductive organs was very sensitive to water so the drought had a great impact on the yield the roots stems and leaves of summer maize had basically stopped growing at the flowering grain stage and the water supply was mainly used to prolong the photosynthetic time of leaves and ensured that the plants transferred the nutrients accumulated in leaves to fruits there was little demand for water at this time so drought had less effect on yield ge et al 2012 when spei 1 and swdi 0 the yield was the highest at booting stage it indicated that maize tolerated water but not drought at booting stage the change of yield under meteorological drought index was relatively smooth because it took some time to transition from meteorological drought to agricultural drought compared with the meteorological drought index the yield under the agricultural drought index changed more dramatically and the correlation coefficient with the yield was larger yield was more sensitive to agricultural drought index obviously the 60 meteorological drought events and 55 agricultural drought events occurred under scenario 1 based on the run theory the frequency of drought intensity and duration of different degrees was shown in fig 14 the higher the intensity of drought the longer the duration and the lower the frequency of drought with the increase of drought intensity and duration maize yield decreased figs 15 and 16 the statistics of drought intensity were based on the negative run area of drought index the calculation methods of spei and swdi were different so the range of drought intensity was quite different and it cannot be compared quantitatively in the same drought duration agricultural drought corresponded to lower yields agricultural drought was directly related to soil water content in the case of low intensity and long duration meteorological drought if the initial soil moisture content was sufficient and the rainfall in the later period of drought was adequate the duration of agricultural drought was often lower than that of meteorological drought therefore the duration of agricultural drought was longer under the same crop yield statistically 4 conclusions the lag times of agricultural drought to meteorological drought under scenario 1 2 and 3 were 23 d 42 d and 30 d respectively both groundwater level rise and agricultural irrigation could effectively prolong the propagation time of meteorological drought to agricultural drought the lag time showed a significant upwards trend under scenario 1 and 2 from the factor contribution rate and cross wavelet analysis it can be derived that the increasing trend of ao and the decreasing trend of pdo caused the shortening of sunshine duration which was the key reason for the extension of drought propagation time comparing different drought response models it was concluded that the simulation effect of the logarithmic three parameter logarithmic function was the best the critical values for the duration and intensity under scenario 1 were 4 9 and 0 9 respectively the critical values under scenario 2 were 5 1 and 2 0 respectively indicating that the rise of the groundwater table to a suitable position could slow down the spread of drought irrigation and rising water tables increase corn yields by about 17 maize is most sensitive to water deficit at booting stage in the same drought duration agricultural drought corresponded to lower yields due to the overexploitation of groundwater the current groundwater depth in the shijin irrigation district is relatively deep to achieve sustainable development and ensure food production it is recommended that the government adopt relevant policies such as reducing groundwater exploitation or conducting groundwater recharge to raise the groundwater level according to the above studies the drought propagation time was within 20 40 d considering the critical point of drought response irrigation was recommended within 23 42 d after the occurrence of meteorological drought the direct cause of agricultural drought was the decrease of soil water content ren et al 2021 and zhang et al 2021 showed that mulching can effectively improve soil water content without damaging the annual balance of soil water storage therefore in depth research on relevant aspects can be conducted after the field data of mulching obtained which provide

9106,research on drought propagation is of great significance for the scientific prediction of agricultural drought and reducing drought losses in this study based on the daily scale standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and soil water deficit index swdi the effects of irrigation and groundwater level change on the development and spread of drought were studied and the dynamic change in the spread time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought was explored through a sliding window additionally the critical value of the response of agricultural drought to meteorological drought was calculated the results indicated that 1 under scenario 1 groundwater depth 19 4 m no irrigation scenario 2 groundwater depth 2 m no irrigation and scenario 3 groundwater depth 19 4 m irrigation the lag times of agricultural drought on meteorological drought were 23 d 42 d and 30 d respectively 2 the drought propagation time under scenario 1 and 2 exhibited a significant upwards trend according to the factor contribution rate and cross wavelet analysis the rising trend of the arctic oscillation ao and the decreasing trend of the pacific decade oscillation pdo led to the shortening of sunshine duration which was the key reason for the extension of drought propagation time 3 under scenario 1 the critical values of the agricultural drought response to meteorological drought duration and intensity were 4 9 and 0 9 respectively under scenario 2 the critical values increased to 5 1 and 2 0 revealing that the propagation of meteorological drought to agricultural drought would slow down when groundwater rose to an appropriate position keywords irrigation groundwater table drought propagation drought response critical value data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought has become one of the most serious natural disasters in the world drought is classified into four categories meteorological drought agricultural drought hydrological drought and socioeconomic drought ams 1997 for agricultural management the spread and development of meteorological drought to agricultural drought is an issue of concern huang et al 2015 gao et al 2020 f w li et al 2020 r h li et al 2020 sattarl and kim 2018 because agricultural drought generally develops from meteorological drought therefore research on the correlation characteristics between agricultural drought and meteorological drought such as drought lag time critical duration and intensity of drought response will help to further understand the mechanism of drought transmission and provide basic support for the prediction of agricultural drought the research on drought lag time is the most extensive the time lag study reveals the propagation time of different drought types to a certain extent and is valuable for drought early warning however the resolution of the lag time in the literatures is basically on the monthly scale zhong et al 2020 tian et al 2022 for crops with short growth periods this time scale will obscure key drought characteristics such as the onset and duration of drought although the lag of drought propagation has been gradually studied the critical condition of agricultural drought response to meteorological drought is vague drought is not only constrained by natural factors such as meteorology and the underlying surface but is also affected by human activities some researchers have discussed the impact of human activities on drought lee et al 2019 wu et al 2020 halder et al 2020 noori and singh 2021 zhang et al 2013 but there are few studies on the propagation between meteorological and agricultural drought to accurately identify the evolution characteristics and occurrence laws of drought and further understand the drought propagation mechanism the shijin irrigation district was selected as the research area owing to the lack of long series of daily soil water content data in the study area the aquacrop model and meteorological data from 1951 to 2016 were used to simulate the soil water content the aquacrop model is a crop model proposed by the fao based on the response of crop yield to water delgoda et al 2016 farahani et al 2009 masasi et al 2019 since the calibration and verification of the model in shijin irrigation area have been described in previous studies f w li et al 2020 r h li et al 2020 li et al 2022 and the aquacrop model has been proved to have good accuracy it will not be repeated here the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and soil water deficit index swdi at the daily scale were calculated to characterize meteorological drought and agricultural drought respectively based on these two indicators the following three aspects were studied 1 the effects of irrigation and groundwater level changes on drought development and propagation 2 the dynamic change in propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought was studied through a sliding window for a set of data select a fixed length as the window and move forward in sequence to divide the original data into a series of data groups and 3 the critical value of agricultural drought response to meteorological drought was calculated 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area as a large irrigation area in the haihe river basin the shijin irrigation district is located in the central and southern parts of hebei province the geographical location is shown in fig 1 the shijin irrigation district has a typical temperate continental monsoon climate the average annual evaporation is 1100 mm and the average annual precipitation is 507 2 mm the annual precipitation distribution in the irrigation area is extremely irregular with june to august receiving nearly 70 of the annual precipitation the average temperature in january is the lowest generally approximately 9 c with extreme lows reaching 22 c the average temperature in july is the highest generally approximately 32 c with extreme highs reaching 41 9 c summer maize is one of the main food crops in the shijin irrigation district the human activities related to drought in the shijin irrigation district mainly include groundwater exploitation and irrigation activities the long term overexploitation of groundwater in hebei province has led to a continuous and large scale decline in the groundwater level in the mid 1960 s the average groundwater depth was approximately 2 m after the 21st century the shallow groundwater depth dropped to below 10 m forming a serious funnel group fang and ren 2005 shijin irrigation district is in the jizaoheng funnel area the largest groundwater drop funnel in the country the area of cultivated land in the irrigation area is 268 thousand ha of which the effective irrigation area is 167 5 thousand ha the total length of the main irrigation canal is 134 7 km the designed flow is 100 m3 s and the average annual irrigation water is 552 million m3 therefore the study area is located in the strong human interference area with good typicality the measured average groundwater level in the shijin irrigation area is 19 4 m which is far above the water table of 2 m suitable for summer maize growth to study the influence of irrigation and groundwater level on the spread of drought the above three scenarios were set up 2 2 data the meteorological data of the luancheng meteorological station from 1951 to 2016 and crop data used in this study were from the china meteorological data network http www nmic cn including daily average

335 according to the primary and secondary relationships between roots stems leaves spikes and grains of summer maize and the process of vegetative and reproductive growth the whole growth process is divided into three stages seedling stage booting stage and flowering grain stage table 2 the irrigation schedule of summer maize is shown in table 3 2 3 data processing and analysis 2 3 1 meteorological drought indicator vicente serrano et al 2011 proposed the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei on the basis of the spi the spei takes the difference between rainfall and potential evapotranspiration as a simple climatic water balance and the difference satisfies the three parameter logarithmic distribution the spei not only retains the advantages of a flexible time scale and convenient calculation of the spi but also considers factors such as potential evapotranspiration however the temporal resolution in the literature is at the monthly scale which often blurs the key drought characteristics such as the starting time and duration of drought wang et al 2015 improved the temporal resolution to the daily scale to describe the characteristics of drought more clearly liang et al 2019 and wei et al 2018 proved that the daily scale spei was suitable for china and could accurately identify the characteristics and occurrence of drought to improve the accuracy and further explore the relationship between agricultural drought and meteorological drought the daily spei was used in this study the calculation method was as follows 1 according to data availability daily potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the physically based method of the penmanmonteith model the pm method requires large amounts of data involving values for solar radiation temperature wind speed and relative humidity pereira et al 2015 this method has been adopted by the fao as the standard procedure for computing potential evapotranspiration 1 et 0 0 408 r n

the three parameter log logistic probability distribution was adopted to normalize the cumulative sequence and the spei corresponding to each value was calculated 4 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where α β and γ

a suitable approach for agricultural drought monitoring martínez fernández et al 2015 proposed the soil water deficit index swdi which was expressed by surface soil water content and soil moisture parameters field capacity and wilting point however with the extension and expansion of crop roots the water pumping area of crops changed to describe the drought events accurately the soil water content in the effective root zone was employed to replace the surface soil water content in this paper martínez fernández et al 2015 found that drought occurred when the local surface soil moisture content was lower than the field capacity ma and zhou 2017 and li et al 2010 showed that the critical point of soil moisture of summer maize was 0 8 times the field capacity and the growth of summer maize was inhibited when the soil moisture was lower than the critical point the daily scale swdi was modified as follows 11 swdi θ 0 8 θ fc θ awc 10 where θ represents the daily effective root zone soil water content m3 m3 θ fc and θ awc represent field capacity m3 m3 and soil water load carrying capacity m3 m3 respectively the parameter values are shown in table 1 and 0 8 was the reduction coefficient of field capacity indicating that drought occurs when the soil water content was less than 0 8 times the field capacity the soil water carrying capacity θ awc is derived from the field capacity minus the wilting point θ wp as shown in eq 12 12 θ awc θ fc θ wp when the swdi was greater than 0 the soil water content was greater than 0 8 times the field capacity indicating that there was no agricultural drought therefore 0 was considered a threshold between arid and non arid conditions 2 3 3 theory of run based on the theory of run yevjevich 1969 a multithreshold method was used to extract drought characteristics and calculate drought duration and drought intensity in fig 2 y2 y1 and y0 were the thresholds to distinguish severe intensity light intensity and combined drought time respectively since the drought duration took day as the time unit it was considered that drought occurred when the discrete index series was continuously less than y1 above 3 periods if the index of adjacent subdrought events was less than y2 and the positive run between them was less than the threshold y0 the drought events were merged into one the length of the negative run in a drought event was the drought duration and the area of the negative run was the drought intensity according to drought levels and historical data meteorological drought and agricultural drought threshold y0 were 0 0 y1 were 0 5 0 4 y2 were 1 5 1 respectively fig 2 2 3 4 pearson correlation analysis the pearson correlation coefficient pcc was used to quantitatively measure the correlation between the daily swdi and spei at different scales the time scale of the spei corresponding to the maximum correlation coefficient was considered the lag time of agricultural propagation 13 pcc i 1 n φ i φ ρ i ρ i 1 n φ i φ 2 i 1 n ρ i ρ 2 where n represents the length of the variable sequence and φ i and ρ i denote the values of the two variable sequences the value range of pcc was from 1 to 1 they were positively correlated when pcc was greater than 0 and they were negatively correlated when pcc was less than 0 the greater the absolute value was the higher the correlation was 2 3 5 trend analysis the linear trend line was obtained by the linear regression method the spearman rank test was used to verify the dominance the spearman rank test was used for sequence order the rank correlation coefficient and statistic t were calculated as eq 13 and eq 14 respectively 14 r 1 6 i 1 n r i i 2 n 3 n where n is the sequence length and r i is the sequence number corresponding to the descending order of data the greater the rank correlation coefficient is the more obvious the trend 15 t r n 2 1 r 2 where t obeys the t distribution of freedom n 2 under the null hypothesis if t 0 and t tα 2 the sequence shows an obvious downwards trend under the selected dominant level α and vice versa 2 3 6 the kmo kaiser meyer olkin test kmo test is the measure of sampling adequacy proposed by kaiser meyer and olkin eq 16 if there is indeed a common factor in the original data the partial correlation coefficient between variables should be small when the kmo value is greater than 0 7 the data set is suitable for cause analysis 16 kmo i j r ij 2 i j r ij 2 i j r ij 1 2 k 2 where a i denotes influence factor 2 3 7 factor contribution rate the propagation time of meteorological drought to agricultural drought was affected by the underlying surface characteristics and meteorological factors because the underlying surface characteristics in the model simulation remained unchanged only meteorological factors were considered the change in propagation time y was expressed by the function determined by meteorological factor x i i 1 2 3 n as eq 17 17 y f x i i 1 2 3 n eq 18 can be obtained by linearization of logarithms on both sides of eq 17 18 ln y ln f x i i 1 2 3 n eq 19 obtained by multiple linear regression of eq 18 19 ln y i 1 n a i ln x i e where a i denotes the elastic coefficient of each influencing factor and e denotes the constant term of the regression equation the contribution rate of each influencing factor to the change in drought propagation time is 20 δ i a i x i x i y y where x i x i and y y represent the annual change rates of the influencing factors and propagation time respectively 2 3 8 cross wavelet transform cross wavelet transform combines the time domain and frequency domain of data series for correlation analysis based on wavelet transform and cross spectrum analysis the cross wavelet transform was conducted between meteorological factors and remote correlation factors to study the effects of solar activities and atmospheric circulation anomalies on drought propagation the cross wavelet transform of two specific time series x n and y n can be defined as w xy w x w y where represents the complex conjugate of x n and y n the cross wavelet energy is expressed as w xy the theoretical expressions of the cross wavelet power of two time series and its background power spectra p k x and p k y are as follows grinsted et al 2004 21 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p represents the confidence level of probability p corresponding to the probability distribution function defined by square roots of two x 2 distributions 2 3 9 drought response model the drought response critical value was calculated using the drought response model the response relationship model was divided into linear eq 22 and nonlinear models the nonlinear model included a logarithmic function eq 23 unary quadratic function eq 24 power function eq 25 and exponential function eq 26 22 y a bx 23 y c d ln h x 24 y i jx k 25 y p q x r 26 y e s t x w where x represents the characteristic value of meteorological drought y represents the characteristic value of agricultural drought and a b c d h i j k p q r s t and w are fitting parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of human activity on drought propagation in fig 3 the pcc of agricultural drought and meteorological drought under scenario 1 was the largest and the pcc under scenario 3 was the smallest irrigation remarkably weakened the correlation between agricultural drought and meteorological drought the time scale of the spei corresponding to the maximum pcc was considered the lag time of agricultural propagation the lag times under scenario 1 2 and 3 were 23 d 42 d and 30 d respectively compared with scenario 1 the occurrence of agricultural drought was prolonged by 19 d and 7 d after the groundwater level rose to 2 m and irrigation respectively the rise of groundwater and agricultural irrigation could effectively curtail the propagation time of meteorological drought to agricultural drought which was of great significance to alleviate agricultural drought and reduce crop yield and agricultural economic losses with the rise of groundwater the storage capacity of groundwater and the hydraulic connection with surface soil water increased when meteorological drought occurs crops cannot supplement water through meteorological precipitation while groundwater can be drawn through soil capillary forces to maintain the normal growth and development of crops thereby weakening the adverse impact of meteorological drought if the intensity and duration of meteorological drought were small a suitable groundwater level could even avoid the spread of meteorological drought to agricultural drought chen and hu 2004 gu et al 2002 when the soil moisture state began to change it was called the incubation period of agricultural drought when the meteorological drought continued to increase the groundwater level began to decline the soil aeration zone thickened and the water transport distance increased with increasing burial depth the influence of atmospheric evaporation and the ability of capillary water transport in the unsaturated zone were weakened the soil water content in the effective root zone was abundantly decreased in the initial stage of this process crops could reduce the water demand of crops through self regulation such as closing stomata to limit gas exchange reducing the photosynthetic rate and slowing the leaf growth rate to diminish the evaporation and diffusion of water from the cuticle at this time the impact of drought on crops was small which was considered the buffer period of agricultural drought with the continuous decrease in soil water content it was beyond the range of crop water balance regulation ability the water absorbed by crop roots has difficulty supplementing crop transpiration consumption and the water budget in crops is unbalanced thus damaging crop growth and development this moment was believed to be when agricultural drought began to occur pei et al 2013 irrigation activities were usually carried out during the buffer period of agricultural drought or after the occurrence of agricultural drought after irrigation the soil water content increased and the water supply could meet the crop water requirements so agricultural drought was relieved or alleviated under scenario 2 drought propagation interfered with the incubation period of agricultural drought compared with the former the intervention time under scenario 3 lagged behind and sometimes the optimal irrigation time might be missed it can be seen that the pcc on the time scale of 30 d was the largest under each condition in fig 3 therefore spei30 was applied to characterize the meteorological drought the calculation results of the spei30 and swdi during the growth period of summer maize are shown in fig 4 this result implied that the trends of agricultural drought and meteorological drought were consistent in the three cases agricultural drought under scenario 1 was the most serious and the mean value of the drought index under scenario 2 was higher than that under scenario 3 in general groundwater level rise had a better prevention or mitigation effect on agricultural drought in the whole growth period of summer maize 3 2 dynamic change of drought transmission time and cause analysis to study the dynamic change in drought propagation time the data of the summer maize growth period from 1951 to 2016 were divided into 36 groups with a 30 year sliding window due to the weak correlation between agricultural drought and meteorological drought under scenario 3 only the dynamic lag time of scenario 1 and 2 was analyzed and the results are shown in figs 5 and 6 the trend line was fitted by a one variable regression equation the slope represents the change rate of the propagation time the increase rate of lag time under scenario 2 was greater than that under scenario 1 the statistics t of scenario 1 and 2 calculated by the spearman rank test method are 5 1 and 2 5 respectively looking up the t distribution table by taking the dominant level α 0 05 when n 36 t0 025 36 2 02 t 0 and t t 0 025 36 the lag time in both cases demonstrated a significant upwards trend which meant that the occurrence time of agricultural drought in the growth period of summer maize was delayed after the meteorological drought there was more preparation time for alleviating or relieving agricultural drought the spread of drought was affected by different factors meteorological factors were the most direct factors for the generation and propagation of drought changes in meteorological factors would cause changes in crop water supply which in turn lead to or exacerbate the spread of drought the topography and soil conditions affected the conversion of atmospheric precipitation to soil water or groundwater to soil water and vegetation types affected rainwater infiltration and evapotranspiration thereby changing the propagation time from meteorological drought to agricultural drought due to the fixed crop species and the long term stability of the underlying surface characteristics such as terrain and soil in the aquacrop model simulation only meteorological factors had an impact on the change in drought propagation time the kmo kaiser meyer olkin test value between the impact factors was 0 798 and the sig is 0 000 it indicates that the variables are suitable for factor analysis the effects of precipitation sunshine duration relative humidity minimum temperature and maximum temperature on drought propagation time were discussed based on the data of meteorological factors during the summer maize growth period from 1951 to 2016 and considering 30 years as the sliding window the average values of 36 groups of data were calculated and arranged in chronological order precipitation sunshine duration and relative humidity showed a downwards trend while the minimum temperature and maximum temperature showed an upwards trend the multivariate linear regression equations of the drought propagation time and the meteorological factors under scenario 1 and 2 were expressed as y 1 5 076 x 1 3 07 x 2 0 79 x 3 1 104 x 4 1 12 x 5 20 386 y 2 7 443 x 1 6 324 x 2 1 927 x 3 0 403 x 4 0 444 x 5 77 412 and r2 values of 0 872 and 0 725 respectively the determination coefficient indicated that the interpretation rates of these five climatic factors for drought propagation time under scenario 1 and 2 reached 87 2 and 72 5 respectively due to the influence of groundwater the influence of meteorological factors on the drought propagation time was weakened the contribution rates of the five influencing factors to the drought propagation time are shown in table 4 the contribution rates of precipitation relative humidity and maximum temperature to the drought propagation time were negative while the contribution rates of sunshine duration and minimum temperature were positive decreases in precipitation and relative humidity and increases in maximum temperatures would shorten the drought propagation time and exacerbate droughts while decreases in sunshine duration and increases in minimum temperatures would curtail the drought propagation time and alleviate droughts the duration of sunshine affected the amount of solar radiation during the growing period of crops according to the theory of water vapor diffusion solar radiation provides energy for evapotranspiration the reduction in sunshine duration would reduce the amount of land evaporation and the water consumption of crops and slow the rate of soil moisture reduction in the propagation process from meteorological drought to agricultural drought therefore the drought propagation time was prolonged precipitation had a direct impact on soil water content the soil stored adequate water and the elastic space from meteorological drought to agricultural drought increased if the precipitation before drought was large therefore the decrease in precipitation reduced the water supply and shortened the drought propagation time the necessary condition for crop transpiration was the hydraulic gradient generated by the decrease in air humidity in plants the research results of guo et al 2014 indicated that when the humidity decreased the gradient between the atmospheric water vapor pressure and the water vapor pressure in the stomata of maize leaves increased which promoted transpiration the increase in root water absorbed by transpiration pull increased the water consumption of crops which aggravated drought temperature affected the drought propagation time by affecting stomatal conductance and the evapotranspiration rate stomata are the channel of plant transpiration and water loss research by zhao et al 2015 found that under drought stress stomatal conductance first decreased and then increased with increasing temperature ben asher et al 2008 pointed out that there was a critical temperature when the temperature was lower than the critical value the water use efficiency of crops increased with increasing temperature when the temperature was higher than the critical value the water use efficiency of crops decreased with increasing temperature therefore the influence of the rise in the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature on the drought propagation time was inconsistent the quantitative analysis results showed that the elastic coefficient of sunshine duration and the annual change rate during the study period were both large under the two conditions so the contribution rate to drought propagation time was the largest the annual change rate of relative humidity was the largest but the elastic coefficient was small that is the change in unit relative humidity had less influence on the propagation time therefore the contribution rate was the second largest the absolute value of the precipitation elasticity coefficient was the largest but the annual change rate was the lowest so the contribution rate was small in general the shortening of sunshine duration was the key reason for the propagation of drought propagation time it is worth noting the different effects of minimum and maximum temperatures on the drought propagation time the maximum temperature and the minimum temperature both showed an upwards trend but the contributions to the drought propagation time were opposite the increase in the minimum temperature would prolong the drought propagation time while the increase in the maximum temperature would shorten the drought propagation time remote correlation factors affected drought propagation by influencing meteorological factors to further understand the influence of solar activity and atmospheric circulation anomalies on drought propagation cross wavelet changes in remote correlation factors sunspot enso ao and pdo and meteorological factors precipitation sunshine duration relative humidity minimum temperature and maximum temperature were carried out to analyze the time frequency correlation between them the results are shown in fig 7 the red and blue represent the peak and valley values of the energy density respectively reflecting the locality and dynamic characteristics of the time frequency transformation the shade of color represents the relative change in the energy density the value enclosed by the black thick solid line passed the red noise test at the 95 confidence level the conical area below the thin black solid line was the cone of influence coi which denoted the area where the edge of the wavelet transform data had a greater influence the direction of the arrow indicates the phase of the two from left to right indicates the same phase and from right to left indicates the opposite phase there was no significant correlation between sunspots and relative humidity while sunspots had a main resonance period of approximately 8 13 years with other meteorological factors especially a significant negative correlation with precipitation in the whole study period enso had a main resonance period of approximately 1 7a with meteorological factors which is consistent with the enso variation period obtained by dash et al 2013 enso had a significantly negative correlation with precipitation and relative humidity and a significantly positive correlation with sunshine duration and temperature there was a main resonance period of approximately 1 7 years between ao and meteorological factors the influence of ao on sunshine duration and temperature was opposite to enso and the influence on precipitation and relative humidity was complex both positive and negative pdo had a main resonance period of approximately 1 10 years with meteorological factors and its influence on meteorological factors was similar to enso pdo had a negative correlation with precipitation and relative humidity and a positive correlation with sunshine duration and maximum temperature pdo had both a positive correlation and a negative correlation with minimum temperature as mentioned in the previous section the largest contribution to the variation in drought propagation time was the sunshine duration the main influencing factor of the sunshine duration was the atmospheric circulation anomaly from 1978 to 2002 the ao showed a significant upwards trend and enso showed a significant downwards trend liu et al 2004 the correlation between atmospheric circulation anomalies and sunshine duration demonstrated that sunshine duration had a downwards trend which was consistent with the previous conclusion taking the 1970s as the dividing line the pdo changed from a cold phase to a warm phase brabets and walvoord 2009 de paula et al 2015 found that the corresponding sunshine time under the cold phase was longer especially since the 21st century the alternation of the cold and warm phases of the pdo and enso has become faster and the fluctuation range has increased zhao et al 2014 resulting in intensified changes in meteorological factors such as sunshine duration in addition due to the largest elastic coefficient of precipitation in the contribution rate analysis it was also necessary to focus on its relationship with remote correlation factors cross wavelet analysis showed that sunspots and atmospheric circulation anomaly factors had a strong impact on precipitation and the influence of sunspots was the most obvious which was consistent with the conclusion of zou et al 2021 if the sunspots increased and the solar activity strengthened the precipitation changed significantly which was likely to aggravate drought and shorten the drought propagation time fig 8 continued fig 7 cross wavelet map of meteorological factors and remote correlation factors 3 3

were selected under scenario 1 and 2 the relationship model between agricultural drought and meteorological drought was constructed by the cross validation method the data samples were divided into two parts most of which were used for model construction and the remaining part of the data was used for model validation shao 1997 proved that when the ratio of the training set to the test set was greater than 2 the simulation effect was better therefore the first 18 events out of 25 typical drought events were used for modeling and the rest of the drought events were used for validation the fitting results of different drought response models are shown in figs 10 11 and table 5 the minimum determination coefficient of the fitting expression was 0 68 and the maximum was 0 92 all passed the test of 0 05 significance level indicating that agricultural drought was closely related to meteorological drought the statistical data of residual meteorological drought characteristics were substituted into each fitting function to obtain the agricultural drought characteristic values under the corresponding meteorological drought the verification results of the drought response model under scenario 1 and 2 are shown in table 6 the average relative errors of the linear function logarithmic function unary quadratic function power function and exponential function were 17 5 13 8 14 4 14 1 and 14 7 respectively the average relative error of the logarithmic function was the smallest therefore the simulation effect of the response model determined by the logarithmic three parameter logarithmic function was the best the results were consistent with wu 2017 and luo et al 2020 when the characteristic value of agricultural drought was 0 the corresponding characteristic value of meteorological drought was the critical value of drought response substituting into the logarithmic three parameter logarithmic function relationship the critical values of the duration and intensity for the response of meteorological drought to agricultural drought under scenario 1 were 4 9 and 0 9 respectively the critical values under scenario 2 were 5 1 and 2 0 respectively indicating that the response thresholds of agricultural drought to meteorological drought increased after the rise of groundwater level and the rise of groundwater level could slow down the spread of drought however crop yield under drought stress does not necessarily decrease appropriate drought stress in some growth periods instead promoted yield increases wan et al 2018 therefore further research on crop yield changes under drought stress is recommended to determine the drought turning point that caused crop yield to begin to decline the stress turning point combined with the response relationship of agricultural drought to meteorological drought would achieve accurate and efficient early warning of drought which will be the focus of future research 3 4 influence of drought on maize yield the maize yield and aboveground biomass under the three scenarios are shown in fig 10 the rise of groundwater level and irrigation significantly increased the maize yield with an average yield increase of about 17 and the distribution of yield was more stable and concentrated under scenario 2 and 3 the yield was the highest under scenario 3 because the artificial irrigation was targeted and the amount of water was large which could supply water quickly and made the crops get rid of drought so the yield increase effect was more obvious than the rise of groundwater level as shown in fig 11 the increase and decrease trends of surface biomass and yield were consistent surface biomass was an external indicator of the growth and development of maize and also an important material basis for the formation of yield showing a significant positive correlation with crop yield steduto et al 2007 scenario 1 had the largest number of drought events in the crop phenological period and the widest range of drought yield changes which was more representative therefore the yield of maize in different growth periods under meteorological drought index and agricultural drought index in scenario 1 was analyzed figs 12 and 13 when spei 0 swdi 1 under the same degree of drought conditions the lowest yield occurred when drought occurs at booting stage and the highest yield at flowering grain stage booting stage was the most vigorous growth stage of summer maize at this stage the vegetative organs grew vigorously the male and female panicoplasms began to differentiate the growth of reproductive organs was very sensitive to water so the drought had a great impact on the yield the roots stems and leaves of summer maize had basically stopped growing at the flowering grain stage and the water supply was mainly used to prolong the photosynthetic time of leaves and ensured that the plants transferred the nutrients accumulated in leaves to fruits there was little demand for water at this time so drought had less effect on yield ge et al 2012 when spei 1 and swdi 0 the yield was the highest at booting stage it indicated that maize tolerated water but not drought at booting stage the change of yield under meteorological drought index was relatively smooth because it took some time to transition from meteorological drought to agricultural drought compared with the meteorological drought index the yield under the agricultural drought index changed more dramatically and the correlation coefficient with the yield was larger yield was more sensitive to agricultural drought index obviously the 60 meteorological drought events and 55 agricultural drought events occurred under scenario 1 based on the run theory the frequency of drought intensity and duration of different degrees was shown in fig 14 the higher the intensity of drought the longer the duration and the lower the frequency of drought with the increase of drought intensity and duration maize yield decreased figs 15 and 16 the statistics of drought intensity were based on the negative run area of drought index the calculation methods of spei and swdi were different so the range of drought intensity was quite different and it cannot be compared quantitatively in the same drought duration agricultural drought corresponded to lower yields agricultural drought was directly related to soil water content in the case of low intensity and long duration meteorological drought if the initial soil moisture content was sufficient and the rainfall in the later period of drought was adequate the duration of agricultural drought was often lower than that of meteorological drought therefore the duration of agricultural drought was longer under the same crop yield statistically 4 conclusions the lag times of agricultural drought to meteorological drought under scenario 1 2 and 3 were 23 d 42 d and 30 d respectively both groundwater level rise and agricultural irrigation could effectively prolong the propagation time of meteorological drought to agricultural drought the lag time showed a significant upwards trend under scenario 1 and 2 from the factor contribution rate and cross wavelet analysis it can be derived that the increasing trend of ao and the decreasing trend of pdo caused the shortening of sunshine duration which was the key reason for the extension of drought propagation time comparing different drought response models it was concluded that the simulation effect of the logarithmic three parameter logarithmic function was the best the critical values for the duration and intensity under scenario 1 were 4 9 and 0 9 respectively the critical values under scenario 2 were 5 1 and 2 0 respectively indicating that the rise of the groundwater table to a suitable position could slow down the spread of drought irrigation and rising water tables increase corn yields by about 17 maize is most sensitive to water deficit at booting stage in the same drought duration agricultural drought corresponded to lower yields due to the overexploitation of groundwater the current groundwater depth in the shijin irrigation district is relatively deep to achieve sustainable development and ensure food production it is recommended that the government adopt relevant policies such as reducing groundwater exploitation or conducting groundwater recharge to raise the groundwater level according to the above studies the drought propagation time was within 20 40 d considering the critical point of drought response irrigation was recommended within 23 42 d after the occurrence of meteorological drought the direct cause of agricultural drought was the decrease of soil water content ren et al 2021 and zhang et al 2021 showed that mulching can effectively improve soil water content without damaging the annual balance of soil water storage therefore in depth research on relevant aspects can be conducted after the field data of mulching obtained which provide

9107,although wastewater irrigation has a long history involving different stages of development the future expectation to improve crop yield and water productivity in wastewater irrigation practices is still relevant therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate water productivity yield and crop quality of silage maize irrigated with different application levels 100 67 and 33 of irrigation need of recycled wastewater with three replicates in conventional tillage and zero tillage practices and comparing them with full fresh water irrigation the results of two year field studies showed that zero tillage resulted in saving 10 1 of irrigation water on average compared to conventional tillage and actual evapotranspiration in silage maize with zero tillage was 7 4 less biomass yield was the highest in full irrigation with wastewater under zero tillage zero tillage practice provided 12 0 and 13 2 higher water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity wpirrig respectively compared to conventional tillage the wp was higher in treatments with wastewater with 100 and 67 irrigation levels while the wpirrig was higher in treatment with wastewater with 67 irrigation level while the crop total soluble solids nutrients crude protein chlorophyll spad leaf area index and leaf relative water content lrwc values were higher in full irrigation with wastewater acid and neutral detergent fibers and membrane damage was lower crude protein in zero tillage was lower than in conventional tillage while spad and lrwc were higher it could be concluded that wastewater can increase silage maize biomass yield and crop quality this result may be more valuable in terms of both protecting scarce fresh water resources and contributing to the environment with waste disposal moreover 67 irrigation treatment with wastewater can be preferred for the higher wp and wpirrig values and zero tillage can be used as a practical treatment that contributes to the yield and water saving keywords deficit irrigation direct sowing forage yield treated wastewater water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction maize zea mays l is a c4 crop that makes good use of solar energy and produces high dry matter maize is very important in livestock feeding because of its high dry matter content and green forage yield as well as being suitable for silage production without the need for additives keskin et al 2018 in addition to its high nutritional properties the adaptability of maize to a wide range of climate and soil conditions makes it a good candidate for being a feed source for livestock shiferaw et al 2011 among cereals maize comes after wheat and paddy in terms of the total cultivated area in the world and ranks first in terms of total production maize production in the world covered an area of 201983645 ha in 2020 and the mean yield was 57547 kg ha 1 fao 2022 increasing demand for fresh water resources in the world and the increasing severity of drought by global warming raise great concerns in irrigated agricultural production in the mediterranean region especially the southern and eastern countries of this region face challenges in accessibility to fresh water resources due to fresh water scarcity and increased environmental risks unesco 2020 population growth and limited water resources can lead to a serious crisis in accessing fresh water in arid and semi arid areas of the world in the future yerli and sahin 2022a while the world s fresh water demand is expected to increase between 23 and 42 by 2050 burak and margat 2016 mancosu et al 2015 also stated that the amount of fresh water needed to meet the consumption should be 53 more considering that agriculture is the sector that consumes the largest amount of fresh water at the ratio of 69 fao 2020 it is urgent to protect fresh water resources and alleviate the water shortage using marginal water resources instead of fresh water in agricultural production turkey is a meditreenean country with an available potential of fresh water resouces amount to 112 billion m3 and a semi arid climate with 574 mm of annual precipitation this potential indicates a water deficiency considering the population of turkey which was approximately 85 million in 2021 and is expected to reach 100 million by 2040 dsi 2021 the increasing urbanization industrialization and change in lifestyle will trigger greater fresh water use and produce larger wastewater quantities in turkey 77 of scarce fresh water resources in turkey are used for agricultural irrigation dsi 2021 the amount of treated and discharged domestic wastewater is over 5 billion m3 year 1 tuik 2020 consequently there is an increasing trend to use recycled wastewater in agriculture in the country inadequate precipitation and high temperatures during the crop production season in the van region which was the study area with hot and dry summers located in eastern turkey led to the need for more irrigation to achieve high yields yerli and sahin 2022a the study region has experienced a rapid population growth with migration and the amount of freshwater per capita is rapidly decreasing especially during the last years therefore deficiencies of fresh water resources are seen as a factor that encourages the use of wastewater in near future yerli and sahin 2022a the use of wastewater for irrigation has the dual advantage of solving discharge problems as well as reducing the cost of chemical fertilizer depending on the nutrient content of the wastewater yerli et al 2022 significant organic matter and nutrient contents of wastewater support the increase in yield and quality in crop production by improving the properties of the soil cakmakci and sahin 2021b as a result of the improvement of soil productivity due to the release of macro and micro nutrients they contain kiziloglu et al 2008 2018 wastewater provides positive contributions to crop yield and quality tunc and sahin 2016 dogan demir and sahin 2017 cakmakci and sahin 2021b moraetis et al 2011 alkhamis et al 2017 and cakmakci and sahin 2021a also indicated that under wastewater irrigation the crop yield and quality of silage maize increased with improved soil fertility zero tillage saves irrigation water by reducing soil moisture loss gozubuyuk et al 2020 in addition zero tillage treatment contributes to the preservation or increase of soil organic matter stocks by reducing the oxidation of organic matter since the soil is not stirred and more plant residues are left on the soil surface yerli et al 2022 intensive tillage increases the mineralization processes of organic matter and n p and k contents however zero tillage not only protects organic matter and n p and k by reducing oxidation but also supports the recovery of more organic matter and n p and k from crop residues into the soil tabaglio et al 2009 he et al 2011 reported that organic matter n and p in the surface layer of no till soil increased by 16 1 31 0 and 29 6 respectively compared to conventional tillage and these increases improved the yields of wheat and maize by 3 5 and 1 4 respectively similarly da silva et al 2020 stated that the yield of maize increased by 17 due to the improved quality characteristics of no till soil compared to conventional tillage in a crop rotation including sorghum or soybean although water productivity can be improved in deficit irrigation conditions water shortage may reduce the yield of silage maize which is highly fertile under adequate irrigation conditions cakmakci and sahin 2021a drought reduces chlorophyll content membrane stability leaf area and relative water content thus these physiological responses can be practical indicators to evaluate yield sampathkumar et al 2014 however alkhamisi et al 2011 abdel latef and sallam 2015 and alkhamisi et al 2017 explained that wastewater irrigation can increase chlorophyll content similarly alkhamisi et al 2011 and mousavi and shahsavari 2014 also reported that leaf area can be increased improving water productivity by increasing crop productivity with less water in silage maize production is one of the most important expectations in previous studies this issue has been examined only within the scope of wastewater or different tillage and sowing practices however no studies in the literature are available on improving the yield and water productivity of silage maize by irrigation with different levels of wastewater under different tillage and sowing conditions in this context this study aims to examine the actual evapotranspiration and water use efficiency of silage maize irrigated with varying application levels of recycled wastewater under different tillage and sowing conditions and determine the changes in crop physical chemical and physiological properties that effect yield thus we tested the hypothesis that irrigation with wastewater under zero tillage could increase water use efficiency by decreasing crop water consumption as well as improve the yield and quality of silage maize in this study 2 material and methods 2 1 location climate and soil properties of the study area the study was carried out in van yuzuncu yil university faculty of agriculture experimental area 38 34 35 n 43 17 26 e with an altitude of 1670 m located in eastern turkey during the vegetation periods from may to september in 2020 and 2021 according to the weather data for many years 1991 2020 the experimental region has a semi arid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 410 2 mm july mean air temperature 22 7 c and total precipitation 7 9 mm and august mean air temperature 22 9 c and total precipitation 5 6 mm are the months with high temperatures and less precipitation in the region tsms 2022 the data of the climate station imetos 2 in the experimental area considering the monthly total precipitation evaporation and mean air temperature values for the production periods of 2020 and 2021 are shown in fig 1 the physicochemical characteristics of the test site soil prior to the experiment are given in table 1 it could be said that sandy clay loam textured soil has medium alkaline low organic matter content and medium lime content with no salinity problem 2 2 irrigation water resources and properties the tap water in van yuzuncu yil university was used for irrigation as a fresh water source the recycled wastewater was obtained from the discharge point of the biological waste water treatment plant 38 24 53 n 43 14 09 e located in the central edremit district of van province the inlet water of the biological wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 10400 m3 day contains domestic pollution elements coming from a residential area with a population of approximately 125000 since there are no important industrial facilities in the region the raw wastewater is free of industrial wastes raw wastewater from the sewerage network is transferred to the pre sedimentation and aeration ponds after being passed through a sand trap coarse and fine screen at the entrance to the facility the recycled wastewater which is aerated and passed through the bacteria pool leaves the facility after the final settling unit and is discharged into van lake the wastewater was taken from the discharge point of treatment plant with an irrigation tanker before each irrigation transported to the experimental area and used in irrigation after being transferred to polyethylene water tanks samples were taken from the water for each month during the irrigation periods and analyzed to determine the quality characteristics of the irrigation water details of the process procedures and methods for the analysis of the water used in the experiment are given by yerli and sahin 2022b based on the findings on the water analyses table 2 and according to national and international evaluations for soil crop and irrigation systems by yerli and sahin 2022b the water was safe for irrigation 2 3 irrigation system irrigation was carried out with a surface drip irrigation system driplines with 33 cm dripper intervals and a 2 3 l h 1 dripper flow rate in 0 1 mpa operation pressure were placed 70 cm intervals in each crop row driplines were connected to water tanks via manifold and main pipelines a control unit consisting of a centrifugal pump screen filter pressure regulator and manometer was positioned between the main pipe and the water tank the irrigation quantity was controlled with water meters placed at each plot inlet 2 4 experimental design the experiment was carried out according to the split plot experimental design in a random blocks experimental plan with three replications the main treatments were different tillage and sowing practices conventional tillage and zero tillage and sub treatments were different application levels of wastewater 100 67 33 of irrigation need and also full irrigation with fresh water as control treatment thus the total number of plots in the experimental area was twenty four and each experiment plot was arranged with dimensions of 3 5 m 7 2 m 25 2 m2 with 5 rows 70 cm 15 cm row spacing and crop spacing suppl 2 2 5 tillage and sowing cultural practices and irrigation treatments in conventional tillage practice the soil was ploughed with a mouldboard plough at a depth of 25 30 cm and then the clods formed in the soil were broken up using a cultivator rotary harrow and leveled finally the maize seeds cv ossk 644 were sown with a pneumatic seeder in zero tillage the sowing was carried out with the direct sowing machine on the same day as the conventional tillage during both years weeding was done manually using hoe for the conventional tillage the first weeding was carried out when the crop was 15 20 cm high and the second weeding as middle breaking when the crop height was 40 50 cm in zero tillage linuron and 2 4 d fluorosulan active ingredient herbicide was applied according to the weed type on the field during the first experimental year urea 45 46 n and triple super phosphate 43 46 p2o5 fertilizers were applied homogeneously to all plot surfaces at 100 kg ha 1 and 150 kg ha 1 doses respectively during sowing the second urea fertilization was applied to all plots by fertigation at a rate of 100 kg ha 1 when the crops reached the 4 6 leaf stage 40 50 cm height during the second experimental year fertilization was carried out in the plots where only fresh water was applied to evaluate the residual fertilizer effect of wastewater treatments from the previous year therefore tn and p2o5 analyzes were made on the surface layer of the fresh water plots during the sowing period a fertilizing of 67 kg ha 1 and 56 kg ha 1 urea and 65 kg ha 1 and 60 kg ha 1 triple super phosphate were added to the fresh water plots of conventional tillage and zero tillage practices respectively during the second year as in the first year of the experiment the second dose of urea fertilization was carried out by fertigation in an amount equal to the first dose in the fresh water plots at the middle breaking stage when the crops reached the 4 6 leaf stage irrigation was applied with fresh water in all plots during both trial years until the crop heights reached 40 50 cm 4 6 leaf stage the irrigation for the remainder of the season the second irrigation period was continued with three different application levels 100 67 and 33 of wastewater in wastewater plots while fresh water plots were irrigated with an application level of 100 fresh water in this study an irrigation schedule which considered crop evapotranspiration etc calculated with real time climatic data was practiced to determine irrigation starting times irrigations was applied when the amount of σ etc precipitation reached 40 of available soil moisture soil depths were considered as 30 and 90 cm for the first and second irrigation periods respectively the values corresponding to 40 of available soil moisture were 19 1 mm for 30 cm soil depth and 59 5 mm for 90 cm soil depth table 1 etc was calculated with the following equation 1 etc eto kc where etc is the crop evapotranspiration eto is the reference crop evapotranspiration and kc is the crop coefficient the eto was calculated with the penman monteith fao approach in the cropwat program the climate data required in the calculations were obtained daily from the climate station imetos 2 in the experimental area the crop coefficient kc values for silage maize in the van region conditions were taken from a guide crop water consumption guide for irrigated crops in turkey published by the ministry of agriculture and forestry general directorate of agricultural research and policies tagem 2017 the total eto etc and precipitation values during the vegetation period of 2020 were determined as 801 1 mm 695 0 mm and 37 0 mm respectively and 739 8 mm 639 7 mm and 52 1 mm for the 2021 vegetation period fig 2 irrigation quantities applied were calculated with eq 2 and 3 in conventional and direct sowing practices kanber and unlu 2010 2 i fc cm γs d w 10 3 v i a where i is the irrigation quantity needed for

periods during each trial year respectively while all of the water calculated with the above equations was applicated to the 100 plots deficit irrigation plots were irrigated with two different levels 67 and 33 of this water amount a total of 13 and 12 irrigations were applied in 2020 and 2021 respectively the first 4 irrigations during both years were carried out with fresh water equally for all plots the total water amounts applied during this first period of irrigations were 20 2 mm in 2020 and 21 5 mm in 2021 in the experiment the mean irrigation interval was 9 days irrigation intervals shortened in july and august fig 2 when the air temperatures were high fig 1 the seasonal irrigation quantities applied to different irrigation treatments in two tillages and sowing practices are shown in table 3 2 6 soil moisture measurements and actual evapotranspiration the soil moisture measurements were carried out at a distance of about 15 20 cm from the drippers between two crops in the center of the plot in the middle replication plots during the sowing harvesting and before each irrigation while the soil moisture measurements were carried out at 0 30 cm soil layer with an hd2 mobile device tdr trime pico iph t3 imko the gravimetric method was used for 30 60 and 60 90 cm soil layers eq 4 was used to calculate the actual evapotranspiration of silage maize allen et al 1998 4

amount of runoff mm and δs is the change in soil moisture content in the soil layer at 0 90 cm mm the pluviometer data of the climate station imetos 2 established in the experimental area were used for precipitation capillary rise was not taken into consideration since the ground water table was rather deep in the experimental field it was determined that there was no deep percolation in gravimetric moisture measurements at 90 120 cm since the dripper flow rate suitable for the infiltration rate of the soil was selected there was no water loss with the runoff 2 7 water productivity and irrigation water productivity while water productivity evaluates the yielding change against seasonal actual evapotranpiration which is determined by the sum of the irrigation quantity precipitation and the change soil water storage irrigation water productivity only indicates the yielding change against seasonal irrigation quantity cakmakci and sahin 2021a as the contribution of irrigation to water consumption increases these values get closer to each other eq 5 and 6 were used to determine water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity wpirrig howell 2001 5 wp y 10

plot was measured at harvest via meter and digital caliper respectively esiyok et al 2004 likewise thirty crops in the center were cut from the soil surface and weighed and then adapted to the unit area ha thus fresh biomass yields were obtained cakmakci and sahin 2021a the weighed fresh crops were air dried and then oven dried at 78 c for 48 h the dry matter ratio was calculated by dividing the dry weight with the wet weight and finally this ratio value was multiplied with the fresh biomass yield to determine the dry matter yield kacar 2014 the milky endosperm liquid of the grains in the middle of the harvested crop cobs was dripped on the refractometer and the reading was taken from the refractometer to determine total soluble solids brix esiyok et al 2004 acid detergent fiber adf and neutral detergent fiber ndf were carried out in ankom 200 fiber analyzer according to the fiber bag system gerhardt developed by modifying the van soest analysis method van soest 1963 while the n in the milled crop samples was determined by the kjeldahl method kacar 2014 the crude protein ratio was calculated from the crop n content with a standard coefficient raju 1979 the crop p content was determined colorimetrically in the solution obtained with the burning process kacar 2014 an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes device was used to determine ca mg na and k in the crop anonymous 2007 the chlorophyll content was determined by the spad 502 chlorophyllmeter device between 10 00 and 14 00 h when the photosynthetic activity was higher from the leaves in the middle of randomly selected six crops from each plot approximately coinciding halfway between two irrigations tunali et al 2012 the leaf area index was determined by measuring all the leaves of six crops at harvest maturity with a leaf area meter licor li 3000 c and measurement values divided by the unit area of a crop 70 cm 15 cm stewart and dwyer 1999 membrane damage was determined on the basis of measuring the electrolyte leakage coming out of the leaf cells jamei et al 2009 and for this purpose 10 mm diameter disc samples were taken from the lower 2nd and 3rd leaves of six crops from each plot placed in 50 µl test tubes and incubated with 30 µl distilled water at room temperature for 24 h after which the ec value was measured ec1 the same samples were incubated in a water bath at 95 c for 20 min to release all electrolytes and the ec value was measured again after cooling at room temperature ec2 the membrane damage was obtained as a percentage ec1 ec2 eq 7 was used to determine the leaf relative water content by taking six leaf samples from each plot benešová et al 2012 7 lrwc fw dw tw dw 100 where lrwc is the leaf relative water content fw is the fresh weight of a leaf g dw is the dry weight of a leaf oven dried at 65 c for 24 h g and tw is the turgid weight of a leaf after it has been kept in distilled water for 4 h g 2 9 data analysis statistical analyzes were carried out using the spss program ver 23 tillage and sowing and irrigation practices were considered as fixed factors and the data were evaluated with general linear model analysis and comparisons were made with duncan multiple comparison test at 5 probability level for the means found significant correlograms with scatter plot correlation coefficient and variable distribution were created by using the rstudio program for the correlation relationships 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation quantity in zero tillage irrigation water savings were between 9 1 and 10 3 during the first year and between 9 8 and 11 2 in the second year compared to conventional tillage table 3 this situation can be evaluated as a result of crop residue management in zero tillage it is thought that the requirement for irrigation water decreases as a result of the decrease in evaporation due to the crop residues left on the soil surface in zero tillage compared to intensive tillage the higher soil moisture contents also confirm less evaporation in zero tillage fig 3 many researchers have stated that the irrigation quantity applied decreases with the reduction of evaporation in zero tillage ma et al 2015 mishra and kushwaha 2016 qi et al 2018 gozubuyuk et al 2020 burke et al 2021 in addition water loss from the soil by evaporation may vary depending on the pore size distribution and connectivity as well as the total porosity which varies according to tillage practices although lower porosity values were determined under zero tillage conditions 51 3 compared to conventional tillage 52 1 in this study an increase in water retention fig 3 probably due to the increased micropores which may have supported the decrease in water loss by evaporation was noted similarly ghosh et al 2020 reported that porosity and maximum connected pores were higher in conventional tillage lower porosity was seen in no till practice and conservation tillage also increased the microporosity that provides water retention in the soil 3 2 soil moisture content and actual evapotranspiration the soil moisture contents measured during sowing harvesting and before each irrigation at 90 cm soil depth in different treatments throughout vegetation periods in 2020 and 2021 are given fig 3 it was seen that the soil moisture content was higher in the zero tillage practice during both years soil moisture content values were close to the soil moisture depletion fraction 40 of available water content in full irrigation treatments with wastewater and fresh water but soil moisture contents approached the wilting point towards the end of the vegetation period in deficit irrigation treatments and resulted in extra stress actual evapotranspiration eta values of silage maize in irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments in 2020 and 2021 are shown fig 4 due to the low precipitation during the vegetation periods figs 1 and 2 the irrigation water amount constituted the most important component of evapotranspiration in the full irrigation treatments therefore eta values in full irrigation treatments with wastewater and fresh water were found to be similar as a result of equal irrigation quantity table 3 as the mean of two experimental years 19 3 and 38 3 lower eta values were determined at 67 and 33 irrigation levels in conventional tillage compared to full irrigation respectively and 19 5 and 36 0 lower in zero tillage the eta values were found to be between 5 2 and 10 3 lower during the first year and 5 4 and 8 6 lower during the second year in zero tillage compared to conventional tillage the lower eta values in zero tillage practice can be evaluated as a result of less irrigation water table 3 djaman et al 2018 also indicated a high correlation of seasonal evapotranspiration of maize grown in semi arid conditions with the irrigation quantity in a previous study similar to this study in the same region the eta values of silage maize were specified as 416 mm 330 mm and 255 mm for 100 67 and 33 irrigation levels respectively under conventional tillage cakmakci and sahin 2021a the eta values in this study were lower than the 601 mm evapotranspiration value determined for silage maize fully irrigated with a mobile sprinkler irrigation system in a region with a semi arid climate at high altitude kiziloglu et al 2009 and also the 526 mm evapotranspiration value determined for silage maize fully irrigated with a surface drip system ors et al 2015 there are also many different studies showing that the evapotranspiration values of silage maize which are fully irrigated by the surface drip method vary between 635 mm and 975 mm dagdelen et al 2009 simsek et al 2011 ucak et al 2016 however in a different region with a similar altitude a lower evapotranspiration value of 351 mm was reported in silage maize cultivation under full irrigation conditions with the surface drip method nilahyane et al 2020 therefore it could be said that the eta findings can vary according to regional climate changes and different irrigation practices 3 3 water productivity and irrigation water productivity the change of water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity wpirrig in irrigation and tillage and sowing practices were determined as significant p 0 001 fig 5 and suppl 1 the higher wp values were obtained with 100 and 67 irrigation treatments with wastewater and the highest wpirrig value was determined in irrigation with the wastewater at the level of 67 in addition wp and wpirrig values in the zero tillage practice were found to be higher than in the conventional tillage wp and wpirrig values in full irrigation with wastewater were 11 0 and 11 6 higher respectively compared to full irrigation with fresh water the similar eta fig 4 and irrigation quantities table 3 in the full irrigation treatments with wastewater and fresh water showed that the higher wp and wpirrig values under wastewater irrigation were due to increased yield with the nutritive effect of the wastewater many studies have reported increased wp and wpirrig values as a result of the increase in yield in irrigation with wastewater hassanli et al 2009 alkhamisi et al 2011 2017 tunc and sahin 2016 hajihashemi et al 2020 cakmakci and sahin 2021a the wp value decreased significantly as a result of the significant yield loss at the 33 irrigation level table 4 yield loss at the 67 irrigation level was lower and the increased wp values with the effect of the decreased eta provided similarity to those in full irrigation with wastewater the higher wpirrig values in the 67 irrigation treatment also were the result of decreased irrigation quantity table 4 as parallel to this study findings ucak et al 2016 determined the highest wpirrig value at a 70 irrigation level in silage maize irrigated by the drip irrigation method the hypothesis valid for wp is based on increased yield with increased water use therefore the increase in wp with the irrigation water level indicates that the increase in yield is supported by irrigation bouazzama et al 2012 significant p 0 001 linear increases in wp with the increase in yield and irrigation quantity were also determined in this study fig 6 however payero et al 2008 stated that the wp value of maize increases non linearly with water consumption and yield basso and ritchie 2018 also stated that maize productivity could be increased without a change in the water use rate resulting in increased wp in addition many studies have demonstrated that deficit irrigation increases wp and wpirrig values dagdelen et al 2006 igbadun et al 2008 kiziloglu et al 2009 ucak et al 2011 bouazzama et al 2012 kuscu naghashzadeh et al 2014 2015 cakmakci and sahin 2021a in zero tillage 12 1 and 13 2 higher wp and wpirrig values were obtained respectively compared to conventional tillage this can be explained by less irrigation quantity table 3 and lower crop water consumption fig 4 and a higher yield table 4 in zero tillage compared to conventional tillage many studies have also shown that the increase in wp and wpirrig values were due to decreasing irrigation quantity and increasing yield in zero tillage practice zhang et al 2013 guan et al 2014 wang et al 2018 hou and li 2019 gozubuyuk et al 2020 3 4 yield and yield components in silage maize the crop heights of silage maize were significantly p 0 001 different in irrigation treatments and the highest value was determined in full wastewater irrigation table 4 and suppl 1 the crop height of forage maize increases significantly with n content in soil carpici et al 2010 therefore it could be said that the higher crop heights in full wastewater irrigation compared to fresh water is related to the high n content of the wastewater table 2 the low crop heights in the deficit wastewater irrigation could be explained with decreased water entry into the soil and thus nutrients similarly selim 2008 reported that the increase in crop height in wastewater irrigation conditions was due to the high nutrient contribution many studies have shown that crop heights were higher in wastewater irrigation conditions khan et al 2009 abegunrin et al 2013 hirich et al 2014 alghobar and suresha 2016 alkhamisi et al 2017 cakmakci and sahin 2021a and lower in deficit irrigation conditions simsek et al 2011 bouazzama et al 2012 ertek and kara 2013 gonulal and soylu 2019 bhattarai et al 2020 the change in stem diameter was found significant in irrigation p 0 001 and tillage and sowing p 0 05 treatments table 4 and suppl 1 a positive correlation p 0 001 was determined between crop height and stem diameter fig 6 therefore it could be argued that a larger stem diameter with full wastewater promoted higher crop height while the low crop heights in deficit irrigation was related to smaller stem diameters table 4 the effect of n intake on the increase of stem diameter can also be mentioned here both soil water content and its chemical composition may have affected crop growth by inducing n uptake by plants in full wastewater irrigation similarly aynehband et al 2011 mentioned a significant relationship between soil moisture content and n uptake carpici et al 2010 also stated that the stem diameter variation may be due to n fertilization similarly kale et al 2018 reported that the stem diameter increased with the increase of n the higher n content of zero tillage soil 0 110 compared to conventional tillage 0 102 may explain the higher stem diameter in zero tillage practice these study results were parallelled by mousavi and shahsavari 2014 who expressed that stem diameter increased in wastewater irrigation conditions compared to fresh water while aikins et al 2012 reported that reduced tillage improved crop growth parameters by increasing soil fertility fresh biomass yield has changed significantly p 0 001 in irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments table 4 and suppl 1 fresh biomass yield was 11 3 higher in wastewater under full irrigation conditions compared to fresh water while fresh biomass yield decreased by 19 4 and 62 3 in 67 and 33 irrigation treatments compared to full irrigation in addition fresh biomass yield was 3 higher under zero tillage conditions than conventional tillage the positive correlations p 0 001 determined between crop heights and stem diameters with the fresh biomass yields fig 6 showed that the increase in crop height and stem diameter could be the main reason for higher yield the increased fresh biomass yield in wastewater irrigation conditions compared to irrigation with fresh water can be explained by the direct fertilization effect caused by the high nutrient content of wastewater table 2 similarly some researchers have reported that the high nutrient content of wastewater improves yield with the fertilization effect mousavi and shahsavari 2014 becerra castro et al 2015 tunc and sahin 2016 2021a the decrease in fresh biomass yield with the decrease of the irrigation level can be evaluated as related to the weakening of crop root growth and the inability of the crop to take nutrients sufficiently due to the decrease in water entry into the soil the positive correlation p 0 001 of irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration with fresh biomass yield also supports this argument fig 6 mengu and ozgurel 2008 also stated that there was a high positive correlation between the irrigation quantity and yield in silage maize yolcu and cetin 2015 indicated that the fresh biomass yield increased significantly by increasing the irrigation quantity and increasing soil n content crop growth and biomass are also reduced due to reduced photosynthetically active radiation and radiation utilization efficiency under deficit irrigation conditions gomaa et al 2021 as can be seen from table 7 spad values which are a good photosynthetic indicator decreased significantly with the deficit irrigation treatments in addition other physiological and photosynthetic properties of the crop are among the parameters that provide additional contributions to the interpretation of fresh biomass yield fig 6 shows the positive correlations p 0 001 of fresh biomass yield with spad leaf relative water content and leaf area index while the negative correlation p 0 001 indicates membrane damage similarly camoglu et al 2011 and karasu et al 2015 reported high correlations between the fresh biomass yield and the physiological parameters of the maize crop previous studies have reported that yield decreases occur under deficit irrigation conditions with wastewater tunc and sahin 2016 dogan demir and sahin 2017 cakmakci and sahin 2021a in addition it has been stated by other researchers that there are significant yield losses due to the decrease in the irrigation water level in silage maize payero et al 2008 ariturk and erdem 2011 rusere et al 2012 djaman et al 2013 depending on the crop residue management in zero tillage the return of crop residues to the soil as organic matter and n may explain the increased fresh biomass yield under zero tillage conditions in addition higher soil moisture values in zero tillage fig 3 may have contributed to yield by reducing stress nouri et al 2019 explained that the increase in crop yield in zero tillage is associated with higher organic matter and n contribution and also with the longer preservation of soil moisture content in zero tillage da silva et al 2020 reported that zero tillage increased yields by 6 in soybean 100 in sorghum and 17 in maize compared to conventional tillage in addition many studies have reported that yield increases were determined under zero tillage conditions de vita et al 2007 he et al 2011 buah et al 2017 si et al 2018 naeem et al 2021 the effects of irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments on dry biomass yield was significant p 0 001 table 4 and suppl 1 dry biomass yield changes due to irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments were similar to fresh biomass yield changes and a positive correlation p 0 001 was determined between dry biomass yield and fresh biomass yield fig 6 while 10 1 more dry biomass yield was obtained with wastewater compared to fresh water under full irrigation conditions dry biomass yield was 7 7 higher under zero tillage conditions than conventional tillage similar to the findings of this study alkhamis et al 2017 expressed that maize irrigated with wastewater had a higher dry biomass yield than irrigation with fresh water cakmakci and sahin 2021 also reported that dry biomass yield was higher in wastewater irrigation than fresh water and dry biomass yield decreased with deficit irrigation and the changes in dry biomass yield were directly related to fresh biomass yield the decrease in dry biomass yield with the increase of the irrigation water deficit could also be supported by the positive correlations p 0 001 of irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration with dry biomass yield fig 6 similarly yolcu and cetin 2015 indicated that there is a positive correlation between the water use of silage maize and dry biomass yield aydinsakir et al 2013 and kale et al 2018 also stated that dry biomass yield decreased due to water stress in silage maize the positive correlation p 0 001 of spad and the leaf area index with dry biomass yield was also determined in this study fig 6 gomaa et al 2021 demonstrated that the decreased photosynthetic level with the decrease in the metabolic activity and the chlorophyll content of maize in the leaves under insufficient soil water conditions can reduce the dry biomass yield bouazzama et al 2012 also reported that crop growth was negatively affected due to water scarcity and dry biomass yield decreased as a result of the decrease in the leaf area index it is thought that dry biomass yield increases as a result of the organic matter and n contribution from increased crop residues in zero tillage table 4 gozubuyuk et al 2020 recorded increases in yield parameters as a result of the n contribution of crop residues to the soil in zero tillage farhad et al 2011 reported that the increase of n in the soil increased the dry biomass yield in maize while yolcu and cetin 2015 stated that increasing n doses supported dry matter accumulation in silage maize kale et al 2018 on the contrary indicated that dry biomass yield decreased with increased n fertilization 3 5 quality properties and macronutrient contents in silage maize a significant p 0 001 change for total soluble solids tss was determined only in irrigation treatments table 5 and suppl 1 the increased tss in wastewater irrigation can be related to the rich n and p content of wastewater table 2 kovacs and gyuricza 2012 reported that the increase in n and p supports the increase in tss in addition the increase in tss in irrigation with wastewater can be related to the high salinity content of wastewater table 2 yurtseven et al 2005 stated that tss increased with the effect of increasing irrigation water salinity decreased tss values with the decrease of irrigation quantity were evaluated as related to the inability of the crop to get enough nutrients from the soil due to the decrease in water entry into the soil acar et al 2008 and polat et al 2008 also stated that the decrease in irrigation level reduces tss the change for acid detergent fiber adf and neutral detergent fiber ndf were significant p 0 001 only in irrigation treatments table 5 and suppl 1 adf and ndf values were lower in full irrigation with wastewater and increased with the increasing water deficit adf and ndf are important quality parameters to evaluate the digestibility and energy intake of feed products in livestock feeding adf represents cellulose and lignins which are difficult to digest and ndf represents fibrous carbohydrates of the cell wall such as cellulose and hemicellulose lignin some proteins and silicon canbolat 2019 high adf causes a decrease in quality due to the increase in fiber content and high ndf causes insufficient feeding with a low dry matter effect as a result of reduced intake due to rumen filling keskin et al 2018 nrc 2001 stated that adf and ndf values should be below 25 0 and 45 8 respectively for good feed quality in this study it was determined that the values of adf and ndf were below these recommended values only under full irrigation conditions with wastewater under wastewater irrigation conditions lower adf and ndf values were considered to be associated with the higher n content of wastewater irrigated crops table 6 the negative correlations p 0 001 of adf and ndf with crop n content also support this fig 6 carpici et al 2010 kaplan et al 2016 and kale et al 2018 reported that increasing n content in silage maize decreased adf and ndf values safdarian et al 2014 expressed the negative relationship of n with adf and ndf as a result of the crops taking n being physiologically active for a longer period of time and the decrease in adf and ndf due to the delayed maturation of the crop at the same time considering the negative correlations p 0 001 of adf and ndf with crop height stem diameter fresh and dry biomass yields fig 6 it can be stated that adf and ndf decrease with the increase of crop growth similarly cacan et al 2018 expressed the negative correlations of ndf with crop height and of adf with fresh biomass yield in vetch crops while mut and erbas kose 2018 indicated the negative correlations of adf with crop height and adf and ndf with grain yield in triticale crops adf and ndf values increased with decreasing irrigation quantity and the highest adf and ndf values were obtained at with the 33 irrigation treatment the negative correlation p 0 001 of adf and ndf with irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration were also determined and indicated in fig 6 carpici et al 2017 reported that similar correlations were obtained and that the adf and ndf values increased depending on the decrease in the irrigation quantity the change of crude protein ratio was significant p 0 001 in irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments table 5 and suppl 1 while wastewater irrigation increased the crude protein the crude protein decreased with the increase of irrigation water stress and also increased in conventional tillage compared to zero tillage the increase in wastewater irrigation can be explained by the high n content of wastewater table 2 similarly alkhamis et al 2011 reported that the crude protein in silage maize irrigated with wastewater was 13 higher compared to silage maize irrigated with fresh water and this increase was associated with the high n content of wastewater it was also determined in another study that the crude protein in the maize grain increased with the increase in the amount of n kale et al 2018 tarighaleslami et al 2012 and aydinsakir et al 2013 stated that the crude protein decreased in water stress and this situation is related to the insufficient nutrient uptake of the crop the higher n content of the crop in conventional tillage practice table 6 also resulted in a higher crude protein ratio compared to zero tillage while irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments had a significant p 0 001 effect on the n content of silage maize p k ca mg and na contents were changed significantly p 0 001 with only irrigation treatments table 6 and suppl 1 the crop macronutrient content increased in irrigation with wastewater compared to irrigation with fresh water while it decreased with deficit irrigation and also only the n content increased in conventional tillage compared to zero tillage similarly cakmakci and sahin 2021a indicated that the crop macronutrient content in silage maize grown under wastewater irrigation conditions were significantly higher than silage maize grown with fresh water since wastewater contains considerable levels of many nutrients compared to fresh water in addition the results of many studies have revealed that due to the high nutrient content of wastewater it increases the accumulation of macro and micro elements in the crop and accumulates in the soil kiziloglu et al 2008 masona et al 2011 avci and deveci 2013 kobaissi et al 2014 ma et al 2015 nzediegwu et al 2019 hajihashemi et al 2020 fattahi et al 2020 the decreased crop macronutrient contents with increased water deficit can be explained by the decrease in nutrient uptake by plants with the effect of less water in the soil as well as less nutrient accumulation in the soil from wastewater it is likely that increases in crop nutrient uptake occur with increased transpiration in silage maize cakmakci and sahin 2021a expressed that the macroelement contents of the crop decreased due to the increase in water scarcity in silage maize under wastewater irrigation conditions in addition it has been stated in many studies that the macro and micro element contents crops decrease due to the increase in water stress kuslu et al 2008 simsek et al 2011 kuscu et al 2014 dogan demir and sahin 2017 in general macronutrient contents were found similar in silage maize in tillage and sowing practices however the higher n content in conventional tillage may be related to increased crop n uptake due to higher crop water consumption in conventional tillage fig 4 similarly guan et al 2014 indicated that root growth is higher in conventional tillage conditions compared to zero tillage and good root development can increase n uptake with more water uptake from the soil it is also mentioned that soil aeration is sufficient for a crop to absorb macro and micro elements abuarab et al 2019 soil aeration promotes root growth and spread thereby increasing the crop s potential to utilize irrigation water therefore it can be stated that increased soil aeration in conventional tillage may have increased n uptake 3 6 physiological properties in silage maize chlorophyll content spad changed significantly p 0 001 with irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments table 7 and suppl 1 while the highest spad values were obtained in full irrigation treatment with wastewater spad values decreased due to increasing water stress and spad values were higher in zero tillage compared to conventional tillage higher spad values in full irrigation with wastewater may be due to the increased rate of chlorophyll biosynthesis from wastewater abdel latef and sallam 2015 in this case the association of higher spad values with the fe content of wastewater table 2 can be considered in wastewater treatments rout and sahoo 2015 fe is an important nutrient in both chloroplast formation and protein development yerli et al 2020 in addition n is also a component of chlorophyll since n deficiency reduces the chlorophyll concentration in leaves the n content of wastewater table 2 can be seen as one of the important factors supporting the increase in spad in leaves liu et al 2018 since maize a c4 crop has more photosynthetic activity compared to other crops it can metabolize high levels of n from wastewater alkhamisi et al 2011 in many studies it has been determined that the spad values were found to be higher in wastewater irrigation conditions than fresh water irrigation alkhamisi et al 2011 petousi et al 2015 cakmakci and sahin 2021a bauerle et al 2004 stated that spad content is a clear indicator of crop water stress this approach explains the significant decrease in spad values with increasing irrigation water deficit in this study it has also been determined in many studies that the spad values decreased due to the increase in water stress tunc and sahin 2016 dogan demir and sahin 2017 soureshjani et al 2019 cakmakci and sahin 2021a camoglu et al 2011 found that spad values decreased with decreasing in the irrigation water level and carroll et al 2017 expressed that drought managed crops had lower chlorophyll content than crops managed with full irrigation the higher soil n content 0 110 in zero tillage compared to conventional tillage 0 102 can be the reason for the higher spad values jános 2010 stated that there is a high correlation between soil n content and spad values liu and wiatrak 2011 confirmed the same correlative relationship and also pointed out that zero tillage in silage maize significantly increased spad values leaf area index lai increased significantly p 0 001 in wastewater irrigation compared to fresh water irrigation while lai decreased due to increased water stress table 7 and suppl 1 it could be said that the increased lai in irrigation with wastewater is due to the n contribution to the soil from wastewater table 2 alkhamis et al 2011 stated that lai is highly correlated with the n content in the crop and that high n content of wastewater increases lai similarly the positive correlation p 0 001 was determined between lai and crop n content in this study fig 6 in addition many studies have reported that lai increases due to the high nutrient content of wastewater alkhamisi et al 2011 abegunrin et al 2013 paudel et al 2018 cakmakci and sahin 2021a due to the decrease in soil water content the crop s inability to get enough nutrients from the soil to maintain its vital activities has reduced lai ozturk 2015 reported that the slowdown of metabolic activities in the crop due to deficit irrigation negatively affects the physiological formations and the number of leaves and leaf area decreases with increasing stress and then the crop growth may stop completely in addition many studies have mentioned that lai decreases with increasing water stress camoglu et al 2011 bouazzama et al 2012 rusere et al 2012 djaman et al 2013 haffani et al 2014 tabatabaei et al 2017 although lai changes with the effect of many factors such as water and nutrient deficiency and toxic effects the increase in lai is important in terms of photosynthesis and yield increase under normal conditions therefore lai can be considered an important yield indicator kaya 2011 in this study positive correlations p 0 001 of lai with irrigation quantity evapotranspiration spad crop height stem diameter fresh and dry biomass yields can also be seen as an important result fig 6 leaf relative water content lrwc changed significantly p 0 001 in irrigation and tillage and sowing p 0 05 treatments table 7 and suppl 1 in full irrigation condition lrwc values were found similar in waste and fresh water irrigation treatments depending on the equal irrigation quantity table 3 while lrwc decreased with increasing water stress lrwc was also higher in zero tillage than conventional tillage the increase in lrwc with increasing irrigation water level and crop water consumption was also supported by the positive correlations p 0 001 of lrwc with irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration fig 6 cakmakci and sahin 2021a also reported that increased water stress in both waste and fresh water irrigation conditions reduced lrwc in silage maize and significant positive correlations were determined for lrwc with irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration sampathkumar et al 2014 expressed that water stress reduced lrwc in maize and that lrwc was higher in maize leaves irrigated adequately than in stressed maize leaves nilahyane et al 2020 stated that there were significant decreases in lrwc in silage maize with the effect of drought stress similarly higher levels and longer retention of soil moisture under zero tillage conditions fig 3 may explain the increased lrwc under zero tillage conditions compared to conventional tillage irrigation treatments significantly p 0 001 affected membrane damage md table 7 and suppl 1 while the md increased in wastewater irrigation compared to fresh water irrigation this increase was higher in deficit irrigation treatments the higher md in wastewater irrigation could be associated with the salt content of the wastewater table 2 similarly yakit and tuna 2006 stated that salinity increases md in maize in addition it has been mentioned in studies conducted in many different crops that cell membrane systems are damaged due to salinity onal and uney 2016 deveci and tugrul 2017 kabay and alp 2017 water stress affects the cell membrane structure of the crop and impairs its function which leads to significant increases in md yildirim et al 2021 therefore it can be said that the md increasing effect of water stress is due to the decrease in lrwc table 7 the negative correlation p 0 001 between md and lrwc also supports this fig 6 ozturk 2015 stated that stomata are closed with the decrease of lrwc in crops experiencing water stress and as a result cell membrane systems are damaged and cell death occurs with increasing leaf temperature 4 conclusion the findings obtained from this study showed that zero tillage saves an average of 10 1 in irrigation quantity for silage maize compared to conventional tillage while the evapotranspiration was 7 4 lower full irrigation with wastewater increased the crop height and stem diameter of silage maize resulting in greater fresh and dry biomass yields the yield was further increased under zero tillage conditions the increased yield and reduced irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration in zero tillage provided 12 0 and 13 2 higher wp and wpirrig respectively while the higher wp values were determined in 100 and 67 irrigation levels with wastewater the highest wpirrig was found in the 67 irrigation level in addition full irrigation with wastewater provided higher total soluble solids brix macronutrients crude protein chlorophyll content leaf area index and leaf relative water content and lower acid and neutral detergent fibers and membrane damage while protein content in zero tillage was lower and chlorophyll content and leaf relative water content were higher it could be concluded that recycled domestic wastewater can be used considering the effect of increasing crop yield and water productivity for silage maize cultivation directly sown in semi arid regions moreover irrigation at the level of 67 with recycled wastewater under zero tillage may be a better practice to obtain higher water and irrigation water productivities funding our thanks to the scientific and technological research council of turkey tubitak for financially supporting this

9107,although wastewater irrigation has a long history involving different stages of development the future expectation to improve crop yield and water productivity in wastewater irrigation practices is still relevant therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate water productivity yield and crop quality of silage maize irrigated with different application levels 100 67 and 33 of irrigation need of recycled wastewater with three replicates in conventional tillage and zero tillage practices and comparing them with full fresh water irrigation the results of two year field studies showed that zero tillage resulted in saving 10 1 of irrigation water on average compared to conventional tillage and actual evapotranspiration in silage maize with zero tillage was 7 4 less biomass yield was the highest in full irrigation with wastewater under zero tillage zero tillage practice provided 12 0 and 13 2 higher water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity wpirrig respectively compared to conventional tillage the wp was higher in treatments with wastewater with 100 and 67 irrigation levels while the wpirrig was higher in treatment with wastewater with 67 irrigation level while the crop total soluble solids nutrients crude protein chlorophyll spad leaf area index and leaf relative water content lrwc values were higher in full irrigation with wastewater acid and neutral detergent fibers and membrane damage was lower crude protein in zero tillage was lower than in conventional tillage while spad and lrwc were higher it could be concluded that wastewater can increase silage maize biomass yield and crop quality this result may be more valuable in terms of both protecting scarce fresh water resources and contributing to the environment with waste disposal moreover 67 irrigation treatment with wastewater can be preferred for the higher wp and wpirrig values and zero tillage can be used as a practical treatment that contributes to the yield and water saving keywords deficit irrigation direct sowing forage yield treated wastewater water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction maize zea mays l is a c4 crop that makes good use of solar energy and produces high dry matter maize is very important in livestock feeding because of its high dry matter content and green forage yield as well as being suitable for silage production without the need for additives keskin et al 2018 in addition to its high nutritional properties the adaptability of maize to a wide range of climate and soil conditions makes it a good candidate for being a feed source for livestock shiferaw et al 2011 among cereals maize comes after wheat and paddy in terms of the total cultivated area in the world and ranks first in terms of total production maize production in the world covered an area of 201983645 ha in 2020 and the mean yield was 57547 kg ha 1 fao 2022 increasing demand for fresh water resources in the world and the increasing severity of drought by global warming raise great concerns in irrigated agricultural production in the mediterranean region especially the southern and eastern countries of this region face challenges in accessibility to fresh water resources due to fresh water scarcity and increased environmental risks unesco 2020 population growth and limited water resources can lead to a serious crisis in accessing fresh water in arid and semi arid areas of the world in the future yerli and sahin 2022a while the world s fresh water demand is expected to increase between 23 and 42 by 2050 burak and margat 2016 mancosu et al 2015 also stated that the amount of fresh water needed to meet the consumption should be 53 more considering that agriculture is the sector that consumes the largest amount of fresh water at the ratio of 69 fao 2020 it is urgent to protect fresh water resources and alleviate the water shortage using marginal water resources instead of fresh water in agricultural production turkey is a meditreenean country with an available potential of fresh water resouces amount to 112 billion m3 and a semi arid climate with 574 mm of annual precipitation this potential indicates a water deficiency considering the population of turkey which was approximately 85 million in 2021 and is expected to reach 100 million by 2040 dsi 2021 the increasing urbanization industrialization and change in lifestyle will trigger greater fresh water use and produce larger wastewater quantities in turkey 77 of scarce fresh water resources in turkey are used for agricultural irrigation dsi 2021 the amount of treated and discharged domestic wastewater is over 5 billion m3 year 1 tuik 2020 consequently there is an increasing trend to use recycled wastewater in agriculture in the country inadequate precipitation and high temperatures during the crop production season in the van region which was the study area with hot and dry summers located in eastern turkey led to the need for more irrigation to achieve high yields yerli and sahin 2022a the study region has experienced a rapid population growth with migration and the amount of freshwater per capita is rapidly decreasing especially during the last years therefore deficiencies of fresh water resources are seen as a factor that encourages the use of wastewater in near future yerli and sahin 2022a the use of wastewater for irrigation has the dual advantage of solving discharge problems as well as reducing the cost of chemical fertilizer depending on the nutrient content of the wastewater yerli et al 2022 significant organic matter and nutrient contents of wastewater support the increase in yield and quality in crop production by improving the properties of the soil cakmakci and sahin 2021b as a result of the improvement of soil productivity due to the release of macro and micro nutrients they contain kiziloglu et al 2008 2018 wastewater provides positive contributions to crop yield and quality tunc and sahin 2016 dogan demir and sahin 2017 cakmakci and sahin 2021b moraetis et al 2011 alkhamis et al 2017 and cakmakci and sahin 2021a also indicated that under wastewater irrigation the crop yield and quality of silage maize increased with improved soil fertility zero tillage saves irrigation water by reducing soil moisture loss gozubuyuk et al 2020 in addition zero tillage treatment contributes to the preservation or increase of soil organic matter stocks by reducing the oxidation of organic matter since the soil is not stirred and more plant residues are left on the soil surface yerli et al 2022 intensive tillage increases the mineralization processes of organic matter and n p and k contents however zero tillage not only protects organic matter and n p and k by reducing oxidation but also supports the recovery of more organic matter and n p and k from crop residues into the soil tabaglio et al 2009 he et al 2011 reported that organic matter n and p in the surface layer of no till soil increased by 16 1 31 0 and 29 6 respectively compared to conventional tillage and these increases improved the yields of wheat and maize by 3 5 and 1 4 respectively similarly da silva et al 2020 stated that the yield of maize increased by 17 due to the improved quality characteristics of no till soil compared to conventional tillage in a crop rotation including sorghum or soybean although water productivity can be improved in deficit irrigation conditions water shortage may reduce the yield of silage maize which is highly fertile under adequate irrigation conditions cakmakci and sahin 2021a drought reduces chlorophyll content membrane stability leaf area and relative water content thus these physiological responses can be practical indicators to evaluate yield sampathkumar et al 2014 however alkhamisi et al 2011 abdel latef and sallam 2015 and alkhamisi et al 2017 explained that wastewater irrigation can increase chlorophyll content similarly alkhamisi et al 2011 and mousavi and shahsavari 2014 also reported that leaf area can be increased improving water productivity by increasing crop productivity with less water in silage maize production is one of the most important expectations in previous studies this issue has been examined only within the scope of wastewater or different tillage and sowing practices however no studies in the literature are available on improving the yield and water productivity of silage maize by irrigation with different levels of wastewater under different tillage and sowing conditions in this context this study aims to examine the actual evapotranspiration and water use efficiency of silage maize irrigated with varying application levels of recycled wastewater under different tillage and sowing conditions and determine the changes in crop physical chemical and physiological properties that effect yield thus we tested the hypothesis that irrigation with wastewater under zero tillage could increase water use efficiency by decreasing crop water consumption as well as improve the yield and quality of silage maize in this study 2 material and methods 2 1 location climate and soil properties of the study area the study was carried out in van yuzuncu yil university faculty of agriculture experimental area 38 34 35 n 43 17 26 e with an altitude of 1670 m located in eastern turkey during the vegetation periods from may to september in 2020 and 2021 according to the weather data for many years 1991 2020 the experimental region has a semi arid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 410 2 mm july mean air temperature 22 7 c and total precipitation 7 9 mm and august mean air temperature 22 9 c and total precipitation 5 6 mm are the months with high temperatures and less precipitation in the region tsms 2022 the data of the climate station imetos 2 in the experimental area considering the monthly total precipitation evaporation and mean air temperature values for the production periods of 2020 and 2021 are shown in fig 1 the physicochemical characteristics of the test site soil prior to the experiment are given in table 1 it could be said that sandy clay loam textured soil has medium alkaline low organic matter content and medium lime content with no salinity problem 2 2 irrigation water resources and properties the tap water in van yuzuncu yil university was used for irrigation as a fresh water source the recycled wastewater was obtained from the discharge point of the biological waste water treatment plant 38 24 53 n 43 14 09 e located in the central edremit district of van province the inlet water of the biological wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 10400 m3 day contains domestic pollution elements coming from a residential area with a population of approximately 125000 since there are no important industrial facilities in the region the raw wastewater is free of industrial wastes raw wastewater from the sewerage network is transferred to the pre sedimentation and aeration ponds after being passed through a sand trap coarse and fine screen at the entrance to the facility the recycled wastewater which is aerated and passed through the bacteria pool leaves the facility after the final settling unit and is discharged into van lake the wastewater was taken from the discharge point of treatment plant with an irrigation tanker before each irrigation transported to the experimental area and used in irrigation after being transferred to polyethylene water tanks samples were taken from the water for each month during the irrigation periods and analyzed to determine the quality characteristics of the irrigation water details of the process procedures and methods for the analysis of the water used in the experiment are given by yerli and sahin 2022b based on the findings on the water analyses table 2 and according to national and international evaluations for soil crop and irrigation systems by yerli and sahin 2022b the water was safe for irrigation 2 3 irrigation system irrigation was carried out with a surface drip irrigation system driplines with 33 cm dripper intervals and a 2 3 l h 1 dripper flow rate in 0 1 mpa operation pressure were placed 70 cm intervals in each crop row driplines were connected to water tanks via manifold and main pipelines a control unit consisting of a centrifugal pump screen filter pressure regulator and manometer was positioned between the main pipe and the water tank the irrigation quantity was controlled with water meters placed at each plot inlet 2 4 experimental design the experiment was carried out according to the split plot experimental design in a random blocks experimental plan with three replications the main treatments were different tillage and sowing practices conventional tillage and zero tillage and sub treatments were different application levels of wastewater 100 67 33 of irrigation need and also full irrigation with fresh water as control treatment thus the total number of plots in the experimental area was twenty four and each experiment plot was arranged with dimensions of 3 5 m 7 2 m 25 2 m2 with 5 rows 70 cm 15 cm row spacing and crop spacing suppl 2 2 5 tillage and sowing cultural practices and irrigation treatments in conventional tillage practice the soil was ploughed with a mouldboard plough at a depth of 25 30 cm and then the clods formed in the soil were broken up using a cultivator rotary harrow and leveled finally the maize seeds cv ossk 644 were sown with a pneumatic seeder in zero tillage the sowing was carried out with the direct sowing machine on the same day as the conventional tillage during both years weeding was done manually using hoe for the conventional tillage the first weeding was carried out when the crop was 15 20 cm high and the second weeding as middle breaking when the crop height was 40 50 cm in zero tillage linuron and 2 4 d fluorosulan active ingredient herbicide was applied according to the weed type on the field during the first experimental year urea 45 46 n and triple super phosphate 43 46 p2o5 fertilizers were applied homogeneously to all plot surfaces at 100 kg ha 1 and 150 kg ha 1 doses respectively during sowing the second urea fertilization was applied to all plots by fertigation at a rate of 100 kg ha 1 when the crops reached the 4 6 leaf stage 40 50 cm height during the second experimental year fertilization was carried out in the plots where only fresh water was applied to evaluate the residual fertilizer effect of wastewater treatments from the previous year therefore tn and p2o5 analyzes were made on the surface layer of the fresh water plots during the sowing period a fertilizing of 67 kg ha 1 and 56 kg ha 1 urea and 65 kg ha 1 and 60 kg ha 1 triple super phosphate were added to the fresh water plots of conventional tillage and zero tillage practices respectively during the second year as in the first year of the experiment the second dose of urea fertilization was carried out by fertigation in an amount equal to the first dose in the fresh water plots at the middle breaking stage when the crops reached the 4 6 leaf stage irrigation was applied with fresh water in all plots during both trial years until the crop heights reached 40 50 cm 4 6 leaf stage the irrigation for the remainder of the season the second irrigation period was continued with three different application levels 100 67 and 33 of wastewater in wastewater plots while fresh water plots were irrigated with an application level of 100 fresh water in this study an irrigation schedule which considered crop evapotranspiration etc calculated with real time climatic data was practiced to determine irrigation starting times irrigations was applied when the amount of σ etc precipitation reached 40 of available soil moisture soil depths were considered as 30 and 90 cm for the first and second irrigation periods respectively the values corresponding to 40 of available soil moisture were 19 1 mm for 30 cm soil depth and 59 5 mm for 90 cm soil depth table 1 etc was calculated with the following equation 1 etc eto kc where etc is the crop evapotranspiration eto is the reference crop evapotranspiration and kc is the crop coefficient the eto was calculated with the penman monteith fao approach in the cropwat program the climate data required in the calculations were obtained daily from the climate station imetos 2 in the experimental area the crop coefficient kc values for silage maize in the van region conditions were taken from a guide crop water consumption guide for irrigated crops in turkey published by the ministry of agriculture and forestry general directorate of agricultural research and policies tagem 2017 the total eto etc and precipitation values during the vegetation period of 2020 were determined as 801 1 mm 695 0 mm and 37 0 mm respectively and 739 8 mm 639 7 mm and 52 1 mm for the 2021 vegetation period fig 2 irrigation quantities applied were calculated with eq 2 and 3 in conventional and direct sowing practices kanber and unlu 2010 2 i fc cm γs d w 10 3 v i a where i is the irrigation quantity needed for full irrigation mm fc is moisture retained at field capacity percent of weight cm is current moisture before irrigation in the fresh water plot percent of weight γs is soil bulk density g cm 3 d is soil depth 30 cm and 90 cm w is the wetting ratio v is the volume of irrigation water l and a is the plot area 25 2 m2 the wetting ratios were used 0 30 and 0 65 for the first and second irrigation periods during each trial year respectively while all of the water calculated with the above equations was applicated to the 100 plots deficit irrigation plots were irrigated with two different levels 67 and 33 of this water amount a total of 13 and 12 irrigations were applied in 2020 and 2021 respectively the first 4 irrigations during both years were carried out with fresh water equally for all plots the total water amounts applied during this first period of irrigations were 20 2 mm in 2020 and 21 5 mm in 2021 in the experiment the mean irrigation interval was 9 days irrigation intervals shortened in july and august fig 2 when the air temperatures were high fig 1 the seasonal irrigation quantities applied to different irrigation treatments in two tillages and sowing practices are shown in table 3 2 6 soil moisture measurements and actual evapotranspiration the soil moisture measurements were carried out at a distance of about 15 20 cm from the drippers between two crops in the center of the plot in the middle replication plots during the sowing harvesting and before each irrigation while the soil moisture measurements were carried out at 0 30 cm soil layer with an hd2 mobile device tdr trime pico iph t3 imko the gravimetric method was used for 30 60 and 60 90 cm soil layers eq 4 was used to calculate the actual evapotranspiration of silage maize allen et al 1998 4 eta i p cr dw rf s where eta is the actual evapotranspiration mm i is the irrigation quantity applied mm p is the precipitation mm cr is the capillary rise mm dw is deep percolation mm rf is the amount of runoff mm and δs is the change in soil moisture content in the soil layer at 0 90 cm mm the pluviometer data of the climate station imetos 2 established in the experimental area were used for precipitation capillary rise was not taken into consideration since the ground water table was rather deep in the experimental field it was determined that there was no deep percolation in gravimetric moisture measurements at 90 120 cm since the dripper flow rate suitable for the infiltration rate of the soil was selected there was no water loss with the runoff 2 7 water productivity and irrigation water productivity while water productivity evaluates the yielding change against seasonal actual evapotranpiration which is determined by the sum of the irrigation quantity precipitation and the change soil water storage irrigation water productivity only indicates the yielding change against seasonal irrigation quantity cakmakci and sahin 2021a as the contribution of irrigation to water consumption increases these values get closer to each other eq 5 and 6 were used to determine water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity wpirrig howell 2001 5 wp y 10 x eta 6 wpirrig y 10 x i where wp is the water productivity kg m 3 wpirrig is the irrigation water productivity kg m 3 y is the fresh biomass yield kg ha 1 eta is the actual evapotranspiration mm and i is the irrigation quantity mm 2 8 measurements and analyzes in silage maize crops the height and stem diameter of thirty crops randomly selected from three central rows in the harvest area of each plot was measured at harvest via meter and digital caliper respectively esiyok et al 2004 likewise thirty crops in the center were cut from the soil surface and weighed and then adapted to the unit area ha thus fresh biomass yields were obtained cakmakci and sahin 2021a the weighed fresh crops were air dried and then oven dried at 78 c for 48 h the dry matter ratio was calculated by dividing the dry weight with the wet weight and finally this ratio value was multiplied with the fresh biomass yield to determine the dry matter yield kacar 2014 the milky endosperm liquid of the grains in the middle of the harvested crop cobs was dripped on the refractometer and the reading was taken from the refractometer to determine total soluble solids brix esiyok et al 2004 acid detergent fiber adf and neutral detergent fiber ndf were carried out in ankom 200 fiber analyzer according to the fiber bag system gerhardt developed by modifying the van soest analysis method van soest 1963 while the n in the milled crop samples was determined by the kjeldahl method kacar 2014 the crude protein ratio was calculated from the crop n content with a standard coefficient raju 1979 the crop p content was determined colorimetrically in the solution obtained with the burning process kacar 2014 an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes device was used to determine ca mg na and k in the crop anonymous 2007 the chlorophyll content was determined by the spad 502 chlorophyllmeter device between 10 00 and 14 00 h when the photosynthetic activity was higher from the leaves in the middle of randomly selected six crops from each plot approximately coinciding halfway between two irrigations tunali et al 2012 the leaf area index was determined by measuring all the leaves of six crops at harvest maturity with a leaf area meter licor li 3000 c and measurement values divided by the unit area of a crop 70 cm 15 cm stewart and dwyer 1999 membrane damage was determined on the basis of measuring the electrolyte leakage coming out of the leaf cells jamei et al 2009 and for this purpose 10 mm diameter disc samples were taken from the lower 2nd and 3rd leaves of six crops from each plot placed in 50 µl test tubes and incubated with 30 µl distilled water at room temperature for 24 h after which the ec value was measured ec1 the same samples were incubated in a water bath at 95 c for 20 min to release all electrolytes and the ec value was measured again after cooling at room temperature ec2 the membrane damage was obtained as a percentage ec1 ec2 eq 7 was used to determine the leaf relative water content by taking six leaf samples from each plot benešová et al 2012 7 lrwc fw dw tw dw 100 where lrwc is the leaf relative water content fw is the fresh weight of a leaf g dw is the dry weight of a leaf oven dried at 65 c for 24 h g and tw is the turgid weight of a leaf after it has been kept in distilled water for 4 h g 2 9 data analysis statistical analyzes were carried out using the spss program ver 23 tillage and sowing and irrigation practices were considered as fixed factors and the data were evaluated with general linear model analysis and comparisons were made with duncan multiple comparison test at 5 probability level for the means found significant correlograms with scatter plot correlation coefficient and variable distribution were created by using the rstudio program for the correlation relationships 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation quantity in zero tillage irrigation water savings were between 9 1 and 10 3 during the first year and between 9 8 and 11 2 in the second year compared to conventional tillage table 3 this situation can be evaluated as a result of crop residue management in zero tillage it is thought that the requirement for irrigation water decreases as a result of the decrease in evaporation due to the crop residues left on the soil surface in zero tillage compared to intensive tillage the higher soil moisture contents also confirm less evaporation in zero tillage fig 3 many researchers have stated that the irrigation quantity applied decreases with the reduction of evaporation in zero tillage ma et al 2015 mishra and kushwaha 2016 qi et al 2018 gozubuyuk et al 2020 burke et al 2021 in addition water loss from the soil by evaporation may vary depending on the pore size distribution and connectivity as well as the total porosity which varies according to tillage practices although lower porosity values were determined under zero tillage conditions 51 3 compared to conventional tillage 52 1 in this study an increase in water retention fig 3 probably due to the increased micropores which may have supported the decrease in water loss by evaporation was noted similarly ghosh et al 2020 reported that porosity and maximum connected pores were higher in conventional tillage lower porosity was seen in no till practice and conservation tillage also increased the microporosity that provides water retention in the soil 3 2 soil moisture content and actual evapotranspiration the soil moisture contents measured during sowing harvesting and before each irrigation at 90 cm soil depth in different treatments throughout vegetation periods in 2020 and 2021 are given fig 3 it was seen that the soil moisture content was higher in the zero tillage practice during both years soil moisture content values were close to the soil moisture depletion fraction 40 of available water content in full irrigation treatments with wastewater and fresh water but soil moisture contents approached the wilting point towards the end of the vegetation period in deficit irrigation treatments and resulted in extra stress actual evapotranspiration eta values of silage maize in irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments in 2020 and 2021 are shown fig 4 due to the low precipitation during the vegetation periods figs 1 and 2 the irrigation water amount constituted the most important component of evapotranspiration in the full irrigation treatments therefore eta values in full irrigation treatments with wastewater and fresh water were found to be similar as a result of equal irrigation quantity table 3 as the mean of two experimental years 19 3 and 38 3 lower eta values were determined at 67 and 33 irrigation levels in conventional tillage compared to full irrigation respectively and 19 5 and 36 0 lower in zero tillage the eta values were found to be between 5 2 and 10 3 lower during the first year and 5 4 and 8 6 lower during the second year in zero tillage compared to conventional tillage the lower eta values in zero tillage practice can be evaluated as a result of less irrigation water table 3 djaman et al 2018 also indicated a high correlation of seasonal evapotranspiration of maize grown in semi arid conditions with the irrigation quantity in a previous study similar to this study in the same region the eta values of silage maize were specified as 416 mm 330 mm and 255 mm for 100 67 and 33 irrigation levels respectively under conventional tillage cakmakci and sahin 2021a the eta values in this study were lower than the 601 mm evapotranspiration value determined for silage maize fully irrigated with a mobile sprinkler irrigation system in a region with a semi arid climate at high altitude kiziloglu et al 2009 and also the 526 mm evapotranspiration value determined for silage maize fully irrigated with a surface drip system ors et al 2015 there are also many different studies showing that the evapotranspiration values of silage maize which are fully irrigated by the surface drip method vary between 635 mm and 975 mm dagdelen et al 2009 simsek et al 2011 ucak et al 2016 however in a different region with a similar altitude a lower evapotranspiration value of 351 mm was reported in silage maize cultivation under full irrigation conditions with the surface drip method nilahyane et al 2020 therefore it could be said that the eta findings can vary according to regional climate changes and different irrigation practices 3 3 water productivity and irrigation water productivity the change of water productivity wp and irrigation water productivity wpirrig in irrigation and tillage and sowing practices were determined as significant p 0 001 fig 5 and suppl 1 the higher wp values were obtained with 100 and 67 irrigation treatments with wastewater and the highest wpirrig value was determined in irrigation with the wastewater at the level of 67 in addition wp and wpirrig values in the zero tillage practice were found to be higher than in the conventional tillage wp and wpirrig values in full irrigation with wastewater were 11 0 and 11 6 higher respectively compared to full irrigation with fresh water the similar eta fig 4 and irrigation quantities table 3 in the full irrigation treatments with wastewater and fresh water showed that the higher wp and wpirrig values under wastewater irrigation were due to increased yield with the nutritive effect of the wastewater many studies have reported increased wp and wpirrig values as a result of the increase in yield in irrigation with wastewater hassanli et al 2009 alkhamisi et al 2011 2017 tunc and sahin 2016 hajihashemi et al 2020 cakmakci and sahin 2021a the wp value decreased significantly as a result of the significant yield loss at the 33 irrigation level table 4 yield loss at the 67 irrigation level was lower and the increased wp values with the effect of the decreased eta provided similarity to those in full irrigation with wastewater the higher wpirrig values in the 67 irrigation treatment also were the result of decreased irrigation quantity table 4 as parallel to this study findings ucak et al 2016 determined the highest wpirrig value at a 70 irrigation level in silage maize irrigated by the drip irrigation method the hypothesis valid for wp is based on increased yield with increased water use therefore the increase in wp with the irrigation water level indicates that the increase in yield is supported by irrigation bouazzama et al 2012 significant p 0 001 linear increases in wp with the increase in yield and irrigation quantity were also determined in this study fig 6 however payero et al 2008 stated that the wp value of maize increases non linearly with water consumption and yield basso and ritchie 2018 also stated that maize productivity could be increased without a change in the water use rate resulting in increased wp in addition many studies have demonstrated that deficit irrigation increases wp and wpirrig values dagdelen et al 2006 igbadun et al 2008 kiziloglu et al 2009 ucak et al 2011 bouazzama et al 2012 kuscu naghashzadeh et al 2014 2015 cakmakci and sahin 2021a in zero tillage 12 1 and 13 2 higher wp and wpirrig values were obtained respectively compared to conventional tillage this can be explained by less irrigation quantity table 3 and lower crop water consumption fig 4 and a higher yield table 4 in zero tillage compared to conventional tillage many studies have also shown that the increase in wp and wpirrig values were due to decreasing irrigation quantity and increasing yield in zero tillage practice zhang et al 2013 guan et al 2014 wang et al 2018 hou and li 2019 gozubuyuk et al 2020 3 4 yield and yield components in silage maize the crop heights of silage maize were significantly p 0 001 different in irrigation treatments and the highest value was determined in full wastewater irrigation table 4 and suppl 1 the crop height of forage maize increases significantly with n content in soil carpici et al 2010 therefore it could be said that the higher crop heights in full wastewater irrigation compared to fresh water is related to the high n content of the wastewater table 2 the low crop heights in the deficit wastewater irrigation could be explained with decreased water entry into the soil and thus nutrients similarly selim 2008 reported that the increase in crop height in wastewater irrigation conditions was due to the high nutrient contribution many studies have shown that crop heights were higher in wastewater irrigation conditions khan et al 2009 abegunrin et al 2013 hirich et al 2014 alghobar and suresha 2016 alkhamisi et al 2017 cakmakci and sahin 2021a and lower in deficit irrigation conditions simsek et al 2011 bouazzama et al 2012 ertek and kara 2013 gonulal and soylu 2019 bhattarai et al 2020 the change in stem diameter was found significant in irrigation p 0 001 and tillage and sowing p 0 05 treatments table 4 and suppl 1 a positive correlation p 0 001 was determined between crop height and stem diameter fig 6 therefore it could be argued that a larger stem diameter with full wastewater promoted higher crop height while the low crop heights in deficit irrigation was related to smaller stem diameters table 4 the effect of n intake on the increase of stem diameter can also be mentioned here both soil water content and its chemical composition may have affected crop growth by inducing n uptake by plants in full wastewater irrigation similarly aynehband et al 2011 mentioned a significant relationship between soil moisture content and n uptake carpici et al 2010 also stated that the stem diameter variation may be due to n fertilization similarly kale et al 2018 reported that the stem diameter increased with the increase of n the higher n content of zero tillage soil 0 110 compared to conventional tillage 0 102 may explain the higher stem diameter in zero tillage practice these study results were parallelled by mousavi and shahsavari 2014 who expressed that stem diameter increased in wastewater irrigation conditions compared to fresh water while aikins et al 2012 reported that reduced tillage improved crop growth parameters by increasing soil fertility fresh biomass yield has changed significantly p 0 001 in irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments table 4 and suppl 1 fresh biomass yield was 11 3 higher in wastewater under full irrigation conditions compared to fresh water while fresh biomass yield decreased by 19 4 and 62 3 in 67 and 33 irrigation treatments compared to full irrigation in addition fresh biomass yield was 3 higher under zero tillage conditions than conventional tillage the positive correlations p 0 001 determined between crop heights and stem diameters with the fresh biomass yields fig 6 showed that the increase in crop height and stem diameter could be the main reason for higher yield the increased fresh biomass yield in wastewater irrigation conditions compared to irrigation with fresh water can be explained by the direct fertilization effect caused by the high nutrient content of wastewater table 2 similarly some researchers have reported that the high nutrient content of wastewater improves yield with the fertilization effect mousavi and shahsavari 2014 becerra castro et al 2015 tunc and sahin 2016 2021a the decrease in fresh biomass yield with the decrease of the irrigation level can be evaluated as related to the weakening of crop root growth and the inability of the crop to take nutrients sufficiently due to the decrease in water entry into the soil the positive correlation p 0 001 of irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration with fresh biomass yield also supports this argument fig 6 mengu and ozgurel 2008 also stated that there was a high positive correlation between the irrigation quantity and yield in silage maize yolcu and cetin 2015 indicated that the fresh biomass yield increased significantly by increasing the irrigation quantity and increasing soil n content crop growth and biomass are also reduced due to reduced photosynthetically active radiation and radiation utilization efficiency under deficit irrigation conditions gomaa et al 2021 as can be seen from table 7 spad values which are a good photosynthetic indicator decreased significantly with the deficit irrigation treatments in addition other physiological and photosynthetic properties of the crop are among the parameters that provide additional contributions to the interpretation of fresh biomass yield fig 6 shows the positive correlations p 0 001 of fresh biomass yield with spad leaf relative water content and leaf area index while the negative correlation p 0 001 indicates membrane damage similarly camoglu et al 2011 and karasu et al 2015 reported high correlations between the fresh biomass yield and the physiological parameters of the maize crop previous studies have reported that yield decreases occur under deficit irrigation conditions with wastewater tunc and sahin 2016 dogan demir and sahin 2017 cakmakci and sahin 2021a in addition it has been stated by other researchers that there are significant yield losses due to the decrease in the irrigation water level in silage maize payero et al 2008 ariturk and erdem 2011 rusere et al 2012 djaman et al 2013 depending on the crop residue management in zero tillage the return of crop residues to the soil as organic matter and n may explain the increased fresh biomass yield under zero tillage conditions in addition higher soil moisture values in zero tillage fig 3 may have contributed to yield by reducing stress nouri et al 2019 explained that the increase in crop yield in zero tillage is associated with higher organic matter and n contribution and also with the longer preservation of soil moisture content in zero tillage da silva et al 2020 reported that zero tillage increased yields by 6 in soybean 100 in sorghum and 17 in maize compared to conventional tillage in addition many studies have reported that yield increases were determined under zero tillage conditions de vita et al 2007 he et al 2011 buah et al 2017 si et al 2018 naeem et al 2021 the effects of irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments on dry biomass yield was significant p 0 001 table 4 and suppl 1 dry biomass yield changes due to irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments were similar to fresh biomass yield changes and a positive correlation p 0 001 was determined between dry biomass yield and fresh biomass yield fig 6 while 10 1 more dry biomass yield was obtained with wastewater compared to fresh water under full irrigation conditions dry biomass yield was 7 7 higher under zero tillage conditions than conventional tillage similar to the findings of this study alkhamis et al 2017 expressed that maize irrigated with wastewater had a higher dry biomass yield than irrigation with fresh water cakmakci and sahin 2021 also reported that dry biomass yield was higher in wastewater irrigation than fresh water and dry biomass yield decreased with deficit irrigation and the changes in dry biomass yield were directly related to fresh biomass yield the decrease in dry biomass yield with the increase of the irrigation water deficit could also be supported by the positive correlations p 0 001 of irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration with dry biomass yield fig 6 similarly yolcu and cetin 2015 indicated that there is a positive correlation between the water use of silage maize and dry biomass yield aydinsakir et al 2013 and kale et al 2018 also stated that dry biomass yield decreased due to water stress in silage maize the positive correlation p 0 001 of spad and the leaf area index with dry biomass yield was also determined in this study fig 6 gomaa et al 2021 demonstrated that the decreased photosynthetic level with the decrease in the metabolic activity and the chlorophyll content of maize in the leaves under insufficient soil water conditions can reduce the dry biomass yield bouazzama et al 2012 also reported that crop growth was negatively affected due to water scarcity and dry biomass yield decreased as a result of the decrease in the leaf area index it is thought that dry biomass yield increases as a result of the organic matter and n contribution from increased crop residues in zero tillage table 4 gozubuyuk et al 2020 recorded increases in yield parameters as a result of the n contribution of crop residues to the soil in zero tillage farhad et al 2011 reported that the increase of n in the soil increased the dry biomass yield in maize while yolcu and cetin 2015 stated that increasing n doses supported dry matter accumulation in silage maize kale et al 2018 on the contrary indicated that dry biomass yield decreased with increased n fertilization 3 5 quality properties and macronutrient contents in silage maize a significant p 0 001 change for total soluble solids tss was determined only in irrigation treatments table 5 and suppl 1 the increased tss in wastewater irrigation can be related to the rich n and p content of wastewater table 2 kovacs and gyuricza 2012 reported that the increase in n and p supports the increase in tss in addition the increase in tss in irrigation with wastewater can be related to the high salinity content of wastewater table 2 yurtseven et al 2005 stated that tss increased with the effect of increasing irrigation water salinity decreased tss values with the decrease of irrigation quantity were evaluated as related to the inability of the crop to get enough nutrients from the soil due to the decrease in water entry into the soil acar et al 2008 and polat et al 2008 also stated that the decrease in irrigation level reduces tss the change for acid detergent fiber adf and neutral detergent fiber ndf were significant p 0 001 only in irrigation treatments table 5 and suppl 1 adf and ndf values were lower in full irrigation with wastewater and increased with the increasing water deficit adf and ndf are important quality parameters to evaluate the digestibility and energy intake of feed products in livestock feeding adf represents cellulose and lignins which are difficult to digest and ndf represents fibrous carbohydrates of the cell wall such as cellulose and hemicellulose lignin some proteins and silicon canbolat 2019 high adf causes a decrease in quality due to the increase in fiber content and high ndf causes insufficient feeding with a low dry matter effect as a result of reduced intake due to rumen filling keskin et al 2018 nrc 2001 stated that adf and ndf values should be below 25 0 and 45 8 respectively for good feed quality in this study it was determined that the values of adf and ndf were below these recommended values only under full irrigation conditions with wastewater under wastewater irrigation conditions lower adf and ndf values were considered to be associated with the higher n content of wastewater irrigated crops table 6 the negative correlations p 0 001 of adf and ndf with crop n content also support this fig 6 carpici et al 2010 kaplan et al 2016 and kale et al 2018 reported that increasing n content in silage maize decreased adf and ndf values safdarian et al 2014 expressed the negative relationship of n with adf and ndf as a result of the crops taking n being physiologically active for a longer period of time and the decrease in adf and ndf due to the delayed maturation of the crop at the same time considering the negative correlations p 0 001 of adf and ndf with crop height stem diameter fresh and dry biomass yields fig 6 it can be stated that adf and ndf decrease with the increase of crop growth similarly cacan et al 2018 expressed the negative correlations of ndf with crop height and of adf with fresh biomass yield in vetch crops while mut and erbas kose 2018 indicated the negative correlations of adf with crop height and adf and ndf with grain yield in triticale crops adf and ndf values increased with decreasing irrigation quantity and the highest adf and ndf values were obtained at with the 33 irrigation treatment the negative correlation p 0 001 of adf and ndf with irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration were also determined and indicated in fig 6 carpici et al 2017 reported that similar correlations were obtained and that the adf and ndf values increased depending on the decrease in the irrigation quantity the change of crude protein ratio was significant p 0 001 in irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments table 5 and suppl 1 while wastewater irrigation increased the crude protein the crude protein decreased with the increase of irrigation water stress and also increased in conventional tillage compared to zero tillage the increase in wastewater irrigation can be explained by the high n content of wastewater table 2 similarly alkhamis et al 2011 reported that the crude protein in silage maize irrigated with wastewater was 13 higher compared to silage maize irrigated with fresh water and this increase was associated with the high n content of wastewater it was also determined in another study that the crude protein in the maize grain increased with the increase in the amount of n kale et al 2018 tarighaleslami et al 2012 and aydinsakir et al 2013 stated that the crude protein decreased in water stress and this situation is related to the insufficient nutrient uptake of the crop the higher n content of the crop in conventional tillage practice table 6 also resulted in a higher crude protein ratio compared to zero tillage while irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments had a significant p 0 001 effect on the n content of silage maize p k ca mg and na contents were changed significantly p 0 001 with only irrigation treatments table 6 and suppl 1 the crop macronutrient content increased in irrigation with wastewater compared to irrigation with fresh water while it decreased with deficit irrigation and also only the n content increased in conventional tillage compared to zero tillage similarly cakmakci and sahin 2021a indicated that the crop macronutrient content in silage maize grown under wastewater irrigation conditions were significantly higher than silage maize grown with fresh water since wastewater contains considerable levels of many nutrients compared to fresh water in addition the results of many studies have revealed that due to the high nutrient content of wastewater it increases the accumulation of macro and micro elements in the crop and accumulates in the soil kiziloglu et al 2008 masona et al 2011 avci and deveci 2013 kobaissi et al 2014 ma et al 2015 nzediegwu et al 2019 hajihashemi et al 2020 fattahi et al 2020 the decreased crop macronutrient contents with increased water deficit can be explained by the decrease in nutrient uptake by plants with the effect of less water in the soil as well as less nutrient accumulation in the soil from wastewater it is likely that increases in crop nutrient uptake occur with increased transpiration in silage maize cakmakci and sahin 2021a expressed that the macroelement contents of the crop decreased due to the increase in water scarcity in silage maize under wastewater irrigation conditions in addition it has been stated in many studies that the macro and micro element contents crops decrease due to the increase in water stress kuslu et al 2008 simsek et al 2011 kuscu et al 2014 dogan demir and sahin 2017 in general macronutrient contents were found similar in silage maize in tillage and sowing practices however the higher n content in conventional tillage may be related to increased crop n uptake due to higher crop water consumption in conventional tillage fig 4 similarly guan et al 2014 indicated that root growth is higher in conventional tillage conditions compared to zero tillage and good root development can increase n uptake with more water uptake from the soil it is also mentioned that soil aeration is sufficient for a crop to absorb macro and micro elements abuarab et al 2019 soil aeration promotes root growth and spread thereby increasing the crop s potential to utilize irrigation water therefore it can be stated that increased soil aeration in conventional tillage may have increased n uptake 3 6 physiological properties in silage maize chlorophyll content spad changed significantly p 0 001 with irrigation and tillage and sowing treatments table 7 and suppl 1 while the highest spad values were obtained in full irrigation treatment with wastewater spad values decreased due to increasing water stress and spad values were higher in zero tillage compared to conventional tillage higher spad values in full irrigation with wastewater may be due to the increased rate of chlorophyll biosynthesis from wastewater abdel latef and sallam 2015 in this case the association of higher spad values with the fe content of wastewater table 2 can be considered in wastewater treatments rout and sahoo 2015 fe is an important nutrient in both chloroplast formation and protein development yerli et al 2020 in addition n is also a component of chlorophyll since n deficiency reduces the chlorophyll concentration in leaves the n content of wastewater table 2 can be seen as one of the important factors supporting the increase in spad in leaves liu et al 2018 since maize a c4 crop has more photosynthetic activity compared to other crops it can metabolize high levels of n from wastewater alkhamisi et al 2011 in many studies it has been determined that the spad values were found to be higher in wastewater irrigation conditions than fresh water irrigation alkhamisi et al 2011 petousi et al 2015 cakmakci and sahin 2021a bauerle et al 2004 stated that spad content is a clear indicator of crop water stress this approach explains the significant decrease in spad values with increasing irrigation water deficit in this study it has also been determined in many studies that the spad values decreased due to the increase in water stress tunc and sahin 2016 dogan demir and sahin 2017 soureshjani et al 2019 cakmakci and sahin 2021a camoglu et al 2011 found that spad values decreased with decreasing in the irrigation water level and carroll et al 2017 expressed that drought managed crops had lower chlorophyll content than crops managed with full irrigation the higher soil n content 0 110 in zero tillage compared to conventional tillage 0 102 can be the reason for the higher spad values jános 2010 stated that there is a high correlation between soil n content and spad values liu and wiatrak 2011 confirmed the same correlative relationship and also pointed out that zero tillage in silage maize significantly increased spad values leaf area index lai increased significantly p 0 001 in wastewater irrigation compared to fresh water irrigation while lai decreased due to increased water stress table 7 and suppl 1 it could be said that the increased lai in irrigation with wastewater is due to the n contribution to the soil from wastewater table 2 alkhamis et al 2011 stated that lai is highly correlated with the n content in the crop and that high n content of wastewater increases lai similarly the positive correlation p 0 001 was determined between lai and crop n content in this study fig 6 in addition many studies have reported that lai increases due to the high nutrient content of wastewater alkhamisi et al 2011 abegunrin et al 2013 paudel et al 2018 cakmakci and sahin 2021a due to the decrease in soil water content the crop s inability to get enough nutrients from the soil to maintain its vital activities has reduced lai ozturk 2015 reported that the slowdown of metabolic activities in the crop due to deficit irrigation negatively affects the physiological formations and the number of leaves and leaf area decreases with increasing stress and then the crop growth may stop completely in addition many studies have mentioned that lai decreases with increasing water stress camoglu et al 2011 bouazzama et al 2012 rusere et al 2012 djaman et al 2013 haffani et al 2014 tabatabaei et al 2017 although lai changes with the effect of many factors such as water and nutrient deficiency and toxic effects the increase in lai is important in terms of photosynthesis and yield increase under normal conditions therefore lai can be considered an important yield indicator kaya 2011 in this study positive correlations p 0 001 of lai with irrigation quantity evapotranspiration spad crop height stem diameter fresh and dry biomass yields can also be seen as an important result fig 6 leaf relative water content lrwc changed significantly p 0 001 in irrigation and tillage and sowing p 0 05 treatments table 7 and suppl 1 in full irrigation condition lrwc values were found similar in waste and fresh water irrigation treatments depending on the equal irrigation quantity table 3 while lrwc decreased with increasing water stress lrwc was also higher in zero tillage than conventional tillage the increase in lrwc with increasing irrigation water level and crop water consumption was also supported by the positive correlations p 0 001 of lrwc with irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration fig 6 cakmakci and sahin 2021a also reported that increased water stress in both waste and fresh water irrigation conditions reduced lrwc in silage maize and significant positive correlations were determined for lrwc with irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration sampathkumar et al 2014 expressed that water stress reduced lrwc in maize and that lrwc was higher in maize leaves irrigated adequately than in stressed maize leaves nilahyane et al 2020 stated that there were significant decreases in lrwc in silage maize with the effect of drought stress similarly higher levels and longer retention of soil moisture under zero tillage conditions fig 3 may explain the increased lrwc under zero tillage conditions compared to conventional tillage irrigation treatments significantly p 0 001 affected membrane damage md table 7 and suppl 1 while the md increased in wastewater irrigation compared to fresh water irrigation this increase was higher in deficit irrigation treatments the higher md in wastewater irrigation could be associated with the salt content of the wastewater table 2 similarly yakit and tuna 2006 stated that salinity increases md in maize in addition it has been mentioned in studies conducted in many different crops that cell membrane systems are damaged due to salinity onal and uney 2016 deveci and tugrul 2017 kabay and alp 2017 water stress affects the cell membrane structure of the crop and impairs its function which leads to significant increases in md yildirim et al 2021 therefore it can be said that the md increasing effect of water stress is due to the decrease in lrwc table 7 the negative correlation p 0 001 between md and lrwc also supports this fig 6 ozturk 2015 stated that stomata are closed with the decrease of lrwc in crops experiencing water stress and as a result cell membrane systems are damaged and cell death occurs with increasing leaf temperature 4 conclusion the findings obtained from this study showed that zero tillage saves an average of 10 1 in irrigation quantity for silage maize compared to conventional tillage while the evapotranspiration was 7 4 lower full irrigation with wastewater increased the crop height and stem diameter of silage maize resulting in greater fresh and dry biomass yields the yield was further increased under zero tillage conditions the increased yield and reduced irrigation quantity and evapotranspiration in zero tillage provided 12 0 and 13 2 higher wp and wpirrig respectively while the higher wp values were determined in 100 and 67 irrigation levels with wastewater the highest wpirrig was found in the 67 irrigation level in addition full irrigation with wastewater provided higher total soluble solids brix macronutrients crude protein chlorophyll content leaf area index and leaf relative water content and lower acid and neutral detergent fibers and membrane damage while protein content in zero tillage was lower and chlorophyll content and leaf relative water content were higher it could be concluded that recycled domestic wastewater can be used considering the effect of increasing crop yield and water productivity for silage maize cultivation directly sown in semi arid regions moreover irrigation at the level of 67 with recycled wastewater under zero tillage may be a better practice to obtain higher water and irrigation water productivities funding our thanks to the scientific and technological research council of turkey tubitak for financially supporting this

9108,due to the frequent irrigation and excessive fertilization during the rice production in china diffuse nitrogen n and phosphorus p pollution from paddy fields has become a serious environment problem and poses great challenges to national water and food security considering the regional heterogeneities of climate cultivation types and cropping systems of rice planting many water management strategies have been proposed and implemented to control diffuse n and p pollution however the water management optimization at different scales the field scale the watershed scale and national scale is lack of comprehensive analyzed here this paper summarized the characteristics of frequent used water managements and recommended the optimal water managements after identifying the critical risk periods of diffuse n and p runoff losses at the field scale the effects of water management optimization on diffuse n and p pollution control at the watershed and national scale were also synthetically reviewed the results indicated that optimized field water management decreased irrigation water use 38 7 40 0 and reduced diffuse pollution 25 5 38 8 without significantly compromising rice yield security 4 20 to 6 5 the critical risk periods of diffuse pollution were pre flooding in the northeast plain pre flooding regreening stage for transplanting rice the seeding three leaf stage for direct seeding rice and within 2 weeks after topdressing fertilization in the yangtze river basin and southeast coast in china the corresponding water managements for these periods has been proposed after considering the climate precipitation and fertilization characteristics ditches and ponds intercepted water and nutrients and mitigated 6 0 39 0 n and p runoff losses in paddy field watersheds furthermore the extensive implementation of paddy water management optimization paddy fields ditches and ponds combined with other advanced agricultural measures for example fertilization optimization would decrease diffuse n and p pollution by 40 7 80 8 at the watershed scale and 44 7 88 1 at the national scale respectively this research provided great insights into the specific characteristics of paddy water managements from the fields watershed and national scale proposed optimal water management strategies for the realization of sustainable rice production in china and also summarized the emerging development trends for future research directions graphical abstract ga1 keywords critical risk period diffuse pollution ditches and ponds paddy field watershed water

ipni 2017 yunus et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 sustainable rice production faces great challenges as it is confronted with water shortages and increasing irrigation water requirements in the future and global rice production needs to increase by 28 by 2050 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 devkota et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2015 moreover frequent irrigation and excessive fertilization in paddy fields lead to a potential high risk of diffuse pollution to surrounding waterbodies through surface runoff maruyama et al 2008 zhuang et al 2019 chen et al 2022 specially nitrogen n and phosphorus p runoff loss have been highly concerned globally because n and p are vital nutrients for rice growth and critical causes of water deterioration bowles et al 2018 goyette et al 2018 liu et al 2021a as one of the major rice planting countries china accounts for 19 and 32 of the global rice yield and harvested area respectively by consuming 65 and 14 of the national agricultural water use and fertilizer use respectively fao 2019 zhuang et al 2019 n and p runoff losses from paddy fields were evaluated to be the second largest agricultural pollution source in china fu et al 2021a therefore deep understanding of the current paddy water managements and proposing highly effective management strategies to improve water use efficiency and mitigate diffuse n and p pollution are critical for the water and food security in china rice planting with diverse rice cropping systems e g single rice middle rice and double rice and cultivation types e g transplanting rice and direct seeding rice are widely distributed in the mainland china from the northeast plain with a temperate monsoon climate to the yangtze river basin and southeast coast with a subtropical monsoon climate ruan et al 2022 zhang et al 2018a optimized paddy water managements such as water saving irrigation wsi and control drainage cd have been applied since the 1980s and are increasingly implemented in recent decades gu and zhao 2012 zhuang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 substantial scientific evidence proves the effectiveness of optimized water managements in improving rice yield and water productivity and decreasing diffuse pollution liu et al 2021b he et al 2020 ishfaq et al 2020 however the specific water managements strategies such as the optimal time of irrigation and drainage the optimal field ponding water level for irrigation and drainage operations varied at different researches he et al 2020 wang et al 2020 even in the same rice planting region with same cultivation system moreover the regional heterogeneities of climatic conditions cultivation types and cropping system give rise to the significant variability of n and p runoff losses over time and space fu et al 2021a hou et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 to effective mitigate the n and p runoff losses from paddy fields and reduce labor costs it is imperative to first identify the critical risk periods for diffuse pollution for different rice planting regions liu et al 2021b the optimal integrated irrigation and drainage managements for these critical risk periods which would be feasible agronomically and attractive economically to reduce diffuse pollution and maintain high rice yield are still lacking apart from optimizing paddy water managements at field scale the effectiveness of agricultural water conservancy projects e g ditches and ponds around the fields at the paddy field watershed are getting more attentions in recent decades sun et al 2021a jia et al 2019 kumwimba et al 2018 the paddy irrigation and drainage unit idu which is compose of fields ditches and a pond if existed is widely distributed in the rice planting regions especially in the yangtze river basin and southeast coast of china li et al 2020 natural or artificial ecological ditches and ponds alter the water cycle as well as the transfer and fate of nutrients in the idu system hua et al 2019a 2019b liu et al 2021a in fact numerous site level studies have examined the interception and purification effects of ditches and ponds and analyzed different influence factors on the diffuse pollution removal rate shen et al 2021 jia et al 2019 moreover the effectiveness of optimized ditches and ponds management strategies have been evaluated in the paddy field watershed using hydrologic models liu et al 2021a sun et al 2021b although much attention has been given to different paddy water managements both in field and watershed scale the mitigation effectiveness on diffuse n and p losses across different spatial scales have rarely been reviewed systematically the comprehensive evaluation of paddy water managements at different scales paddy field watershed and national scale is in urgent need to provide future research directions and tailored policy suggestion for sustainable agricultural water management and rice production in china to fill these knowledge gaps firstly the frequently used water management strategies at the paddy field scale in china were summarized and the optimal paddy water managements were recommended after identifying the critical risk periods of diffuse n and p pollution in the three dominant rice planting areas of china secondly the effects of the water management optimization at the watershed scale and national scale on diffuse n and p pollution control were summarized finally future emerging prospects for a deep understanding of paddy water managements were proposed from the field scale to national scale the main purpose of this study is to deepen the knowledge of paddy water managements and facilitate the extensive application of optimal paddy water managements in china more specifically our analysis mainly focuses on a systematically providing a comprehensive review of the research on paddy water managements and b proposing future research difficulties and emerging prospects at the field watershed and national scales for sustainable rice production of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 identification of critical risk periods of diffuse n and p pollution from paddy fields 2 1 1 analysis of historical precipitation in different rice planting regions to identify the critical risk periods of diffuse n and p pollution for different rice planting regions the historical precipitation in the three major rice planting regions was analyzed the daily precipitation data from 2016 to 2020 for each meteorological site in the three major rice planting regions 441 sites in total supplementary fig s1 were collected from the national meteorological information centre china meteorological administration http data cma cn then the monthly average rainfall amount for each region was calculated for the analysis of the possibility of rainfall runoff events during the rice growing season the daily extreme precipitation for three typical sites with three different cropping systems was calculated the detailed information of cropping systems and rice phenological data of these three typical sites is showed in table s1 the daily precipitation data in the last 30 years were collected and the daily extreme precipitation for each site was defined with the percentile threshold method toride et al 2018 the extreme precipitation frequency for each day during the rice growing season for the last 30 years was numbered and the cumulative extreme precipitation amount for each day was summed then the cumulative extreme precipitation amount for each day was divided by the extreme precipitation frequency and the results were defined as the average daily extreme precipitation for each day the possibility of rainfall runoff events can be evaluated using the index of the average daily extreme precipitation 2 1 2 water quality monitoring of field ponding water after fertilization in different rice cropping system paddy field ponding water is the direct source of surface runoff leading to n and p runoff losses from rice paddy fields and fertilization is main driving factor for the dynamic changes in n and p concentrations in field ponding water ruan et al 2022 therefore the water quality in field ponding water were monitored within two weeks after fertilization at three typical rice planting sites with single rice in the northeast plain 2017 middle rice 2017 2018 and early rice of double rice system 2014 in the yangtze river basin fig s1 there were usually two rounds of n fertilization in northeast plain and three rounds of n fertilization in the yangtze river basin basal fertilization in the preflooding stage top dressing at the early stage of tillering tillering fertilization and top dressing at the beginning of the booting stage panicle fertilization all p fertilizer was applied one time as the basal fertilization the water samples were determined for total n tn and total p tp using the methods described in hua et al 2019a and liu et al 2021a basic information regarding the climate soil properties and fertilization for each site is shown in table s2 2 2 determination of optimal paddy water managements at the paddy field scale 2 2 1 data sources to identify the optimal paddy water managements at the field scale the specific water level regulation data from multi site studies were collected the principal source of such data was the chinese national knowledge infrastructure project cnki to ensure integrity of the datasets only data that satisfied the following criteria were used in subsequent analysis the water management regime must involve the field water level managements for all rice growing stages to get more reasonable paddy water managements the water management regimes which are recommended in the national standards the industry standards of water conservancy and agriculture and local standards of specific provinces were also collected such effective studies covered 30 study literatures 1 national standard 2 industry standards and 1 local standard which involved main rice planting regions and cropping systems in china table s3 and table s4 2 2 2 recommending the appropriate paddy water management regime base on the critical risk periods of diffuse n and p pollution identified in section 2 1 and the collected water management data in section 2 2 1 a new paddy water management regime which includes four water level regulation indexes was recommended the water level regulation indexes of the optimal wsi and the optimal cd managements were adopted to increase the field water storage capacity by lowering the ponding water level using water saving irrigation managements and improving the drainage water level by control drainage without rice yield reduction 3 results and discussion 3 1 water management strategies at the paddy field scale 3 1 1 characteristics of optimized water management strategies water management optimization at the field scale is a critical method to reduce n and p runoff losses and has a better effect than fertilization management optimization fu et al 2021a hitomi et al 2010 many management strategies based on field water management optimization have been proposed and can be categorized into two methods one is to reduce the irrigation amount and irrigation frequency by wsi system and the other is to intercept water and nutrients in paddy fields by cd zhuang et al 2019 liu et al 2021a ishfaq et al 2020 jung et al 2012 fig 1 the water management optimization is a water saving economically viable and ecofriendly alternative to conventional flooding and drainage management according to the scientometrics analysis through citespace software the influence of water managements on the emission of greenhouse gases rice growth soil proprieties and water use efficiency has been widely researched fig s2 compared with traditional management water management optimization results in lower ch4 and nh4 emissions but higher n2o emissions he et al 2020 lagomarsino et al 2016 higher nutrient uptake and less heavy metal accumulation in plants ishfaq et al 2020 higher rice yield or slight yield loss he et al 2020 a more beneficial soil environment for nutrient uptake sandhu et al 2017 less water use and surface runoff and higher water productivity liu et al 2021a wsi regimes such as alternate wetting and drying awd shallow wet irrigation swi intermittent irrigation ii controlled irrigation ci and rain gathering irrigation rgi have been widely applied across rice planting countries he et al 2020 lampayan et al 2010 the main technical strategies for these water managements are summarized in table 1 three critical water indexes are usually used to control the irrigation and drainage of the paddy fields namely lower limit of irrigation lli upper limit of irrigation uli and allowed depth after precipitation rain adr wu et al 2021a the lli is the field ponding water level or soil moisture content that triggers the irrigation operation the uli is the field ponding water level where irrigation ceases and the adr is the maximum ponding water level allowed after precipitation rain wu et al 2021a the percentage of water content of the 30 cm surface soil to the saturated water content of the soil or the soil water potential at the 15 cm soil depth are used as the control index of lli zhuang et al 2019 he et al 2019 awd is the one of the common water saving strategies which could decrease irrigation water usage by 40 and increase water productivity by 34 while increasing yield by 1 6 under mild awd conditions he et al 2019 at the national scale wsi practices are likely to be applicable for 94 19 of the total paddy area in china and the total water saving rate pollutant reducing rate and yield increasing rate are likely to reach 22 06 26 41 32 11 39 11 and 5 39 6 87 respectively with full implementation of appropriate wsi regimes zhuang et al 2019 different from other regimes rgi regime not only adopt water saving irrigation but also use cd optimization management and focuses on rainfall interception effects of paddy fields table 1 this regime increases the water storage capacity of natural precipitation in paddy fields as long as the water level does not prohibit rice growth wu et al 2021a zhuang et al 2019 cd optimization is the other approach to save irrigation water and alleviate surface drainage ideally zero drainage management i e no artificial or natural drainage during the rice growing season is suggested to avoid water and nutrient loss hua et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2007 if there are abundant rainfall which will affect the normal plant growth and lead to yield production drainage operation must be done to avoid the waterlogging damage for rice paddy to ensure normal plant growth and rice yield the optimal drainage water level should be determined according to the waterlogging tolerance at different rice growing stages according to our previous studies the optimal drainage water level is suggested to be 95 180 and 300 mm during the tillering jointing booting and milky stages for two day waterlogging respectively and 80 150 mm during the entire rice growing season liu et al 2021b long duration waterlogging or complete submergence at depths greater than 250 300 mm adversely affected rice yield which should be avoided in rice production singh et al 2017 ismail et al 2013 diffuse n and p runoff losses decreased by more than 27 18 after implementing cd optimization at the field scale liu et al 2021a 2021b 3 1 2 critical risk periods of diffuse pollution in different rice planting regions although current optimized water managements provide guidelines on the water level managements for irrigation and drainage for each stage in the whole rice growing seasons most farmers still use the traditional managements to save labor cost and avoid operation times a paddy field water management for different regions with feasible agronomically and attractive economically operations is in urgent need to for extensive implementation in china the single rice is the main cultivation type for northeast plain whereas middle rice and double rice are the main cultivation type for yangtze river basin and southeast coast the main cultivation type is the transplanting rice before 2000 but the areas using direct seeding rice have gradually increased because of its low economic cost and lower labor force in recent decades zhang et al 2018b kumar et al 2019 sha et al 2019 considering the differences of climate cultivation types and cropping systems the critical risk periods for different rice planting regions need to be specifically identified two important factors for runoff losses namely draining operation artificial draining natural draining due to surface runoff after precipitation and fertilization operation were comprehensive analyzed artificial draining is an important cause of runoff losses in the rice season zhao et al 2012 in traditional paddy water managements an artificial drainage event is usually conducted after steeping the paddy field with a large amount of water for 8 15 days before seeding or transplanting pre flooding stage fig 2 artificial drainage events also occur at the midseason to reduce ineffective tillering and at the mature stage before harvest zhuang et al 2019 it should be pointed out that the artificial drainage at the pre flooding stage contributes the most nutrient losses in the three artificial draining because basal n and p fertilizer are applied in this period moreover to ensure the normal emergence of rice for direct seeding the pre flooding water needs to be totally drained before seeding and no ponding water exists during the sowing stage to the three leaf stage fig 2 compared with transplanted seedling rice direct seeding rice increases soil erosion increase runoff water by 26 76 tn loss by 31 169 and tp loss by 197 483 respectively zhou et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b precipitation is another important cause of runoff loss during the flooding period of rice growth the natural climatic conditions cultivation management cropping system and agricultural water resources are widely different from northeastern to southeastern rice planting regions zhuang et al 2019 hou et al 2016 the critical risk periods for surface runoff loss are supposed to be different in various rice planting areas the climatic characteristics of the three main types of rice cultivation in typical sites were analyzed to assist to identify the critical risk periods of runoff loss fig 3 the yearly rainfall amount increases from 679 mm in the northeast plain to 1257 mm in the yangtze river basin rice area and 1695 mm in the southeastern coast the daily extreme precipitation for the three typical sites in these three areas during the last 30 years was 22 9 mm 48 2 mm and 60 1 mm respectively the precipitation is mainly distributed in the main rice growing season from april to september normally there are usually two or three times fertilization applications in the rice growing season the extreme rainfall during the three fertilization periods was 1 5 d with 35 5 mm for the northeast plain 1 3 d with 111 3 mm for the yangtze river basin and 1 3 d with 113 1 mm in the early rice season and 1 7 d with 142 7 mm in the late rice season for the southeast coast the height of the field ridge is usually approximately 50 mm or even higher thus the frequency of rainfall runoff events during the fertilization period is very few or no in the northeast plain and much higher in the other two regions fertilization is the most important factor for the n and p concentration dynamics of field ponding water and the n and p concentrations in the field ponding water increased sharply on the first day abruptly declined with time and stabilized 1 2 weeks after fertilization ouyang et al 2015 li et al 2020 our field experiments in three typical sites also showed that the n and p concentrations decreased 58 99 and 34 96 within two weeks after fertilization respectively fig 4 the result is consistent with a national review study which proved that n concentrations in the field ponding water could decreased by 79 96 within one week after fertilization ruan et al 2022 if heavy rainfall occurred during the fertilization period the high concentrations of field ponding water would result in significant runoff losses hua et al 2019a overall the two weeks after fertilization are critical for diffuse n and p pollution mitigation and efficient paddy water managements should be implemented in these periods therefore comprehensively considering the fertilization artificial draining operation cultivation system and climatic conditions in different rice planting regions the critical risk periods of diffuse n and p pollution are pre flooding in the northeast plain the pre flooding regreening stage for transplanting rice the seeding three leaf stage for direct seeding rice and within 2 weeks after topdressing fertilization usually tillering fertilization and panicle fertilization are identified to be the critical risk periods for yangtze river basin and southeast coast 3 1 3 optimal water management for different rice planting regions pre flooding period is one of the critical risk periods for three rice planting regions the key management is to avoid flood irrigation and the irrigation amount should be determined according to the soil leakage evaporation days of soaking rainfall and the appropriate water level depth of the field ponding water level when sowing or transplanting guo et al 1997 for the seeding three leaf stage for the direct seeding rice in the yangtze river basin and southeast coast wet irrigating regime is recommended and there should be no water layer on the field surface in this stage to ensure normal emergence of rice for the other three critical risk periods for the yangtze river basin and southeast coast water control and drainage reduction wcdr regime were recommended table 1 and table 2 different from the previous water management regimes wcdr regime was proposed based on four water indexes uli allowed field ponding water level apwl allowed waterlogging depth after rain awder and allowed waterlogging duration after rain awdur the uli index in three critical risk periods are recommended base on the values of uli indexes in table s3 and table s4 the apwl index are recommended base on the information in table s3 and table s4 and wide investigation from the academy of agricultural sciences of main rice planting provinces considering the waterlogging tolerance of rice a certain waterlogging height for a period of time does not prohibit rice growth the awder and awdur indexes are recommended base on the national standard on the design of irrigation and drainage engineering mhurd 2018 the information in table s3 and table s4 and our previous researches liu et al 2021b if optimal water management is widely applied for example with government incentive policies it will represent a large step forward in effective diffuse pollution control and sustainable agricultural development in rice planting areas of china 3 2 water management strategies at the paddy field watershed scale 3 2 1 transportation of nitrogen and phosphorus at the paddy field watershed according to the research hotspots and evolution analysis fig s2 paddy water management extends from the field scale to watershed scale and its effects on river ecosystems in the catchment have attracted research attention in paddy dominated watersheds paddy fields are usually connected with natural or artificial ditches and ponds liu et al 2021a baba and tanaka 2016 usio et al 2017 ditches and ponds not only serve as canal links and temporary reservoirs for paddy field drainage water but also serve as water sources by cycling irrigation hama et al 2011 li et al 2019 the intercepted rainfall drainage water and n p nutrients stored in ditches and ponds can also be reused by rice plants improving the water and fertilizer use efficiencies fig 5 the water and nutrient retention rates of ditches and ponds depend on various factors such as the hydrological connectivity hydraulic residence time water storage capacity temperature location and runoff influent concentration sun et al 2021a yan et al 1998 zhang et al 2019 in addition plants and sediments exist in ditches and ponds resulting in complex physical chemical and biological processes that occur in the system 3 2 2 diffuse pollution reduction effects of water management strategies generally ditches and ponds are considered sinks for n and p pollution but they may become occasionally saturated and transform to sources especially during the winter or when heavy rain occurs shen et al 2021 the effectiveness of ditches and ponds in reducing diffuse n and p pollution varied widely across different climatic and geographic regions therefore the limitation of temperature for the application of ditches and ponds needs to be considered in paddy field watersheds natural plants and part concrete are the recommended ditch and pond designs considering the general n and p retention capacity in addition the uneven distribution of ditches and ponds is another major limiting factor of their water quality function in agricultural watersheds jia et al 2019 improving hydraulic conditions will further strengthen the ecological service functions of ditches and ponds to compare the effects of optimal management in the paddy field watershed the effectiveness on rice yield water use and diffuse pollution was obtained from recent literatures table 3 in paddy fields a meta analysis indicated that optimized management decreased irrigation water use and diffuse pollution by 38 7 40 0 and 25 5 38 8 respectively without significant yield changes 4 20 to 6 5 zhuang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 he et al 2020 liao et al 2021 in the ditch and pond approximately 6 0 39 0 of diffuse pollution from the paddy fields would be intercepted shen et al 2021 li et al 2020 jia et al 2019 after the adoption of optimal management in the paddy field pitch pond system diffuse pollution would decrease by 40 7 80 8 xiong et al 2015 xue et al 2020 liu et al 2021a 3 2 3 diffuse pollution modeling in the paddy field watershed to get knowledge of the n and p transportation at the paddy field watershed in situ monitoring experiments are usually conducted hua et al 2019a liu et al 2021a zhao et al 2012 however routine in situ monitoring is time consuming and labor costing and cannot generate complete information on the spatial patterns buczko et al 2010 therefore several models at different scales have been developed such as ceres rice oryza rice and dndc rice for field scale and swat walrus and hspf for watershed scale ouyang et al 2020 jeong et al 2016 given the complex hydrology and nutrient cycling of paddy fields due to the field ponding status and specific irrigation and drainage system many model modifications have been developed for example walrus paddy model with controlling irrigation and drainage scheme has been developed for the lowland polders with paddy fields yan et al 2016 modified swat models are developed for modeling diffuse pollution of large rice paddy fields ouyang et al 2020 and simulating the reuse of ponds and rive water in the paddy field watershed wu et al 2021b the natural artificial transport paths and related hydrological connectivity affected by ditch networks has also been considered in the watershed modeling sun et al 2021b moreover new modeling framework has been developed to describe the complex transport and removal processes of ditches and ponds across spatial scales sun et al 2021a the effectiveness of optimized individual management strategy i e paddy field ditches and ponds and comprehensive optimization on the fate of diffuse pollutant has also been estimated using modified swat model liu et al 2021a although lots of works and development have been done for diffuse pollution modeling at the paddy field watershed the complex transport processes characterizing of water and pollutants pose significant challenges in accurately quantifying pollution loading specially previous modeling studies have mainly focused on the lateral migration of pollutants whereas the process of interaction between groundwater and surface water is rarely considered in the pollutant migration modeling yan et al 2016 in many rice planting regions of the yangtze river basin and southeast coast the groundwater level is generally high and shows significant fluctuations and strong interaction with soil water huang et al 2018 this interaction and its influence on the effects of water managements on diffuse pollution should be considered in future model development furthermore although the natural artificial transport paths and related hydrological connectivity effected by ditches networks have been considered more attentions should be put on exploring the optimization of specific common allocations of ponds and ditches using hydrological modeling in future work 3 3 water management strategies at the national scale recognizing the paramount importance of water resources and the serious water shortage many agricultural water conservation policies have been brought out in china most large and medium sized irrigation districts had been built with the government support between 1950 and 1980 liu et al 2013 the implementation of agricultural water saving measures had been promoted in the water saving society policy which first appeared in the tenth five year plan 2001 2005 ndrc 2001 the national agricultural water conservation outline was proposed to improve the water saving irrigation technology in 2012 xu and yang 2022 with joint efforts of government farmers and other departments the water saving irrigation areas had reached 37 8 million ha and 62 of these areas were irrigated with high efficiency water saving irrigation by the end of 2020 zhang and oki 2023 the total irrigation amount of paddy fields had decreased by approximately 11 17 million m3 due to the adoption of highly efficient irrigation water technologies liu et al 2021b although many efforts have resulted in significant improvement in water use efficiency of paddy fields the national agricultural irrigation water is still in great demand and the effective irrigation use coefficient is far below the world advanced level zhang and oki 2023 more effective paddy water managements such as the optimal irrigation and drainage managements at the field scale promoted in this study and the ditch pond landscape pattern as temporary reservoirs for field discharge and irrigation water sources in the watershed scale are suggested to be promoted and applied extensively in the national scale several researches have estimated the national n and p runoff losses from paddy fields and the reduction effects of different water management optimization national n and p runoff losses from rice paddies were estimated to be 272 6 101 2 gg n yr 1 and 17 0 6 4 gg p yr 1 by using national model and the national n and p surface runoff losses would decreased by 56 6 after control drainage by increasing weir outlet height 44 7 after water saving irrigation and 88 1 after irrigation drainage fertilization optimization respectively fu et al 2021a if appropriate wsi regimes were full implementation at the national scale the total water use and diffuse pollution will be reduced by 22 06 26 41 and 32 11 39 11 respectively zhuang et al 2019 after applying drainage optimization management more than 21 18 diffuse pollution could be reduced at the field scale and 0 19 tg yr 1 n runoff loss will be reduced combined with optimal drainage and fertilization management at the national scale liu et al 2021b these abovementioned national estimations of diffuse pollution are mainly focused on the effectiveness of water management optimization at the field scale whereas the water saving and pollution reduction effects of both irrigation and drainage optimization at field scale and utilization of water conservancy projects in watershed scale are rarely estimated in addition there is a need to balance the benefits derived from water management optimization with the associated society economic and environmental costs the environmental cost assessment could provide guidance for emerging policy priorities in mitigating diffuse pollution after quantifying its loading amount and damage costs to ecosystems chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2018a 3 4 future emerging prospects of paddy water managements in china this review provides a comprehensive understanding of specific strategies of current paddy water managements at different scales from the current review it can be concluded that deeper understanding and efforts are urgently needed in researching the following emerging prospects first at the field scale the planting area of direct seeding rice has continuously increased in recent years in china because it can save more labor and water usage for farmers sha et al 2019 however compared with transplanting rice direct seeding rice could lead to more n and p runoff losses probably due to the low nutrient uptake during the early rice growth period zhang et al 2018b therefore more effective fertilization strategies such as postponing and reducing basal nitrogen application deep placement of fertilizers and controlled released fertilizers fu et al 2021b ke et al 2018 should be applied with irrigation and drainage management optimization to alleviate the negative effects of direct seeding rice production on n and p runoff losses from paddy fields second at the watershed scale the layout and distribution of ditches and ponds and the hydrological process of complex interactions among the surface water and groundwater in the paddy field watershed still need to be studied thoroughly last but not least at the national scale the social environmental and economic benefits of water management optimization from field idu to watershed need to be comprehensively evaluated to seek environmental friendly water management for sustainable rice production in china 4 conclusions in this study a comprehensive review of paddy water managements for diffuse n and p pollution control in china was conducted from multiple perspectives the specific strategies of frequent used paddy water managements the critical risk periods of diffuse n and p pollution and the corresponding optimal water management for different rice planting regions and the specific strategies of optimized irrigation and drainage management and the corresponding effects on rice ecosystems at the watershed scale and national scale paddy water management optimization at different scales is a promising profitable and ecofriendly technology for sustainable rice production globally at field scale the adoption of optimal paddy water management improves water use efficiency reduces diffuse pollution and maintains or even increases rice yield compared to conventional water managements at watershed scale full utilization of ditches and ponds would intercept water and nutrients and decrease n and p runoff losses based on the current review three emerging prospects related to further paddy water managements are proposed more effective water managements combined with fertilization optimization requires further research on direct seeding rice the layout and distribution of ditches and ponds and the hydrological connectivity analysis of complex networks in the paddy field watershed still need to be studied thoroughly for wide adoption of water management optimization at the national scale the environmental and

9108,due to the frequent irrigation and excessive fertilization during the rice production in china diffuse nitrogen n and phosphorus p pollution from paddy fields has become a serious environment problem and poses great challenges to national water and food security considering the regional heterogeneities of climate cultivation types and cropping systems of rice planting many water management strategies have been proposed and implemented to control diffuse n and p pollution however the water management optimization at different scales the field scale the watershed scale and national scale is lack of comprehensive analyzed here this paper summarized the characteristics of frequent used water managements and recommended the optimal water managements after identifying the critical risk periods of diffuse n and p runoff losses at the field scale the effects of water management optimization on diffuse n and p pollution control at the watershed and national scale were also synthetically reviewed the results indicated that optimized field water management decreased irrigation water use 38 7 40 0 and reduced diffuse pollution 25 5 38 8 without significantly compromising rice yield security 4 20 to 6 5 the critical risk periods of diffuse pollution were pre flooding in the northeast plain pre flooding regreening stage for transplanting rice the seeding three leaf stage for direct seeding rice and within 2 weeks after topdressing fertilization in the yangtze river basin and southeast coast in china the corresponding water managements for these periods has been proposed after considering the climate precipitation and fertilization characteristics ditches and ponds intercepted water and nutrients and mitigated 6 0 39 0 n and p runoff losses in paddy field watersheds furthermore the extensive implementation of paddy water management optimization paddy fields ditches and ponds combined with other advanced agricultural measures for example fertilization optimization would decrease diffuse n and p pollution by 40 7 80 8 at the watershed scale and 44 7 88 1 at the national scale respectively this research provided great insights into the specific characteristics of paddy water managements from the fields watershed and national scale proposed optimal water management strategies for the realization of sustainable rice production in china and also summarized the emerging development trends for future research directions graphical abstract ga1 keywords critical risk period diffuse pollution ditches and ponds paddy field watershed water management optimization 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l a staple food for more than half of the world s population consumes 50 of global irrigation water and 14 of global fertilizer uses ifa and ipni 2017 yunus et al 2013 zhao et al 2017 sustainable rice production faces great challenges as it is confronted with water shortages and increasing irrigation water requirements in the future and global rice production needs to increase by 28 by 2050 alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 devkota et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2015 moreover frequent irrigation and excessive fertilization in paddy fields lead to a potential high risk of diffuse pollution to surrounding waterbodies through surface runoff maruyama et al 2008 zhuang et al 2019 chen et al 2022 specially nitrogen n and phosphorus p runoff loss have been highly concerned globally because n and p are vital nutrients for rice growth and critical causes of water deterioration bowles et al 2018 goyette et al 2018 liu et al 2021a as one of the major rice planting countries china accounts for 19 and 32 of the global rice yield and harvested area respectively by consuming 65 and 14 of the national agricultural water use and fertilizer use respectively fao 2019 zhuang et al 2019 n and p runoff losses from paddy fields were evaluated to be the second largest agricultural pollution source in china fu et al 2021a therefore deep understanding of the current paddy water managements and proposing highly effective management strategies to improve water use efficiency and mitigate diffuse n and p pollution are critical for the water and food security in china rice planting with diverse rice cropping systems e g single rice middle rice and double rice and cultivation types e g transplanting rice and direct seeding rice are widely distributed in the mainland china from the northeast plain with a temperate monsoon climate to the yangtze river basin and southeast coast with a subtropical monsoon climate ruan et al 2022 zhang et al 2018a optimized paddy water managements such as water saving irrigation wsi and control drainage cd have been applied since the 1980s and are increasingly implemented in recent decades gu and zhao 2012 zhuang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 substantial scientific evidence proves the effectiveness of optimized water managements in improving rice yield and water productivity and decreasing diffuse pollution liu et al 2021b he et al 2020 ishfaq et al 2020 however the specific water managements strategies such as the optimal time of irrigation and drainage the optimal field ponding water level for irrigation and drainage operations varied at different researches he et al 2020 wang et al 2020 even in the same rice planting region with same cultivation system moreover the regional heterogeneities of climatic conditions cultivation types and cropping system give rise to the significant variability of n and p runoff losses over time and space fu et al 2021a hou et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 to effective mitigate the n and p runoff losses from paddy fields and reduce labor costs it is imperative to first identify the critical risk periods for diffuse pollution for different rice planting regions liu et al 2021b the optimal integrated irrigation and drainage managements for these critical risk periods which would be feasible agronomically and attractive economically to reduce diffuse pollution and maintain high rice yield are still lacking apart from optimizing paddy water managements at field scale the effectiveness of agricultural water conservancy projects e g ditches and ponds around the fields at the paddy field watershed are getting more attentions in recent decades sun et al 2021a jia et al 2019 kumwimba et al 2018 the paddy irrigation and drainage unit idu which is compose of fields ditches and a pond if existed is widely distributed in the rice planting regions especially in the yangtze river basin and southeast coast of china li et al 2020 natural or artificial ecological ditches and ponds alter the water cycle as well as the transfer and fate of nutrients in the idu system hua et al 2019a 2019b liu et al 2021a in fact numerous site level studies have examined the interception and purification effects of ditches and ponds and analyzed different influence factors on the diffuse pollution removal rate shen et al 2021 jia et al 2019 moreover the effectiveness of optimized ditches and ponds management strategies have been evaluated in the paddy field watershed using hydrologic models liu et al 2021a sun et al 2021b although much attention has been given to different paddy water managements both in field and watershed scale the mitigation effectiveness on diffuse n and p losses across different spatial scales have rarely been reviewed systematically the comprehensive evaluation of paddy water managements at different scales paddy field watershed and national scale is in urgent need to provide future research directions and tailored policy suggestion for sustainable agricultural water management and rice production in china to fill these knowledge gaps firstly the frequently used water management strategies at the paddy field scale in china were summarized and the optimal paddy water managements were recommended after identifying the critical risk periods of diffuse n and p pollution in the three dominant rice planting areas of china secondly the effects of the water management optimization at the watershed scale and national scale on diffuse n and p pollution control were summarized finally future emerging prospects for a deep understanding of paddy water managements were proposed from the field scale to national scale the main purpose of this study is to deepen the knowledge of paddy water managements and facilitate the extensive application of optimal paddy water managements in china more specifically our analysis mainly focuses on a systematically providing a comprehensive review of the research on paddy water managements and b proposing future research difficulties and emerging prospects at the field watershed and national scales for sustainable rice production of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 identification of critical risk periods of diffuse n and p pollution from paddy fields 2 1 1 analysis of historical precipitation in different rice planting regions to identify the critical risk periods of diffuse n and p pollution for different rice planting regions the historical precipitation in the three major rice planting regions was analyzed the daily precipitation data from 2016 to 2020 for each meteorological site in the three major rice planting regions 441 sites in total supplementary fig s1 were collected from the national meteorological information centre china meteorological administration http data cma cn then the monthly average rainfall amount for each region was calculated for the analysis of the possibility of rainfall runoff events during the rice growing season the daily extreme precipitation for three typical sites with three different cropping systems was calculated the detailed information of cropping systems and rice phenological data of these three typical sites is showed in table s1 the daily precipitation data in the last 30 years were collected and the daily extreme precipitation for each site was defined with the percentile threshold method toride et al 2018 the extreme precipitation frequency for each day during the rice growing season for the last 30 years was numbered and the cumulative extreme precipitation amount for each day was summed then the cumulative extreme precipitation amount for each day was divided by the extreme precipitation frequency and the results were defined as the average daily extreme precipitation for each day the possibility of rainfall runoff events can be evaluated using the index of the average daily extreme precipitation 2 1 2 water quality monitoring of field ponding water after fertilization in different rice cropping system paddy field ponding water is the direct source of surface runoff leading to n and p runoff losses from rice paddy fields and fertilization is main driving factor for the dynamic changes in n and p concentrations in field ponding water ruan et al 2022 therefore the water quality in field ponding water were monitored within two weeks after fertilization at three typical rice planting sites with single rice in the northeast plain 2017 middle rice 2017 2018 and early rice of double rice system 2014 in the yangtze river basin fig s1 there were usually two rounds of n fertilization in northeast plain and three rounds of n fertilization in the yangtze river basin basal fertilization in the preflooding stage top dressing at the early stage of tillering tillering fertilization and top dressing at the beginning of the booting stage panicle fertilization all p fertilizer was applied one time as the basal fertilization the water samples were determined for total n tn and total p tp using the methods described in hua et al 2019a and liu et al 2021a basic information regarding the climate soil properties and fertilization for each site is shown in table s2 2 2 determination of optimal paddy water managements at the paddy field scale 2 2 1 data sources to identify the optimal paddy water managements at the field scale the specific water level regulation data from multi site studies were collected the principal source of such data was the chinese national knowledge infrastructure project cnki to ensure integrity of the datasets only data that satisfied the following criteria were used in subsequent analysis the water management regime must involve the field water level managements for all rice growing stages to get more reasonable paddy water managements the water management regimes which are recommended in the national standards the industry standards of water conservancy and agriculture and local standards of specific provinces were also collected such effective studies covered 30 study literatures 1 national standard 2 industry standards and 1 local standard which involved main rice planting regions and cropping systems in china table s3 and table s4 2 2 2 recommending the appropriate paddy water management regime base on the critical risk periods of diffuse n and p pollution identified in section 2 1 and the collected water management data in section 2 2 1 a new paddy water management regime which includes four water level regulation indexes was recommended the water level regulation indexes of the optimal wsi and the optimal cd managements were adopted to increase the field water storage capacity by lowering the ponding water level using water saving irrigation managements and improving the drainage water level by control drainage without rice yield reduction 3 results and discussion 3 1 water management strategies at the paddy field scale 3 1 1 characteristics of optimized water management strategies water management optimization at the field scale is a critical method to reduce n and p runoff losses and has a better effect than fertilization management optimization fu et al 2021a hitomi et al 2010 many management strategies based on field water management optimization have been proposed and can be categorized into two methods one is to reduce the irrigation amount and irrigation frequency by wsi system and the other is to intercept water and nutrients in paddy fields by cd zhuang et al 2019 liu et al 2021a ishfaq et al 2020 jung et al 2012 fig 1 the water management optimization is a water saving economically viable and ecofriendly alternative to conventional flooding and drainage management according to the scientometrics analysis through citespace software the influence of water managements on the emission of greenhouse gases rice growth soil proprieties and water use efficiency has been widely researched fig s2 compared with traditional management water management optimization results in lower ch4 and nh4 emissions but higher n2o emissions he et al 2020 lagomarsino et al 2016 higher nutrient uptake and less heavy metal accumulation in plants ishfaq et al 2020 higher rice yield or slight yield loss he et al 2020 a more beneficial soil environment for nutrient uptake sandhu et al 2017 less water use and surface runoff and higher water productivity liu et al 2021a wsi regimes such as alternate wetting and drying awd shallow wet irrigation swi intermittent irrigation ii controlled irrigation ci and rain gathering irrigation rgi have been widely applied across rice planting countries he et al 2020 lampayan et al 2010 the main technical strategies for these water managements are summarized in table 1 three critical water indexes are usually used to control the irrigation and drainage of the paddy fields namely lower limit of irrigation lli upper limit of irrigation uli and allowed depth after precipitation rain adr wu et al 2021a the lli is the field ponding water level or soil moisture content that triggers the irrigation operation the uli is the field ponding water level where irrigation ceases and the adr is the maximum ponding water level allowed after precipitation rain wu et al 2021a the percentage of water content of the 30 cm surface soil to the saturated water content of the soil or the soil water potential at the 15 cm soil depth are used as the control index of lli zhuang et al 2019 he et al 2019 awd is the one of the common water saving strategies which could decrease irrigation water usage by 40 and increase water productivity by 34 while increasing yield by 1 6 under mild awd conditions he et al 2019 at the national scale wsi practices are likely to be applicable for 94 19 of the total paddy area in china and the total water saving rate pollutant reducing rate and yield increasing rate are likely to reach 22 06 26 41 32 11 39 11 and 5 39 6 87 respectively with full implementation of appropriate wsi regimes zhuang et al 2019 different from other regimes rgi regime not only adopt water saving irrigation but also use cd optimization management and focuses on rainfall interception effects of paddy fields table 1 this regime increases the water storage capacity of natural precipitation in paddy fields as long as the water level does not prohibit rice growth wu et al 2021a zhuang et al 2019 cd optimization is the other approach to save irrigation water and alleviate surface drainage ideally zero drainage management i e no artificial or natural drainage during the rice growing season is suggested to avoid water and nutrient loss hua et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2007 if there are abundant rainfall which will affect the normal plant growth and lead to yield production drainage operation must be done to avoid the waterlogging damage for rice paddy to ensure normal plant growth and rice yield the optimal drainage water level should be determined according to the waterlogging tolerance at different rice growing stages according to our previous studies the optimal drainage water level is suggested to be 95 180 and 300 mm during the tillering jointing booting and milky stages for two day waterlogging respectively and 80 150 mm during the entire rice growing season liu et al 2021b long duration waterlogging or complete submergence at depths greater than 250 300 mm adversely affected rice yield which should be avoided in rice production singh et al 2017 ismail et al 2013 diffuse n and p runoff losses decreased by more than 27 18 after implementing cd optimization at the field scale liu et al 2021a 2021b 3 1 2 critical risk periods of diffuse pollution in different rice planting regions although current optimized water managements provide guidelines on the water level managements for irrigation and drainage for each stage in the whole rice growing seasons most farmers still use the traditional managements to save labor cost and avoid operation times a paddy field water management for different regions with feasible agronomically and attractive economically operations is in urgent need to for extensive implementation in china the single rice is the main cultivation type for northeast plain whereas middle rice and double rice are the main cultivation type for yangtze river basin and southeast coast the main cultivation type is the transplanting rice before 2000 but the areas using direct seeding rice have gradually increased because of its low economic cost and lower labor force in recent decades zhang et al 2018b kumar et al 2019 sha et al 2019 considering the differences of climate cultivation types and cropping systems the critical risk periods for different rice planting regions need to be specifically identified two important factors for runoff losses namely draining operation artificial draining natural draining due to surface runoff after precipitation and fertilization operation were comprehensive analyzed artificial draining is an important cause of runoff losses in the rice season zhao et al 2012 in traditional paddy water managements an artificial drainage event is usually conducted after steeping the paddy field with a large amount of water for 8 15 days before seeding or transplanting pre flooding stage fig 2 artificial drainage events also occur at the midseason to reduce ineffective tillering and at the mature stage before harvest zhuang et al 2019 it should be pointed out that the artificial drainage at the pre flooding stage contributes the most nutrient losses in the three artificial draining because basal n and p fertilizer are applied in this period moreover to ensure the normal emergence of rice for direct seeding the pre flooding water needs to be totally drained before seeding and no ponding water exists during the sowing stage to the three leaf stage fig 2 compared with transplanted seedling rice direct seeding rice increases soil erosion increase runoff water by 26 76 tn loss by 31 169 and tp loss by 197 483 respectively zhou et al 2019 zhang et al 2018b precipitation is another important cause of runoff loss during the flooding period of rice growth the natural climatic conditions cultivation management cropping system and agricultural water resources are widely different from northeastern to southeastern rice planting regions zhuang et al 2019 hou et al 2016 the critical risk periods for surface runoff loss are supposed to be different in various rice planting areas the climatic characteristics of the three main types of rice cultivation in typical sites were analyzed to assist to identify the critical risk periods of runoff loss fig 3 the yearly rainfall amount increases from 679 mm in the northeast plain to 1257 mm in the yangtze river basin rice area and 1695 mm in the southeastern coast the daily extreme precipitation for the three typical sites in these three areas during the last 30 years was 22 9 mm 48 2 mm and 60 1 mm respectively the precipitation is mainly distributed in the main rice growing season from april to september normally there are usually two or three times fertilization applications in the rice growing season the extreme rainfall during the three fertilization periods was 1 5 d with 35 5 mm for the northeast plain 1 3 d with 111 3 mm for the yangtze river basin and 1 3 d with 113 1 mm in the early rice season and 1 7 d with 142 7 mm in the late rice season for the southeast coast the height of the field ridge is usually approximately 50 mm or even higher thus the frequency of rainfall runoff events during the fertilization period is very few or no in the northeast plain and much higher in the other two regions fertilization is the most important factor for the n and p concentration dynamics of field ponding water and the n and p concentrations in the field ponding water increased sharply on the first day abruptly declined with time and stabilized 1 2 weeks after fertilization ouyang et al 2015 li et al 2020 our field experiments in three typical sites also showed that the n and p concentrations decreased 58 99 and 34 96 within two weeks after fertilization respectively fig 4 the result is consistent with a national review study which proved that n concentrations in the field ponding water could decreased by 79 96 within one week after fertilization ruan et al 2022 if heavy rainfall occurred during the fertilization period the high concentrations of field ponding water would result in significant runoff losses hua et al 2019a overall the two weeks after fertilization are critical for diffuse n and p pollution mitigation and efficient paddy water managements should be implemented in these periods therefore comprehensively considering the fertilization artificial draining operation cultivation system and climatic conditions in different rice planting regions the critical risk periods of diffuse n and p pollution are pre flooding in the northeast plain the pre flooding regreening stage for transplanting rice the seeding three leaf stage for direct seeding rice and within 2 weeks after topdressing fertilization usually tillering fertilization and panicle fertilization are identified to be the critical risk periods for yangtze river basin and southeast coast 3 1 3 optimal water management for different rice planting regions pre flooding period is one of the critical risk periods for three rice planting regions the key management is to avoid flood irrigation and the irrigation amount should be determined according to the soil leakage evaporation days of soaking rainfall and the appropriate water level depth of the field ponding water level when sowing or transplanting guo et al 1997 for the seeding three leaf stage for the direct seeding rice in the yangtze river basin and southeast coast wet irrigating regime is recommended and there should be no water layer on the field surface in this stage to ensure normal emergence of rice for the other three critical risk periods for the yangtze river basin and southeast coast water control and drainage reduction wcdr regime were recommended table 1 and table 2 different from the previous water management regimes wcdr regime was proposed based on four water indexes uli allowed field ponding water level apwl allowed waterlogging depth after rain awder and allowed waterlogging duration after rain awdur the uli index in three critical risk periods are recommended base on the values of uli indexes in table s3 and table s4 the apwl index are recommended base on the information in table s3 and table s4 and wide investigation from the academy of agricultural sciences of main rice planting provinces considering the waterlogging tolerance of rice a certain waterlogging height for a period of time does not prohibit rice growth the awder and awdur indexes are recommended base on the national standard on the design of irrigation and drainage engineering mhurd 2018 the information in table s3 and table s4 and our previous researches liu et al 2021b if optimal water management is widely applied for example with government incentive policies it will represent a large step forward in effective diffuse pollution control and sustainable agricultural development in rice planting areas of china 3 2 water management strategies at the paddy field watershed scale 3 2 1 transportation of nitrogen and phosphorus at the paddy field watershed according to the research hotspots and evolution analysis fig s2 paddy water management extends from the field scale to watershed scale and its effects on river ecosystems in the catchment have attracted research attention in paddy dominated watersheds paddy fields are usually connected with natural or artificial ditches and ponds liu et al 2021a baba and tanaka 2016 usio et al 2017 ditches and ponds not only serve as canal links and temporary reservoirs for paddy field drainage water but also serve as water sources by cycling irrigation hama et al 2011 li et al 2019 the intercepted rainfall drainage water and n p nutrients stored in ditches and ponds can also be reused by rice plants improving the water and fertilizer use efficiencies fig 5 the water and nutrient retention rates of ditches and ponds depend on various factors such as the hydrological connectivity hydraulic residence time water storage capacity temperature location and runoff influent concentration sun et al 2021a yan et al 1998 zhang et al 2019 in addition plants and sediments exist in ditches and ponds resulting in complex physical chemical and biological processes that occur in the system 3 2 2 diffuse pollution reduction effects of water management strategies generally ditches and ponds are considered sinks for n and p pollution but they may become occasionally saturated and transform to sources especially during the winter or when heavy rain occurs shen et al 2021 the effectiveness of ditches and ponds in reducing diffuse n and p pollution varied widely across different climatic and geographic regions therefore the limitation of temperature for the application of ditches and ponds needs to be considered in paddy field watersheds natural plants and part concrete are the recommended ditch and pond designs considering the general n and p retention capacity in addition the uneven distribution of ditches and ponds is another major limiting factor of their water quality function in agricultural watersheds jia et al 2019 improving hydraulic conditions will further strengthen the ecological service functions of ditches and ponds to compare the effects of optimal management in the paddy field watershed the effectiveness on rice yield water use and diffuse pollution was obtained from recent literatures table 3 in paddy fields a meta analysis indicated that optimized management decreased irrigation water use and diffuse pollution by 38 7 40 0 and 25 5 38 8 respectively without significant yield changes 4 20 to 6 5 zhuang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 he et al 2020 liao et al 2021 in the ditch and pond approximately 6 0 39 0 of diffuse pollution from the paddy fields would be intercepted shen et al 2021 li et al 2020 jia et al 2019 after the adoption of optimal management in the paddy field pitch pond system diffuse pollution would decrease by 40 7 80 8 xiong et al 2015 xue et al 2020 liu et al 2021a 3 2 3 diffuse pollution modeling in the paddy field watershed to get knowledge of the n and p transportation at the paddy field watershed in situ monitoring experiments are usually conducted hua et al 2019a liu et al 2021a zhao et al 2012 however routine in situ monitoring is time consuming and labor costing and cannot generate complete information on the spatial patterns buczko et al 2010 therefore several models at different scales have been developed such as ceres rice oryza rice and dndc rice for field scale and swat walrus and hspf for watershed scale ouyang et al 2020 jeong et al 2016 given the complex hydrology and nutrient cycling of paddy fields due to the field ponding status and specific irrigation and drainage system many model modifications have been developed for example walrus paddy model with controlling irrigation and drainage scheme has been developed for the lowland polders with paddy fields yan et al 2016 modified swat models are developed for modeling diffuse pollution of large rice paddy fields ouyang et al 2020 and simulating the reuse of ponds and rive water in the paddy field watershed wu et al 2021b the natural artificial transport paths and related hydrological connectivity affected by ditch networks has also been considered in the watershed modeling sun et al 2021b moreover new modeling framework has been developed to describe the complex transport and removal processes of ditches and ponds across spatial scales sun et al 2021a the effectiveness of optimized individual management strategy i e paddy field ditches and ponds and comprehensive optimization on the fate of diffuse pollutant has also been estimated using modified swat model liu et al 2021a although lots of works and development have been done for diffuse pollution modeling at the paddy field watershed the complex transport processes characterizing of water and pollutants pose significant challenges in accurately quantifying pollution loading specially previous modeling studies have mainly focused on the lateral migration of pollutants whereas the process of interaction between groundwater and surface water is rarely considered in the pollutant migration modeling yan et al 2016 in many rice planting regions of the yangtze river basin and southeast coast the groundwater level is generally high and shows significant fluctuations and strong interaction with soil water huang et al 2018 this interaction and its influence on the effects of water managements on diffuse pollution should be considered in future model development furthermore although the natural artificial transport paths and related hydrological connectivity effected by ditches networks have been considered more attentions should be put on exploring the optimization of specific common allocations of ponds and ditches using hydrological modeling in future work 3 3 water management strategies at the national scale recognizing the paramount importance of water resources and the serious water shortage many agricultural water conservation policies have been brought out in china most large and medium sized irrigation districts had been built with the government support between 1950 and 1980 liu et al 2013 the implementation of agricultural water saving measures had been promoted in the water saving society policy which first appeared in the tenth five year plan 2001 2005 ndrc 2001 the national agricultural water conservation outline was proposed to improve the water saving irrigation technology in 2012 xu and yang 2022 with joint efforts of government farmers and other departments the water saving irrigation areas had reached 37 8 million ha and 62 of these areas were irrigated with high efficiency water saving irrigation by the end of 2020 zhang and oki 2023 the total irrigation amount of paddy fields had decreased by approximately 11 17 million m3 due to the adoption of highly efficient irrigation water technologies liu et al 2021b although many efforts have resulted in significant improvement in water use efficiency of paddy fields the national agricultural irrigation water is still in great demand and the effective irrigation use coefficient is far below the world advanced level zhang and oki 2023 more effective paddy water managements such as the optimal irrigation and drainage managements at the field scale promoted in this study and the ditch pond landscape pattern as temporary reservoirs for field discharge and irrigation water sources in the watershed scale are suggested to be promoted and applied extensively in the national scale several researches have estimated the national n and p runoff losses from paddy fields and the reduction effects of different water management optimization national n and p runoff losses from rice paddies were estimated to be 272 6 101 2 gg n yr 1 and 17 0 6 4 gg p yr 1 by using national model and the national n and p surface runoff losses would decreased by 56 6 after control drainage by increasing weir outlet height 44 7 after water saving irrigation and 88 1 after irrigation drainage fertilization optimization respectively fu et al 2021a if appropriate wsi regimes were full implementation at the national scale the total water use and diffuse pollution will be reduced by 22 06 26 41 and 32 11 39 11 respectively zhuang et al 2019 after applying drainage optimization management more than 21 18 diffuse pollution could be reduced at the field scale and 0 19 tg yr 1 n runoff loss will be reduced combined with optimal drainage and fertilization management at the national scale liu et al 2021b these abovementioned national estimations of diffuse pollution are mainly focused on the effectiveness of water management optimization at the field scale whereas the water saving and pollution reduction effects of both irrigation and drainage optimization at field scale and utilization of water conservancy projects in watershed scale are rarely estimated in addition there is a need to balance the benefits derived from water management optimization with the associated society economic and environmental costs the environmental cost assessment could provide guidance for emerging policy priorities in mitigating diffuse pollution after quantifying its loading amount and damage costs to ecosystems chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2018a 3 4 future emerging prospects of paddy water managements in china this review provides a comprehensive understanding of specific strategies of current paddy water managements at different scales from the current review it can be concluded that deeper understanding and efforts are urgently needed in researching the following emerging prospects first at the field scale the planting area of direct seeding rice has continuously increased in recent years in china because it can save more labor and water usage for farmers sha et al 2019 however compared with transplanting rice direct seeding rice could lead to more n and p runoff losses probably due to the low nutrient uptake during the early rice growth period zhang et al 2018b therefore more effective fertilization strategies such as postponing and reducing basal nitrogen application deep placement of fertilizers and controlled released fertilizers fu et al 2021b ke et al 2018 should be applied with irrigation and drainage management optimization to alleviate the negative effects of direct seeding rice production on n and p runoff losses from paddy fields second at the watershed scale the layout and distribution of ditches and ponds and the hydrological process of complex interactions among the surface water and groundwater in the paddy field watershed still need to be studied thoroughly last but not least at the national scale the social environmental and economic benefits of water management optimization from field idu to watershed need to be comprehensively evaluated to seek environmental friendly water management for sustainable rice production in china 4 conclusions in this study a comprehensive review of paddy water managements for diffuse n and p pollution control in china was conducted from multiple perspectives the specific strategies of frequent used paddy water managements the critical risk periods of diffuse n and p pollution and the corresponding optimal water management for different rice planting regions and the specific strategies of optimized irrigation and drainage management and the corresponding effects on rice ecosystems at the watershed scale and national scale paddy water management optimization at different scales is a promising profitable and ecofriendly technology for sustainable rice production globally at field scale the adoption of optimal paddy water management improves water use efficiency reduces diffuse pollution and maintains or even increases rice yield compared to conventional water managements at watershed scale full utilization of ditches and ponds would intercept water and nutrients and decrease n and p runoff losses based on the current review three emerging prospects related to further paddy water managements are proposed more effective water managements combined with fertilization optimization requires further research on direct seeding rice the layout and distribution of ditches and ponds and the hydrological connectivity analysis of complex networks in the paddy field watershed still need to be studied thoroughly for wide adoption of water management optimization at the national scale the environmental and socioeconomic benefits of paddy water management optimization need to be comprehensively evaluated to seek environmentally friendly water management strategies declaration of competing interest the

9109,evapotranspiration et is regulated by vapor pressure deficit vpd and soil moisture sm which are expected to change in global climate change understanding the impacts of vpd and sm on maize et is essential for global food security and water cycle here we estimate the actual maize et in southwest china during 2001 2011 based on mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric model using remote sensing data and reanalysis data then we define the extreme drought events in 2009 2011 using the smoothed standardized anomaly of the three month standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to investigate the responses of maize et to vpd and sm during extreme drought events in southwest china we detected the lag times of maize et responses to vpd and sm and then analyzed the sensitivity of maize et to vpd and sm with lagged effects we found pervasive lagged responses of maize et with a shorter lag time of vpd 1 12 0 006 months p 0 05 than sm 1 28 0 006 months p 0 05 we analyzed the lag times of maize et in relation to elevation temperature and precipitation to investigate the abiotic impacts on the lagged responses and found the lagged responses were more prevalent in areas at higher altitudes with lower temperatures but there was less variation across precipitation gradients maize et was more sensitive to vpd than sm with lagged effects high vpd enhanced maize et under sufficient sm but during an extreme drought event maize et might be dramatically reduced due to sm depletion in spite of high vpd the study highlights the significance of atmospheric water demand for crop water consumption under extreme climate events keywords maize evapotranspiration et vapor pressure deficit vpd soil moisture sm drought lagged responses biological factors data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an essential component of the global water cycle liou and kar 2014 and plays a key role in the land atmosphere coupling miralles et al 2019 it has been profoundly affected by drought including altered long term climate state e g atmospheric water demand and soil moisture supply and acute drought extreme events allan et al 2020 helbig et al 2020 ruane and rosenzweig 2018 yang et al 2019 2012 on the one hand atmospheric water demand i e vapor pressure deficit vpd and soil moisture supply i e soil moisture sm are two key factors for et liu et al 2020 vpd has been increasing sharply since the late 1990s and is projected to continuously increase throughout the current century with increasing air temperature balting et al 2022 ficklin and novick 2017 yuan et al 2019 which may lead to a global et rise zhang et al 2015 in contrast global sm fluctuation is heterogeneous and unpredictable novick et al 2016 on the other hand drought events are expected to become more frequent and severe especially for recent 20 years huang et al 2016 spinoni et al 2020 zhao and dai 2022 high vpd and low sm often co occur when drought happens leading to the change of et by triggering the partial closure of plant stomata zhou et al 2019 previous studies have assessed the responses of et to drought which is related to vpd and sm helbig et al 2020 li et al 2021 mu et al 2022 yang et al 2019 however given the complexity of land atmosphere interactions and biological processes the sensitivity of et to vpd and sm remains equivocal brown et al 2014 liu et al 2020 novick et al 2016 the impact of drought on agriculture has prompted great concern given that over 2 billion people in the world face food insecurity at moderate or severe levels fao et al 2022 maize is the world s third important nutritious crop for both human and animal consumption after wheat and rice orhun 2013 ranum et al 2014 for the great adaptability to various planting environment and high yield as a food feed and forage crop maize is grown throughout the world except antarctic and china supplies about 20 of global maize annual production since the 1990 s bennetzen and hake 2009 orhun 2013 maize is a common crop in southwest china a region mainly dominated by humid subtropical monsoon climate approximately 2 7 million tons of maize were produced in southwest china in 2020 accounting for 10 5 of the total maize production in china fu and liu 2021 the majority of maize grown in southwest china is rainfed because its growing period coincides with the local rainy season tao et al 2014 maize is more vulnerable to drought than other rainfed crops monneveux and okono 2013 which makes drought the first constraint on the development of the maize industry in china liu et al 2014 nevertheless severe droughts occurred more frequently in the last decade in southwest china wang et al 2021 previous studies have emphasized the impact of drought on maize production and yield but paid little attention to its impact on maize et which indeed is directly impact on maize yield cai et al 2020 lobell et al 2014 ray et al 2018 in addition drought also has long lasting lagged effects by leaving biophysical legacies bunting et al 2017 kannenberg et al 2020 the lagged effects or legacies are dependent on intrinsic factors i e the biotic and abiotic traits and processes from species community to ecosystem scales such as plant physiology plant biomass carbon and nitrogen cycling and soil hydraulic properties and extrinsic factors i e the occurrence intensity duration and frequency of drought müller and bahn 2022 the lagged effects of drought have been broadly mentioned in previous studies brümmer et al 2012 mu et al 2022 song et al 2019a sun et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 but have not been explored by field experiments and remote sensing data until recently anderegg et al 2015 hoover et al 2021 uuh sonda et al 2018 zeng et al 2021 moreover numerous researches on lagged effects emphasized drought impacts on the growth or productivity of forests shrubs or perennial grass but rarely focused on water consumption like water use efficiency or et nor of annual crops like maize bunting et al 2017 kannenberg et al 2021 wu et al 2015 2018 two intense and prolonged drought events struck southwest china during 2009 2011 barriopedro et al 2012 li et al 2019 song et al 2019a the first one was from the winter of 2009 to early spring of 2010 and affected 89 of the area causing widespread negative precipitation anomaly and large reduction in gross primary productivity and et li et al 2019 song et al 2019a the second one occurred in the summer of 2011 with increased solar radiation and led to higher gross primary productivity and greener vegetation song et al 2019a in this study we aim to explore the responses of maize et to drought which is related to vpd and sm with lagged effects in southwest china with a focus on the extreme drought events in 2009 2011 in southwest china as well as the mean climate condition in 2001 2011 specifically the objectives of this study are to investigate the sensitivity of maize et to vpd and sm with lagged effects and clarify the underlying biotic and abiotic mechanisms in southwest china 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in southwest china 96 6 112 9 e 20 9 34 4 n and consists of sichuan guizhou yunnan guangxi provinces and chongqing municipality covering a total area of 137 600 km2 fig 1a it is mainly dominated by humid subtropical monsoon climate the annual precipitation varies from 1000 to 1300 mm and is mainly distributed from may to october li et al 2019 song et al 2019a wang et al 2021 maize grows from april to august and is generally rainfed as its growing period coincides with the rainy season in this area tao et al 2014 2 2 data preparation 2 2 1 satellite based data we used a series of satellite based products from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis during 2001 2011 including mod09a1 for surface reflectance 500 m 8 days mod15a2h for leaf area index lai 500 m 8 days mod11a2 for land surface temperature ts 1 km 8 days mcd12q1 for global land cover types 500 m yearly it should be noted that modis images contain several missing or unreliable pixels caused by cloud or other reasons these pixels were discarded according to quality control files before use datasets of mod09a1 and mod15a2h were from the google earth engine gee https developers google cn earth engine a cloud based interactive platform that incorporates multi petabyte analysis ready data catalogs and enables high impact data driven science gorelick et al 2017 on gee the surface reflectance data were calculated into the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and albedo allen et al 2007 lai ndvi and albedo were averaged from 8 days to one month due to too many missing values datasets of mod11a2 and mcd12q1 were available at the level 1 and atmosphere archive distribution system distributed active archive center laads daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov ts of mod11a2 was downscaled from 1 km to 500 m using random forest regression referring to hutengs and vohland 2016 the downscaled ts was compared with mod11a2 and mod21a2 and proved to be of good accuracy fig s1 2 2 2 meteorological reanalysis data and sm data the meteorological data and sm data used in this study were from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 yang et al 2010 and global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 which are two widely used climate datasets for land surface and hydrology research the cmfd dataset http data tpdc ac cn zh hans was developed by merging china meteorological administration weather station data and gridded reanalysis remote sensing data he et al 2020 a larger amount of stations were utilized in the generation of cmfd than gldas therefore the cmfd dataset was proved to have lower rmse and higher r2 than gldas on a daily scale in western china he et al 2020 in this study we used the monthly temperature and precipitation from 2001 to 2011 with an original spatial resolution of 0 1 from cmfd to calculate the drought index standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to identify the drought events during 2009 2011 with further details introduced in section 2 3 2 we also used three hour daily temperature precipitation wind speed specific humidity and shortwave radiation from 2001 to 2011 after aggregating them to 500 m to estimate actual et since cmfd does not provide the sm data we used the sm data of 0 100 cm from gldas version 2 1 it was summed from the sm of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm and aggregated to a temporal scale of one month and spatial scale of 500 m on gee 2 2 3 maize distribution data the maize distribution data used in this study was from the chinacroparea1km dataset luo et al 2020 the dataset is based on lai and observed crop phenology and provides annual harvesting areas from 2000 to 2015 for maize wheat and paddy rice in china with a spatial resolution of 1 km the results are highly consistent with county level agricultural statistics with an average r2 of 0 82 for maize since crop cultivation areas are relatively stable over time as well as the trends in maize harvesting areas in southwest china over the years are rather slow from 0 5 to 0 5 each year the maize distribution in 2011 was applied in this study fig 1b 2 3 methods 2 3 1 maize actual et estimation we employed the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric model allen et al 2007 to estimate actual et at a 500 m resolution and then extracted maize et based on maize distribution data the metric et computed in this study was validated with flux tower data from xishuangbanna station xsbn daily 2003 2010 and ailao mountain station alm daily 2009 2011 which are located in yunnan province and proved to have good accuracy fig s2 table s1 metric model is a single source energy balance model that calculates et at the satellite overpass time as a residual of the surface energy equation allen et al 2007 metric is a successor of surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal

et al 2021 in this study we restricted the area of interest aoi to the agricultural area within 30 km of 144 meteorological stations fig s3 then the pixels in the aoi falling within the thresholds of albedo lai ndvi t s and the momentum roughness length for mountainous terrain z om mtn were selected as candidate pixels jaafar and ahmad 2020 silva et al 2019 the pixel with the lowest highest t s

applied to upscale et inst to 24 hour et et 24 based on the assumption of constant et r f during a day et 24 at temporal scale of 8 days was interpolated to daily et based on the same assumption grosso et al 2018 and subsequently summed to a monthly scale 2 3 2 identification of the drought events in 2009 2011 the drought index spei was constructed based on both precipitation and potential et by vicente serrano et al 2010 it is superior to other drought indices as it accounts for the possible influences of temperature variability and has the benefit of being multiscalar vicente serrano et al 2010 in this study we used the three month spei spei 3 to determine the drought events in 2009 2011 because this time scale of spei has been proved effective in capturing drought events li et al 2019 wang et al 2021 xu et al 2015 yao et al 2022 the monthly spei 3 dataset was performed using spei package in r environment using monthly precipitation and temperature data from cmfd dataset the standardized anomaly of spei 3 for each grid cell was further derived as follows eq 7 7 sa spei 3 spe i 3 i t spe i 3 i t σ spe i 3 i t t 1 2 12 where spe i 3 i t is the value of spei 3 at the ith grid for the tth month during 2009 2011 spe i 3 i t is the mean value of spei 3 at the ith grid for the tth month during the reference period 2001 2011 σ spe i 3 i t is the standard deviation of spei 3 at the ith grid for the tth month during the reference period the average sa spei 3 over the maize grids in the study area was calculated from the monthly gridded sa spei 3 images and this anomaly series was smoothed with a three month moving window to avoid a single wet month interrupting the long term drought period saft et al 2015 the onset and end of the drought event was then determined based on the series of smoothed sa spei 3 fig 2 the drought onset was defined as the first month with sa spei 3 less than 0 5 marked by a green upward facing triangle in fig 2 while the end greater than 0 5 marked by a green downward facing triangle in fig 2 this threshold of 0 5 was set with reference to li et al 2019 2 3 3 lag month detection of maize et responses to vpd and sm the lag months of maize et responses to vpd and sm in the maize growing season from april to august were detected for each grid cell using unary linear regression models eq 8 eq 9 previous studies have indicated that lag months are no longer than a quarter anderson et al 2010 wu et al 2015 thus we took a time lag of 0 3 months into consideration in this study 8 et maize k i vpd b 9 et maize k i sm b where k i is the regression coefficient with a time lag of i month which ranges from 0 to 3 et maize is the time series of average maize et for maize growing season from april to august in 2001 2011 for each grid cell after normalization by its standardized deviation z score method vpd or sm is the time series of average vpd or sm after normalization by z score method for april to august no time lag march to july one month lag february to june two month lag january to may three month lag respectively the time lag with the highest determination coefficient r2 is the best lagged month of vpd or sm on maize et 2 3 4 correlation between maize et and vpd sm with lagged effects to investigate the correlation of maize et with vpd and sm in 2001 2011 with lagged effects we extracted maize et and vpd sm with corresponding lag months from 2000 randomly selected maize pixels in southwest china and generated scatter plots between maize et and vpd or sm fig s4 then we applied a multiple linear regression model which included vpd and sm with corresponding lag months as predictors and maize et as response variable eq 10 and a non linear regression model which included ln vpd and ln sm with corresponding lag months as predictors and ln et maize as response variable eq 11 10 et maize a vpd i b sm j c 11 ln et maize a ln vpd i b ln sm j c where a is the slope of vpd or ln vpd with a i month lag b is the slope of sm or ln sm with a j month lag vpd i is the time series of average vpd after normalization by z score method for i month lag during 2001 2011 and sm j is time series of average sm after normalization by z score method for j month lag during 2001 2011 in this study the fitting performance of the linear model r2 0 41 was better than that of the non linear model r2 0 38 fig s5 in addition both linear and non linear models have been used in previous studies for quantifying the effects of vpd and sm on et or stomatal conductance flo et al 2022 fu et al 2022 kimm et al 2020 kimm et al 2020 further indicated the linear model and non linear model both led to similar conclusion therefore the linear model was adopted in this study to investigate the correlation of maize et with vpd and sm with lagged effects in 2001 2011 for each maize pixel 3 results 3 1 characteristics of extreme drought events in 2009 2011 using the three month smoothed sa spei 3 we identified two extreme drought events in southwest china during 2009 2011 fig 2 the first drought hereafter 2009 2010 drought started from october 2009 initially affecting western and southern guizhou eastern yunnan and northern guangxi fig s6a it peaked in november 2009 with a drought area of 60 3 across the entire region and it was extremely severe in eastern yunnan the drought was slightly alleviated in the following two months as rainfall recovered fig s7a but it expanded again in february 2010 as rainfall fell below the baseline by 63 fig s7b the drought ended in april 2010 across the entire region lasting for seven months the 2009 2010 drought occurred in the autumn and winter of 2009 and spring of 2010 ending well before the start of the 2010 maize growing season the second drought event hereafter 2011 drought struck southwest china in the summer and autumn of 2011 it started in june 2011 in the middle of maize growing season and lasted for five months fig 2 it first occurred in the central part of the study region and then expanded to 61 8 of the entire area except for the northern part and a small area of yunnan in august 2011 when maize in southwest china was mostly at the maturity stages fig s6b the severe and extremely severe drought areas accounted for approximately 32 8 it gradually subsided and ended in october with precipitation returning to normal fig s7b 3 2 temporal characteristics of vpd sm and maize et in the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons we further analyzed the variation of monthly vpd sm and maize et in the maize growing seasons of 2010 and 2011 fig 3 2001 2011 was selected as a baseline period to represent normal conditions in the 2010 maize growing season vpd was below the baseline 1 5 kpa it peaked in may and hit a low of 3 46 kpa in june vpd was positively anomalous in august due to high shortwave radiation fig s7 maize et decreased by 5 7 in the 2010 growing season 28 5 mm relative to the baseline we found the fluctuation of maize et was quite similar to vpd with a maximum in may 105 1 mm a minimum in june 74 5 mm and a positive anomaly in august sm was reduced by 10 7 0 031 m 3 m 3 during the 2010 growing season compared to vpd and maize et which fluctuated by a wide margin sm rose steadily but did not surpass the baseline until the late season during the 2011 growing season the variation of vpd sm and maize et presented a different pattern vpd was dramatically high 4 9 kpa throughout the entire growing season with the peak point in august by exceeding the baseline value by 51 3 sm was low till year end for the continuous negative precipitation anomalies fig s7b it dropped by 6 8 in the 2011 growing season 0 113 m 3 m 3 relative to the baseline with the lowest value in august which was 10 26 below baseline maize et was 0 35 higher than the baseline in the 2011 growing season it showed a similar but lagged fluctuation with vpd from april to july in august 2011 maize et declined sharply and was 15 25 below the baseline which might be associated with the depleted sm 3 3 lagged responses of maize et to vpd and sm a series of unary linear regression models between maize et and vpd or sm were established and the lag times of vpd and sm were detected we found pervasive lagged responses of maize et in southwest china with an average lag time of 1 12 0 006 months p 0 05 for vpd and 1 28 0 006 months p 0 05 for sm fig 4 maize et in the sichuan basin and southeast chongqing responded to vpd and sm in the same month accounting for approximately 45 of the whole maize areas 54 2 of the maize areas in southwest china had lagged responses of maize et to vpd with 16 6 17 9 and 19 7 of the areas lagging 1 2 and 3 months respectively fig 4a while 54 6 of the maize areas had lagged responses of maize et to sm with less than 10 of the maize areas having a one month lag and over 28 of the areas having a three month lag for sm fig 4b we further analyzed the differences in maize et responses to drought among elevations temperatures and precipitations fig 5 fig 5 a d illustrated the lagged responses of maize et to vpd or sm occurred mainly at high altitudes higher than 1000 m and low temperatures about 20 however the lagged responses had less variation across precipitation gradients fig 5e f specifically the lagged responses to vpd showed no distinct differences between precipitation gradients fig 5e and maize et in areas with heavier precipitation was likely to have one month lag to sm fig 5f 3 4 sensitivity of maize et to vpd and sm with lagged effects the multiple linear regression model was established for each maize pixel between maize et and drought of vpd and sm with lagged effects the slopes in the model which represent the sensitivity of maize et to vpd and sm were extracted for each maize pixel fig 6 we found the slope for vpd and sm both showed gaussian like distributions with an average slope of 0 41 for vpd fig 6a and 0 07 for sm fig 6b over the whole study region fig 6c indicated that an increase in vpd enhanced maize et under the same sm condition while sm had a negative but far less effect on maize et p 0 001 because vpd exerted a widespread positive impact on maize et accounting for approximately 87 of the area fig s8a while the regional difference between the positive 41 8 and negative 58 2 impact of sm on maize et was negligible fig s8b about 68 of the study region in southwest china showed a greater absolute slope of vpd than sm with sichuan guizhou and chongqing accounting for the majority fig s8c this led to a greater absolute mean slope of vpd than sm over the whole region further indicating that maize et was more sensitive and responsive to the variation of vpd than sm in southwest china 4 discussions 4 1 lagged responses of maize et to vpd and sm in this study we found pervasive lagged responses of maize et to vpd and sm in southwest china our finding confirmed a global analysis by ji et al 2021 that in 70 87 of the global vegetated areas the water consumption characterized by water use efficiency showed lagged responses to drought moreover we suggested maize et had a shorter lag on vpd 1 12 0 006 months p 0 05 than sm 1 28 0 006 months p 0 05 fig 4 further support was given by the multiple linear regression model which showed maize et was more responsive to vpd and less susceptible to sm fig 6 it also indicated that sm had a longer effect on maize et than vpd this longer lag of sm on maize et might be related to soil moisture memory which refers to the recovery time of a positive or negative anomaly in soil moisture song et al 2019b soil moisture memory is widely acknowledged to be more persistent than atmosphere memory koster and suarez 2001 rodell et al 2004 with observational work showing that soil moisture memory could last 5 40 days especially in summer and autumn in switzerland and denmark orth and seneviratne 2012 or even for more than 1 year in northeast china song et al 2019b the phenomenon of the lagged responses of plant water consumption to drought at diurnal scales and longer time scales e g seasonal or interannual scales has been reported worldwide with some studies emphasizing the importance of radiation in controlling the lag time brümmer et al 2012 matheny et al 2014 zeppel et al 2004 zheng et al 2014 here approximately 45 of the maize areas which were mainly located at elevations below 1000 m with temperatures above 20 showed in month responses to vpd or sm fig 4 fig 5 in addition we found that the lagged responses mainly occurred in regions at higher altitudes with lower temperatures but there was less variation across precipitation gradients fig 5 it is contrary to a previous study conducted in the loess plateau which suggested that the variation of lagged responses was more prominent between precipitation than temperature duan et al 2020 the conflict is also found in a previous research in southwestern north america which mainly experiences monsoonal and mediterranean climate showing stronger lagged responses with temperature than precipitation in evergreen and deciduous forests but opposite lagged responses in semiarid grasslands and deserts forzieri et al 2013 brümmer et al 2012 suggested that unfavorable climatic conditions for massive et lead to lags therefore the result may be explained by the different dominants for local plant growth southwest china and the regions where evergreen and deciduous forests grow in southwestern north america are characterized by dense cloud cover which significantly reduces downward solar radiation and modulates surface temperature resulting in energy being the primary factor to restrict plant growth jia et al 2013 xu 2022 in contrast the loess plateau and the regions where semiarid grasslands grow in southwestern north america are located in semi arid or arid regions with less cloud cover and less precipitation thus plant growth depends mainly on water availability yang et al 2016 biological processes also play important roles in regulating the occurrence of lagged responses and lag times brümmer et al 2012 wu et al 2018 zeppel et al 2004 on the one hand the hydraulic dysfunction caused by drought induced cavitation and embolism in xylem and stomatal partial closure in response to drought may impede eco hydrological interaction with the land atmosphere system and trigger a lagged response in et wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2014 on the other hand the ability to refill embolized conduits in the xylem and the stomatal sensitivity may regulate the lag times across species wu et al 2018 zwieniecki and holbrook 2009 a common strategy for maize in response to drought is stomatal closure to avoid hydraulic failure isohydric which may result in shorter lags of et than plants with anisohydric behaviors tardieu and simonneau 1998 different rooting systems may be another regulation for lag times among species wu et al 2018 despite the inconsistency of the specific lag times in the previous studies there is a consensus that forests have the longest lag followed by shrubs and grass duan et al 2020 ji et al 2021 uuh sonda et al 2018 forests with deep root systems can uptake water retained in deep soil to withstand drought thus et lags behind the variation of vpd and sm shallow rooted herbaceous plants depending on water from top middle soil respond faster to rewetting events which leads to a shorter lag bunting et al 2017 ji et al 2021 wei et al 2022 as an annual herb maize can have a root system up to 1 2 m in depth ordóñez et al 2018 however due to the short lifespan of maize its root system may be shallower than that of perennial herbs which can reach up to 4 m in depth copeland et al 2016 schenk and jackson 2002 this may result in the in month responses of maize et to vpd and sm in nearly half of the whole study area in this study 4 2 sensitivity of maize et to vpd and sm this study found that maize et was affected by vpd and sm in southwest china the analysis of the multiple linear regression model suggested maize et was more sensitive and responsive to vpd than sm with lagged effects fig 6 it was enhanced by high vpd under sufficient sm but constrained by a strong sm depletion coupled with high atmospheric demand in an extreme drought event fig 3 fig 6 theoretically higher vpd values reflect a higher atmospheric demand to absorb water from soil or plants acting as a water pump and raising the transpiration rate franks et al 1997 penman 1948 in addition to direct impacts on plant physiology high vpd causes greater rates of sm loss hence increasing et grossiord et al 2020 this positive contribution of vpd to et has been reported in numerous studies on forests shrublands grasslands and peatlands helbig et al 2020 mu et al 2022 yang et al 2019 2012 our findings support the theoretical framework combined with penmann monteith and semi empirical optimal stomatal regulation theory which suggested that tropical and temperate climates were more likely to exhibit positive et responses to increased vpd than boreal and arctic climates and so were crops than shrubs and gymniosperm trees massmann et al 2019 accumulating studies support the dominant role of vpd in regulating et li et al 2021 liu et al 2020 novick et al 2016 li et al 2021 further indicated that the contribution of vpd to et was markedly enhanced with temperature exceeding 15 humid areas like southwest china dominate an energy limited et regime where sm content is generally above a critical threshold seneviratne et al 2010 xu 2022 vpd explains 91 of the variability of maize stomatal conductance irrespective of rainfall and temperature gradients or management strategies irrigated or not kimm et al 2020 in addition less precipitation impacts maize stomatal conductance through vpd by reducing relative humidity and increasing temperature rather than directly through sm kimm et al 2020 sm may impose additional limitations on et by changing the susceptibility of stomata to vpd luo et al 2017 grossiord et al 2020 hence et variability will not be constrained by sm but by vpd as long as plants can uptake water from soil e g in the maize growing season of 2010 yet during extreme drought events sm can be dramatically reduced due to continuous precipitation reduction and persistent evaporation e g in the growing season of 2011 if the soil water content falls below the threshold the predominant et mechanism may shift to a sm limited regime alessi et al 2022 seneviratne et al 2010 soil dehydration raises the hormone abscisic acid aba concentration in plant leaves resulting in stomatal closure to prevent excessive water loss gupta et al 2020 meanwhile the coupling of sm depletion and high atmospheric water demand induces cavitation and embolism in maize xylem further leading to a reduction of transpiration mcdowell et al 2008 yuan et al 2019 in addition the surface evaporation is markedly constrained by sm depletion the aforementioned may explain the sharp decline in maize et in august 2011 despite the high vpd 5 conclusion this study found pervasive lagged responses of vpd and sm to maize et in southwest china and maize et had a shorter lag of vpd 1 12 0 006 months p 0 05 than sm 1 28 0 006 months p 0 05 the lagged responses mainly occurred in regions at higher altitudes with lower temperatures but there was less variation across precipitation gradients the lagged responses of maize et may be triggered by drought induced cavitation and embolism in xylem and stomatal sensitivity and the lag times may be regulated by stomatal control and rooting systems with maize isohydricity dominated stomatal closure and relatively shallow roots resulting in shorter lag times of maize et responses to drought and the model analysis indicated maize et was more sensitive to vpd than sm with lagged effects in southwest china it was enhanced by high vpd as long as maize could uptake water from soil which might result from the feed back response of maize transpiration to vpd and the increased soil evaporation however it was limited by a strong sm depletion irrespective of high vpd in an extreme drought event due to xylem cavitation and embolism and aba concentration in maize plants under sm stress these results highlight

9109,evapotranspiration et is regulated by vapor pressure deficit vpd and soil moisture sm which are expected to change in global climate change understanding the impacts of vpd and sm on maize et is essential for global food security and water cycle here we estimate the actual maize et in southwest china during 2001 2011 based on mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric model using remote sensing data and reanalysis data then we define the extreme drought events in 2009 2011 using the smoothed standardized anomaly of the three month standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to investigate the responses of maize et to vpd and sm during extreme drought events in southwest china we detected the lag times of maize et responses to vpd and sm and then analyzed the sensitivity of maize et to vpd and sm with lagged effects we found pervasive lagged responses of maize et with a shorter lag time of vpd 1 12 0 006 months p 0 05 than sm 1 28 0 006 months p 0 05 we analyzed the lag times of maize et in relation to elevation temperature and precipitation to investigate the abiotic impacts on the lagged responses and found the lagged responses were more prevalent in areas at higher altitudes with lower temperatures but there was less variation across precipitation gradients maize et was more sensitive to vpd than sm with lagged effects high vpd enhanced maize et under sufficient sm but during an extreme drought event maize et might be dramatically reduced due to sm depletion in spite of high vpd the study highlights the significance of atmospheric water demand for crop water consumption under extreme climate events keywords maize evapotranspiration et vapor pressure deficit vpd soil moisture sm drought lagged responses biological factors data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an essential component of the global water cycle liou and kar 2014 and plays a key role in the land atmosphere coupling miralles et al 2019 it has been profoundly affected by drought including altered long term climate state e g atmospheric water demand and soil moisture supply and acute drought extreme events allan et al 2020 helbig et al 2020 ruane and rosenzweig 2018 yang et al 2019 2012 on the one hand atmospheric water demand i e vapor pressure deficit vpd and soil moisture supply i e soil moisture sm are two key factors for et liu et al 2020 vpd has been increasing sharply since the late 1990s and is projected to continuously increase throughout the current century with increasing air temperature balting et al 2022 ficklin and novick 2017 yuan et al 2019 which may lead to a global et rise zhang et al 2015 in contrast global sm fluctuation is heterogeneous and unpredictable novick et al 2016 on the other hand drought events are expected to become more frequent and severe especially for recent 20 years huang et al 2016 spinoni et al 2020 zhao and dai 2022 high vpd and low sm often co occur when drought happens leading to the change of et by triggering the partial closure of plant stomata zhou et al 2019 previous studies have assessed the responses of et to drought which is related to vpd and sm helbig et al 2020 li et al 2021 mu et al 2022 yang et al 2019 however given the complexity of land atmosphere interactions and biological processes the sensitivity of et to vpd and sm remains equivocal brown et al 2014 liu et al 2020 novick et al 2016 the impact of drought on agriculture has prompted great concern given that over 2 billion people in the world face food insecurity at moderate or severe levels fao et al 2022 maize is the world s third important nutritious crop for both human and animal consumption after wheat and rice orhun 2013 ranum et al 2014 for the great adaptability to various planting environment and high yield as a food feed and forage crop maize is grown throughout the world except antarctic and china supplies about 20 of global maize annual production since the 1990 s bennetzen and hake 2009 orhun 2013 maize is a common crop in southwest china a region mainly dominated by humid subtropical monsoon climate approximately 2 7 million tons of maize were produced in southwest china in 2020 accounting for 10 5 of the total maize production in china fu and liu 2021 the majority of maize grown in southwest china is rainfed because its growing period coincides with the local rainy season tao et al 2014 maize is more vulnerable to drought than other rainfed crops monneveux and okono 2013 which makes drought the first constraint on the development of the maize industry in china liu et al 2014 nevertheless severe droughts occurred more frequently in the last decade in southwest china wang et al 2021 previous studies have emphasized the impact of drought on maize production and yield but paid little attention to its impact on maize et which indeed is directly impact on maize yield cai et al 2020 lobell et al 2014 ray et al 2018 in addition drought also has long lasting lagged effects by leaving biophysical legacies bunting et al 2017 kannenberg et al 2020 the lagged effects or legacies are dependent on intrinsic factors i e the biotic and abiotic traits and processes from species community to ecosystem scales such as plant physiology plant biomass carbon and nitrogen cycling and soil hydraulic properties and extrinsic factors i e the occurrence intensity duration and frequency of drought müller and bahn 2022 the lagged effects of drought have been broadly mentioned in previous studies brümmer et al 2012 mu et al 2022 song et al 2019a sun et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 but have not been explored by field experiments and remote sensing data until recently anderegg et al 2015 hoover et al 2021 uuh sonda et al 2018 zeng et al 2021 moreover numerous researches on lagged effects emphasized drought impacts on the growth or productivity of forests shrubs or perennial grass but rarely focused on water consumption like water use efficiency or et nor of annual crops like maize bunting et al 2017 kannenberg et al 2021 wu et al 2015 2018 two intense and prolonged drought events struck southwest china during 2009 2011 barriopedro et al 2012 li et al 2019 song et al 2019a the first one was from the winter of 2009 to early spring of 2010 and affected 89 of the area causing widespread negative precipitation anomaly and large reduction in gross primary productivity and et li et al 2019 song et al 2019a the second one occurred in the summer of 2011 with increased solar radiation and led to higher gross primary productivity and greener vegetation song et al 2019a in this study we aim to explore the responses of maize et to drought which is related to vpd and sm with lagged effects in southwest china with a focus on the extreme drought events in 2009 2011 in southwest china as well as the mean climate condition in 2001 2011 specifically the objectives of this study are to investigate the sensitivity of maize et to vpd and sm with lagged effects and clarify the underlying biotic and abiotic mechanisms in southwest china 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in southwest china 96 6 112 9 e 20 9 34 4 n and consists of sichuan guizhou yunnan guangxi provinces and chongqing municipality covering a total area of 137 600 km2 fig 1a it is mainly dominated by humid subtropical monsoon climate the annual precipitation varies from 1000 to 1300 mm and is mainly distributed from may to october li et al 2019 song et al 2019a wang et al 2021 maize grows from april to august and is generally rainfed as its growing period coincides with the rainy season in this area tao et al 2014 2 2 data preparation 2 2 1 satellite based data we used a series of satellite based products from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis during 2001 2011 including mod09a1 for surface reflectance 500 m 8 days mod15a2h for leaf area index lai 500 m 8 days mod11a2 for land surface temperature ts 1 km 8 days mcd12q1 for global land cover types 500 m yearly it should be noted that modis images contain several missing or unreliable pixels caused by cloud or other reasons these pixels were discarded according to quality control files before use datasets of mod09a1 and mod15a2h were from the google earth engine gee https developers google cn earth engine a cloud based interactive platform that incorporates multi petabyte analysis ready data catalogs and enables high impact data driven science gorelick et al 2017 on gee the surface reflectance data were calculated into the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and albedo allen et al 2007 lai ndvi and albedo were averaged from 8 days to one month due to too many missing values datasets of mod11a2 and mcd12q1 were available at the level 1 and atmosphere archive distribution system distributed active archive center laads daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov ts of mod11a2 was downscaled from 1 km to 500 m using random forest regression referring to hutengs and vohland 2016 the downscaled ts was compared with mod11a2 and mod21a2 and proved to be of good accuracy fig s1 2 2 2 meteorological reanalysis data and sm data the meteorological data and sm data used in this study were from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 yang et al 2010 and global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 which are two widely used climate datasets for land surface and hydrology research the cmfd dataset http data tpdc ac cn zh hans was developed by merging china meteorological administration weather station data and gridded reanalysis remote sensing data he et al 2020 a larger amount of stations were utilized in the generation of cmfd than gldas therefore the cmfd dataset was proved to have lower rmse and higher r2 than gldas on a daily scale in western china he et al 2020 in this study we used the monthly temperature and precipitation from 2001 to 2011 with an original spatial resolution of 0 1 from cmfd to calculate the drought index standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to identify the drought events during 2009 2011 with further details introduced in section 2 3 2 we also used three hour daily temperature precipitation wind speed specific humidity and shortwave radiation from 2001 to 2011 after aggregating them to 500 m to estimate actual et since cmfd does not provide the sm data we used the sm data of 0 100 cm from gldas version 2 1 it was summed from the sm of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm and aggregated to a temporal scale of one month and spatial scale of 500 m on gee 2 2 3 maize distribution data the maize distribution data used in this study was from the chinacroparea1km dataset luo et al 2020 the dataset is based on lai and observed crop phenology and provides annual harvesting areas from 2000 to 2015 for maize wheat and paddy rice in china with a spatial resolution of 1 km the results are highly consistent with county level agricultural statistics with an average r2 of 0 82 for maize since crop cultivation areas are relatively stable over time as well as the trends in maize harvesting areas in southwest china over the years are rather slow from 0 5 to 0 5 each year the maize distribution in 2011 was applied in this study fig 1b 2 3 methods 2 3 1 maize actual et estimation we employed the mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration metric model allen et al 2007 to estimate actual et at a 500 m resolution and then extracted maize et based on maize distribution data the metric et computed in this study was validated with flux tower data from xishuangbanna station xsbn daily 2003 2010 and ailao mountain station alm daily 2009 2011 which are located in yunnan province and proved to have good accuracy fig s2 table s1 metric model is a single source energy balance model that calculates et at the satellite overpass time as a residual of the surface energy equation allen et al 2007 metric is a successor of surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal

et al 2021 in this study we restricted the area of interest aoi to the agricultural area within 30 km of 144 meteorological stations fig s3 then the pixels in the aoi falling within the thresholds of albedo lai ndvi t s and the momentum roughness length for mountainous terrain z om mtn were selected as candidate pixels jaafar and ahmad 2020 silva et al 2019 the pixel with the lowest highest t s was selected as cold hot anchor pixel after the determination of r n g and h le is calculated from eq 1 and instantaneous et at the satellite overpass time et inst is obtained by dividing le by latent heat of evaporation for each pixel at the same time reference et for the standardized 0 5 m tall alfalfa at the satellite overpass time et r is calculated et r f the ratio of et inst to et r is applied to upscale et inst to 24 hour et et 24 based on the assumption of constant et r f during a day et 24 at temporal scale of 8 days was interpolated to daily et based on the same assumption grosso et al 2018 and subsequently summed to a monthly scale 2 3 2 identification of the drought events in 2009 2011 the drought index spei was constructed based on both precipitation and potential et by vicente serrano et al 2010 it is superior to other drought indices as it accounts for the possible influences of temperature variability and has the benefit of being multiscalar vicente serrano et al 2010 in this study we used the three month spei spei 3 to determine the drought events in 2009 2011 because this time scale of spei has been proved effective in capturing drought events li et al 2019 wang et al 2021 xu et al 2015 yao et al 2022 the monthly spei 3 dataset was performed using spei package in r environment using monthly precipitation and temperature data from cmfd dataset the standardized anomaly of spei 3 for each grid cell was further derived as follows eq 7 7 sa spei 3 spe i 3 i t spe i 3 i t σ spe i 3 i t t 1 2 12 where spe i 3 i t is the value of spei 3 at the ith grid for the tth month during 2009 2011 spe i 3 i t is the mean value of spei 3 at the ith grid for the tth month during the reference period 2001 2011 σ spe i 3 i t is the standard deviation of spei 3 at the ith grid for the tth month during the reference period the average sa spei 3 over the maize grids in the study area was calculated from the monthly gridded sa spei 3 images and this anomaly series was smoothed with a three month moving window to avoid a single wet month interrupting the long term drought period saft et al 2015 the onset and end of the drought event was then determined based on the series of smoothed sa spei 3 fig 2 the drought onset was defined as the first month with sa spei 3 less than 0 5 marked by a green upward facing triangle in fig 2 while the end greater than 0 5 marked by a green downward facing triangle in fig 2 this threshold of 0 5 was set with reference to li et al 2019 2 3 3 lag month detection of maize et responses to vpd and sm the lag months of maize et responses to vpd and sm in the maize growing season from april to august were detected for each grid cell using unary linear regression models eq 8 eq 9 previous studies have indicated that lag months are no longer than a quarter anderson et al 2010 wu et al 2015 thus we took a time lag of 0 3 months into consideration in this study 8 et maize k i vpd b 9 et maize k i sm b where k i is the regression coefficient with a time lag of i month which ranges from 0 to 3 et maize is the time series of average maize et for maize growing season from april to august in 2001 2011 for each grid cell after normalization by its standardized deviation z score method vpd or sm is the time series of average vpd or sm after normalization by z score method for april to august no time lag march to july one month lag february to june two month lag january to may three month lag respectively the time lag with the highest determination coefficient r2 is the best lagged month of vpd or sm on maize et 2 3 4 correlation between maize et and vpd sm with lagged effects to investigate the correlation of maize et with vpd and sm in 2001 2011 with lagged effects we extracted maize et and vpd sm with corresponding lag months from 2000 randomly selected maize pixels in southwest china and generated scatter plots between maize et and vpd or sm fig s4 then we applied a multiple linear regression model which included vpd and sm with corresponding lag months as predictors and maize et as response variable eq 10 and a non linear regression model which included ln vpd and ln sm with corresponding lag months as predictors and ln et maize as response variable eq 11 10 et maize a vpd i b sm j c 11 ln et maize a ln vpd i b ln sm j c where a is the slope of vpd or ln vpd with a i month lag b is the slope of sm or ln sm with a j month lag vpd i is the time series of average vpd after normalization by z score method for i month lag during 2001 2011 and sm j is time series of average sm after normalization by z score method for j month lag during 2001 2011 in this study the fitting performance of the linear model r2 0 41 was better than that of the non linear model r2 0 38 fig s5 in addition both linear and non linear models have been used in previous studies for quantifying the effects of vpd and sm on et or stomatal conductance flo et al 2022 fu et al 2022 kimm et al 2020 kimm et al 2020 further indicated the linear model and non linear model both led to similar conclusion therefore the linear model was adopted in this study to investigate the correlation of maize et with vpd and sm with lagged effects in 2001 2011 for each maize pixel 3 results 3 1 characteristics of extreme drought events in 2009 2011 using the three month smoothed sa spei 3 we identified two extreme drought events in southwest china during 2009 2011 fig 2 the first drought hereafter 2009 2010 drought started from october 2009 initially affecting western and southern guizhou eastern yunnan and northern guangxi fig s6a it peaked in november 2009 with a drought area of 60 3 across the entire region and it was extremely severe in eastern yunnan the drought was slightly alleviated in the following two months as rainfall recovered fig s7a but it expanded again in february 2010 as rainfall fell below the baseline by 63 fig s7b the drought ended in april 2010 across the entire region lasting for seven months the 2009 2010 drought occurred in the autumn and winter of 2009 and spring of 2010 ending well before the start of the 2010 maize growing season the second drought event hereafter 2011 drought struck southwest china in the summer and autumn of 2011 it started in june 2011 in the middle of maize growing season and lasted for five months fig 2 it first occurred in the central part of the study region and then expanded to 61 8 of the entire area except for the northern part and a small area of yunnan in august 2011 when maize in southwest china was mostly at the maturity stages fig s6b the severe and extremely severe drought areas accounted for approximately 32 8 it gradually subsided and ended in october with precipitation returning to normal fig s7b 3 2 temporal characteristics of vpd sm and maize et in the 2010 and 2011 growing seasons we further analyzed the variation of monthly vpd sm and maize et in the maize growing seasons of 2010 and 2011 fig 3 2001 2011 was selected as a baseline period to represent normal conditions in the 2010 maize growing season vpd was below the baseline 1 5 kpa it peaked in may and hit a low of 3 46 kpa in june vpd was positively anomalous in august due to high shortwave radiation fig s7 maize et decreased by 5 7 in the 2010 growing season 28 5 mm relative to the baseline we found the fluctuation of maize et was quite similar to vpd with a maximum in may 105 1 mm a minimum in june 74 5 mm and a positive anomaly in august sm was reduced by 10 7 0 031 m 3 m 3 during the 2010 growing season compared to vpd and maize et which fluctuated by a wide margin sm rose steadily but did not surpass the baseline until the late season during the 2011 growing season the variation of vpd sm and maize et presented a different pattern vpd was dramatically high 4 9 kpa throughout the entire growing season with the peak point in august by exceeding the baseline value by 51 3 sm was low till year end for the continuous negative precipitation anomalies fig s7b it dropped by 6 8 in the 2011 growing season 0 113 m 3 m 3 relative to the baseline with the lowest value in august which was 10 26 below baseline maize et was 0 35 higher than the baseline in the 2011 growing season it showed a similar but lagged fluctuation with vpd from april to july in august 2011 maize et declined sharply and was 15 25 below the baseline which might be associated with the depleted sm 3 3 lagged responses of maize et to vpd and sm a series of unary linear regression models between maize et and vpd or sm were established and the lag times of vpd and sm were detected we found pervasive lagged responses of maize et in southwest china with an average lag time of 1 12 0 006 months p 0 05 for vpd and 1 28 0 006 months p 0 05 for sm fig 4 maize et in the sichuan basin and southeast chongqing responded to vpd and sm in the same month accounting for approximately 45 of the whole maize areas 54 2 of the maize areas in southwest china had lagged responses of maize et to vpd with 16 6 17 9 and 19 7 of the areas lagging 1 2 and 3 months respectively fig 4a while 54 6 of the maize areas had lagged responses of maize et to sm with less than 10 of the maize areas having a one month lag and over 28 of the areas having a three month lag for sm fig 4b we further analyzed the differences in maize et responses to drought among elevations temperatures and precipitations fig 5 fig 5 a d illustrated the lagged responses of maize et to vpd or sm occurred mainly at high altitudes higher than 1000 m and low temperatures about 20 however the lagged responses had less variation across precipitation gradients fig 5e f specifically the lagged responses to vpd showed no distinct differences between precipitation gradients fig 5e and maize et in areas with heavier precipitation was likely to have one month lag to sm fig 5f 3 4 sensitivity of maize et to vpd and sm with lagged effects the multiple linear regression model was established for each maize pixel between maize et and drought of vpd and sm with lagged effects the slopes in the model which represent the sensitivity of maize et to vpd and sm were extracted for each maize pixel fig 6 we found the slope for vpd and sm both showed gaussian like distributions with an average slope of 0 41 for vpd fig 6a and 0 07 for sm fig 6b over the whole study region fig 6c indicated that an increase in vpd enhanced maize et under the same sm condition while sm had a negative but far less effect on maize et p 0 001 because vpd exerted a widespread positive impact on maize et accounting for approximately 87 of the area fig s8a while the regional difference between the positive 41 8 and negative 58 2 impact of sm on maize et was negligible fig s8b about 68 of the study region in southwest china showed a greater absolute slope of vpd than sm with sichuan guizhou and chongqing accounting for the majority fig s8c this led to a greater absolute mean slope of vpd than sm over the whole region further indicating that maize et was more sensitive and responsive to the variation of vpd than sm in southwest china 4 discussions 4 1 lagged responses of maize et to vpd and sm in this study we found pervasive lagged responses of maize et to vpd and sm in southwest china our finding confirmed a global analysis by ji et al 2021 that in 70 87 of the global vegetated areas the water consumption characterized by water use efficiency showed lagged responses to drought moreover we suggested maize et had a shorter lag on vpd 1 12 0 006 months p 0 05 than sm 1 28 0 006 months p 0 05 fig 4 further support was given by the multiple linear regression model which showed maize et was more responsive to vpd and less susceptible to sm fig 6 it also indicated that sm had a longer effect on maize et than vpd this longer lag of sm on maize et might be related to soil moisture memory which refers to the recovery time of a positive or negative anomaly in soil moisture song et al 2019b soil moisture memory is widely acknowledged to be more persistent than atmosphere memory koster and suarez 2001 rodell et al 2004 with observational work showing that soil moisture memory could last 5 40 days especially in summer and autumn in switzerland and denmark orth and seneviratne 2012 or even for more than 1 year in northeast china song et al 2019b the phenomenon of the lagged responses of plant water consumption to drought at diurnal scales and longer time scales e g seasonal or interannual scales has been reported worldwide with some studies emphasizing the importance of radiation in controlling the lag time brümmer et al 2012 matheny et al 2014 zeppel et al 2004 zheng et al 2014 here approximately 45 of the maize areas which were mainly located at elevations below 1000 m with temperatures above 20 showed in month responses to vpd or sm fig 4 fig 5 in addition we found that the lagged responses mainly occurred in regions at higher altitudes with lower temperatures but there was less variation across precipitation gradients fig 5 it is contrary to a previous study conducted in the loess plateau which suggested that the variation of lagged responses was more prominent between precipitation than temperature duan et al 2020 the conflict is also found in a previous research in southwestern north america which mainly experiences monsoonal and mediterranean climate showing stronger lagged responses with temperature than precipitation in evergreen and deciduous forests but opposite lagged responses in semiarid grasslands and deserts forzieri et al 2013 brümmer et al 2012 suggested that unfavorable climatic conditions for massive et lead to lags therefore the result may be explained by the different dominants for local plant growth southwest china and the regions where evergreen and deciduous forests grow in southwestern north america are characterized by dense cloud cover which significantly reduces downward solar radiation and modulates surface temperature resulting in energy being the primary factor to restrict plant growth jia et al 2013 xu 2022 in contrast the loess plateau and the regions where semiarid grasslands grow in southwestern north america are located in semi arid or arid regions with less cloud cover and less precipitation thus plant growth depends mainly on water availability yang et al 2016 biological processes also play important roles in regulating the occurrence of lagged responses and lag times brümmer et al 2012 wu et al 2018 zeppel et al 2004 on the one hand the hydraulic dysfunction caused by drought induced cavitation and embolism in xylem and stomatal partial closure in response to drought may impede eco hydrological interaction with the land atmosphere system and trigger a lagged response in et wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zheng et al 2014 on the other hand the ability to refill embolized conduits in the xylem and the stomatal sensitivity may regulate the lag times across species wu et al 2018 zwieniecki and holbrook 2009 a common strategy for maize in response to drought is stomatal closure to avoid hydraulic failure isohydric which may result in shorter lags of et than plants with anisohydric behaviors tardieu and simonneau 1998 different rooting systems may be another regulation for lag times among species wu et al 2018 despite the inconsistency of the specific lag times in the previous studies there is a consensus that forests have the longest lag followed by shrubs and grass duan et al 2020 ji et al 2021 uuh sonda et al 2018 forests with deep root systems can uptake water retained in deep soil to withstand drought thus et lags behind the variation of vpd and sm shallow rooted herbaceous plants depending on water from top middle soil respond faster to rewetting events which leads to a shorter lag bunting et al 2017 ji et al 2021 wei et al 2022 as an annual herb maize can have a root system up to 1 2 m in depth ordóñez et al 2018 however due to the short lifespan of maize its root system may be shallower than that of perennial herbs which can reach up to 4 m in depth copeland et al 2016 schenk and jackson 2002 this may result in the in month responses of maize et to vpd and sm in nearly half of the whole study area in this study 4 2 sensitivity of maize et to vpd and sm this study found that maize et was affected by vpd and sm in southwest china the analysis of the multiple linear regression model suggested maize et was more sensitive and responsive to vpd than sm with lagged effects fig 6 it was enhanced by high vpd under sufficient sm but constrained by a strong sm depletion coupled with high atmospheric demand in an extreme drought event fig 3 fig 6 theoretically higher vpd values reflect a higher atmospheric demand to absorb water from soil or plants acting as a water pump and raising the transpiration rate franks et al 1997 penman 1948 in addition to direct impacts on plant physiology high vpd causes greater rates of sm loss hence increasing et grossiord et al 2020 this positive contribution of vpd to et has been reported in numerous studies on forests shrublands grasslands and peatlands helbig et al 2020 mu et al 2022 yang et al 2019 2012 our findings support the theoretical framework combined with penmann monteith and semi empirical optimal stomatal regulation theory which suggested that tropical and temperate climates were more likely to exhibit positive et responses to increased vpd than boreal and arctic climates and so were crops than shrubs and gymniosperm trees massmann et al 2019 accumulating studies support the dominant role of vpd in regulating et li et al 2021 liu et al 2020 novick et al 2016 li et al 2021 further indicated that the contribution of vpd to et was markedly enhanced with temperature exceeding 15 humid areas like southwest china dominate an energy limited et regime where sm content is generally above a critical threshold seneviratne et al 2010 xu 2022 vpd explains 91 of the variability of maize stomatal conductance irrespective of rainfall and temperature gradients or management strategies irrigated or not kimm et al 2020 in addition less precipitation impacts maize stomatal conductance through vpd by reducing relative humidity and increasing temperature rather than directly through sm kimm et al 2020 sm may impose additional limitations on et by changing the susceptibility of stomata to vpd luo et al 2017 grossiord et al 2020 hence et variability will not be constrained by sm but by vpd as long as plants can uptake water from soil e g in the maize growing season of 2010 yet during extreme drought events sm can be dramatically reduced due to continuous precipitation reduction and persistent evaporation e g in the growing season of 2011 if the soil water content falls below the threshold the predominant et mechanism may shift to a sm limited regime alessi et al 2022 seneviratne et al 2010 soil dehydration raises the hormone abscisic acid aba concentration in plant leaves resulting in stomatal closure to prevent excessive water loss gupta et al 2020 meanwhile the coupling of sm depletion and high atmospheric water demand induces cavitation and embolism in maize xylem further leading to a reduction of transpiration mcdowell et al 2008 yuan et al 2019 in addition the surface evaporation is markedly constrained by sm depletion the aforementioned may explain the sharp decline in maize et in august 2011 despite the high vpd 5 conclusion this study found pervasive lagged responses of vpd and sm to maize et in southwest china and maize et had a shorter lag of vpd 1 12 0 006 months p 0 05 than sm 1 28 0 006 months p 0 05 the lagged responses mainly occurred in regions at higher altitudes with lower temperatures but there was less variation across precipitation gradients the lagged responses of maize et may be triggered by drought induced cavitation and embolism in xylem and stomatal sensitivity and the lag times may be regulated by stomatal control and rooting systems with maize isohydricity dominated stomatal closure and relatively shallow roots resulting in shorter lag times of maize et responses to drought and the model analysis indicated maize et was more sensitive to vpd than sm with lagged effects in southwest china it was enhanced by high vpd as long as maize could uptake water from soil which might result from the feed back response of maize transpiration to vpd and the increased soil evaporation however it was limited by a strong sm depletion irrespective of high vpd in an extreme drought event due to xylem cavitation and embolism and aba concentration in maize plants under sm stress these results highlight the importance of atmospheric water demand in regulating maize et in complicated land atmosphere interaction especially under extreme climate events declaration of competing interest the authors
