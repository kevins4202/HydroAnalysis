9345,due to the national nutrition crisis and the adjustment of planting structure millet has once again become a widely planted cash crop in northern china however as the climate warms in recent years drought has occurred frequently and repeatedly in northern china which has seriously threatened millet production safety in this area therefore it is urgent to clarify the hazard of millet drought disaster and provide reference for the formulation of millet disaster prevention and reduction measures in this paper combined with the water demand of millet in each growth period standardized precipitation requirement index spri was selected to identify and quantify the drought disaster of millet considering the impact of different degrees of drought in different growth periods a hazard assessment model is constructed to evaluate the hazard of millet drought disaster in northern china under the background of climate change the results show that 1 spri can well characterize the drought of millet in northern china 2 in the context of climate change millet drought in northern china shows a trend of increasing intensity and decreasing frequency and it is possible that millet drought will be even more severe in the future 3 combined with the hazard assessment model millet drought in northern china will still be dominated by middle hazard in the future but the areas with high hazard will gradually increase mainly distributed in northeast china central and western inner mongolia and northern gansu the research results can be of great practical significance for the adjustment of agricultural production structure in the future especially for the sustainable development of agriculture and the formulation of measures to prevent and resist agricultural disasters graphical abstract ga1 keywords standardized precipitation requirement index millet drought hazard assessment model climate change data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the first part of the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc pointed out that the global surface temperature continued to rise with an increase of about 1 1 compared with 1850 1990 tollefson 2021 extreme weather caused by global warming has increased since 1950 and some regions may suffer from more frequent and serious drought disasters in the future guo et al 2022 tegegne et al 2020 due to the changeable terrain and complex geographical environment northern china is one of the regions where was most seriously affected by climate warming drought occurs frequently and food security is seriously threatened ding et al 2021 song et al 2021 millet is rich in nutrition and widely used it can be used as a food source for people s daily lives as well as a high quality raw material for the processing of agricultural and sideline products in the era of continuous improvement of living standards millet the first of coarse cereals is becoming more and more popular liu et al 2020 meng et al 2020 millet has a high yield per unit area and a huge potential for production increase which plays an important role in ensuring human food security and reduce poverty li et al 2021b northern china is the main millet producing area in china with the sown area and yield accounting for more than 90 of all areas and yields in spite of this millet growth and development are often threatened by drought disasters which seriously affect millet yield from june to august in 2014 the precipitation in northern china remained low with precipitation in most areas 20 50 lower than that in the same period of the previous year among them liaoning jilin and henan provinces all recorded the lowest precipitation in the same period since 1951 in addition the continuous high temperature in july in most parts of northern china led to the rapid development of drought resulting in a large scale reduction of millet production which was only 50 of the yield of the previous year china meteorological administration 2015 as for may 2017 the precipitation in north china the west of northeast china and the east of inner mongolia was less than 200 mm which was 30 80 less than that in the same period of the previous year and more than 80 less locally the progress of spring ploughing and sowing was slow which negatively impact the growth of local millet china meteorological administration 2018 although the frequency of millet drought generally shows a decreasing trend according to the climate warming the intensity of drought may increase in some areas due to the greater fluctuation of climate elements ayantobo et al 2017 therefore it is urgent to make clear the change characteristics of millet drought disaster and quantitatively evaluate the risk of millet drought disaster in the process of formulating agricultural disaster prevention and reduction measures disaster hazard is an important part of the four elements of the disaster risk system the other three elements are vulnerability exposure and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity zhang 2004 agrometeorological disaster hazard refers to the abnormal degree of meteorological factors that are likely to harm crops zhang et al 2014 at present relevant studies are mainly divided into the following two categories one is to use meteorological indicators as disaster inducing factor identification indicators for hazard assessment for example hu et al 2021 used spei to identify maize drought in the huang huai hai plain and comprehensively analyzed the characteristics and hazard distribution of maize drought disasters by using gis spatial analysis and disaster risk assessment zhang et al 2021b took the daily maximum temperature 35 as the index of extreme heat for summer maize and combined with copula function to estimate the hazard of extreme heat damage of maize in haihe plain however since the meteorological indicators did not take into account the biological processes of crops they were only able to determine the spatial temporal pattern and development trend of meteorological disasters in the whole region and could not assess directly how much agrometeorological disasters impacted crop yield therefore more and more researches tend to focus on the second category that is to develop a new agrometeorological disaster index to identify the disaster of specific crops and evaluate their hazard investigators such as yang and zhou 2015 selected heat index water deficit index and z index as identification indexes of chilling injury drought and flood disaster combining with the maximum entropy model to evaluate the comprehensive hazard of major agrometeorological disasters of maize in northeast china yang et al 2021b constructed an apple drought index based on water demand and precipitation supply during different growth periods and used this index to assess the drought hazard of apples in northern china overall agrometeorological disaster hazard assessment is established on the index selection quantifying the agrometeorological disasters and evaluating it over the whole growth period nevertheless the evaluation results aren t reliable as they fail to consider the impact of disasters at different degrees on the growth and development of crops during different periods of growth to sum up the current research system on the hazard of agrometeorological disasters is seemingly perfect but it narrowly focuses on field food crops and characteristic forest and fruit crops the existing studies on millet a field cash crop mainly include the effects of drought on millet lu et al 2015 mukami et al 2019 the analysis of meteorological conditions in the process of millet production bhattarai et al 2020 yang et al 2020 and the climatic suitability regionalization egbebiyi et al 2020 luitel et al 2020 but there are still few studies on the hazard of millet drought disaster lacking corresponding evaluation indicators therefore this study takes millet in northern china as a research object from the perspective of disaster hazard in the disaster risk system combining with the growth and development characteristics of millet this study also selects corresponding indicators to analyze the occurrence regularity and spatial temporal distribution characteristics of millet drought disaster in the context of climate change according to the occurrence frequency and the impact of different degrees of drought disaster in different growth periods the millet drought disaster hazard assessment model is constructed to evaluate the millet drought disaster hazard in northern china considering climate change the research results can provide reference for scientific planning and management of millet production as well as improve the effect of meteorological disaster prevention and reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is a potential millet planting area in northern china which is located between 31 23 53 33 n and 93 13 135 05 e fig 1 it covers spring millet area in northeast china heilongjiang jilin and liaoning summer millet area in north china inner mongolia hebei shanxi shandong and henan and spring millet area in northwest china shaanxi gansu and ningxia with a total area of about 3 38 106 km2 accounting for 35 of china s total land area including about 6 46 105 km2 of cultivated land accounting for 53 of china s total cultivated land area the study area spans four climatic regions humid semi humid arid and semi arid the average annual temperature ranges from 5 6 to 13 7 and the average annual rainfall ranges from 150 to 1100 mm which gradually decreases from the southeast coast to the northwest inland zheng et al 2020 chen et al 2020 yin et al 2022 northern china is the main millet producing area in china with a perennial planting area of about 7 33 105 hectares millet is usually sown in may and harvested in september 2 2 data set and sources 2 2 1 meteorological data 2 2 1 1 historical observation data the historical observation data used in this study came from the national earth system science data center national science technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn peng et al 2019 including the monthly average temperature and monthly precipitation from 1960 to 2019 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 the resolution was unified to 0 1 0 1 which was used for the calculation of millet drought index 2 2 1 2 cmip6 data in this study monthly average temperature and monthly precipitation output from 24 global climate models table 1 in cmip6 are used for 2020 2099 these models have been used in previous studies to simulate the temperature and precipitation in northern china their good simulation capability has been confirmed by calculating and analyzing the relative error and root mean square error song et al 2021 ma et al 2022 song and yan 2022 the climate scenarios of ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 combined with shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and representation concentration pathways rcps released by ipcc in 2020 were selected for analysis representing low emission forcing medium emission forcing and high emission forcing scenarios in turn shafeeque and luo 2021 the spatial resolution of 24 global climate models was different so the bilinear interpolation method was used to unify the spatial resolution of data to 0 1 0 1 which was used for the subsequent multi model ensemble average and calculation of millet drought index 2 2 2 crop data the crop data were obtained from the statistical yearbook of all provinces and cities in the study area from 1960 to 2019 including sowing area annual yield and annual average yield per unit area of millet due to the large span between east and west in the study area in order to facilitate the comparison of spatial results the growth period is uniformly calculated from early may to late september and the early may to late june was selected as the early growth period the early july to late july was the middle growth period and the early august to late september was the late growth period 2 2 3 historical disaster data historical disaster data were mainly from china agriculture yearbook yearbook of meteorological disasters in china report of the damage caused by disaster in china and the china meteorological disaster dictionary of all provinces in the study area 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 standardized precipitation requirement index at present meteorological drought indexes were often used to evaluate the impact of drought in agricultural drought disaster however agricultural drought is not equal to meteorological drought and different crops respond differently to meteorological drought so these indexes were difficult to indicate the impact of drought on crops therefore the key to study agricultural drought is to select suitable agricultural drought index for specific crops in this study standardized precipitation requirement index spri was selected as the drought assessment index for millet considering the different water requirements at different growth periods which was added into the calculation based on standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei wei et al 2021 the calculation process and formula are as follows 1 calculate the water requirement of millet in different growth periods 1 et c i k c i et 0 i where et c i is the water requirement of millet at the i growth period mm et 0 i is the reference evapotranspiration in the i growth period mm reflecting the influence of atmospheric evaporation capacity in different periods and regions on crop water requirement which was calculated by thornthwatie fu et al 2019 formula 2 this is the method for calculating et0 recommended in gb t 20481 2006 meteorological drought grade standard ari et al 2021 compared with penman monteith method its required data are easier to obtain in humid semi humid and semi arid areas there is little difference between et0 calculated by thornthwatie method and penman monteith method yang et al 2017 xu et al 2018 and its temporal variation and spatial distribution characteristics are consistent under the background of climate change cao and gao 2019 zhou et al 2020 therefore thornthwatie method is selected for the calculation of et0 in the context of climate change kc is crop coefficient of millet reflecting the comprehensive effect of soil evaporation and crop transpiration which are affected by various factors such as climate conditions soil evaporation crop types and crop growth conditions pascual seva and pascual 2021 in this paper the crop coefficients of millet at different growth periods are determined based on the actual situation of the study area gao et al 2021 table 2 2 et 0 i 16 k 10 t i h i a where t i is the monthly average temperature h is the annual heat index k is the correction factor calculated according to latitude and month a is a constant if t i 0 h i 0 and et 0 i 0 2 calculate the difference between precipitation and millet water requirement in each growth period 3 d i p i et c i where p i is the precipitation at the i growth period mm 3 normalize the difference between precipitation and millet water requirement adopt the log logistic probability distribution function of three parameters standardize the probability density and calculate the corresponding spri the formula of log logistic probability distribution function is 4 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where α βandγ were obtained by fitting with linear moment method standardize the cumulative probability density 5 v 1 f x if v 0 5 6 w 2 ln v if v 0 5 7 w 2 ln 1 v 8 spri c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 w where is c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 according to spei drought classification yao et al 2018 spri was divided into four levels to determine the drought classification standard table 3 2 3 2 drought frequency drought frequency pij yang et al 2021a refers to the percentage of drought disaster years in the total number of years which can generally represent the frequency of disasters in this study spri was extracted to each meteorological station for the calculation of drought frequency and its spatial distribution was obtained by inverse distance weight interpolation method 9 p ij n ij n 100 where n ij is the number of years occurred j level drought in the i growth period of a station and n is the total number of years 2 3 3 sen s slope and mann kendall test sen slope estimation is a robust non parametric statistical trend calculation method which is highly efficient and insensitive to measurement error and outlier data it is often used in trend analysis of long time series data however it cannot realize the significance judgment of the sequence trend by itself and the mann kendall method has no requirements on the sequence distribution and is insensitive to outliers therefore this method is introduced to test the significance of the sequence trend the significance of the change trend is judged by the z of the mk test under the given α significant level if z z 1 α 2 that indicated he research sequence had a significant changes in the α significant level when z 1 96 mean the trend passed significance test at α 0 05 the specific calculation method can be seen in zhao et al 2019 2 3 4 climate yield and yield fluctuation in general the actual yield y of crops can be divided into three parts that is the trend yield with the improvement of social production level the meteorological yield fluctuating with historical meteorological conditions and the random noise that is generally ignored li et al 2021c 10 y y t y w ε where y is the millet yield per unit area yt is the trend yield yw is the meteorological yield and ε is the random noise the linear moving average method is used to simulate the trend yield and the relative meteorological yield yr is calculated according to formula 11 the relative meteorological yield is a relative value indicating the degree to which the actual grain yield deviates from the trend yield when the actual yield is lower than the trend yield that is the relative meteorological yield is negative it is a reduction in yield the percentage of the actual yield per unit lower than the trend yield is called the reduction rate in yield 11 y r y w y t 100 2 3 5 establishment of hazard assessment model for the hazard of millet drought disaster the greater the intensity and frequency of disaster the higher the hazard so the hazard was represented by the product of disaster intensity disaster loss coefficient and frequency however due to millet in different growth periods suffered different degrees of drought disaster for millet production effect is different this study based on the occurrence of drought disasters at each station in the study area determined by spri selected the years in which mild moderate and severe drought occur alone in the early middle and late growth period resulted in yield reduction yield reduction rate 5 so as to calculate the average yield reduction rate of each level drought in each growth period on this basis the disaster loss coefficient of a certain level drought in a certain growth period is defined as the ratio of the average yield reduction rate of a certain level drought in a certain growth period to the sum of the average yield reduction rate caused by different level drought disasters in each growth period 12 w ij y ij i 1 3 j 1 3 y ij where wij is the disaster loss coefficient of j level drought in i growth period table 4 yij is average yield reduction rate of j level drought in i growth period drought disaster hazard model of millet in each growth period is expressed as 13 h xi j 1 3 p ij w ij 14 h x i 1 3 h xi the spatial distribution of drought hazard in different growth periods of the study area was calculated by formula 13 and 14 the fuzzy membership function in arcgis was used to normalize the drought hazard and the optimal segmentation method was used to divide the drought hazard into five grades low sub low middle sub high and high and the hazard of drought disaster in different growth periods of millet was analyzed 2 3 6 taylor diagram and multi model ensemble taylor diagram can display the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and standard deviation sd of simulated and observed data sets in polar coordinates and can comprehensively and directly evaluate the simulation ability and differences of various gcms huang et al 2022 with the application and development of climate models the research on multi mode ensemble is becoming more and more in depth previous studies have shown that the cmip6 multi model ensemble mme can reasonably reproduce the spatial distribution of annual average climate of observed precipitation and temperature as well as the annual cycle characteristics zhu et al 2020 ma et al 2022 therefore in this paper the equal weight method zuo et al 2020 is adopted to carry out ensemble average for 24 global climate models and taylor diagram is used to evaluate the simulation ability of mme 15 x 1 n i 1 n x i where x is the result of multi model ensemble xi is the value of each model and n is the number of models 3 results 3 1 applicability analysis of spri since northern china is a major grain producing area in this country the occurrence of drought would have a direct impact on agricultural production in this region in this paper pearson correlation coefficient between spri and drought affected areas drought areas and relative meteorological yield of millet in 11 provinces of the study area were calculated to discuss the applicability of spri in characterizing millet drought the results are shown in fig 2 the pearson correlation coefficient between spri and drought affected areas and drought areas in 11 provinces is mostly negative which means with the increase of spri the decrease of drought level the area affected by drought drought affected areas and drought areas decreases indicating that spri can reflect the agricultural drought and drought level in the study area in addition spri was positively correlated with the relative meteorological yield of millet which implies the relative meteorological yield of millet increased with the increase of spri and it was obvious that the correlation between spri and relative meteorological yield of millet was the greatest in the late growth period indicating that the drought condition in the late growth period basically determined the millet yield it is noteworthy that spri was negatively correlated with the relative meteorological yield of millet in some areas during the early growth period this is because the early growth period is highly susceptible to cold weather in the northern china and the temperature is too low which affects the emergence of millet and thus the final millet yield therefore even if there is no drought in this period the millet yield will be reduced under the effect of low temperature which makes spri negatively correlated with the elative meteorological yield of millet in addition through the variation trend of drought affected area drought area millet production and spri in different growth periods from 1980 to 2019 fig s1 it can be seen that the change trend of spri and the relative meteorological yield of millet is the most similar and the change range of drought affected area and drought area is larger which further confirms that spri is a drought index suitable for millet in conclusion spri has a good ability to characterize the actual drought and the relative meteorological yield of millet in northern china in other words spri index can characterize the millet drought in this region in order to further analyze the applicability of spri in the identification of drought disasters in millet in northern china the drought events identified by spri were statistically analyzed in this study and compared with historical drought events the results are shown in table 5 it can be seen that spri can identify most typical drought events in the study area which reflects that it has a good applicability in drought identification of millet growth period in northern china 3 2 climate model capability assessment in cmip6 the historical simulation of each model only runs up to 2014 therefore based on the observed data we calculated the r correlation coefficient sd standard deviation and rmse root mean square error between the simulated and observed values of monthly average temperature monthly precipitation from 1960 to 2014 and plotted them in the taylor diagram to objectively evaluate the simulation ability of 24 gcms in the historical climate scenario in the study area fig 3 the color shapes in the figure correspond to 24 gcms and 1 mme multi model ensemble the red dot on the horizontal axis represents the observation values of meteorological stations the closer the model point is to the observation point the stronger the simulation ability of the model as shown in fig 3 a the correlation coefficient between each model and the observed temperature is between 0 94 and 0 98 which shows good simulation ability mme has the best simulation ability for air temperature with a correlation coefficient of 0 99 p 0 01 and its sd and rmse are also close to the observed values indicating that mme can better simulate the temperature in the study area as shown in fig 3 b the simulation capacity of precipitation is generally worse than that of temperature the correlation coefficient of 24 gcms is between 0 51 and 0 76 and the rmse and sd fluctuate around 50 however by contrast mme has the largest correlation coefficient and sd and rmse are smaller to sum up mme can well simulate the temperature and precipitation in the study area therefore the mme was selected for follow up research 3 3 temporal and spatial variation of millet drought under climate change 3 3 1 temporal variation of spri fig 4 shows the variation trend of spri of millet in the early middle and late growth periods in northern china in the baseline and the future under different scenarios as can be seen in the baseline a1 a3 spri showed a downward trend in all growth periods except for a slight increase in the early growth period of millet under different scenarios spri showed a decreasing trend b1 c1 d1 in early growth period under ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 spri decreases at a speed of 0 04 10a while spri shows a slight decreasing trend under ssp2 4 5 which may be related to the increase of precipitation predicted by ssp2 4 5 li et al 2021a in middle growth period b2 c2 d2 except for ssp1 2 6 the decreasing trend of spri in other scenarios is weaker than that in early growth period indicating that precipitation in the middle growth period of millet will increase in the future in the late growth period b3 c3 d3 spri shows the same downward trend at 0 03 10a in all three scenarios in general spri universally shows a decreasing trend in different growth periods under different scenarios indicating that millet growing season tended to become drought with climate warming in addition spri fluctuates slightly and mild drought is dominant in most years under ssp1 2 6 however the fluctuation range of spri increases significantly under ssp5 8 5 and the years of moderate drought increases which is related to the enhanced uncertainty of precipitation resources under the background of climate change 3 3 2 spatial variation of spri to analyze the spatial variation of spri sen trend analysis and mk significance test were carried out for spri in different growth periods of millet in northern china under the background of climate change fig 5 the results show that in different scenarios and different growth periods of millet spri mostly shows the change trend of decline in the east rise in the west decline in the south and rise in the north in early growth period b1 c1 d1 climate change makes the area where the spri decreases greatly increase especially under ssp5 8 5 spri in the west of northeast china significantly decreases and drought intensifies at the same time spri in the west of the study area increases significantly which is due to the increase of precipitation in this area in the future fig s2 which can meet the needs of millet growth and development in the early growth period and drought is weakened in the middle growth period b2 c2 d2 the spatial variation characteristics of spri are similar to that in the early growth period the difference is that under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 spri increases more in the west of the study area with a significant upward trend this may be that middle growth period of millet is in the rainy season the precipitation increases significantly and the level of drought decreases fig s2 in late growth period b3 c3 d3 the spatial variation of spri shows disorder and the regions of spri increasing are dispersed under ssp2 4 5 spri in the north central of the study area shows a significant increasing trend while under ssp5 8 5 spri in the west and north of the study area increases significantly in general the spatial variation of spri in the late growth period of millet is mainly upward and the level of drought is weakened 3 3 3 spatial variation of drought frequency as can be seen from fig 6 8 that under different scenarios and different growth periods millet is dominated by mild drought followed by moderate drought and severe drought is rare in the early growth period fig 6 mild drought occurs most frequently under ssp1 2 6 scenario b1 b3 and the frequency can reach more than 40 in northern gansu central and western inner mongolia compared with ssp1 2 6 the frequency of mild drought decreases significantly under ssp2 4 5 c1 c3 and ssp5 8 5 d1 d3 scenarios with the occurrence frequency of about 20 and more scattered distribution while the frequency of moderate drought increases mainly distributes in the west of northeast china south of north china and central and western inner mongolia in the middle growth period fig 7 the overall change trend of millet is consistent with that in the early growth period compared with the baseline period the frequency of mild drought under ssp1 2 6 scenario b1 b3 is significantly higher up to 40 and distributes in the north of northeast china the south of north china and the west and center of northwest china the frequency of moderate and severe drought has decreased under ssp2 4 5 scenario c1 c3 and ssp5 8 5 scenario d1 d3 the frequency of mild drought decreases by about 20 compared with ssp1 2 6 scenario but the frequency of moderate and severe drought increases by up to 15 which is consistent with the distribution in the baseline compared with the early and middle growth periods different degrees of drought occur more frequently in the late growth period of millet and the frequency of mild drought is still much higher than that of moderate and severe drought fig 8 in addition it is found that the frequency of moderate drought and severe drought of millet do not change significantly under different scenarios and the frequency of severe drought is very small less than 3 this is because millet is drought tolerant in the late growth period which may lead to severe drought only under the condition of extreme water shortage 3 4 change in millet drought hazard under climate change fig 9 shows the spatial distribution characteristics of drought hazard of millet at different growth periods under different scenarios according to different scenarios in the baseline a1 a4 millet in different growth periods is mainly middle hazard accounting for 33 06 41 86 which is distributed in a belt from northeast to southwest the area of high hazard is small mostly distributes in northern gansu and central and western inner mongolia compared with the baseline under ssp1 2 6 b1 b4 and ssp2 4 5 c1 c4 scenarios the middle hazard is still dominant at different growth periods of millet but the area is greatly increased up to 48 35 at the same time the area with sub high hazard decreases while the area with high hazard increases slightly under the scenario of ssp5 8 5 d1 d4 the area with middle hazard in different growth periods of millet decreases and the high hazard areas increases significantly mainly distributes in the west of the study area in terms of different growth periods in the early growth period a1 b1 c1 d1 the high hazard areas gradually increase from 0 59 to 11 22 mainly distribute in the northwest china and northeast china in the middle growth period a2 b2 c2 d2 the area with high hazard has no obvious change which is generally smaller than that in the early growth period and the spatial distribution is scattered in the late growth period a3 b3 c3 d3 the change of high risk areas is similar to that in the early growth period and the increase is relatively small in the whole growth period a4 b4 c4 d4 the distribution of high hazard areas is different under different scenarios but in general it is mainly distributed in the center and west of inner mongolia the north of gansu and the west of northeast china in conclusion the spatial distribution of drought hazard of millet varies greatly under different scenarios and growth periods it is necessary to timely adjust the planting layout and cultivation scheme according to the change of hazard in the process of millet planting so as to reduce the loss caused by drought disaster 4 discussion drought is a typical natural disaster in northern china with high frequency and wide impact range which will have a serious impact on agricultural production xie et al 2016 with climate warming many studies focus on the changes of agricultural drought in northern china in the future lei et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 however most of the studies apply meteorological drought indexes ignoring the difference between crop water requirement and potential evapotranspiration which cannot be used to characterize agricultural drought therefore in this study the crop coefficient is added into the calculation of actual evapotranspiration and the standardized precipitation requirement index spri is resorted to identify millet drought through the correlation analysis of spri with drought affected area drought area and relative meteorological yield of millet as well as the comparison with historical disaster information it is found that the index can more accurately represent the drought characteristics of millet in northern china the results of spri identification show that the drought of millet will generally present a weak aggravating trend in the future and drought was significantly aggravated in the eastern and southern regions of the study area while drought was alleviated in the northwest of the study area which is consistent with the research results of meteorological drought changes in china in the 21st century zhang et al 2021a yang et al 2022 in the construction of hazard assessment model considering the various effects of drought on millet growth at different degrees and in various growth periods the average rates of yield reduction under different degrees of drought are calculated by using the index discrimination and the corresponding yield reduction rate of millet and the disaster loss coefficient under different degrees of drought in different growth periods are also determined which can be used to show the drought intensity and further describe drought hazard on millet more precisely the results of this study show that under the background of climate change the hazard of millet drought in northern china shows a certain increasing trend and decreased in some areas but the overall hazard is still dominated by middle hazard with high hazard in the west of northeast china the middle and west of inner mongolia and the north of gansu in the context of climate change the precipitation will increase in northern china fig s2 and drought will be alleviated in some areas xu et al 2021 however it is still uncertain that how precipitation will alter in the future and as the temperature rises fig s3 the potential evapotranspiration and millet water requirement increases fig s4 making the future of millet drought in northern china unpredictable in the high hazard areas above millet drought showed an increase in intensity and a decrease in frequency leading to upward trend in drought hazard in addition from the different growth periods of millet the drought hazard in the early growth period of millet is the greatest the precipitation in northern china is concentrated from july to august which implied that there is relatively little water in the early growth period so millet is prone to drought jiang et al 2017 although drought in the early growth period has little influence on the final yield of millet insufficient water in this period is likely to affect millet s emergence and subsequent development han et al 2019 moreover it can be found that with the climate warming the high hazard areas in the early growth period of millet gradually increase which means that irrigation should be increased according to actual situation in order to ensure the smooth emergence of millet which will reduce the losses from drought agrometeorological disaster risk refers to the occurrence of agrometeorological disasters and the possibility of losses to agricultural production which has both natural and social attributes according to the theory of disaster risk system the magnitude of agrometeorological disaster risk is the result of the joint action of four elements hazard exposure vulnerability and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity zhang 2004 this paper focuses on the changes of drought hazard in different growth periods of millet under the background of climate change without considering the impact of millet varieties geographical characteristics of the study area and human factors in the future it is planned to conduct a more comprehensive risk assessment based on the vulnerability of millet itself exposure of disaster bearing bodies and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity 5 conclusion in this study millet in northern china was taken as the research object and the standardized precipitation requirement index spri was selected as the millet drought identification index to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of drought in different growth periods of millet under the background of climate change on this basis the millet drought hazard assessment model was constructed by considering the disaster loss coefficient of different degrees of drought in different growth periods to evaluate drought hazard of millet the results show that 1 in terms of time the spri in different growth periods under different scenarios shows a downward trend with the passage of time indicating that millet tends to drought during the whole growth period with climate warming in addition under ssp1 2 6 spri will fluctuate slightly and mild drought is dominant in most years however under ssp5 8 5 the volatility of spri will increase significantly and the years of moderate drought will increase spatially spri mainly shows a trend of decline in the east and south rise in the west and north in different growth periods under various scenarios 2 in different scenarios millet in different growth periods is dominated by mild drought followed by moderate drought and severe drought is few with climate warming the frequency of mild drought increases dramatically under ssp1 2 6 while the frequency of moderate and severe drought does not change significantly however the frequency of mild drought decreases and the frequency of moderate and severe drought increases under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 3 the spatial distribution of drought hazard in different growth periods of millet under different scenarios is very different but it is mainly dominant by middle hazard with climate warming the middle hazard areas increase and the sub high and high hazard areas decrease under ssp1 2 6 however under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 the middle hazard areas will decrease while the sub high and high hazard areas will increase mainly distribute in the northeast central and western of inner

9345,due to the national nutrition crisis and the adjustment of planting structure millet has once again become a widely planted cash crop in northern china however as the climate warms in recent years drought has occurred frequently and repeatedly in northern china which has seriously threatened millet production safety in this area therefore it is urgent to clarify the hazard of millet drought disaster and provide reference for the formulation of millet disaster prevention and reduction measures in this paper combined with the water demand of millet in each growth period standardized precipitation requirement index spri was selected to identify and quantify the drought disaster of millet considering the impact of different degrees of drought in different growth periods a hazard assessment model is constructed to evaluate the hazard of millet drought disaster in northern china under the background of climate change the results show that 1 spri can well characterize the drought of millet in northern china 2 in the context of climate change millet drought in northern china shows a trend of increasing intensity and decreasing frequency and it is possible that millet drought will be even more severe in the future 3 combined with the hazard assessment model millet drought in northern china will still be dominated by middle hazard in the future but the areas with high hazard will gradually increase mainly distributed in northeast china central and western inner mongolia and northern gansu the research results can be of great practical significance for the adjustment of agricultural production structure in the future especially for the sustainable development of agriculture and the formulation of measures to prevent and resist agricultural disasters graphical abstract ga1 keywords standardized precipitation requirement index millet drought hazard assessment model climate change data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the first part of the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc pointed out that the global surface temperature continued to rise with an increase of about 1 1 compared with 1850 1990 tollefson 2021 extreme weather caused by global warming has increased since 1950 and some regions may suffer from more frequent and serious drought disasters in the future guo et al 2022 tegegne et al 2020 due to the changeable terrain and complex geographical environment northern china is one of the regions where was most seriously affected by climate warming drought occurs frequently and food security is seriously threatened ding et al 2021 song et al 2021 millet is rich in nutrition and widely used it can be used as a food source for people s daily lives as well as a high quality raw material for the processing of agricultural and sideline products in the era of continuous improvement of living standards millet the first of coarse cereals is becoming more and more popular liu et al 2020 meng et al 2020 millet has a high yield per unit area and a huge potential for production increase which plays an important role in ensuring human food security and reduce poverty li et al 2021b northern china is the main millet producing area in china with the sown area and yield accounting for more than 90 of all areas and yields in spite of this millet growth and development are often threatened by drought disasters which seriously affect millet yield from june to august in 2014 the precipitation in northern china remained low with precipitation in most areas 20 50 lower than that in the same period of the previous year among them liaoning jilin and henan provinces all recorded the lowest precipitation in the same period since 1951 in addition the continuous high temperature in july in most parts of northern china led to the rapid development of drought resulting in a large scale reduction of millet production which was only 50 of the yield of the previous year china meteorological administration 2015 as for may 2017 the precipitation in north china the west of northeast china and the east of inner mongolia was less than 200 mm which was 30 80 less than that in the same period of the previous year and more than 80 less locally the progress of spring ploughing and sowing was slow which negatively impact the growth of local millet china meteorological administration 2018 although the frequency of millet drought generally shows a decreasing trend according to the climate warming the intensity of drought may increase in some areas due to the greater fluctuation of climate elements ayantobo et al 2017 therefore it is urgent to make clear the change characteristics of millet drought disaster and quantitatively evaluate the risk of millet drought disaster in the process of formulating agricultural disaster prevention and reduction measures disaster hazard is an important part of the four elements of the disaster risk system the other three elements are vulnerability exposure and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity zhang 2004 agrometeorological disaster hazard refers to the abnormal degree of meteorological factors that are likely to harm crops zhang et al 2014 at present relevant studies are mainly divided into the following two categories one is to use meteorological indicators as disaster inducing factor identification indicators for hazard assessment for example hu et al 2021 used spei to identify maize drought in the huang huai hai plain and comprehensively analyzed the characteristics and hazard distribution of maize drought disasters by using gis spatial analysis and disaster risk assessment zhang et al 2021b took the daily maximum temperature 35 as the index of extreme heat for summer maize and combined with copula function to estimate the hazard of extreme heat damage of maize in haihe plain however since the meteorological indicators did not take into account the biological processes of crops they were only able to determine the spatial temporal pattern and development trend of meteorological disasters in the whole region and could not assess directly how much agrometeorological disasters impacted crop yield therefore more and more researches tend to focus on the second category that is to develop a new agrometeorological disaster index to identify the disaster of specific crops and evaluate their hazard investigators such as yang and zhou 2015 selected heat index water deficit index and z index as identification indexes of chilling injury drought and flood disaster combining with the maximum entropy model to evaluate the comprehensive hazard of major agrometeorological disasters of maize in northeast china yang et al 2021b constructed an apple drought index based on water demand and precipitation supply during different growth periods and used this index to assess the drought hazard of apples in northern china overall agrometeorological disaster hazard assessment is established on the index selection quantifying the agrometeorological disasters and evaluating it over the whole growth period nevertheless the evaluation results aren t reliable as they fail to consider the impact of disasters at different degrees on the growth and development of crops during different periods of growth to sum up the current research system on the hazard of agrometeorological disasters is seemingly perfect but it narrowly focuses on field food crops and characteristic forest and fruit crops the existing studies on millet a field cash crop mainly include the effects of drought on millet lu et al 2015 mukami et al 2019 the analysis of meteorological conditions in the process of millet production bhattarai et al 2020 yang et al 2020 and the climatic suitability regionalization egbebiyi et al 2020 luitel et al 2020 but there are still few studies on the hazard of millet drought disaster lacking corresponding evaluation indicators therefore this study takes millet in northern china as a research object from the perspective of disaster hazard in the disaster risk system combining with the growth and development characteristics of millet this study also selects corresponding indicators to analyze the occurrence regularity and spatial temporal distribution characteristics of millet drought disaster in the context of climate change according to the occurrence frequency and the impact of different degrees of drought disaster in different growth periods the millet drought disaster hazard assessment model is constructed to evaluate the millet drought disaster hazard in northern china considering climate change the research results can provide reference for scientific planning and management of millet production as well as improve the effect of meteorological disaster prevention and reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is a potential millet planting area in northern china which is located between 31 23 53 33 n and 93 13 135 05 e fig 1 it covers spring millet area in northeast china heilongjiang jilin and liaoning summer millet area in north china inner mongolia hebei shanxi shandong and henan and spring millet area in northwest china shaanxi gansu and ningxia with a total area of about 3 38 106 km2 accounting for 35 of china s total land area including about 6 46 105 km2 of cultivated land accounting for 53 of china s total cultivated land area the study area spans four climatic regions humid semi humid arid and semi arid the average annual temperature ranges from 5 6 to 13 7 and the average annual rainfall ranges from 150 to 1100 mm which gradually decreases from the southeast coast to the northwest inland zheng et al 2020 chen et al 2020 yin et al 2022 northern china is the main millet producing area in china with a perennial planting area of about 7 33 105 hectares millet is usually sown in may and harvested in september 2 2 data set and sources 2 2 1 meteorological data 2 2 1 1 historical observation data the historical observation data used in this study came from the national earth system science data center national science technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn peng et al 2019 including the monthly average temperature and monthly precipitation from 1960 to 2019 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 the resolution was unified to 0 1 0 1 which was used for the calculation of millet drought index 2 2 1 2 cmip6 data in this study monthly average temperature and monthly precipitation output from 24 global climate models table 1 in cmip6 are used for 2020 2099 these models have been used in previous studies to simulate the temperature and precipitation in northern china their good simulation capability has been confirmed by calculating and analyzing the relative error and root mean square error song et al 2021 ma et al 2022 song and yan 2022 the climate scenarios of ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 combined with shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and representation concentration pathways rcps released by ipcc in 2020 were selected for analysis representing low emission forcing medium emission forcing and high emission forcing scenarios in turn shafeeque and luo 2021 the spatial resolution of 24 global climate models was different so the bilinear interpolation method was used to unify the spatial resolution of data to 0 1 0 1 which was used for the subsequent multi model ensemble average and calculation of millet drought index 2 2 2 crop data the crop data were obtained from the statistical yearbook of all provinces and cities in the study area from 1960 to 2019 including sowing area annual yield and annual average yield per unit area of millet due to the large span between east and west in the study area in order to facilitate the comparison of spatial results the growth period is uniformly calculated from early may to late september and the early may to late june was selected as the early growth period the early july to late july was the middle growth period and the early august to late september was the late growth period 2 2 3 historical disaster data historical disaster data were mainly from china agriculture yearbook yearbook of meteorological disasters in china report of the damage caused by disaster in china and the china meteorological disaster dictionary of all provinces in the study area 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 standardized precipitation requirement index at present meteorological drought indexes were often used to evaluate the impact of drought in agricultural drought disaster however agricultural drought is not equal to meteorological drought and different crops respond differently to meteorological drought so these indexes were difficult to indicate the impact of drought on crops therefore the key to study agricultural drought is to select suitable agricultural drought index for specific crops in this study standardized precipitation requirement index spri was selected as the drought assessment index for millet considering the different water requirements at different growth periods which was added into the calculation based on standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei wei et al 2021 the calculation process and formula are as follows 1 calculate the water requirement of millet in different growth periods 1 et c i k c i et 0 i where et c i is the water requirement of millet at the i growth period mm et 0 i is the reference evapotranspiration in the i growth period mm reflecting the influence of atmospheric evaporation capacity in different periods and regions on crop water requirement which was calculated by thornthwatie fu et al 2019 formula 2 this is the method for calculating et0 recommended in gb t 20481 2006 meteorological drought grade standard ari et al 2021 compared with penman monteith method its required data are easier to obtain in humid semi humid and semi arid areas there is little difference between et0 calculated by thornthwatie method and penman monteith method yang et al 2017 xu et al 2018 and its temporal variation and spatial distribution characteristics are consistent under the background of climate change cao and gao 2019 zhou et al 2020 therefore thornthwatie method is selected for the calculation of et0 in the context of climate change kc is crop coefficient of millet reflecting the comprehensive effect of soil evaporation and crop transpiration which are affected by various factors such as climate conditions soil evaporation crop types and crop growth conditions pascual seva and pascual 2021 in this paper the crop coefficients of millet at different growth periods are determined based on the actual situation of the study area gao et al 2021 table 2 2 et 0 i 16 k 10 t i h i a where t i is the monthly average temperature h is the annual heat index k is the correction factor calculated according to latitude and month a is a constant if t i 0 h i 0 and et 0 i 0 2 calculate the difference between precipitation and millet water requirement in each growth period 3 d i p i et c i where p i is the precipitation at the i growth period mm 3 normalize the difference between precipitation and millet water requirement adopt the log logistic probability distribution function of three parameters standardize the probability density and calculate the corresponding spri the formula of log logistic probability distribution function is 4 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where α βandγ were obtained by fitting with linear moment method standardize the cumulative probability density 5 v 1 f x if v 0 5 6 w 2 ln v if v 0 5 7 w 2 ln 1 v 8 spri c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 w where is c 0 2 515517 c 1 0 802853 c 2 0 010328 d 1 1 432788 d 2 0 189269 d 3 0 001308 according to spei drought classification yao et al 2018 spri was divided into four levels to determine the drought classification standard table 3 2 3 2 drought frequency drought frequency pij yang et al 2021a refers to the percentage of drought disaster years in the total number of years which can generally represent the frequency of disasters in this study spri was extracted to each meteorological station for the calculation of drought frequency and its spatial distribution was obtained by inverse distance weight interpolation method 9 p ij n ij n 100 where n ij is the number of years occurred j level drought in the i growth period of a station and n is the total number of years 2 3 3 sen s slope and mann kendall test sen slope estimation is a robust non parametric statistical trend calculation method which is highly efficient and insensitive to measurement error and outlier data it is often used in trend analysis of long time series data however it cannot realize the significance judgment of the sequence trend by itself and the mann kendall method has no requirements on the sequence distribution and is insensitive to outliers therefore this method is introduced to test the significance of the sequence trend the significance of the change trend is judged by the z of the mk test under the given α significant level if z z 1 α 2 that indicated he research sequence had a significant changes in the α significant level when z 1 96 mean the trend passed significance test at α 0 05 the specific calculation method can be seen in zhao et al 2019 2 3 4 climate yield and yield fluctuation in general the actual yield y of crops can be divided into three parts that is the trend yield with the improvement of social production level the meteorological yield fluctuating with historical meteorological conditions and the random noise that is generally ignored li et al 2021c 10 y y t y w ε where y is the millet yield per unit area yt is the trend yield yw is the meteorological yield and ε is the random noise the linear moving average method is used to simulate the trend yield and the relative meteorological yield yr is calculated according to formula 11 the relative meteorological yield is a relative value indicating the degree to which the actual grain yield deviates from the trend yield when the actual yield is lower than the trend yield that is the relative meteorological yield is negative it is a reduction in yield the percentage of the actual yield per unit lower than the trend yield is called the reduction rate in yield 11 y r y w y t 100 2 3 5 establishment of hazard assessment model for the hazard of millet drought disaster the greater the intensity and frequency of disaster the higher the hazard so the hazard was represented by the product of disaster intensity disaster loss coefficient and frequency however due to millet in different growth periods suffered different degrees of drought disaster for millet production effect is different this study based on the occurrence of drought disasters at each station in the study area determined by spri selected the years in which mild moderate and severe drought occur alone in the early middle and late growth period resulted in yield reduction yield reduction rate 5 so as to calculate the average yield reduction rate of each level drought in each growth period on this basis the disaster loss coefficient of a certain level drought in a certain growth period is defined as the ratio of the average yield reduction rate of a certain level drought in a certain growth period to the sum of the average yield reduction rate caused by different level drought disasters in each growth period 12 w ij y ij i 1 3 j 1 3 y ij where wij is the disaster loss coefficient of j level drought in i growth period table 4 yij is average yield reduction rate of j level drought in i growth period drought disaster hazard model of millet in each growth period is expressed as 13 h xi j 1 3 p ij w ij 14 h x i 1 3 h xi the spatial distribution of drought hazard in different growth periods of the study area was calculated by formula 13 and 14 the fuzzy membership function in arcgis was used to normalize the drought hazard and the optimal segmentation method was used to divide the drought hazard into five grades low sub low middle sub high and high and the hazard of drought disaster in different growth periods of millet was analyzed 2 3 6 taylor diagram and multi model ensemble taylor diagram can display the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and standard deviation sd of simulated and observed data sets in polar coordinates and can comprehensively and directly evaluate the simulation ability and differences of various gcms huang et al 2022 with the application and development of climate models the research on multi mode ensemble is becoming more and more in depth previous studies have shown that the cmip6 multi model ensemble mme can reasonably reproduce the spatial distribution of annual average climate of observed precipitation and temperature as well as the annual cycle characteristics zhu et al 2020 ma et al 2022 therefore in this paper the equal weight method zuo et al 2020 is adopted to carry out ensemble average for 24 global climate models and taylor diagram is used to evaluate the simulation ability of mme 15 x 1 n i 1 n x i where x is the result of multi model ensemble xi is the value of each model and n is the number of models 3 results 3 1 applicability analysis of spri since northern china is a major grain producing area in this country the occurrence of drought would have a direct impact on agricultural production in this region in this paper pearson correlation coefficient between spri and drought affected areas drought areas and relative meteorological yield of millet in 11 provinces of the study area were calculated to discuss the applicability of spri in characterizing millet drought the results are shown in fig 2 the pearson correlation coefficient between spri and drought affected areas and drought areas in 11 provinces is mostly negative which means with the increase of spri the decrease of drought level the area affected by drought drought affected areas and drought areas decreases indicating that spri can reflect the agricultural drought and drought level in the study area in addition spri was positively correlated with the relative meteorological yield of millet which implies the relative meteorological yield of millet increased with the increase of spri and it was obvious that the correlation between spri and relative meteorological yield of millet was the greatest in the late growth period indicating that the drought condition in the late growth period basically determined the millet yield it is noteworthy that spri was negatively correlated with the relative meteorological yield of millet in some areas during the early growth period this is because the early growth period is highly susceptible to cold weather in the northern china and the temperature is too low which affects the emergence of millet and thus the final millet yield therefore even if there is no drought in this period the millet yield will be reduced under the effect of low temperature which makes spri negatively correlated with the elative meteorological yield of millet in addition through the variation trend of drought affected area drought area millet production and spri in different growth periods from 1980 to 2019 fig s1 it can be seen that the change trend of spri and the relative meteorological yield of millet is the most similar and the change range of drought affected area and drought area is larger which further confirms that spri is a drought index suitable for millet in conclusion spri has a good ability to characterize the actual drought and the relative meteorological yield of millet in northern china in other words spri index can characterize the millet drought in this region in order to further analyze the applicability of spri in the identification of drought disasters in millet in northern china the drought events identified by spri were statistically analyzed in this study and compared with historical drought events the results are shown in table 5 it can be seen that spri can identify most typical drought events in the study area which reflects that it has a good applicability in drought identification of millet growth period in northern china 3 2 climate model capability assessment in cmip6 the historical simulation of each model only runs up to 2014 therefore based on the observed data we calculated the r correlation coefficient sd standard deviation and rmse root mean square error between the simulated and observed values of monthly average temperature monthly precipitation from 1960 to 2014 and plotted them in the taylor diagram to objectively evaluate the simulation ability of 24 gcms in the historical climate scenario in the study area fig 3 the color shapes in the figure correspond to 24 gcms and 1 mme multi model ensemble the red dot on the horizontal axis represents the observation values of meteorological stations the closer the model point is to the observation point the stronger the simulation ability of the model as shown in fig 3 a the correlation coefficient between each model and the observed temperature is between 0 94 and 0 98 which shows good simulation ability mme has the best simulation ability for air temperature with a correlation coefficient of 0 99 p 0 01 and its sd and rmse are also close to the observed values indicating that mme can better simulate the temperature in the study area as shown in fig 3 b the simulation capacity of precipitation is generally worse than that of temperature the correlation coefficient of 24 gcms is between 0 51 and 0 76 and the rmse and sd fluctuate around 50 however by contrast mme has the largest correlation coefficient and sd and rmse are smaller to sum up mme can well simulate the temperature and precipitation in the study area therefore the mme was selected for follow up research 3 3 temporal and spatial variation of millet drought under climate change 3 3 1 temporal variation of spri fig 4 shows the variation trend of spri of millet in the early middle and late growth periods in northern china in the baseline and the future under different scenarios as can be seen in the baseline a1 a3 spri showed a downward trend in all growth periods except for a slight increase in the early growth period of millet under different scenarios spri showed a decreasing trend b1 c1 d1 in early growth period under ssp1 2 6 and ssp5 8 5 spri decreases at a speed of 0 04 10a while spri shows a slight decreasing trend under ssp2 4 5 which may be related to the increase of precipitation predicted by ssp2 4 5 li et al 2021a in middle growth period b2 c2 d2 except for ssp1 2 6 the decreasing trend of spri in other scenarios is weaker than that in early growth period indicating that precipitation in the middle growth period of millet will increase in the future in the late growth period b3 c3 d3 spri shows the same downward trend at 0 03 10a in all three scenarios in general spri universally shows a decreasing trend in different growth periods under different scenarios indicating that millet growing season tended to become drought with climate warming in addition spri fluctuates slightly and mild drought is dominant in most years under ssp1 2 6 however the fluctuation range of spri increases significantly under ssp5 8 5 and the years of moderate drought increases which is related to the enhanced uncertainty of precipitation resources under the background of climate change 3 3 2 spatial variation of spri to analyze the spatial variation of spri sen trend analysis and mk significance test were carried out for spri in different growth periods of millet in northern china under the background of climate change fig 5 the results show that in different scenarios and different growth periods of millet spri mostly shows the change trend of decline in the east rise in the west decline in the south and rise in the north in early growth period b1 c1 d1 climate change makes the area where the spri decreases greatly increase especially under ssp5 8 5 spri in the west of northeast china significantly decreases and drought intensifies at the same time spri in the west of the study area increases significantly which is due to the increase of precipitation in this area in the future fig s2 which can meet the needs of millet growth and development in the early growth period and drought is weakened in the middle growth period b2 c2 d2 the spatial variation characteristics of spri are similar to that in the early growth period the difference is that under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 spri increases more in the west of the study area with a significant upward trend this may be that middle growth period of millet is in the rainy season the precipitation increases significantly and the level of drought decreases fig s2 in late growth period b3 c3 d3 the spatial variation of spri shows disorder and the regions of spri increasing are dispersed under ssp2 4 5 spri in the north central of the study area shows a significant increasing trend while under ssp5 8 5 spri in the west and north of the study area increases significantly in general the spatial variation of spri in the late growth period of millet is mainly upward and the level of drought is weakened 3 3 3 spatial variation of drought frequency as can be seen from fig 6 8 that under different scenarios and different growth periods millet is dominated by mild drought followed by moderate drought and severe drought is rare in the early growth period fig 6 mild drought occurs most frequently under ssp1 2 6 scenario b1 b3 and the frequency can reach more than 40 in northern gansu central and western inner mongolia compared with ssp1 2 6 the frequency of mild drought decreases significantly under ssp2 4 5 c1 c3 and ssp5 8 5 d1 d3 scenarios with the occurrence frequency of about 20 and more scattered distribution while the frequency of moderate drought increases mainly distributes in the west of northeast china south of north china and central and western inner mongolia in the middle growth period fig 7 the overall change trend of millet is consistent with that in the early growth period compared with the baseline period the frequency of mild drought under ssp1 2 6 scenario b1 b3 is significantly higher up to 40 and distributes in the north of northeast china the south of north china and the west and center of northwest china the frequency of moderate and severe drought has decreased under ssp2 4 5 scenario c1 c3 and ssp5 8 5 scenario d1 d3 the frequency of mild drought decreases by about 20 compared with ssp1 2 6 scenario but the frequency of moderate and severe drought increases by up to 15 which is consistent with the distribution in the baseline compared with the early and middle growth periods different degrees of drought occur more frequently in the late growth period of millet and the frequency of mild drought is still much higher than that of moderate and severe drought fig 8 in addition it is found that the frequency of moderate drought and severe drought of millet do not change significantly under different scenarios and the frequency of severe drought is very small less than 3 this is because millet is drought tolerant in the late growth period which may lead to severe drought only under the condition of extreme water shortage 3 4 change in millet drought hazard under climate change fig 9 shows the spatial distribution characteristics of drought hazard of millet at different growth periods under different scenarios according to different scenarios in the baseline a1 a4 millet in different growth periods is mainly middle hazard accounting for 33 06 41 86 which is distributed in a belt from northeast to southwest the area of high hazard is small mostly distributes in northern gansu and central and western inner mongolia compared with the baseline under ssp1 2 6 b1 b4 and ssp2 4 5 c1 c4 scenarios the middle hazard is still dominant at different growth periods of millet but the area is greatly increased up to 48 35 at the same time the area with sub high hazard decreases while the area with high hazard increases slightly under the scenario of ssp5 8 5 d1 d4 the area with middle hazard in different growth periods of millet decreases and the high hazard areas increases significantly mainly distributes in the west of the study area in terms of different growth periods in the early growth period a1 b1 c1 d1 the high hazard areas gradually increase from 0 59 to 11 22 mainly distribute in the northwest china and northeast china in the middle growth period a2 b2 c2 d2 the area with high hazard has no obvious change which is generally smaller than that in the early growth period and the spatial distribution is scattered in the late growth period a3 b3 c3 d3 the change of high risk areas is similar to that in the early growth period and the increase is relatively small in the whole growth period a4 b4 c4 d4 the distribution of high hazard areas is different under different scenarios but in general it is mainly distributed in the center and west of inner mongolia the north of gansu and the west of northeast china in conclusion the spatial distribution of drought hazard of millet varies greatly under different scenarios and growth periods it is necessary to timely adjust the planting layout and cultivation scheme according to the change of hazard in the process of millet planting so as to reduce the loss caused by drought disaster 4 discussion drought is a typical natural disaster in northern china with high frequency and wide impact range which will have a serious impact on agricultural production xie et al 2016 with climate warming many studies focus on the changes of agricultural drought in northern china in the future lei et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 however most of the studies apply meteorological drought indexes ignoring the difference between crop water requirement and potential evapotranspiration which cannot be used to characterize agricultural drought therefore in this study the crop coefficient is added into the calculation of actual evapotranspiration and the standardized precipitation requirement index spri is resorted to identify millet drought through the correlation analysis of spri with drought affected area drought area and relative meteorological yield of millet as well as the comparison with historical disaster information it is found that the index can more accurately represent the drought characteristics of millet in northern china the results of spri identification show that the drought of millet will generally present a weak aggravating trend in the future and drought was significantly aggravated in the eastern and southern regions of the study area while drought was alleviated in the northwest of the study area which is consistent with the research results of meteorological drought changes in china in the 21st century zhang et al 2021a yang et al 2022 in the construction of hazard assessment model considering the various effects of drought on millet growth at different degrees and in various growth periods the average rates of yield reduction under different degrees of drought are calculated by using the index discrimination and the corresponding yield reduction rate of millet and the disaster loss coefficient under different degrees of drought in different growth periods are also determined which can be used to show the drought intensity and further describe drought hazard on millet more precisely the results of this study show that under the background of climate change the hazard of millet drought in northern china shows a certain increasing trend and decreased in some areas but the overall hazard is still dominated by middle hazard with high hazard in the west of northeast china the middle and west of inner mongolia and the north of gansu in the context of climate change the precipitation will increase in northern china fig s2 and drought will be alleviated in some areas xu et al 2021 however it is still uncertain that how precipitation will alter in the future and as the temperature rises fig s3 the potential evapotranspiration and millet water requirement increases fig s4 making the future of millet drought in northern china unpredictable in the high hazard areas above millet drought showed an increase in intensity and a decrease in frequency leading to upward trend in drought hazard in addition from the different growth periods of millet the drought hazard in the early growth period of millet is the greatest the precipitation in northern china is concentrated from july to august which implied that there is relatively little water in the early growth period so millet is prone to drought jiang et al 2017 although drought in the early growth period has little influence on the final yield of millet insufficient water in this period is likely to affect millet s emergence and subsequent development han et al 2019 moreover it can be found that with the climate warming the high hazard areas in the early growth period of millet gradually increase which means that irrigation should be increased according to actual situation in order to ensure the smooth emergence of millet which will reduce the losses from drought agrometeorological disaster risk refers to the occurrence of agrometeorological disasters and the possibility of losses to agricultural production which has both natural and social attributes according to the theory of disaster risk system the magnitude of agrometeorological disaster risk is the result of the joint action of four elements hazard exposure vulnerability and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity zhang 2004 this paper focuses on the changes of drought hazard in different growth periods of millet under the background of climate change without considering the impact of millet varieties geographical characteristics of the study area and human factors in the future it is planned to conduct a more comprehensive risk assessment based on the vulnerability of millet itself exposure of disaster bearing bodies and disaster prevention and mitigation capacity 5 conclusion in this study millet in northern china was taken as the research object and the standardized precipitation requirement index spri was selected as the millet drought identification index to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of drought in different growth periods of millet under the background of climate change on this basis the millet drought hazard assessment model was constructed by considering the disaster loss coefficient of different degrees of drought in different growth periods to evaluate drought hazard of millet the results show that 1 in terms of time the spri in different growth periods under different scenarios shows a downward trend with the passage of time indicating that millet tends to drought during the whole growth period with climate warming in addition under ssp1 2 6 spri will fluctuate slightly and mild drought is dominant in most years however under ssp5 8 5 the volatility of spri will increase significantly and the years of moderate drought will increase spatially spri mainly shows a trend of decline in the east and south rise in the west and north in different growth periods under various scenarios 2 in different scenarios millet in different growth periods is dominated by mild drought followed by moderate drought and severe drought is few with climate warming the frequency of mild drought increases dramatically under ssp1 2 6 while the frequency of moderate and severe drought does not change significantly however the frequency of mild drought decreases and the frequency of moderate and severe drought increases under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 3 the spatial distribution of drought hazard in different growth periods of millet under different scenarios is very different but it is mainly dominant by middle hazard with climate warming the middle hazard areas increase and the sub high and high hazard areas decrease under ssp1 2 6 however under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 the middle hazard areas will decrease while the sub high and high hazard areas will increase mainly distribute in the northeast central and western of inner

9346,both empirical models and process based models of ammonia nh3 volatilization simulation in paddy field have some disadvantages this work describes a semi empirical semi process model which combines the simplicity of empirical models with the precision of process based models and its combinatorial structure is sufficient for reproducing the characteristic course of nh3 volatilization in paddy fields under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes over time a dataset consisting of seven rice seasons across three locations was used for model development performance indexes showed the model is good r 2 values ranged from 0 67 to 0 94 the influence of air temperature and wind speed on nh3 volatilization was not as great as our conventional understanding and soil temperature was a more accurate indicator than air temperature for model development model performance was better where the less urea splits and the higher urea rate but there was no significant difference between alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation mode average values of r 2 ia nsi and rmse were 0 82 0 94 0 96 and 0 53 kg ha 1 d 1 and flooding irrigation fi mode average values of r 2 ia nsi and rmse were 0 86 0 94 0 96 and 0 58 kg ha 1 d 1 the ammonium nitrogen nh4 n concentration and ph of surface water and soil water in paddy fields had the greatest impact on nh3 volatilization and they were mainly related to the amount of urea applied splitting the urea application and delaying the first urea application are the fundamental countermeasures to reduce nh3 volatilization the magnitude of developed model performance varied among rice cropping systems irrigation modes urea application regimes and climatic regions highlighting the need to understand why measured nh3 volatilization varies among locations the new model may be a useful tool for predicting fertilizer efficiency of paddy fields applied urea assessing nh3 volatilization factors and reducing emission

cultivation accounts for approximately 21 25 of the global nitrogen fertilizer use chauhan et al 2017 it has been widely recognized that nh3 volatilization is one of the main avenues of nitrogen loss from paddy fields soares et al 2012 xu et al 2017a accounting for 15 60 of the applied nitrogen loss xue et al 2014 nh3 volatilization mainly contributes to low nitrogen use efficiency and nh3 is a significant factor influencing the formation of delicate particulate matter pm2 5 stokstad 2014 with the latter affecting the global climate as it alters the earth s radiation budget hauglustaine et al 2014 nh3 in the air can be converted into n2o under certain circumstances intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2006 in addition discharged nh3 also returns to land and surface water through sedimentation leading to soil acidification eutrophication and biodiversity loss hellsten et al 2008 guo et al 2010 fields observation of nh3 volatilization can be time consuming laborious and can be easily disturbed dubache et al 2019 in recent years various nh3 volatilization prediction models have been developed including process based models petersen et al 2014 congreves et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 and empirical models misselbrook et al 2005 gyldenkærne et al 2005 process based models are more likely to be accurate under new conditions and predicting complex responses cuddington et al 2013 while empirical models generally have fewer parameters require fewer input variables and are simpler and easier to use both empirical and process based models contain significant empirical components hafner et al 2019 for example the dndc model has been widely applied as a process based model to simulate nh3 volatilization chen et al 2016 dutta et al 2016 balasubramanian et al 2017 giltrap et al 2017 however it performs poorly gilhespy et al 2014 and includes a simplistic equation for determining slurry ph based on measurements from a single study li et al 2019 congreves et al 2016 furthermore the dndc model is written in c and is not an open source model meaning its code is challenging to rewrite to optimize the simulation process even if its simulation results for nh3 volatilization were inaccurate yang et al 2012 li et al 2019 dubache et al 2019 other process based models such as manner alfam daycent century daisy and volt air also have empirical components nicholson et al 2013 søgaard et al 2002 schils et al 2007 del grosso et al 2002 urea is the most commonly used nitrogen fertilizer in paddy fields scherger et al 2022 especially in developing countries ifa 2017 urea has a fast hydrolysis rate in paddy fields and the nh4 n concentration in field water reached its peak on the first or second day after urea was applied han et al 2021 when urea is applied the nh3 volatilization is mainly affected by the fertilizer application rate fertilization methods water management practices climate conditions and soil properties dattamudi et al 2016 misselbrook et al 2004 xu et al 2017a b louro et al 2013 webb et al 2006 thus many empirical models of nh3 volatilization are based on these influencing factors petersen et al 2014 shan et al 2015 these models can estimate the nh3 volatilization load to some extent but they cannot describe the nh3 volatilization process deeply or accurately enough because of a shortage of water resources water saving irrigation wsi modes are widely used in paddy fields and they have an important influence on nh3 volatilization lahue et al 2016 xu et al 2017b under the wsi modes the soil in paddy fields alternates between drying and wetting frequently affecting the physical and chemical properties of the soil which in turn affects the nh3 volatilization process ishfaq et al 2020 most researchers have focused on simulating nh3 volatilization under fi mode while few have paid attention to that under wsi in view of the process based models require a large number of input parameters and are difficult to optimize the simulation process and the empirical models are not deep and accurate enough with the soil moisture dynamic changes under different irrigation modes therefore combining process based models with the empirical models to obtain a concise and efficient semi empirical semi process model of nh3 volatilization for paddy fields is necessary in order to be useful for both research and management parameter estimates should include the effects of common types of irrigation modes and urea application regimes along with major environmental effects however the model should require only the values of a small number of predictor variables for use our objective was to develop a model for nh3 volatilization from paddy fields with urea applied that strikes a balance between the simplicity of empirical models and the more accurate representation of processes achieved with a process based approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection to calibrate and evaluate the nh3 volatilization prediction model after urea application we utilized a dataset consisting of four separate experimental trials obtained by our team collectively including seven rice seasons between 1999 and 2017 across three locations fig 1 table 1 the experimental observation methods were either ventilation or micrometeorological with meteorological data recorded daily for a full description of materials and methods for each trial see cui et al 2004 li et al 2009 yu et al 2015 and han et al 2021 cui et al 2004 observed nh3 volatilization after surface application of urea with awd mode and fi mode during the 2001 and 2002 middle season rice seasons at the hubei central station of irrigation experiment tuanlin china hereafter referred to as the tuanlin station table 1 li et al 2009 also observed nh3 volatilization from the lysimeters in the tuanlin station their experiment was carried out during the 1999 and 2003 middle season rice seasons and awd and fi modes were used table 1 yu et al 2015 observed and analyzed the variation of nh3 volatilization in paddy fields under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes using ventilation method during the 2013 late rice season and the 2014 early rice season in jiangxi central station of irrigation experiment nanchang china hereafter referred to as the nanchang station table 1 han et al 2021 studied nh3 volatilization during the 2016 and 2017 middle season rice seasons in the dali observation and experiment station of china national agricultural environment hereafter referred to as the dali station an overview of this station can be found in han et al 2019 finally we utilized the dataset collected by chen et al 2015 which consisted of nh3 volatilization from paddy fields with urea applied in eryuan county hereafter referred to as the eryuan site a site about 35 km away from the dali station fig 1 the meteorological data were extracted from the openly accessible online database of china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn 2 2 model description our philosophy in designing this semi empirical semi process model has been to minimize complexity we first determine the factors affecting nh3 volatilization in paddy fields with urea applied if it is confirmed that a certain factor has an effect on nh3 volatilization but the influencing process is not clear we only rely on empirical expressions to determine for example if we have a good observation and understanding of nh4 n concentration change in soil water but do not understand the nitrification adsorption and exchange process of nh4 ion in soil as well as the escape and absorption process of nh3 molecules at the water air interface we will not further investigate these processes to improve the simulation accuracy of nh4 n concentration change and then maximize the simulation accuracy of nh3 volatilization increasing the complexity of some components of an nh3 volatilization model will not lead to more accurate predictions as long as important processes are not quantitatively understood and in some cases implementation of an incomplete process level understanding may result in a model less accurate than one that is more empirical because of inflexibility hafner et al 2019 compared with manure or organic manure the nh3 volatilization process in paddy fields with urea applied is relatively simple therefore on the basis of empirical model construction method nh3 volatilization process analysis is added to the change of soil physical and chemical properties in irrigation modes which is the simple and efficient basis for semi empirical semi process model construction in this regard as the semi empirical semi process model eq 1 was given to determine the nh3 volatilization from paddy fields under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes 1 f a f ca f scl f swc f r f t f w f ph f n where a is the comprehensive nh3 volatilization constant kg ha 1 d 1 f is

can be classified into four categories meteorological data irrigation modes and urea application regimes data soil data and rice canopy characteristics fig 2 2 3 model development 2 3 1 brief description modeling nh3 volatilization following urea dutta et al 2016 dubache et al 2019 swine slurry congreves et al 2016 synthetic fertilizers li et al 2019 application to farmlands by revising dndc model li et al 2016 have been conducted in addition to these processes directly adapted from revising dndc model four categories of simulation parameters in section 2 2 meteorological data irrigation modes and urea application regimes soil physicochemical properties and rice canopy parameters were simulated in the present study based on test data to achieve a semi empirical semi process model with the advantages of concision and high efficiency the four parameters fitting are detailed in the following subsections 2 3 2 parameters fitting for meteorological data meteorological condition is a key factor in regulating the processes related to nh3 volatilization the relationship between air temperature and nh3 volatilization is generally exponential fig 3a nh3 volatilization mainly occurs when the temperature is above 20 c nh3 volatilization increases with temperature increases however this trend is not significant r 2 0 21 p 0 12 the relationship between wind speed and nh3 volatilization follows a normal distribution fig 3b with increasing wind speed nh3 volatilization increases rapidly first and then decreases peaking when the wind speed is 1 3 m s 1 r 2 0 30 p 0 01 the relationship between rainfall and nh3 volatilization is logist fig 3c when rainfall occurs nh3 volatilization is reduced in bluff mode r 2 0 92 p 0 01 and when rainfall is over 5 mm nh3 volatilization is almost 0 according to the fitting results fig 3 f t f w and f r are expressed by eqs 2 4 2 f t e 5 4 t 24 2 0 13 3 f w e 5 w 1 3 2 0 06 4 f r 1 1 2 3 r 3 2 3 3 parameters fitting for irrigation modes and urea application regimes 2 3 3 1 when there was a water layer present in the field fig 4 shows no relationship between the water layer and the nh3 volatilization rate r 2 0 01 p 0 01 eq 5 which is consistent with the results from hayashi et al 2008 the clay content has little effect on nh3 volatilization and can be neglected eq 6 research has shown that the nh4 n concentration in the surface water dominates nh3 volatilization from a rice paddy hayashi et al 2008 xu et al 2012 lian et al 2018 and this is confirmed in fig 5 the nh3 volatilization rate has a significant linear relationship with the nh4 n concentration p 0 01 with an increase in nh4 n concentration the nh3 volatilization rate also increases eq 7 5 f swc 1 6 f scl 1 7 f n 0 01 nh 4 i 1 where nh 4 i is the nh4 n concentration in the field water nh 4 max and nh 4 min are the maximum and minimum nh4 n concentration in the field water during the rice growth period and their units are mg l 1 the change of nh4 n concentration of surface water conforms to first order kinetics fig 6 in addition the nitrogen brought by rainfall and irrigation is considered and the nh 4 i can be calculated by eq 8 others such as nitrification and denitrification fulazzaky et al 2015 plant uptake ata ul karim et al 2017 and nh4 n fixation lu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 xie et al 2021 are not considered again because the reduction or increase of nh4 n concentration caused by these effects are reflected in eq 8 and the exponential decay function in eq 8 is the embodiment of the overall decrease of nh4 n concentration 8 nh 4 i 0

nh3 volatilization are negatively correlated eq 9 this relationship was determined using obtained from 22 soils in china duan and xiao 2000 9 f scl e 0 06 scl the flow of nh4 n from the soil aqueous solution into the air is affected by the depth of the soil layer f swc which is determined by eqs 10 13 li et al 2016 these were derived by lee 2005 as the best function for estimating this soil

22 ph 6 87 2 0 035 2 3 5 parameters fitting for rice canopy change leaf area index lai is the embodiment of rice canopy fig 8 the fitting relationship between lai and nh3 volatilization can be regarded as the effect of rice canopy on nh3 volatilization paddy field surface was mainly exposed to solar radiation during the returning green stage within 7 days after transplanting and nh3 volatilization was not affected by the rice canopy that is f ca is 1 0 as the rice grows to its maximum lai the canopy began gradually to hinder the circulation of wind in the paddy field blocks the solar radiation reaching the field surface lowers the field surface temperature and then gradually limits the field nh3 volatilization the influence coefficient of the canopy on nh3 volatilization can be determined by eq 19 where t is the number of days for transplanting the rice 19 f ca 1 t 7 0 45 e 0 15 lai 0 55 t 7 as nh3 volatilization in the paddy field is a complicated process eqs 1 19 a constant adaptation factor was given to determine the volatilization coefficient for nh3 volatilization eq 20 which was calibrated to 18 using the nh3 volatilization fluxes of the four rice seasons at the tuanlin station cui et al 2004 li et al 2009 and the 2016 rice season at the dali station han et al 2021 in section 2 1 we selected these cases for this calibration because they cover a broad range of climates range plain and plateau rice cropping systems double cropping rice middle season rice and field management practices irrigation modes and fertilizer application regimes 20 f 18 f ca

root mean squared error rmse the index of agreement ia and the nash sutcliffe index nsi to evaluate the modeling efficiency between the observations o and simulations s nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 the closer the slope and r 2 are to 1 the better the model performance is with a slope less than 1 indicating an underestimation by the simulation otherwise an overestimation if the r 2 is negative it is remarked as not available nsi represents the prediction accuracy of the model the closer ia and nsi are to 1 the better the model performance is a positive nsi value indicates an acceptable simulation cui et al 2014 haas et al 2013 the error analysis has been one of the most applied tools for defining the best fitting models because it consists of different statistical methods for determining the values syafiuddin et al 2018 we choose r 2 rmse ia and nsi to evaluate the model which are also the choices of most researchers and can reflect the advantages and disadvantages of

results 3 1 model performance for middle season rice in dali station we selected the observation result from eight treatments in the 2017 rice season for the semi empirical semi process model eq 20 evaluation at the same time the widely used process based dndc model gilhespy et al 2014 was also used to simulate nh3 volatilization and its simulation performance was evaluated fig 9 illustrates the observed and simulated daily nh3 volatilization rate due to irrigation and urea application in the individual treatments overall the temporal patterns and magnitudes of the daily nh3 volatilization rates simulated by the semi empirical semi process model agreed with the observations the temporal patterns of the daily nh3 volatilization rates simulated by dndc also agreed with the observations however magnitudes simulated by dndc were significantly higher than the simulated values by the semi empirical semi process model and the observed values and almost 2 3 times higher than them this was consistent with the study results of nh3 volatilization from paddy fields simulated by dndc conducted by chen 2018 and gilhespy et al 2014 the daily nh3 volatilization rates simulated by the semi empirical semi process model showed r 2 values for the model ranged from 0 67 to 0 94 0 84 on average the ia values ranged from 0 89 to 0 98 0 94 on average the nsi values ranged from 0 94 to 0 99 0 96 on average and rmse ranged from 0 33 kg ha 1 d 1 to 0 78 kg ha 1 d 1 0 56 kg ha 1 d 1 on average table 2 these results demonstrated that the semi empirical semi process model used based on paddy fields observations from different studies can illustrate the nh3 volatilization from the middle season rice field under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes in terms of irrigation mode the average values of r 2 ia nsi and rmse were 0 82 0 94 0 96 and 0 53 kg ha 1 d 1 under awd and 0 86 0 94 0 96 and 0 58 kg ha 1 d 1 under fi respectively showing little differences in simulating the performance of irrigation modes in terms of nitrogen application rate the average values of r2 ia nsi and rmse were 0 86 0 95 0 97 and 0 575 kg ha 1 d 1 under n2 and 0 82 0 93 0 95 and 0 535 kg ha 1 d 1 under n1 respectively the value of r 2 ia and nsi under n2 were higher than those under n1 the nitrogen application rate of n2 was 43 higher than that of n1 in comparison the rmse of the model under n2 was only 7 5 higher than that under n1 indicating that the model was better for simulating a high nitrogen application rate than a low nitrogen application rate in terms of fertilization splits the average values of r 2 ia nsi and rmse were 0 89 0 95 0 96 0 585 kg ha 1 d 1 under f2 and 0 78 0 93 0 97 0 525 kg ha 1 d 1 under f3 respectively similarly the simulation performance under f2 using this model was slightly better than that under f3 3 2 model performance for middle season rice in the eryuan site compared with the observation results of our team at dali station the observation data at eryuan station was less as it was only observed within 5 7 days after fertilization fig 10 fig 10 also shows that the results of nh3 volatilization simulated by the semi empirical semi process model in the eryuan station are consistent with the observed values while the model s simulation performance using the evaluation indexes of r 2 0 753 is less than that 0 81 in chen et al 2015 they developed an empirical model using urea applied rate temperature and ph of surface water but overall the simulation performance of the semi empirical semi process model is good the model s simulation performance using the evaluation indexes of r 2 ia nsi and rmse were 0 753 0 887 0 962 and 0 60 kg ha 1 d 1 on average respectively table 3 except for the n0 treatment without fertilization the measured value of nh3 volatilization was higher which may be related to the strong soil organic nitrogen mineralization in eryuan 3 3 model performance for double cropping rice in nanchang station we also selected the observation result from the 2013 2014 rice seasons in the nanchang station for model calibration fig 11 this had r 2 ia nsi and rmse values of 0 95 0 99 0 99 and 0 29 kg ha 1 d 1 on average respectively table 4 the results simulated by the dndc model still deviate greatly from the actual observation they are not displayed again compared with the simulation results of nh3 volatilization in the middle season rice field in the dali irrigated area the average values of r 2 ia nsi and rmse were higher at nanchang station than that at dali station indicating that the simulation result of double cropping rice in the nanchang station was better therefore this model can not only simulate nh3 volatilization from paddy fields in plateau area but also has a good simulation ability on double cropping rice in plain area in all the model is suitable for simulating nh3 volatilization in paddy fields for various climate types and rice cropping systems 4 discussion 4 1 necessity and feasibility of developing a semi empirical semi process model in previous studies modeling the development of nh3 volatilization the process based model was commonly selected li 2000 dubache et al 2019 li et al 2019 this is primarily because slurry and manure were used as fertilizer sources and the nh3 volatilization process of these fertilizers was relatively complicated beuning et al 2008 huang et al 2012 balasubramanian et al 2017 hafner et al 2019 smith et al 2020 the most critical process the mineralization and decomposition of these fertilizers which produces nh4 n is further complicated by the various enzymes and microorganisms playing essential roles in this process xu et al 2020 however urea was rapidly converted into nh4 n after being applied to paddy fields due to soil water and urease and the microbial participation in this process was low and weak fig 6 saggar et al 2013 nh3 volatilization occurred when nh3 molecules escaped after the dynamic balance between nh4 n in the field water was broken liu et al 2020 the nh4 n concentration meteorological factors ph soil moisture and other factors directly accelerated the nh3 volatilization she et al 2018 therefore it is possible to build an empirical model of nh3 volatilization by considering these main influencing factors some factors directly influenced the generation of nh3 volatilization such as soil clay content and soil temperature however their formation was the result of multiple influencing factors and other processes sommer et al 2004 for instance the soil clay content is an inherent property of soil yet soil clay content varied significantly in different growth stages of rice fig 12 the same was true of soil temperature which was affected by rice lai solar radiation irrigation and drainage and these processes need to be considered therefore the simulation of nh3 volatilization in paddy fields should improve the simulation efficiency based on empirical simulation and improve the simulation accuracy based on process based simulation 4 2 factors regulating the observation and simulation of nh3 volatilization 4 2 1 meteorological factors meteorological factors have a crucial effect on nh3 volatilization chen et al 2015 hayashi et al 2008 however the correlation between temperature and nh3 volatilization rate was low r 2 0 21 fig 3a contrary to what was expected the higher the temperature is the faster the nh3 volatilization is further analysis showed that soil or water temperature directly affected nh3 volatilization according to the results obtained by feng and cai 2004 soil and air temperature have a specific relationship but this relationship was not significant in our study fig 13 the air temperature was higher than the soil temperature in the same period and their peak was not synchronous with the peak of soil temperature occurring 4 7 h later than that of air temperature fig 13 in addition the soil temperature rose more slowly and did not change significantly as air temperature did during the whole day or even throughout the entire rice growth stage similar to the temperature it is generally believed that the higher the wind speed the more easily the nh3 molecules can escape from the soil or water surface and thus the greater the nh3 volatilization rate hayashi et al 2008 however a normal distribution relationship occurred between wind speed and nh3 volatilization rate fig 3b when the wind speed exceeded 1 3 m s 1 the nh3 volatilization rate decreased with increasing wind speed which was similar to gyldenkærne et al 2005 this is likely due to two phenomena firstly plant growth blocks the wind transmission and there will be different degrees of loss when the wind blows to the ground secondly high wind speed will reduce soil surface temperature and negatively affect nh3 volatilization sommer et al 2004 compared with air temperature and wind speed the influence of rainfall on nh3 volatilization was apparent fig 3c however the effect of rainfall on nh3 volatilization was related to rice canopy and rainfall distribution rice canopy hindered the direct contact between the rain and the field and thus changed the nh3 volatilization process under the same amount of rainfall nh3 volatilization differed under different rainfall distributions and weather changes during a day in conclusion the impact of meteorological factors on nh3 volatilization is not completely clear and requires further research and discussion and their interactions should be considered 4 2 2 irrigation modes and urea application regimes the effect of irrigation modes on nh3 volatilization in paddy fields had not been determined xu et al 2015 pan et al 2016 han et al 2021 irrigation had significant effects on the physical and chemical properties enzyme activities microbial community structure and quantity of paddy soil lu et al 2020 xie et al 2021 and regulated the microclimate and microenvironment in paddy fields akhtar et al 2019 wu et al 2020 these factors affected the process of nh3 volatilization and were difficult to predict the most direct effect of irrigation was to reduce the field soil temperature dilute the nh4 n concentration of field water reduce the ph of field water accelerate the nh4 n leaching and inhibit nh3 volatilization simultaneously the nh4 n absorbed or mineralized by the soil would also migrate and diffuse to the field surface water with the immersion of water under awd sommer et al 2004 in addition most irrigation water sources are currently polluted and the nh4 n concentration sometimes exceeds the field water presently irrigation increases the nh4 n concentration of field water resulting in increased nh3 volatilization after irrigation han et al 2021 we found that irrigation will cause immediate changes in parameters such as f scl f swc f ph and f n in the model and the nh3 volatilization process under awd is much more complex than under fi even for a simulation step of one day the parameter change under awd is more drastic than that of fi for this reason the model performance under awd was slightly worse than that of fi table 2 therefore it is necessary to strengthen the observation of the nh3 volatilization process and the changes in the rice field microenvironment caused by irrigation to improve the performance of the nh3 volatilization model under awd although urea is an organic fertilizer its hydrolysis process is similar to that of chemical fertilizers such as ammonium bicarbonate abc urea hydrolyzes rapidly after being applied to paddy fields the greater the amount of single fertilization the higher the nh4 n concentration thus the smaller the proportion of nh4 n loss the easier it is to simulate its peak and trend and the higher the simulation accuracy this relationship was also the reason why the model performed better under n2 mode than n1 table 2 although the model was developed and calibrated with 193 kg ha 1 under n2 as the upper limit it could be utilized for a higher nitrogen application rate for several reasons firstly urea was applied to paddy fields in several splits and generally the single urea application amount did not exceed 100 kg ha 1 alivelu et al 2006 secondly during fertilization the field surface water depth was maintained at 30 40 mm han et al 2021 which was enough to dissolve the urea applied at once split similarly under the same nitrogen application rate the model performance under f2 was better than f3 because with fewer nitrogen splits the single urea application rate increases 4 2 3 plant growth and canopy in the simulation of nh3 volatilization the influence of the rice growth process was only reflected in the parameter of the canopy f ca rice growth affected the simulation process in various aspects while it was hard to account for rice growth in the different parameters studies showed that the combination of wsi mode and multiple splits improved rice lai dry matter quality and nitrogen content of rice plants carrijo et al 2017 ata ul karim et al 2017 in addition to absorbing nh4 n from the soil by the root system rice plants especially leaves also absorbed nh3 volatilized from the field during specific growth stages and released nh3 to the outside during other growth stages yang et al 2019 2020 the absorption or release of nh3 by rice leaves would also affect the simulation accuracy of nh3 volatilization rice leaves always absorbed nh3 from the air during the returning green stage tillering stage and heading flowering stage and released nh3 outward at the jointing booting stage and yellow ripening stage yang et al 2020 therefore if we only consider that the rice canopy hinders the circulation of wind in the paddy field blocks the solar radiation reaching the field surface and lowers the field surface temperature eq 19 can be used to summarize the effect of rice canopy on nh3 volatilization from rice field surface otherwise the absorption of nh3 by rice canopy needs to be further evaluated fortunately nh3 flux in the canopy was low during the whole growth stage of rice and contributed little to nh3 emission above the canopy yang et al 2020 4 2 4 observation methods of nh3 volatilization there are many field observation methods for measuring nh3 volatilization yang et al 2019 sun et al 2019 xu et al 2012 chen et al 2015 mariano et al 2019 hayashi et al 2011 liu et al 2020 the applicability of observation methods and observation accuracy was the basis of model construction selecting the most advanced observation equipment and the most accurate observation method may not be the optimal solution for instance using the wind tunnel method observed values close to the nh3 volatilization in the natural state but the equipment is more expensive the micrometeorology method directly samples and determines from the air above the test area with high accuracy still it requires a large test area and the surrounding fields can not apply nitrogen fertilizer during the model developed in this study the nh3 volatilization test results were primarily based on the ventilation method this method has been verified to have high accuracy up to 99 yang et al 2019 and the operation is simple and easy the nh3 volatilization results observed by other methods may have some deviation if eq 20 is used for simulation to better utilize this model the correction between different observation methods needs to be further studied 4 3 countermeasures to reduce nh3 volatilization based on model development based on the nh3 volatilization modeling process specific measures can be obtained to reduce nh3 volatilization in paddy fields meteorological changes are random and unincorporated making it difficult to achieve effective countermeasures there is no conclusion on the impact of irrigation mode on nh3 volatilization although awd mode can improve the nitrogen use efficiency of rice this study showed no relationship between nitrogen use efficiency and nh3 volatilization chen et al 2020 additionally irrigation can reduce the nh4 n concentration and ph of field water nevertheless nh3 volatilization lasts longer with lower nh4 n concentrations and a lower ph in the field water which may not ultimately reduce the nh3 volatilization load sommer et al 2004 the ph and nh4 n concentration significantly impact nh3 volatilization han et al 2021 liu et al 2020 she et al 2018 fertilization will lead to a sharp increase in the ph of field water even if urea is applied to the soil during the base fertilizer period lowering the ph of field water after fertilization can be achieved by reducing the amount of single fertilization but this does not cure the root cause of the problem because the total nh3 volatilization load will not be reduced much another option is to apply additives to lower ph but additives may threaten farmers safety and increase costs nonurea fertilizer has proven effective in minimizing the nh4 n concentration in field water and lowering the ph du preez and burger 1988 studies showed that the typical pattern of accumulated nh3 volatilization from fertilizers would generally show nh3 emission rates in the following order abc urea diammonium phosphate ammonia sulfate calcium ammonia nitrate monoamine phosphate due to the alkaline properties of the fertilizers and interaction of precipitation and anions sommer et al 2004 ammonium based products and other nonurea based fertilizers such as sulfate and triple superphosphate may contribute to soil acidification reducing nh3 volatilization akhtar and naeem 2012 du preez and burger 1988 urea is a commonly used fertilizer due to its high n content cost effective and easy transportation so urea should be applied with appropriate measures or mixed with ammonium fertilizer at a lower interest rate to minimize nh3 volatilization pan et al 2016 in addition the strategies of adding urease inhibitors slow and controlled release fertilizer nitrification inhibitors and biochar have become more respectable mariano et al 2019 liu et al 2020 additives may affect the nh3 loss in fertilizer but their efficiency may vary for example transporting urea to the soil depends on rainwater in addition additives that inhibit urea hydrolysis are expensive sommer et al 2004 in conclusion splitting the urea application delaying the first urea application and using nitrogen fertilizers that are less prone to volatilization are fundamental way to reduce nh3 volatilization to effectively alleviate nh3 volatilization in rice varieties with high nitrogen use efficiency future breeding should focus on improving nitrogen uptake capacity increasing canopy structure at tillering stage and early panicle stage and preventing premature senescence of rice plants to maintain high yield chen et al 2020 4 4 analysis of model error sources it is found that the new model is competent to simulate nh3 volatilization in paddy fields with urea application through performance evaluation and statistical analysis and the evaluation index value can reach more than 95 in some situations for simulation scenarios with lower index values errors may come from the following aspects 1 some important data are missing or unmeasured as is known to all soil temperature has a great influence on nh3 volatilization though it can be roughly predicted from air temperature feng and cai 2004 soil temperature is actually easily changed due to the influence of water and fertilizer system field management crop varieties etc and soil temperature at different depths will also be different so a single temperature value may not meet the needs of simulation 2 data sources of long series years are inconsistent in addition to parameters of rice variety and planting density with relatively little influence differences in the accuracy of field data acquisition have a great impact on the simulation some use hour scale some use day scale and some use ten days scale the observation of nh3 volatilization is similar and the critical moment of nh3 volatilizations is not observed enough this is probably the reason for the difference between the simulated and the measured peak value of nh3 volatilization 3 the selected parameters are related to each other there is a certain correlation between temperature and rainfall wind speed irrigation rice growth it will be very complicated to thoroughly understand the relationship between these factors only through simulation can we determine their respective effects on nh3 volatilization 4 some parameters are difficult to observe and are not taken into account the process of organic nitrogen mineralization to provide nh4 n to rice fields can also be simulated but there are many complex factors affecting organic nitrogen mineralization lu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 xie et al 2021 and organic nitrogen mineralization and nh4 n fixation are a continuous and dynamic process of mutual transformation which were not considered in this study 5 conclusion the structure of the model presented here along with the method of predicting how variables affect the nh3 volatilization process helps to build a model that can closely match the observed nh3 volatilization process at the daily scale the application of this model indicated that this semi empirical semi process approach was useful the semi empirical semi process model development presented herein provided a reasonable prediction for nh3 volatilization in paddy fields in the process of model development the advantages of empirical models and process based models were used as a reference which showed the prospect of this flexible method this method also highlighted the challenges faced by different researchers in predicting nh3 volatilization over a wide range of climatic regions cropping systems and observation methods additional field trials are needed to confirm whether differences in model performance at different test stations are due to observational biases or the defects of the model s structure all in all the semi empirical semi process model is a valuable tool to assist in the development of nh3 volatilization inventories with a high spatial and temporal resolution and in upscaling volatilization from the station to the regional scale the

9346,both empirical models and process based models of ammonia nh3 volatilization simulation in paddy field have some disadvantages this work describes a semi empirical semi process model which combines the simplicity of empirical models with the precision of process based models and its combinatorial structure is sufficient for reproducing the characteristic course of nh3 volatilization in paddy fields under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes over time a dataset consisting of seven rice seasons across three locations was used for model development performance indexes showed the model is good r 2 values ranged from 0 67 to 0 94 the influence of air temperature and wind speed on nh3 volatilization was not as great as our conventional understanding and soil temperature was a more accurate indicator than air temperature for model development model performance was better where the less urea splits and the higher urea rate but there was no significant difference between alternate wetting and drying awd irrigation mode average values of r 2 ia nsi and rmse were 0 82 0 94 0 96 and 0 53 kg ha 1 d 1 and flooding irrigation fi mode average values of r 2 ia nsi and rmse were 0 86 0 94 0 96 and 0 58 kg ha 1 d 1 the ammonium nitrogen nh4 n concentration and ph of surface water and soil water in paddy fields had the greatest impact on nh3 volatilization and they were mainly related to the amount of urea applied splitting the urea application and delaying the first urea application are the fundamental countermeasures to reduce nh3 volatilization the magnitude of developed model performance varied among rice cropping systems irrigation modes urea application regimes and climatic regions highlighting the need to understand why measured nh3 volatilization varies among locations the new model may be a useful tool for predicting fertilizer efficiency of paddy fields applied urea assessing nh3 volatilization factors and reducing emission keywords water saving irrigation ammonia flux non point sources pollution model development south china data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction rice cultivation accounts for approximately 21 25 of the global nitrogen fertilizer use chauhan et al 2017 it has been widely recognized that nh3 volatilization is one of the main avenues of nitrogen loss from paddy fields soares et al 2012 xu et al 2017a accounting for 15 60 of the applied nitrogen loss xue et al 2014 nh3 volatilization mainly contributes to low nitrogen use efficiency and nh3 is a significant factor influencing the formation of delicate particulate matter pm2 5 stokstad 2014 with the latter affecting the global climate as it alters the earth s radiation budget hauglustaine et al 2014 nh3 in the air can be converted into n2o under certain circumstances intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2006 in addition discharged nh3 also returns to land and surface water through sedimentation leading to soil acidification eutrophication and biodiversity loss hellsten et al 2008 guo et al 2010 fields observation of nh3 volatilization can be time consuming laborious and can be easily disturbed dubache et al 2019 in recent years various nh3 volatilization prediction models have been developed including process based models petersen et al 2014 congreves et al 2016 jiang et al 2019 and empirical models misselbrook et al 2005 gyldenkærne et al 2005 process based models are more likely to be accurate under new conditions and predicting complex responses cuddington et al 2013 while empirical models generally have fewer parameters require fewer input variables and are simpler and easier to use both empirical and process based models contain significant empirical components hafner et al 2019 for example the dndc model has been widely applied as a process based model to simulate nh3 volatilization chen et al 2016 dutta et al 2016 balasubramanian et al 2017 giltrap et al 2017 however it performs poorly gilhespy et al 2014 and includes a simplistic equation for determining slurry ph based on measurements from a single study li et al 2019 congreves et al 2016 furthermore the dndc model is written in c and is not an open source model meaning its code is challenging to rewrite to optimize the simulation process even if its simulation results for nh3 volatilization were inaccurate yang et al 2012 li et al 2019 dubache et al 2019 other process based models such as manner alfam daycent century daisy and volt air also have empirical components nicholson et al 2013 søgaard et al 2002 schils et al 2007 del grosso et al 2002 urea is the most commonly used nitrogen fertilizer in paddy fields scherger et al 2022 especially in developing countries ifa 2017 urea has a fast hydrolysis rate in paddy fields and the nh4 n concentration in field water reached its peak on the first or second day after urea was applied han et al 2021 when urea is applied the nh3 volatilization is mainly affected by the fertilizer application rate fertilization methods water management practices climate conditions and soil properties dattamudi et al 2016 misselbrook et al 2004 xu et al 2017a b louro et al 2013 webb et al 2006 thus many empirical models of nh3 volatilization are based on these influencing factors petersen et al 2014 shan et al 2015 these models can estimate the nh3 volatilization load to some extent but they cannot describe the nh3 volatilization process deeply or accurately enough because of a shortage of water resources water saving irrigation wsi modes are widely used in paddy fields and they have an important influence on nh3 volatilization lahue et al 2016 xu et al 2017b under the wsi modes the soil in paddy fields alternates between drying and wetting frequently affecting the physical and chemical properties of the soil which in turn affects the nh3 volatilization process ishfaq et al 2020 most researchers have focused on simulating nh3 volatilization under fi mode while few have paid attention to that under wsi in view of the process based models require a large number of input parameters and are difficult to optimize the simulation process and the empirical models are not deep and accurate enough with the soil moisture dynamic changes under different irrigation modes therefore combining process based models with the empirical models to obtain a concise and efficient semi empirical semi process model of nh3 volatilization for paddy fields is necessary in order to be useful for both research and management parameter estimates should include the effects of common types of irrigation modes and urea application regimes along with major environmental effects however the model should require only the values of a small number of predictor variables for use our objective was to develop a model for nh3 volatilization from paddy fields with urea applied that strikes a balance between the simplicity of empirical models and the more accurate representation of processes achieved with a process based approach 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection to calibrate and evaluate the nh3 volatilization prediction model after urea application we utilized a dataset consisting of four separate experimental trials obtained by our team collectively including seven rice seasons between 1999 and 2017 across three locations fig 1 table 1 the experimental observation methods were either ventilation or micrometeorological with meteorological data recorded daily for a full description of materials and methods for each trial see cui et al 2004 li et al 2009 yu et al 2015 and han et al 2021 cui et al 2004 observed nh3 volatilization after surface application of urea with awd mode and fi mode during the 2001 and 2002 middle season rice seasons at the hubei central station of irrigation experiment tuanlin china hereafter referred to as the tuanlin station table 1 li et al 2009 also observed nh3 volatilization from the lysimeters in the tuanlin station their experiment was carried out during the 1999 and 2003 middle season rice seasons and awd and fi modes were used table 1 yu et al 2015 observed and analyzed the variation of nh3 volatilization in paddy fields under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes using ventilation method during the 2013 late rice season and the 2014 early rice season in jiangxi central station of irrigation experiment nanchang china hereafter referred to as the nanchang station table 1 han et al 2021 studied nh3 volatilization during the 2016 and 2017 middle season rice seasons in the dali observation and experiment station of china national agricultural environment hereafter referred to as the dali station an overview of this station can be found in han et al 2019 finally we utilized the dataset collected by chen et al 2015 which consisted of nh3 volatilization from paddy fields with urea applied in eryuan county hereafter referred to as the eryuan site a site about 35 km away from the dali station fig 1 the meteorological data were extracted from the openly accessible online database of china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn 2 2 model description our philosophy in designing this semi empirical semi process model has been to minimize complexity we first determine the factors affecting nh3 volatilization in paddy fields with urea applied if it is confirmed that a certain factor has an effect on nh3 volatilization but the influencing process is not clear we only rely on empirical expressions to determine for example if we have a good observation and understanding of nh4 n concentration change in soil water but do not understand the nitrification adsorption and exchange process of nh4 ion in soil as well as the escape and absorption process of nh3 molecules at the water air interface we will not further investigate these processes to improve the simulation accuracy of nh4 n concentration change and then maximize the simulation accuracy of nh3 volatilization increasing the complexity of some components of an nh3 volatilization model will not lead to more accurate predictions as long as important processes are not quantitatively understood and in some cases implementation of an incomplete process level understanding may result in a model less accurate than one that is more empirical because of inflexibility hafner et al 2019 compared with manure or organic manure the nh3 volatilization process in paddy fields with urea applied is relatively simple therefore on the basis of empirical model construction method nh3 volatilization process analysis is added to the change of soil physical and chemical properties in irrigation modes which is the simple and efficient basis for semi empirical semi process model construction in this regard as the semi empirical semi process model eq 1 was given to determine the nh3 volatilization from paddy fields under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes 1 f a f ca f scl f swc f r f t f w f ph f n where a is the comprehensive nh3 volatilization constant kg ha 1 d 1 f is

can be classified into four categories meteorological data irrigation modes and urea application regimes data soil data and rice canopy characteristics fig 2 2 3 model development 2 3 1 brief description modeling nh3 volatilization following urea dutta et al 2016 dubache et al 2019 swine slurry congreves et al 2016 synthetic fertilizers li et al 2019 application to farmlands by revising dndc model li et al 2016 have been conducted in addition to these processes directly adapted from revising dndc model four categories of simulation parameters in section 2 2 meteorological data irrigation modes and urea application regimes soil physicochemical properties and rice canopy parameters were simulated in the present study based on test data to achieve a semi empirical semi process model with the advantages of concision and high efficiency the four parameters fitting are detailed in the following subsections 2 3 2 parameters fitting for meteorological data meteorological condition is a key factor in regulating the processes related to nh3 volatilization the relationship between air temperature and nh3 volatilization is generally exponential fig 3a nh3 volatilization mainly occurs when the temperature is above 20 c nh3 volatilization increases with temperature increases however this trend is not significant r 2 0 21 p 0 12 the relationship between wind speed and nh3 volatilization follows a normal distribution fig 3b with increasing wind speed nh3 volatilization increases rapidly first and then decreases peaking when the wind speed is 1 3 m s 1 r 2 0 30 p 0 01 the relationship between rainfall and nh3 volatilization is logist fig 3c when rainfall occurs nh3 volatilization is reduced in bluff mode r 2 0 92 p 0 01 and when rainfall is over 5 mm nh3 volatilization is almost 0 according to the fitting results fig 3 f t f w and f r are expressed by eqs 2 4 2 f t e 5 4 t 24 2 0 13 3 f w e 5 w 1 3 2 0 06 4 f r 1 1 2 3 r 3 2 3 3 parameters fitting for irrigation modes and urea application regimes 2 3 3 1 when there was a water layer present in the field fig 4 shows no relationship between the water layer and the nh3 volatilization rate r 2 0 01 p 0 01 eq 5 which is consistent with the results from hayashi et al 2008 the clay content has little effect on nh3 volatilization and can be neglected eq 6 research has shown that the nh4 n concentration in the surface water dominates nh3 volatilization from a rice paddy hayashi et al 2008 xu et al 2012 lian et al 2018 and this is confirmed in fig 5 the nh3 volatilization rate has a significant linear relationship with the nh4 n concentration p 0 01 with an increase in nh4 n concentration the nh3 volatilization rate also increases eq 7 5 f swc 1 6 f scl 1 7 f n 0 01 nh 4 i 1 where nh 4 i is the nh4 n concentration in the field water nh 4 max and nh 4 min are the maximum and minimum nh4 n concentration in the field water during the rice growth period and their units are mg l 1 the change of nh4 n concentration of surface water conforms to first order kinetics fig 6 in addition the nitrogen brought by rainfall and irrigation is considered and the nh 4 i can be calculated by eq 8 others such as nitrification and denitrification fulazzaky et al 2015 plant uptake ata ul karim et al 2017 and nh4 n fixation lu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 xie et al 2021 are not considered again because the reduction or increase of nh4 n concentration caused by these effects are reflected in eq 8 and the exponential decay function in eq 8 is the embodiment of the overall decrease of nh4 n concentration 8 nh 4 i 0

nh3 volatilization are negatively correlated eq 9 this relationship was determined using obtained from 22 soils in china duan and xiao 2000 9 f scl e 0 06 scl the flow of nh4 n from the soil aqueous solution into the air is affected by the depth of the soil layer f swc which is determined by eqs 10 13 li et al 2016 these were derived by lee 2005 as the best function for estimating this soil

22 ph 6 87 2 0 035 2 3 5 parameters fitting for rice canopy change leaf area index lai is the embodiment of rice canopy fig 8 the fitting relationship between lai and nh3 volatilization can be regarded as the effect of rice canopy on nh3 volatilization paddy field surface was mainly exposed to solar radiation during the returning green stage within 7 days after transplanting and nh3 volatilization was not affected by the rice canopy that is f ca is 1 0 as the rice grows to its maximum lai the canopy began gradually to hinder the circulation of wind in the paddy field blocks the solar radiation reaching the field surface lowers the field surface temperature and then gradually limits the field nh3 volatilization the influence coefficient of the canopy on nh3 volatilization can be determined by eq 19 where t is the number of days for transplanting the rice 19 f ca 1 t 7 0 45 e 0 15 lai 0 55 t 7 as nh3 volatilization in the paddy field is a complicated process eqs 1 19 a

the tuanlin station cui et al 2004 li et al 2009 and the 2016 rice season at the dali station han et al 2021 in section 2 1 we selected these cases for this calibration because they cover a broad range of climates range plain and plateau rice cropping systems double cropping rice middle season rice and field management practices irrigation modes and fertilizer application regimes 20 f 18 f ca

root mean squared error rmse the index of agreement ia and the nash sutcliffe index nsi to evaluate the modeling efficiency between the observations o and simulations s nash and sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 the closer the slope and r 2 are to 1 the better the model performance is with a slope less than 1 indicating an underestimation by the simulation otherwise an overestimation if the r 2 is negative it is remarked as not available nsi represents the prediction accuracy of the model the closer ia and nsi are to 1 the better the model performance is a positive nsi value indicates an acceptable simulation cui et al 2014 haas et al 2013 the error analysis has been one of the most applied tools for defining the best fitting models because it consists of different statistical methods

evaluation at the same time the widely used process based dndc model gilhespy et al 2014 was also used to simulate nh3 volatilization and its simulation performance was evaluated fig 9 illustrates the observed and simulated daily nh3 volatilization rate due to irrigation and urea application in the individual treatments overall the temporal patterns and magnitudes of the daily nh3 volatilization rates simulated by the semi empirical semi process model agreed with the observations the temporal patterns of the daily nh3 volatilization rates simulated by dndc also agreed with the observations however magnitudes simulated by dndc were significantly higher than the simulated values by the semi empirical semi process model and the observed values and almost 2 3 times higher than them this was consistent with the study results of nh3 volatilization from paddy fields simulated by dndc conducted by chen 2018 and gilhespy et al 2014 the daily nh3 volatilization rates simulated by the semi empirical semi process model showed r 2 values for the model ranged from 0 67 to 0 94 0 84 on average the ia values ranged from 0 89 to 0 98 0 94 on average the nsi values ranged from 0 94 to 0 99 0 96 on average and rmse ranged from 0 33 kg ha 1 d 1 to 0 78 kg ha 1 d 1 0 56 kg ha 1 d 1 on average table 2 these results demonstrated that the semi empirical semi process model used based on paddy fields observations from different studies can illustrate the nh3 volatilization from the middle season rice field under different irrigation modes and urea application regimes in terms of irrigation mode the average values of r 2 ia nsi and rmse were 0 82 0 94 0 96 and 0 53 kg ha 1 d 1 under awd and 0 86 0 94 0 96 and 0 58 kg ha 1 d 1 under fi respectively showing little differences in simulating the performance of irrigation modes in terms of nitrogen application rate the average values of r2 ia nsi and rmse were 0 86 0 95 0 97 and 0 575 kg ha 1 d 1 under n2 and 0 82 0 93 0 95 and 0 535 kg ha 1 d 1 under n1 respectively the value of r 2 ia and nsi under n2 were higher than those under n1 the nitrogen application rate of n2 was 43 higher than that of n1 in comparison the rmse of the model under n2 was only 7 5 higher than that under n1 indicating that the model was better for simulating a high nitrogen application rate than a low nitrogen application rate in terms of fertilization splits the average values of r 2 ia nsi and rmse were 0 89 0 95 0 96 0 585 kg ha 1 d 1 under f2 and 0 78 0 93 0 97 0 525 kg ha 1 d 1 under f3 respectively similarly the simulation performance under f2 using this model was slightly better than that under f3 3 2 model performance for middle season rice in the eryuan site compared with the observation results of our team at dali station the observation data at eryuan station was less as it was only observed within 5 7 days after fertilization fig 10 fig 10 also shows that the results of nh3 volatilization simulated by the semi empirical semi process model in the eryuan station are consistent with the observed values while the model s simulation performance using the evaluation indexes of r 2 0 753 is less than that 0 81 in chen et al 2015 they developed an empirical model using urea applied rate temperature and ph of surface water but overall the simulation performance of the semi empirical semi process model is good the model s simulation performance using the evaluation indexes of r 2 ia nsi and rmse were 0 753 0 887 0 962 and 0 60 kg ha 1 d 1 on average respectively table 3 except for the n0 treatment without fertilization the measured value of nh3 volatilization was higher which may be related to the strong soil organic nitrogen mineralization in eryuan 3 3 model performance for double cropping rice in nanchang station we also selected the observation result from the 2013 2014 rice seasons in the nanchang station for model calibration fig 11 this had r 2 ia nsi and rmse values of 0 95 0 99 0 99 and 0 29 kg ha 1 d 1 on average respectively table 4 the results simulated by the dndc model still deviate greatly from the actual observation they are not displayed again compared with the simulation results of nh3 volatilization in the middle season rice field in the dali irrigated area the average values of r 2 ia nsi and rmse were higher at nanchang station than that at dali station indicating that the simulation result of double cropping rice in the nanchang station was better therefore this model can not only simulate nh3 volatilization from paddy fields in plateau area but also has a good simulation ability on double cropping rice in plain area in all the model is suitable for simulating nh3 volatilization in paddy fields for various climate types and rice cropping systems 4 discussion 4 1 necessity and feasibility of developing a semi empirical semi process model in previous studies modeling the development of nh3 volatilization the process based model was commonly selected li 2000 dubache et al 2019 li et al 2019 this is primarily because slurry and manure were used as fertilizer sources and the nh3 volatilization process of these fertilizers was relatively complicated beuning et al 2008 huang et al 2012 balasubramanian et al 2017 hafner et al 2019 smith et al 2020 the most critical process the mineralization and decomposition of these fertilizers which produces nh4 n is further complicated by the various enzymes and microorganisms playing essential roles in this process xu et al 2020 however urea was rapidly converted into nh4 n after being applied to paddy fields due to soil water and urease and the microbial participation in this process was low and weak fig 6 saggar et al 2013 nh3 volatilization occurred when nh3 molecules escaped after the dynamic balance between nh4 n in the field water was broken liu et al 2020 the nh4 n concentration meteorological factors ph soil moisture and other factors directly accelerated the nh3 volatilization she et al 2018 therefore it is possible to build an empirical model of nh3 volatilization by considering these main influencing factors some factors directly influenced the generation of nh3 volatilization such as soil clay content and soil temperature however their formation was the result of multiple influencing factors and other processes sommer et al 2004 for instance the soil clay content is an inherent property of soil yet soil clay content varied significantly in different growth stages of rice fig 12 the same was true of soil temperature which was affected by rice lai solar radiation irrigation and drainage and these processes need to be considered therefore the simulation of nh3 volatilization in paddy fields should improve the simulation efficiency based on empirical simulation and improve the simulation accuracy based on process based simulation 4 2 factors regulating the observation and simulation of nh3 volatilization 4 2 1 meteorological factors meteorological factors have a crucial effect on nh3 volatilization chen et al 2015 hayashi et al 2008 however the correlation between temperature and nh3 volatilization rate was low r 2 0 21 fig 3a contrary to what was expected the higher the temperature is the faster the nh3 volatilization is further analysis showed that soil or water temperature directly affected nh3 volatilization according to the results obtained by feng and cai 2004 soil and air temperature have a specific relationship but this relationship was not significant in our study fig 13 the air temperature was higher than the soil temperature in the same period and their peak was not synchronous with the peak of soil temperature occurring 4 7 h later than that of air temperature fig 13 in addition the soil temperature rose more slowly and did not change significantly as air temperature did during the whole day or even throughout the entire rice growth stage similar to the temperature it is generally believed that the higher the wind speed the more easily the nh3 molecules can escape from the soil or water surface and thus the greater the nh3 volatilization rate hayashi et al 2008 however a normal distribution relationship occurred between wind speed and nh3 volatilization rate fig 3b when the wind speed exceeded 1 3 m s 1 the nh3 volatilization rate decreased with increasing wind speed which was similar to gyldenkærne et al 2005 this is likely due to two phenomena firstly plant growth blocks the wind transmission and there will be different degrees of loss when the wind blows to the ground secondly high wind speed will reduce soil surface temperature and negatively affect nh3 volatilization sommer et al 2004 compared with air temperature and wind speed the influence of rainfall on nh3 volatilization was apparent fig 3c however the effect of rainfall on nh3 volatilization was related to rice canopy and rainfall distribution rice canopy hindered the direct contact between the rain and the field and thus changed the nh3 volatilization process under the same amount of rainfall nh3 volatilization differed under different rainfall distributions and weather changes during a day in conclusion the impact of meteorological factors on nh3 volatilization is not completely clear and requires further research and discussion and their interactions should be considered 4 2 2 irrigation modes and urea application regimes the effect of irrigation modes on nh3 volatilization in paddy fields had not been determined xu et al 2015 pan et al 2016 han et al 2021 irrigation had significant effects on the physical and chemical properties enzyme activities microbial community structure and quantity of paddy soil lu et al 2020 xie et al 2021 and regulated the microclimate and microenvironment in paddy fields akhtar et al 2019 wu et al 2020 these factors affected the process of nh3 volatilization and were difficult to predict the most direct effect of irrigation was to reduce the field soil temperature dilute the nh4 n concentration of field water reduce the ph of field water accelerate the nh4 n leaching and inhibit nh3 volatilization simultaneously the nh4 n absorbed or mineralized by the soil would also migrate and diffuse to the field surface water with the immersion of water under awd sommer et al 2004 in addition most irrigation water sources are currently polluted and the nh4 n concentration sometimes exceeds the field water presently irrigation increases the nh4 n concentration of field water resulting in increased nh3 volatilization after irrigation han et al 2021 we found that irrigation will cause immediate changes in parameters such as f scl f swc f ph and f n in the model and the nh3 volatilization process under awd is much more complex than under fi even for a simulation step of one day the parameter change under awd is more drastic than that of fi for this reason the model performance under awd was slightly worse than that of fi table 2 therefore it is necessary to strengthen the observation of the nh3 volatilization process and the changes in the rice field microenvironment caused by irrigation to improve the performance of the nh3 volatilization model under awd although urea is an organic fertilizer its hydrolysis process is similar to that of chemical fertilizers such as ammonium bicarbonate abc urea hydrolyzes rapidly after being applied to paddy fields the greater the amount of single fertilization the higher the nh4 n concentration thus the smaller the proportion of nh4 n loss the easier it is to simulate its peak and trend and the higher the simulation accuracy this relationship was also the reason why the model performed better under n2 mode than n1 table 2 although the model was developed and calibrated with 193 kg ha 1 under n2 as the upper limit it could be utilized for a higher nitrogen application rate for several reasons firstly urea was applied to paddy fields in several splits and generally the single urea application amount did not exceed 100 kg ha 1 alivelu et al 2006 secondly during fertilization the field surface water depth was maintained at 30 40 mm han et al 2021 which was enough to dissolve the urea applied at once split similarly under the same nitrogen application rate the model performance under f2 was better than f3 because with fewer nitrogen splits the single urea application rate increases 4 2 3 plant growth and canopy in the simulation of nh3 volatilization the influence of the rice growth process was only reflected in the parameter of the canopy f ca rice growth affected the simulation process in various aspects while it was hard to account for rice growth in the different parameters studies showed that the combination of wsi mode and multiple splits improved rice lai dry matter quality and nitrogen content of rice plants carrijo et al 2017 ata ul karim et al 2017 in addition to absorbing nh4 n from the soil by the root system rice plants especially leaves also absorbed nh3 volatilized from the field during specific growth stages and released nh3 to the outside during other growth stages yang et al 2019 2020 the absorption or release of nh3 by rice leaves would also affect the simulation accuracy of nh3 volatilization rice leaves always absorbed nh3 from the air during the returning green stage tillering stage and heading flowering stage and released nh3 outward at the jointing booting stage and yellow ripening stage yang et al 2020 therefore if we only consider that the rice canopy hinders the circulation of wind in the paddy field blocks the solar radiation reaching the field surface and lowers the field surface temperature eq 19 can be used to summarize the effect of rice canopy on nh3 volatilization from rice field surface otherwise the absorption of nh3 by rice canopy needs to be further evaluated fortunately nh3 flux in the canopy was low during the whole growth stage of rice and contributed little to nh3 emission above the canopy yang et al 2020 4 2 4 observation methods of nh3 volatilization there are many field observation methods for measuring nh3 volatilization yang et al 2019 sun et al 2019 xu et al 2012 chen et al 2015 mariano et al 2019 hayashi et al 2011 liu et al 2020 the applicability of observation methods and observation accuracy was the basis of model construction selecting the most advanced observation equipment and the most accurate observation method may not be the optimal solution for instance using the wind tunnel method observed values close to the nh3 volatilization in the natural state but the equipment is more expensive the micrometeorology method directly samples and determines from the air above the test area with high accuracy still it requires a large test area and the surrounding fields can not apply nitrogen fertilizer during the model developed in this study the nh3 volatilization test results were primarily based on the ventilation method this method has been verified to have high accuracy up to 99 yang et al 2019 and the operation is simple and easy the nh3 volatilization results observed by other methods may have some deviation if eq 20 is used for simulation to better utilize this model the correction between different observation methods needs to be further studied 4 3 countermeasures to reduce nh3 volatilization based on model development based on the nh3 volatilization modeling process specific measures can be obtained to reduce nh3 volatilization in paddy fields meteorological changes are random and unincorporated making it difficult to achieve effective countermeasures there is no conclusion on the impact of irrigation mode on nh3 volatilization although awd mode can improve the nitrogen use efficiency of rice this study showed no relationship between nitrogen use efficiency and nh3 volatilization chen et al 2020 additionally irrigation can reduce the nh4 n concentration and ph of field water nevertheless nh3 volatilization lasts longer with lower nh4 n concentrations and a lower ph in the field water which may not ultimately reduce the nh3 volatilization load sommer et al 2004 the ph and nh4 n concentration significantly impact nh3 volatilization han et al 2021 liu et al 2020 she et al 2018 fertilization will lead to a sharp increase in the ph of field water even if urea is applied to the soil during the base fertilizer period lowering the ph of field water after fertilization can be achieved by reducing the amount of single fertilization but this does not cure the root cause of the problem because the total nh3 volatilization load will not be reduced much another option is to apply additives to lower ph but additives may threaten farmers safety and increase costs nonurea fertilizer has proven effective in minimizing the nh4 n concentration in field water and lowering the ph du preez and burger 1988 studies showed that the typical pattern of accumulated nh3 volatilization from fertilizers would generally show nh3 emission rates in the following order abc urea diammonium phosphate ammonia sulfate calcium ammonia nitrate monoamine phosphate due to the alkaline properties of the fertilizers and interaction of precipitation and anions sommer et al 2004 ammonium based products and other nonurea based fertilizers such as sulfate and triple superphosphate may contribute to soil acidification reducing nh3 volatilization akhtar and naeem 2012 du preez and burger 1988 urea is a commonly used fertilizer due to its high n content cost effective and easy transportation so urea should be applied with appropriate measures or mixed with ammonium fertilizer at a lower interest rate to minimize nh3 volatilization pan et al 2016 in addition the strategies of adding urease inhibitors slow and controlled release fertilizer nitrification inhibitors and biochar have become more respectable mariano et al 2019 liu et al 2020 additives may affect the nh3 loss in fertilizer but their efficiency may vary for example transporting urea to the soil depends on rainwater in addition additives that inhibit urea hydrolysis are expensive sommer et al 2004 in conclusion splitting the urea application delaying the first urea application and using nitrogen fertilizers that are less prone to volatilization are fundamental way to reduce nh3 volatilization to effectively alleviate nh3 volatilization in rice varieties with high nitrogen use efficiency future breeding should focus on improving nitrogen uptake capacity increasing canopy structure at tillering stage and early panicle stage and preventing premature senescence of rice plants to maintain high yield chen et al 2020 4 4 analysis of model error sources it is found that the new model is competent to simulate nh3 volatilization in paddy fields with urea application through performance evaluation and statistical analysis and the evaluation index value can reach more than 95 in some situations for simulation scenarios with lower index values errors may come from the following aspects 1 some important data are missing or unmeasured as is known to all soil temperature has a great influence on nh3 volatilization though it can be roughly predicted from air temperature feng and cai 2004 soil temperature is actually easily changed due to the influence of water and fertilizer system field management crop varieties etc and soil temperature at different depths will also be different so a single temperature value may not meet the needs of simulation 2 data sources of long series years are inconsistent in addition to parameters of rice variety and planting density with relatively little influence differences in the accuracy of field data acquisition have a great impact on the simulation some use hour scale some use day scale and some use ten days scale the observation of nh3 volatilization is similar and the critical moment of nh3 volatilizations is not observed enough this is probably the reason for the difference between the simulated and the measured peak value of nh3 volatilization 3 the selected parameters are related to each other there is a certain correlation between temperature and rainfall wind speed irrigation rice growth it will be very complicated to thoroughly understand the relationship between these factors only through simulation can we determine their respective effects on nh3 volatilization 4 some parameters are difficult to observe and are not taken into account the process of organic nitrogen mineralization to provide nh4 n to rice fields can also be simulated but there are many complex factors affecting organic nitrogen mineralization lu et al 2020 xu et al 2020 xie et al 2021 and organic nitrogen mineralization and nh4 n fixation are a continuous and dynamic process of mutual transformation which were not considered in this study 5 conclusion the structure of the model presented here along with the method of predicting how variables affect the nh3 volatilization process helps to build a model that can closely match the observed nh3 volatilization process at the daily scale the application of this model indicated that this semi empirical semi process approach was useful the semi empirical semi process model development presented herein provided a reasonable prediction for nh3 volatilization in paddy fields in the process of model development the advantages of empirical models and process based models were used as a reference which showed the prospect of this flexible method this method also highlighted the challenges faced by different researchers in predicting nh3 volatilization over a wide range of climatic regions cropping systems and observation methods additional field trials are needed to confirm whether differences in model performance at different test stations are due to observational biases or the defects of the model s structure all in all the semi empirical semi process model is a valuable tool to assist in the development of nh3 volatilization inventories with a high spatial and temporal resolution and in upscaling volatilization from the station to the regional scale the

9347,at present water shortage has increasingly become one of the key factors restricting the sustainable development of agriculture and during the process of agricultural production the energy consumption has also been paid more and more attention therefore in order to deal with the above problems an improved interval linear multi objective fractional programming model ilmofpm was developed which has the characteristic is that it not only focuses on the optimal allocation of the amount of irrigation water resources but also on improving irrigation water resources use efficiency to demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability ilmofpm was applied to a case study in jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china maximum economic benefit per unit of water resource and minimum energy consumption per unit of water resource were selected as the planning objectives a series of irrigation water resources optimal allocation schemes were obtained which could give the decision makers the desired optimal scheme according to the actual situation based on the results of the established model economic benefit and energy consumption generally decreased as the representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry and the total crop planting area also showed a decreased trend moreover a lot of water resources was saved by introducing crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation in the developed model 57 45 44 17 39 33 of total water resources consumption were saved under different representative hydrological years respectively keywords multi objective fractional programming multiple uncertainties energy consumption water resources 1 introduction water resources are one of the most important natural resources for the sustainable development of society economy and ecology nouri et al 2019 ren et al 2019b zhang et al 2021a 2021b with the rapid development of society and economy and the growth of population the contradiction between the increasing demand for water resources and the limited supply of water resources is becoming more and more serious ren et al 2019a zhang et al 2021d li et al 2022 shao et al 2022 according to the latest report of the world meteorological organization there will be 5 billion people in the world facing water resources shortage by 2050 van vliet et al 2021 in addition the problem of water scarcity has become more severe due to waste in agricultural irrigation for example in northwest china agricultural irrigation water accounts for approximately 90 of the total water resources but the average irrigation water use coefficient is only about 0 5 li et al 2019a 2019b therefore water resources shortage has become one of the key factors restricting regional sustainable development especially in northwest of china in order to deal with the above problems the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources is a potential way in past decades a series of studies have been proposed to optimize irrigation water resources for example an improved ant colony optimization model made maximize net returns as objective was developed to the allocation of crops and water in different irrigation areas nguyen et al 2016 in order to improve water use efficiency sun et al 2017 proposed a single objective interval optimization model which made maximize the benefits of water as objective when facing ecological benefits and water shortage a multi objective fuzzy robust programming was developed to optimize land and water resources in agriculture tan et al 2017 for the purpose of optimizing allocation of irrigation water resources a linear programming model was developed which focused on obtaining the maximum planting benefits under the restriction of irrigation water soentoro et al 2018 an inexact irrigation water allocation optimization model has proven to be an effective approach to deal with the problem of water shortage and climate change which coupled with a statistical downscaling model and an evapotranspiration model wang et al 2019 in order to deal with the problem of the irrigation water optimal allocation in the jinghuiqu irrigation district the method of interval linear programming was adopted by gong et al 2020 for the purpose of optimizing irrigation water resources a simulation optimization framework under fuzzy uncertainty was developed which integrated fuzzy credibility based optimization model with the hurwicz criterion and daily water balance simulation zhang et al 2021a in order to deal with the problem of agricultural water shortage a process based model multi objective and fuzzy theory was integrated into optimization model which aimed at optimal allocation of irrigation water under uncertainties of water diversion and groundwater zhang et al 2021f in general the above studies have done a lot of work in the optimization allocation of irrigation water resources however most of the above studies paid attention to maximize system benefits minimize system cost or balancing multi objective when faced with severe water resources shortage it is not only focus on the rational use of water resources but also to increase the water resources use efficiency therefore in this study a multi objective fractional optimization model was developed which not only can deal with multi objective but also focus on water use efficiency energy consumption is involved in most of the irrigation process such as pumping water transporting water etc li et al 2019a 2020 2019b avila et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c in addition energy consumption is also involved in the growth of crops hua et al 2021 bhunia et al 2021 however few studies taking energy consumption into the study of optimization allocation of water resources ren et al 2021 therefore in this study an optimization model was established which not only takes water resources use efficiency under consideration but also takes energy consumption under consideration in addition due to the complexity of agricultural production the agricultural production involves many independent subsystems which characterized that uncertain factors are generated in their interaction process li et al 2016 ren and zhang 2019 hu et al 2020 yang et al 2022 thus uncertainty should be considered in the optimization allocation of water resources in past decades many studies have paid attention to uncertainty in agricultural production for example li and zhang 2015 proposed an inexact two stage allocation model to deal with uncertain parameters a two stage regional multi water sources allocation model was developed by liu et al 2017 which could deal with multiple uncertainties effectively fu et al 2018 developed an interval two stage stochastic robust programming model to deal with interval and random uncertainties in order to deal with uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets and randomness an integrated multi objective stochastic fuzzy programming was established ren et al 2019a a coupled interval chance constrained quadratic programming for water quality management was developed to address uncertainties arising from inexact and random parameters zhang et al 2021e in addition climate uncertainty was introduced to a three stage robust optimization model which made the model more applicable to reality in a realistic network moreira et al 2021 in this study uncertain factors expressed as interval are involves in the irrigation and energy consumption subsystem therefore in order to solve the above problems the established optimization model incorporates an interval mathematical model therefore based on the above analysis this paper developed an interval linear multi objective fractional programming model which has the characteristic is that it not only focuses on the optimal allocation of the amount of irrigation water resources but also on improving irrigation water resources use efficiency in addition energy consumption is one of the key parts of agricultural production which should not be ignored in the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources the established model was then applied in jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china maximum economic benefit per unit of irrigation water resource and minimize energy consumption per unit of irrigation water resource are made as objectives the established model has the following advantages a it not only focuses on the optimal allocation of the amount of irrigation water resources but also focuses on improving irrigation water resources use efficiency b it has the ability to deal with multi objective problems c it takes energy consumption into consideration d it can effectively deal with uncertainties expressed as interval in the irrigation and energy consumption subsystems e it incorporates crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation into the optimization model f a series of irrigation water resources optimization schemes crop planting structure schemes and energy consumption schemes were provided under different representative hydrological years 2 model formulation 2 1 interval linear programming in reality in the process of optimizing irrigation water resources the exact value of some parameters cannot be determined and they have the characteristics of uncertainty which is represented as interval form therefore in order to deal with the above problems the linear interval programming proposed by huang et al 1993 was adopted which has the ability to deal with interval uncertainty both in objectives and constraints the interval linear programming is as follows 2 1 min f c x a x b x 0 where f is the objection function a r m n b r m 1 c r 1 n x r n 1 r denotes a set of interval numbers a denotes the matrix where a a a a r m n a i j a i j a i j b c and x denote the vector and the model 2 1 can be transformed into two sub models based on the adopted interval linear programming the two sub models are as follows lower bound sub model 2 2 min f j i k 1 c j x j j k 1 1 n c j x j j i k 1 a i j s i g n a i j x j j k 1 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i i x j 0 j 1 2 n where f is the objective function f o p t is optimal value of objective function a i j a i j are the lower and upper bounds of a i j respectively a i j is an element in the column of matrix a other parameters are expressed in the same way c j is the jth element of vector c x j is the jth element of vector x sign is a sign function among the uncertain coefficients of the objective function the number of positive numbers is k 1 and the number of negative numbers is k 2 let the first k 1 coefficients be positive that is c j 0 j k 1 1 k 1 2 n where k 1 k 2 n in order to make the calculation convenient the upper and lower limit signs of c j were assumed to be consistent by solving the lower bound sub model f o p t x j o p t j 1 2 k 1 and x j o p t j k 1 1 k 1 2 n can be obtained upper bound sub model 2 3 min f j i k 1 c j x j j k 1 1 n c j x j j i k 1 a i j s i g n a i j x j j k 1 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i i x j x j o p t j k 1 1 k 1 2 n x j 0 j 1 2 n where f is the objective function f o p t is optimal value of objective function other parameters are the same as the lower bound sub model by solving the upper bound sub model f o p t x j o p t j 1 2 k 1 and x j o p t j k 1 1 k 1 2 n can be obtained therefore x j o p t x j o p t x j o p t j and f j o p t f j o p t f j o p t can be obtained 2 2 multi objective fractional programming multi objective fractional programming is an optimization model with two or more objective functions which has the advantages is that it can deal with multi objective problems while focusing on the maximum input output ratio yuan and xiao 2016 the general multi objective fractional programming form is as following 2 4 f i x c i x d i x c i x α i d i x β i i 1 2 k a x b x 0 where a r m n b r n x r n c i d i r n α i β i r a denotes the m n matrix x and b are n dimensional and m dimensional column vectors respectively c and d are n dimensional row vectors α and β are parameters and d i x β i 0 i 1 2 k assume that the upper and lower bounds of feasible region of each fractional objective are f i u and f i l i 1 2 k respectively and then the maximum and minimum values of the numerator and denominator in the feasible region for each fractional objective can be calculated which can be recorded as 2 5 yuan and xiao 2016 and it can be expressed as follows 2 5 c i c i x c i d i d i x d i i 1 2 k and then f i u and f i l i 1 2 k can be also expressed as follows 2 6 f i u max c i d i c i d i c i d i c i d i f i l min c i d i c i d i c i d i c i d i in addition the fuzzy objective of fuzzy multi objective linear fractional programming can be expressed by the membership functions dutta et al 1993 and the membership functions for maximization and minimization are as follows 2 7 μ i x 1 f i x f i u f i x f i l f i u f i l f i l f i x f i u 0 f i x f i l i 1 2 k 2 8 μ i x 1 f i x f i l f i u f i x f i u f i l f i l f i x f i u 0 f i x f i u i 1 2 k furthermore the multi objective linear programming problem is equivalent to the fuzzy objective programming problem mohamed 1997 therefore the model 2 4 can be transformed as follows 2 9 min z i 1 k ω i d i μ i x d i d i 1 i 1 2 k a x b x 0 where ω i represents the weight coefficient which can be defined as ω i 1 f i u f i l i 1 2 k μ i x is the membership function d i and d i represent different scaling values moreover in order to solve the above model more easily the membership function μ i x in the model 2 9 can be represented by a first order taylor series assume that x i 0 x i 1 0 x i 2 0 x i k 0 t i 1 2 k is the maximum optimal solution of a single objective function of model 2 4 therefore the first order taylor series of μ i x can be expressed as follows 2 10 μ i x μ i x i 0 i 1 k μ i x i 0 x j x j x i j 0 i 1 2 k where x j is the jth element of variable x x i j 0 is the jth element of variable x i 0 therefore the original model can be transformed into a linear goal programming model by introducing model 2 10 into 2 9 which is as follows 2 11 min z i 1 k ω i d i μ i x d i d i 1 i 1 2 k a x b x 0 by solving the above linear goal programming model the optimal solution x can be obtained 2 3 interval linear multi objective fractional programming in order to deal with the multiple uncertainties and multi objective fractional problems this study established an interval linear multi objective fractional programming model ilmofpm by integrating interval linear programming and multi objective fractional programming the developed ilmofpm model is as following 2 12 min f i x c i x d i x c i x α i d i x β i i 1 2 k a x b x 0 where f i x is the objective function x is the

irrigation district in shaanxi province fig 2 which was located in the middle of the guanzhong plain zhao et al 2019 on the left bank of the weihe and jinghe rivers zhou et al 2012 and the irrigation area is about 70 km long from east to west and 20 km wide with a total area of 1180 km2 zhou et al 2012 and the total irrigation area is about 969 km2 of which the artesian irrigation area is 740 km2 and the pumped irrigation area is 229 km2 in addition the annual average precipitation in the irrigation district is 538 9 mm mainly from july to september but the annual average is 1212 0 mm which belongs to continental semi arid area jia et al 2019 furthermore as it is one of the most important irrigation districts in the guanzhong area the jinghuiqu irrigation district plays an irreplaceable role in the sustainable development of xi an tao et al 2015 recently the problem of water shortage jinghuiqu irrigation district is becoming more and more serious the reason is that the runoff of jinghe river is gradually decreasing and it is the main water source of jinghuiqu irrigation district in addition the amount of average annual evapotranspiration is more than twice as much as average annual precipitation making the problem of water scarcity even more serious however the irrigation water use efficiency in jinghuiqu irrigation district is only about 0 547 which means a lot of water resources have been wasted zhang 2021 therefore optimization allocation of irrigation water resources may have positive significance for the sustainable development of jinghuiqu irrigation district therefore this study established an interval linear multi objective fractional programming model to optimize irrigation water resources which not only focuses on the optimal allocation of the irrigation water resources but also focuses on improving irrigation water resources use efficiency wheat maize fruit trees and vegetables are chosen as the study crops which are the main crops of the study area based on the obtained results a series of optimal schemes can be provided for the decision makers 3 2 energy consumption calculation with the advancement of agricultural technology energy plays an increasingly important role in agricultural production praveen et al 2021 for example in the process of agricultural production agricultural productivity will increase by 0 45 when energy input increases by 1 marpaung 2019 therefore energy has become an indispensable part of agricultural production and in the process of agricultural production energy consumption includes not only direct energy consumption but also indirect consumption in other aspects according to the previous studies proctor et al 2021 ren et al 2021 four forms of energy consumption diesel fuel consumption of agricultural machinery agricultural electricity consumption pesticide consumption and chemical fertilizers consumption play a major role in agricultural production the calculation method of energy consumption is as follows diesel fuel consumption calculation 3 1 e 1 t f 1 t p 1 t n 1 f 7 f 4 m p 1 t n 1 where t denotes the time e 1 t is the diesel energy consumption in t year f 1 t is the diesel cost in t year p 1t is the diesel price in t year n 1 is the energy consumption coefficient of diesel f 7 is the fuel power cost per ha in t year f 4 is the cost of mechanical operation per ha

potash fertilizer phosphate fertilizer and compound fertilizer calculation of total energy consumption per ha 3 5 e u t e 1 t e 2 t e 3 t e 4 t where t denotes time e u t is the total energy consumption per ha in t year table 1 represents the energy consumption coefficients in this paper standard coal was selected as the unit of energy consumption which contains 7000 kcal energy by one kilogram ren et al 2021 according to the energy consumption calculation formula and the energy consumption coefficient the calculation results of energy consumption are shown in table 2 3 3 model building in order to deal with the above problems an interval linear multi objective fractional programming model was established to optimize irrigation water resources under uncertainties which not only focuses on the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources but also focuses on improving irrigation water use efficiency in addition energy consumption which play an irreplaceable role in agricultural production is taken into consideration maximum economic benefit per unit of water resource and minimize energy consumption per unit of water resource are made as objectives the formulation of the proposed model is presented below objective function maximum economic benefit per unit of water resource 3 6 max f max i 1 i y i p i a i w s i w g i a i c w s i w g i a i minimum

the hydrological frequency analysis method was chosen to analyze the collected precipitation series data and the effective precipitation of wet normal and wet hydrological year can be obtained based on the above analysis which is represented in the table 4 moreover the corresponding available surface water resources shown in the table 5 can be also obtained according to the obtained representative hydrological years in addition tables 6 to 8 represented the remaining parameters of the developed model which were collected through field investigation national agricultural product cost and income data collection price yearbook agricultural technology and economics manual etc 4 result and discussion in this study the established model determined three representative hydrological years which are wet p 25 normal p 50 and dry p 75 by solving the established model a series of optimal schemes can be obtained under different representative hydrological years in addition in the process of solving the interval linear multi objective fractional model the optimal value of single objective fractional model can also be obtained figs 3 and 4 show the optimal results of the established ilmofpm under different representative hydrological years from the figures the optimal results economic benefit per unit of water resource and energy consumption per unit of water resource would change as different representative hydrological years changed in general the economic benefit per unit of water resource and the energy consumption per unit of water resource represented decreased trend as the representative hydrological year changed from wet to dry for example the upper and lower bound of economic benefit per unit of water resource reduced from 14 65 m3 p 25 to 9 30 m3 p 75 8 27 m3 p 25 to 6 05 m3 p 75 respectively the upper and lower bound of energy consumption per unit of water resource reduced from 0 45210 kg m3 p 25 to 0 31086 kg m3 p 75 0 36549 kg m3 p 25 to 0 26703 kg m3 p 75 respectively fig 5 represented the planting area under different representative hydrological years from figures the optimal value would change when representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry from figure regardless of the upper and lower bound the optimized planting area represented a downward trend when representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry for example the optimized planting area reduced from 9 73 104 9 45 104 ha to 8 17 104 7 87 104 ha respectively with the reduction of available water resources the planting area would decrease which indicates that water shortage has become one of the factors restricting the sustainable development of jinghuiqu irrigation district p 75 was selected as an example to show the optimization distribution of planting area from fig 6 the planting area prefer to wheat and maize and the planting area of fruit tree is the smallest for example the planting area of maize and fruit tree are 3 23 104 3 01 104 ha 0 657 104 0 58 104 ha respectively the reason is that in the process of optimizing irrigation water resources distribution the minimum water demand and food security should be satisfied firstly therefore irrigation water resources are preferentially allocated to wheat and maize which take up a lot of planting area and then the rest irrigation water resources prefer to vegetables in general from figs 5 and 6 the available water resources play an irreplaceable role in determining the planting area moreover during the process of optimal allocation of irrigation water resources the minimum water demand and food security should be satisfied firstly and then the rest of the irrigation water resources would be allocated to the crops which characterized with higher economic benefit per unit of water resource and lower energy consumption per unit of water resource figs 7 and 8 represent water resources consumption and composition of water resources consumption under different representative hydrological years from figures as representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry the upper and lower bound of water resources consumption and composition of water resources consumption changed as well for example when representative hydrological year changed from wet p 25 to dry p 75 the upper and lower bound of water resources consumption would vary from 47836 565 104 46131 62 104 m3 p 25 to 42170 408 104 40437 07 104 m3 p 75 respectively which is roughly similar to fig 6 however the upper and lower bound of water resources consumption under p 50 is higher than it under p 25 the reason is that water resources consumption is determined by irrigation area crop water requirement and effective precipitation in this study and the upper bound of irrigation area under p 25 and 50 are the same however the crop water requirement under p 50 is much higher than that when p 25 while the effective precipitation presents the opposite situation from fig 8 the composition of crop water consumption under different representative hydrological years can be obtained from figure the total water resources consumption is composed if effective precipitation and optimal allocation of water resources which has the same trend as fig 7 in addition a lot of water resources are saved by introducing effective precipitation into the developed model in the study for example when p 75 the upper bound of water resources consumption consist of 2 56 108 m3 optimal allocation of water resources and 1 66 108 m3 effective precipitation which accounts about 39 33 of total water resources consumption in addition during the process of solving the multi objective programming model the optimal value of maximum economic benefit or minimum energy consumption per unit of water resource can be obtained figs 9 and 10 represented economic benefit and energy consumption of different objectives under different representative hydrological years from figures as representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry economic benefit and energy consumption under different objectives would also change showing a downward trend for example when p changed from 25 to 75 the economic benefit under single objective of maximum economic benefit per unit of water resource multi objective and single objective of minimum energy consumption per unit of water resource would reduce from 37 53 108 24 99 108 to 26 87 108 14 89 108 29 81 108 16 64 108 to 23 80 108 14 89 108 25 02 108 17 57 108 to 22 88 108 14 89 108 respectively moreover when p 75 the lower bound of economic benefit and energy consumption under different objectives were the same this is because only the minimum constraints in the developed model are satisfied moreover from figures the single objective model can maximize the economic benefits per unit of water resource or minimize the energy consumption per unit of water resource but another corresponding objective is not taken into accounted for example when p 25 the economic benefit and energy consumption under single objective of maximum economic benefit per unit of water resource were 37 53 108 24 99 108 9627 90 104 8041 62 104 kg respectively while the economic benefit and energy consumption under single objective of minimum energy consumption were 25 02 108 17 57 108 8612 80 104 7975 85 104 kg respectively however the economic benefit and energy consumption under multi objective were 29 81 108 16 64 108 9200 94 104 7353 21 104 kg which represented that economic benefit and energy consumption were both taken under consideration in the developed multi objective model this is because the multi objective model can effectively deal with multiple conflicting objectives based on the above analysis the developed multi objective fractional model has contributed to the sustainable use of water resources in jinghuiqu irrigation district which can not only focus on the optimal allocation of water resources but also deal with the multiple conflict objectives under uncertainty moreover a lot of water resources can be saved by the developed model which incorporated effective precipitation in addition a series of optimal plans can be provided by the developed model for decision makers as a result of the developed model land and water resources can be reasonably optimized which not only improves economic benefit but also reduces energy consumption in addition the developed model provides a set of optimal planting structures and decisions under different representative hydrological years 5 conclusion this paper established an interval linear multi objective fractional programming model for optimizing water resources under multiple uncertainties which can not only deal with the optimal allocation of water resources but also focus on water use efficiency in addition energy consumption is taken into consideration moreover it also has the ability to deal with multiple conflicting objectives jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china was selected as study area maximum economic benefit per unit of water resource and minimum energy consumption per unit of water resource were made as objectives which is conflict between them based on the results the planting area prefer to wheat and maize and the planting area of fruit tree is the smallest in addition 57 45 44 17 39 33 of total water resources consumption were saved under different representative hydrological years due to introducing crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation in the developed model respectively when compared with the above studies the advantages are as follows a deal with multiple conflict objectives b deal with multiple uncertainties c it can not only deal with optimal allocation of water resources but also focus on water use efficiency d take energy consumption under consideration e a lot of water resource was saved by introducing effective precipitation and crop evapotranspiration in addition according to the results of the established model a series of optimal schemes were provided under different representative hydrological years although the developed model has ability to provide a series of irrigation water resources optimal allocation schemes and deal with multiple conflicting objectives it still has potential to improve for example in reality different objectives may belong to different levels which is a two level programming and due to the complexity of irrigation systems there are different types of uncertainties in addition the established optimization model focus on optimizing allocation of the available water resources quantity the surface water and groundwater simulation models are not coupled into the established optimization model therefore return flow or interaction between surface and groundwater bi objective programming and different types of uncertainties should be paid attention credit authorship contribution statement yu zhang

9347,at present water shortage has increasingly become one of the key factors restricting the sustainable development of agriculture and during the process of agricultural production the energy consumption has also been paid more and more attention therefore in order to deal with the above problems an improved interval linear multi objective fractional programming model ilmofpm was developed which has the characteristic is that it not only focuses on the optimal allocation of the amount of irrigation water resources but also on improving irrigation water resources use efficiency to demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability ilmofpm was applied to a case study in jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china maximum economic benefit per unit of water resource and minimum energy consumption per unit of water resource were selected as the planning objectives a series of irrigation water resources optimal allocation schemes were obtained which could give the decision makers the desired optimal scheme according to the actual situation based on the results of the established model economic benefit and energy consumption generally decreased as the representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry and the total crop planting area also showed a decreased trend moreover a lot of water resources was saved by introducing crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation in the developed model 57 45 44 17 39 33 of total water resources consumption were saved under different representative hydrological years respectively keywords multi objective fractional programming multiple uncertainties energy consumption water resources 1 introduction water resources are one of the most important natural resources for the sustainable development of society economy and ecology nouri et al 2019 ren et al 2019b zhang et al 2021a 2021b with the rapid development of society and economy and the growth of population the contradiction between the increasing demand for water resources and the limited supply of water resources is becoming more and more serious ren et al 2019a zhang et al 2021d li et al 2022 shao et al 2022 according to the latest report of the world meteorological organization there will be 5 billion people in the world facing water resources shortage by 2050 van vliet et al 2021 in addition the problem of water scarcity has become more severe due to waste in agricultural irrigation for example in northwest china agricultural irrigation water accounts for approximately 90 of the total water resources but the average irrigation water use coefficient is only about 0 5 li et al 2019a 2019b therefore water resources shortage has become one of the key factors restricting regional sustainable development especially in northwest of china in order to deal with the above problems the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources is a potential way in past decades a series of studies have been proposed to optimize irrigation water resources for example an improved ant colony optimization model made maximize net returns as objective was developed to the allocation of crops and water in different irrigation areas nguyen et al 2016 in order to improve water use efficiency sun et al 2017 proposed a single objective interval optimization model which made maximize the benefits of water as objective when facing ecological benefits and water shortage a multi objective fuzzy robust programming was developed to optimize land and water resources in agriculture tan et al 2017 for the purpose of optimizing allocation of irrigation water resources a linear programming model was developed which focused on obtaining the maximum planting benefits under the restriction of irrigation water soentoro et al 2018 an inexact irrigation water allocation optimization model has proven to be an effective approach to deal with the problem of water shortage and climate change which coupled with a statistical downscaling model and an evapotranspiration model wang et al 2019 in order to deal with the problem of the irrigation water optimal allocation in the jinghuiqu irrigation district the method of interval linear programming was adopted by gong et al 2020 for the purpose of optimizing irrigation water resources a simulation optimization framework under fuzzy uncertainty was developed which integrated fuzzy credibility based optimization model with the hurwicz criterion and daily water balance simulation zhang et al 2021a in order to deal with the problem of agricultural water shortage a process based model multi objective and fuzzy theory was integrated into optimization model which aimed at optimal allocation of irrigation water under uncertainties of water diversion and groundwater zhang et al 2021f in general the above studies have done a lot of work in the optimization allocation of irrigation water resources however most of the above studies paid attention to maximize system benefits minimize system cost or balancing multi objective when faced with severe water resources shortage it is not only focus on the rational use of water resources but also to increase the water resources use efficiency therefore in this study a multi objective fractional optimization model was developed which not only can deal with multi objective but also focus on water use efficiency energy consumption is involved in most of the irrigation process such as pumping water transporting water etc li et al 2019a 2020 2019b avila et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c in addition energy consumption is also involved in the growth of crops hua et al 2021 bhunia et al 2021 however few studies taking energy consumption into the study of optimization allocation of water resources ren et al 2021 therefore in this study an optimization model was established which not only takes water resources use efficiency under consideration but also takes energy consumption under consideration in addition due to the complexity of agricultural production the agricultural production involves many independent subsystems which characterized that uncertain factors are generated in their interaction process li et al 2016 ren and zhang 2019 hu et al 2020 yang et al 2022 thus uncertainty should be considered in the optimization allocation of water resources in past decades many studies have paid attention to uncertainty in agricultural production for example li and zhang 2015 proposed an inexact two stage allocation model to deal with uncertain parameters a two stage regional multi water sources allocation model was developed by liu et al 2017 which could deal with multiple uncertainties effectively fu et al 2018 developed an interval two stage stochastic robust programming model to deal with interval and random uncertainties in order to deal with uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets and randomness an integrated multi objective stochastic fuzzy programming was established ren et al 2019a a coupled interval chance constrained quadratic programming for water quality management was developed to address uncertainties arising from inexact and random parameters zhang et al 2021e in addition climate uncertainty was introduced to a three stage robust optimization model which made the model more applicable to reality in a realistic network moreira et al 2021 in this study uncertain factors expressed as interval are involves in the irrigation and energy consumption subsystem therefore in order to solve the above problems the established optimization model incorporates an interval mathematical model therefore based on the above analysis this paper developed an interval linear multi objective fractional programming model which has the characteristic is that it not only focuses on the optimal allocation of the amount of irrigation water resources but also on improving irrigation water resources use efficiency in addition energy consumption is one of the key parts of agricultural production which should not be ignored in the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources the established model was then applied in jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china maximum economic benefit per unit of irrigation water resource and minimize energy consumption per unit of irrigation water resource are made as objectives the established model has the following advantages a it not only focuses on the optimal allocation of the amount of irrigation water resources but also focuses on improving irrigation water resources use efficiency b it has the ability to deal with multi objective problems c it takes energy consumption into consideration d it can effectively deal with uncertainties expressed as interval in the irrigation and energy consumption subsystems e it incorporates crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation into the optimization model f a series of irrigation water resources optimization schemes crop planting structure schemes and energy consumption schemes were provided under different representative hydrological years 2 model formulation 2 1 interval linear programming in reality in the process of optimizing irrigation water resources the exact value of some parameters cannot be determined and they have the characteristics of uncertainty which is represented as interval form therefore in order to deal with the above problems the linear interval programming proposed by huang et al 1993 was adopted which has the ability to deal with interval uncertainty both in objectives and constraints the interval linear programming is as follows 2 1 min f c x a x b x 0 where f is the objection function a r m n b r m 1 c r 1 n x r n 1 r denotes a set of interval numbers a denotes the matrix where a a a a r m n a i j a i j a i j b c and x denote the vector and the model 2 1 can be transformed into two sub models based on the adopted interval linear programming the two sub models are as follows lower bound sub model 2 2 min f j i k 1 c j x j j k 1 1 n c j x j j i k 1 a i j s i g n a i j x j j k 1 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i i x j 0 j 1 2 n where f is the objective function f o p t is optimal value of objective function a i j a i j are the lower and upper bounds of a i j respectively a i j is an element in the column of matrix a other parameters are expressed in the same way c j is the jth element of vector c x j is the jth element of vector x sign is a sign function among the uncertain coefficients of the objective function the number of positive numbers is k 1 and the number of negative numbers is k 2 let the first k 1 coefficients be positive that is c j 0 j k 1 1 k 1 2 n where k 1 k 2 n in order to make the calculation convenient the upper and lower limit signs of c j were assumed to be consistent by solving the lower bound sub model f o p t x j o p t j 1 2 k 1 and x j o p t j k 1 1 k 1 2 n can be obtained upper bound sub model 2 3 min f j i k 1 c j x j j k 1 1 n c j x j j i k 1 a i j s i g n a i j x j j k 1 1 n a i j s i g n a i j x j b i i x j x j o p t j k 1 1 k 1 2 n x j 0 j 1 2 n where f is the objective function f o p t is optimal value of objective function other parameters are the same as the lower bound sub model by solving the upper bound sub model f o p t x j o p t j 1 2 k 1 and x j o p t j k 1 1 k 1 2 n can be obtained therefore x j o p t x j o p t x j o p t j and f j o p t f j o p t f j o p t can be obtained 2 2 multi objective fractional programming multi objective fractional programming is an optimization model with two or more objective functions which has the advantages is that it can deal with multi objective problems while focusing on the maximum input output ratio yuan and xiao 2016 the general multi objective fractional programming form is as following 2 4 f i x c i x d i x c i x α i d i x β i i 1 2 k a x b x 0 where a r m n b r n x r n c i d i r n α i β i r a denotes the m n matrix x and b are n dimensional and m dimensional column vectors respectively c and d are n dimensional row vectors α and β are parameters and d i x β i 0 i 1 2 k assume that the upper and lower bounds of feasible region of each fractional objective are f i u and f i l i 1 2 k respectively and then the maximum and minimum values of the numerator and denominator in the feasible region for each fractional objective can be calculated which can be recorded as 2 5 yuan and xiao 2016 and it can be expressed as follows 2 5 c i c i x c i d i d i x d i i 1 2 k and then f i u and f i l i 1 2 k can be also expressed as follows 2 6 f i u max c i d i c i d i c i d i c i d i f i l min c i d i c i d i c i d i c i d i in addition the fuzzy objective of fuzzy multi objective linear fractional programming can be expressed by the membership functions dutta et al 1993 and the membership functions for maximization and minimization are as follows 2 7 μ i x 1 f i x f i u f i x f i l f i u f i l f i l f i x f i u 0 f i x f i l i 1 2 k 2 8 μ i x 1 f i x f i l f i u f i x f i u f i l f i l f i x f i u 0 f i x f i u i 1 2 k furthermore the multi objective linear programming problem is equivalent to the fuzzy objective programming problem mohamed 1997 therefore the model 2 4 can be transformed as follows 2 9 min z i 1 k ω i d i μ i x d i d i 1 i 1 2 k a x b x 0 where ω i represents the weight coefficient which can be defined as ω i 1 f i u f i l i 1 2 k μ i x is the membership function d i and d i represent different scaling values moreover in order to solve the above model more easily the membership function μ i x in the model 2 9 can be represented by a first order taylor series assume that x i 0 x i 1 0 x i 2 0 x i k 0 t i 1 2 k is the maximum optimal solution of a single objective function of model 2 4 therefore the first order taylor series of μ i x can be expressed as follows 2 10 μ i x μ i x i 0 i 1 k μ i x i 0 x j x j x i j 0 i 1 2 k where x j is the jth element of variable x x i j 0 is the jth element of variable x i 0 therefore the original model can be transformed into a linear goal programming model by introducing model 2 10 into 2 9 which is as follows 2 11 min z i 1 k ω i d i μ i x d i d i 1 i 1 2 k a x b x 0 by solving the above linear goal programming model the optimal solution x can be obtained 2 3 interval linear multi objective fractional programming in order to deal with the multiple uncertainties and multi objective fractional problems this study established an interval linear multi objective fractional programming model ilmofpm by integrating interval linear programming and multi objective fractional programming the developed ilmofpm model is as following 2 12 min f i x c i x d i x c i x α i d i x β i i 1 2 k a x b x 0 where f i x is the objective function x is the independent variable of the model a b c d c i d i α i β i are the interval parameters i 1 2 k fig 1 illustrates the framework of the ilmofpm model therefore the steps of solving the ilmofpm are as follows a build the original ilmofpm model b convert the original ilmofpm into upper and lower bound of multi objective fractional sub model c transformed multi objective fractional model into linear programming model by building membership function and introducing first order taylor series d set the representative hydrological year p and solve the obtained linear programming model e change the value of representative hydrological year p and repeat steps d to e f get the solution under different representative hydrological years 3 application 3 1 study area the study area is jinghuiqu irrigation district in shaanxi province fig 2 which was located in the middle of the guanzhong plain zhao et al 2019 on the left bank of the weihe and jinghe rivers zhou et al 2012 and the irrigation area is about 70 km long from east to west and 20 km wide with a total area of 1180 km2 zhou et al 2012 and the total irrigation area is about 969 km2 of which the artesian irrigation area is 740 km2 and the pumped irrigation area is 229 km2 in addition the annual average precipitation in the irrigation district is 538 9 mm mainly from july to september but the annual average is 1212 0 mm which belongs to continental semi arid area jia et al 2019 furthermore as it is one of the most important irrigation districts in the guanzhong area the jinghuiqu irrigation district plays an irreplaceable role in the sustainable development of xi an tao et al 2015 recently the problem of water shortage jinghuiqu irrigation district is becoming more and more serious the reason is that the runoff of jinghe river is gradually decreasing and it is the main water source of jinghuiqu irrigation district in addition the amount of average annual evapotranspiration is more than twice as much as average annual precipitation making the problem of water scarcity even more serious however the irrigation water use efficiency in jinghuiqu irrigation district is only about 0 547 which means a lot of water resources have been wasted zhang 2021 therefore optimization allocation of irrigation water resources may have positive significance for the sustainable development of jinghuiqu irrigation district therefore this study established an interval linear multi objective fractional programming model to optimize irrigation water resources which not only focuses on the optimal allocation of the irrigation water resources but also focuses on improving irrigation water resources use efficiency wheat maize fruit trees and vegetables are chosen as the study crops which are the main crops of the study area based on the obtained results a series of optimal schemes can be provided for the decision makers 3 2 energy consumption calculation with the advancement of agricultural technology energy plays an increasingly important role in agricultural production praveen et al 2021 for example in the process of agricultural production agricultural productivity will increase by 0 45 when energy input increases by 1 marpaung 2019 therefore energy has become an indispensable part of agricultural production and in the process of agricultural production energy consumption includes not only direct energy consumption but also indirect consumption in other aspects according to the previous studies proctor et al 2021 ren et al 2021 four forms of energy consumption diesel fuel consumption of agricultural machinery agricultural electricity consumption pesticide consumption and chemical fertilizers consumption play a major role in agricultural production the calculation method of energy consumption is as follows diesel fuel consumption calculation 3 1 e 1 t f 1 t p 1 t n 1 f 7 f 4 m p 1 t n 1 where t denotes the time e 1 t is the diesel energy consumption in t year f 1 t is the

fertilizer consumption calculation 3 4 e 4 t j 1 4 q j t n j j 1 4 q j n j where t denotes the time e 4t is the energy consumption of chemical fertilizers in t year q j t is j fertilizer consumption

potash fertilizer phosphate fertilizer and compound fertilizer calculation of total energy consumption per ha 3 5 e u t e 1 t e 2 t e 3 t e 4 t where t denotes time e u t is the total energy consumption per ha in t year table 1 represents the energy consumption coefficients in this paper standard coal was selected as the unit of energy consumption which contains 7000 kcal energy by one kilogram ren et al 2021 according to the energy consumption calculation formula and the energy consumption coefficient the calculation results of energy consumption are shown in table 2 3 3 model building in order to deal with the above problems an interval linear multi objective fractional programming model was established to optimize irrigation water resources under uncertainties which not only focuses on the optimal allocation of irrigation water resources but also focuses on improving irrigation water use efficiency in addition energy consumption which play an irreplaceable role in agricultural production is taken into consideration maximum economic benefit per unit of water resource and minimize energy consumption per unit of water resource are made as objectives the formulation of the proposed model is presented below objective function maximum economic benefit per unit of water resource 3 6 max f max i 1 i y i p i a i w s i w g i a i c w s i w g i a i minimum

the hydrological frequency analysis method was chosen to analyze the collected precipitation series data and the effective precipitation of wet normal and wet hydrological year can be obtained based on the above analysis which is represented in the table 4 moreover the corresponding available surface water resources shown in the table 5 can be also obtained according to the obtained representative hydrological years in addition tables 6 to 8 represented the remaining parameters of the developed model which were collected through field investigation national agricultural product cost and income data collection price yearbook agricultural technology and economics manual etc 4 result and discussion in this study the established model determined three representative hydrological years which are wet p 25 normal p 50 and dry p 75 by solving the established model a series of optimal schemes can be obtained under different representative hydrological years in addition in the process of solving the interval linear multi objective fractional model the optimal value of single objective fractional model can also be obtained figs 3 and 4 show the optimal results of the established ilmofpm under different representative hydrological years from the figures the optimal results economic benefit per unit of water resource and energy consumption per unit of water resource would change as different representative hydrological years changed in general the economic benefit per unit of water resource and the energy consumption per unit of water resource represented decreased trend as the representative hydrological year changed from wet to dry for example the upper and lower bound of economic benefit per unit of water resource reduced from 14 65 m3 p 25 to 9 30 m3 p 75 8 27 m3 p 25 to 6 05 m3 p 75 respectively the upper and lower bound of energy consumption per unit of water resource reduced from 0 45210 kg m3 p 25 to 0 31086 kg m3 p 75 0 36549 kg m3 p 25 to 0 26703 kg m3 p 75 respectively fig 5 represented the planting area under different representative hydrological years from figures the optimal value would change when representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry from figure regardless of the upper and lower bound the optimized planting area represented a downward trend when representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry for example the optimized planting area reduced from 9 73 104 9 45 104 ha to 8 17 104 7 87 104 ha respectively with the reduction of available water resources the planting area would decrease which indicates that water shortage has become one of the factors restricting the sustainable development of jinghuiqu irrigation district p 75 was selected as an example to show the optimization distribution of planting area from fig 6 the planting area prefer to wheat and maize and the planting area of fruit tree is the smallest for example the planting area of maize and fruit tree are 3 23 104 3 01 104 ha 0 657 104 0 58 104 ha respectively the reason is that in the process of optimizing irrigation water resources distribution the minimum water demand and food security should be satisfied firstly therefore irrigation water resources are preferentially allocated to wheat and maize which take up a lot of planting area and then the rest irrigation water resources prefer to vegetables in general from figs 5 and 6 the available water resources play an irreplaceable role in determining the planting area moreover during the process of optimal allocation of irrigation water resources the minimum water demand and food security should be satisfied firstly and then the rest of the irrigation water resources would be allocated to the crops which characterized with higher economic benefit per unit of water resource and lower energy consumption per unit of water resource figs 7 and 8 represent water resources consumption and composition of water resources consumption under different representative hydrological years from figures as representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry the upper and lower bound of water resources consumption and composition of water resources consumption changed as well for example when representative hydrological year changed from wet p 25 to dry p 75 the upper and lower bound of water resources consumption would vary from 47836 565 104 46131 62 104 m3 p 25 to 42170 408 104 40437 07 104 m3 p 75 respectively which is roughly similar to fig 6 however the upper and lower bound of water resources consumption under p 50 is higher than it under p 25 the reason is that water resources consumption is determined by irrigation area crop water requirement and effective precipitation in this study and the upper bound of irrigation area under p 25 and 50 are the same however the crop water requirement under p 50 is much higher than that when p 25 while the effective precipitation presents the opposite situation from fig 8 the composition of crop water consumption under different representative hydrological years can be obtained from figure the total water resources consumption is composed if effective precipitation and optimal allocation of water resources which has the same trend as fig 7 in addition a lot of water resources are saved by introducing effective precipitation into the developed model in the study for example when p 75 the upper bound of water resources consumption consist of 2 56 108 m3 optimal allocation of water resources and 1 66 108 m3 effective precipitation which accounts about 39 33 of total water resources consumption in addition during the process of solving the multi objective programming model the optimal value of maximum economic benefit or minimum energy consumption per unit of water resource can be obtained figs 9 and 10 represented economic benefit and energy consumption of different objectives under different representative hydrological years from figures as representative hydrological years changed from wet to dry economic benefit and energy consumption under different objectives would also change showing a downward trend for example when p changed from 25 to 75 the economic benefit under single objective of maximum economic benefit per unit of water resource multi objective and single objective of minimum energy consumption per unit of water resource would reduce from 37 53 108 24 99 108 to 26 87 108 14 89 108 29 81 108 16 64 108 to 23 80 108 14 89 108 25 02 108 17 57 108 to 22 88 108 14 89 108 respectively moreover when p 75 the lower bound of economic benefit and energy consumption under different objectives were the same this is because only the minimum constraints in the developed model are satisfied moreover from figures the single objective model can maximize the economic benefits per unit of water resource or minimize the energy consumption per unit of water resource but another corresponding objective is not taken into accounted for example when p 25 the economic benefit and energy consumption under single objective of maximum economic benefit per unit of water resource were 37 53 108 24 99 108 9627 90 104 8041 62 104 kg respectively while the economic benefit and energy consumption under single objective of minimum energy consumption were 25 02 108 17 57 108 8612 80 104 7975 85 104 kg respectively however the economic benefit and energy consumption under multi objective were 29 81 108 16 64 108 9200 94 104 7353 21 104 kg which represented that economic benefit and energy consumption were both taken under consideration in the developed multi objective model this is because the multi objective model can effectively deal with multiple conflicting objectives based on the above analysis the developed multi objective fractional model has contributed to the sustainable use of water resources in jinghuiqu irrigation district which can not only focus on the optimal allocation of water resources but also deal with the multiple conflict objectives under uncertainty moreover a lot of water resources can be saved by the developed model which incorporated effective precipitation in addition a series of optimal plans can be provided by the developed model for decision makers as a result of the developed model land and water resources can be reasonably optimized which not only improves economic benefit but also reduces energy consumption in addition the developed model provides a set of optimal planting structures and decisions under different representative hydrological years 5 conclusion this paper established an interval linear multi objective fractional programming model for optimizing water resources under multiple uncertainties which can not only deal with the optimal allocation of water resources but also focus on water use efficiency in addition energy consumption is taken into consideration moreover it also has the ability to deal with multiple conflicting objectives jinghuiqu irrigation district shaanxi province china was selected as study area maximum economic benefit per unit of water resource and minimum energy consumption per unit of water resource were made as objectives which is conflict between them based on the results the planting area prefer to wheat and maize and the planting area of fruit tree is the smallest in addition 57 45 44 17 39 33 of total water resources consumption were saved under different representative hydrological years due to introducing crop evapotranspiration and effective precipitation in the developed model respectively when compared with the above studies the advantages are as follows a deal with multiple conflict objectives b deal with multiple uncertainties c it can not only deal with optimal allocation of water resources but also focus on water use efficiency d take energy consumption under consideration e a lot of water resource was saved by introducing effective precipitation and crop evapotranspiration in addition according to the results of the established model a series of optimal schemes were provided under different representative hydrological years although the developed model has ability to provide a series of irrigation water resources optimal allocation schemes and deal with multiple conflicting objectives it still has potential to improve for example in reality different objectives may belong to different levels which is a two level programming and due to the complexity of irrigation systems there are different types of uncertainties in addition the established optimization model focus on optimizing allocation of the available water resources quantity the surface water and groundwater simulation models are not coupled into the established optimization model therefore return flow or interaction between surface and groundwater bi objective programming and different types of uncertainties should be paid attention credit authorship contribution statement yu zhang

9348,agricultural crop management requires extensive and comprehensive tools that allow for a full knowledge of the crops status and growth dynamic this study aims at estimating crop yield for maize and tomato crops over large areas at field scale for this purpose we developed a fully coupled model based on a parameter saving crop growth model simple algorithm for yield estimates safy with a water energy balance model flash flood event based spatially distributed rainfall runoff transformation energy water balance model fest ewb with a double exchange of leaf area index lai and soil moisture sm information both models are driven by remote sensing data and are calibrated independently from in situ measurements satellite lai data are used to calibrate the crop growth model parameters while the energy water balance parameters are calibrated against satellite land surface temperature lst data multiple satellite data are used either at high spatial resolution sentinel 2 and landsat 7 and 8 and at low resolution modis two italian case studies are selected to test the model accuracy the chiese irrigation consortium northern italy mainly devoted to maize crop cultivation and the capitanata irrigation consortium southern italy where tomatoes are largely diffused at local scale lai is reproduced for tomatoes with a mean rmse of 0 92 and yield with a rmse of 1 2 ton ha 1 while for maize a rmse of 1 is found for lai and a rmse of 1 5 ton ha 1 for yield results show an overall correspondence of daily soil moisture and evapotranspiration estimates with a rmse in between 0 11 and 0 15 and of 1 3 3 mm respectively at the regional scale lai estimates show a rmse around 1 1 for both case studies while a rmse of 13 4 ton ha 1 is obtained for tomato yield and of 1 4 ton ha 1 for maize keywords crop growth energy water balance remote sensing tomatoes and maize data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world s population is projected to increase to 8 5 billion by 2030 demanding for a substantial increase in both water and food which is expected to increase by 70 by 2050 simultaneously with the diet style quality increase thus improving crop production and water use management is a fundamental step to achieve sustainable food and water security alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 crop models are robust instruments for analyzing crop dynamics and yield while considering the relative impacts of agricultural practices including irrigation meteorological conditions and the energy and water cycles boote et al 2013 2008 a number of models have been developed over the years built on physical or empirical equations or a combination of both and involving a variable number of parameters estes et al 2013 these models differ one from the other in their complexity structure and calculation processes in how they water dynamics solar radiation impacts nutrients and carbon dioxide concentration steduto 2003 complex process based models governed by a large number of crop and soil parameters are available to study crops dynamic as dssat jones et al 2003 ceres maize dyke et al 1986 and stics brisson et al 2003 but these have a limited applicability over large areas due to data unavailability and uncertainty semi empirical approaches to reduce model complexity have been studied such as aquacrop steduto et al 2009 wofost supit et al 1994 or safy duchemin et al 2008 which have been show to provide accurate estimates of crop yield at field scale the combined use of remote sensing information with crop models allows the estimation of crop yield over larger areas at high spatial resolution as well as monitoring irrigation water needs battude et al 2017 morari et al 2021 li et al 2014 lu et al 2021 remotely sensed leaf area index lai or vegetation fraction fv are in fact able to accurately describe the crop evolution over time and space of different types of crops with high accuracy bsaibes et al 2009 claverie et al 2013 over the last few years simple regressions have also been developed to estimate crop yield from remotely sensed vegetation indices skakun et al 2019 moreover the development of land surface water energy balance schemes based on remotely sensed land surface temperature lst and or soil moisture sm as alexi anderson et al 1997 sebs su 2002 tseb kustas and norman 1999 sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 fest ewb corbari et al 2011 allow to estimate the evolution of evapotranspiration and or soil moisture over time at high spatial and temporal resolutions these land surface models coupled with crop growth models might provide new insight in the crop yield and biomass evolution along with the land water energy fluxes partitioning with an improved accuracy and allowing to compute also crop water needs or defining optimal irrigation management van den hoof et al 2011 song et al 2013 zhang et al 2020a 2020b liu et al 2016 included in the noah mp model a dynamic crop module for corn and soybean showing a good correspondence with observed data for lai and energy fluxes in the us steduto et al 2009 developed the aquacrop model for simulating the interaction between crop yield production and irrigation practices accounting for soil moisture dynamics battude et al 2017 improved the safy model by adding a crop coefficient based evapotranspiration computation to evaluate the irrigation water needs of maize in france 1 1 objectives in this context the objective of this paper is the development of a fully coupled model based on a low parameter crop growth model integrated with a water energy balance model with a double exchange of lai and sm information to estimate maize and tomato crop yields as well as soil moisture evapotranspiration and lai in particular the safy simple algorithm for yield estimate crop model duchemin et al 2008 has been integrated with the fest ewb energy water balance model flash flood event based spatially distributed rainfall runoff transformation energy water balance model corbari et al 2011 the sub objectives are i to evaluate the capability of the coupled model to estimate sm et lai yield at point scale as well as over the irrigation consortium area ii to calibrate the coupled model at pixel scale relying only on satellite information lai data to calibrate the inputs parameters derived from the safy model while the inputs parameters of the fest ewb energy water balance model against satellite lst the coupled fest ewb safy model will be validated by comparison with multi annual local measurements of soil moisture and evapotranspiration et data as well as crop yield data two case studies are selected to test model accuracy the chiese irrigation consortium area in the north of italy mainly devoted to maize crop cultivation and the capitanata irrigation consortium area in the south of italy characterized by a summer intensive cultivation of tomatoes and winter vegetables these areas are extremely different in climatic conditions crops types irrigation strategies and techniques multiple satellite data of both lai and lst are obtained at high spatial resolution from sentinel 2 and landsat 7 and 8 satellites as well as at low resolution from modis terra sensor ground based eddy covariance data of sm and et are available in different maize and tomato fields in both case studies as well as information on crop yields from farmers knowledge or national databases details in section 2 2 4 the main innovative aspects of this study are 1 coupling of a parsimonious crop growth model into a time continuous energy water balance model not based on lst as input data 2 a robust calibration independent from ground data which relies on a pixel wise comparison against lst and lai satellite images 3 model calibration and validation using completely independent variables allowing to verify multiple processes 4 the use of safy model to simulate tomato crop growth which it has never been used before 2 materials and methods 2 1 the fest ewb safy coupled model the fest ewb distributed hydrological model based on the system of water and energy balances equations has been fully coupled in two ways with the crop growth model safy the essence of this modeling coupling is that the safy model provides the leaf area index lai evolution through time which is then used by the fest ewb for computation of evapotranspiration fig 1 while the fest ewb model provides soil moisture sm to safy model which is used to compute the water stress to the crop growing the main variables of the coupled model are listed in table 1 including symbols meanings and units of measurement model calibration and evaluation have then been performed at two different scales local and regional the coupled model is calibrated against satellite data of lst and lai at pixel by pixel scale at the regional scale while it is then validated against yield data obtained from two italian national statistics databases with data for specific farms and aggregated per regional boundaries as well as at the local scale against a large database of in situ measurements of soil moisture land surface temperature and evapotranspiration which are available from field scale eddy covariance measurements while yield information is from farmers knowledge 2 1 1 the safy model the safy model simple algorithm for yield estimates is a parsimonious agronomical model that simulates the green area index gai and dry aboveground mass dam at a daily time step duchemin et al 2008 the model combines monteith s 1972 light use efficiency theory with a leaf partitioning function based on the maas 1993 formulation the safy model has been previously demonstrated to produce reliable estimates of dry biomass for wheat in semi arid regions duchemin et al 2008 2015 fieuzal et al 2011 as well for over irrigated or rainfed maize sunflower and soybean in the south west of france battude et al 2016 it has a set of 13 parameters 7 of which are to be calibrated the model does not require additional information about the agricultural practices the dam production is a function of the effective light use efficiency elue the daily temperature ta and the daily photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy apar eqs 1 3 where rg is the daily global incoming radiation ε c is the climatic efficiency and kext is the light extinction coefficient monsi and saeki 2005 the daily dam change is partitioned to the dry leaf biomass by the mean of the partition to leaf function pl eq 5 the gai is obtained by converting daily leaf mass production dam x pl into daily leaf area growth gai based on the specific leaf area sla eq 4 leaf senescence gai begins when the sum of temperature smt reaches a given threshold the sum of temperature for senescence stt which is calibrated based on remotely sensed lai it is modeled by a function based on the rate of senescence coefficient rs eqs 6 and 7 the crop yield can be obtained by multiplying the final dam value with a crop dependent harvest index hi eq 8 a full description of the model is available in duchemin et al 2008 1 dam elue x f t ta x apar 2 apar 1 e k ext

ffresh the coefficient of transformation between dry biomass and fresh yield is set as equal to 0 055 for tomatoes rinaldi et al 2011 the effect of the temperature on plant growth is considered with the f t t a eq 3 it is a classical polynomial of β degree defined by an optimal daily mean temperature topt and two extreme temperatures tmin and tmax which is usually set equal to 2 brisson et al 2003 all other agro environmental stress factors that could affect plant growth nitrogen diseases or water stress are supposed to be considered through the gai and the elue in the safy model alternative implementation of safy that includes a water budget module considering the evapotranspiration using the fao56 methodology has been suggested in duchemin et al 2015 when safy is coupled with fest ewb the vegetation growth might be limited by a linear temperature stress coefficient f t ta and a water stress coefficient kstress based on soil moisture hence eq 1 might be rewritten as 9 dam elue x f t ta x k stre ss sm xapar 10 k stress sm taw dr taw raw taw dr 1 p taw 11 taw fc wp dz 12 dr fc sm dz where taw is the total taw the total available soil water in the root zone mm fc the

that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress reduction in et occurs 0 1 dr root zone depletion mm the p coefficient is tabulated according to fao56 allen et al 1998 and applies for etc of about 5 mm day the value for p can be adjusted for different etc according to 13 p new p 0 04 5 etc where p is expressed as a fraction and etc as mm day 1 2 1 2 the fest ewb model the fest ewb flash flood event based spatially distributed rainfall runoff transformation energy water balance model is a time continuous distributed land surface energy water balance model corbari et al 2011 which computes all the main processes of the water land surface cycle fest ewb has been demonstrated to be able to simulate et and sm at local scale against eddy covariance stations measurements corbari et al 2011 as well as at irrigation consortium scale in comparison to satellite land surface temperature lst data considering also irrigation distribution corbari et al 2013 2020 and at catchment scale against remotely sensed lst and river discharge in the po and yangtze river basins corbari and mancini 2014 corbari et al 2019b fest ewb has also been used for smart irrigation management combined with remote sensing data and meteorological forecast in an asparagus field in southern italy corbari et al 2019a fest ewb resolves the system of the energy and water budget equations in each pixel of the analysed area searching for the representative equilibrium temperature ret as the land surface temperature that allows closing the energy balance equation the two energy and water balances equations are then connected by the evapotranspiration flux the system is calculated as 14 sm i j t 1 dz i j p i j r i j pe i j et i j r n i j g i j h i j l e i j 0 where sm i j is soil moisture p is precipitation rate mm h 1 r is runoff flux mm h 1 pe is drainage flux mm h 1 et is evapotranspiration rate mm h 1 z is the soil depth m rn wm 2 is the net radiation g wm 2 is the soil heat flux h wm 2 is the sensible heat flux while le wm 2 is the latent heat flux i and j are the pixel coordinates surface and subsurface river discharges are not computed being the analyzed case studies located into agricultural areas the latent heat fluxes which is the heat used in the phase change from a liquid to a gas is considered for bare soil les and of canopy lec are 15 l e c l e s f v ρ a c p γ r a r c e e a 1 f v ρ a c p γ r a r s e e a where γ is psychrometric constant pa c 1 e is the saturation vapour pressure pa computed as a function of the lst and ea is the vapour pressure pa ra is the aerodynamic resistance sm 1 which determines the transfer of heat and water vapour from the evapotranspirating surface into the air above the canopy correction functions for atmospheric stability or instability are included using the thom model thom 1975 the canopy resistance rc sm 1 which describes the resistance of vapour flow through the transpiring crop is expressed as jarvis 1976 16 r c r s min l a i f c w p θ w p considering rs min as the minimum stomatal resistance sm 1 the soil resistance rs sm 1 is the resistance at the evaporating soil surface sun 1982 17 r s 3 5 θ s a t θ 2 3 33 5 the model requires as input all the meteorological variables air temperature and relative humidity solar radiation wind velocity and precipitation plus the irrigation amount the model parameters regulating the water and energy budgets are reported in table 1 2 1 3 calibration and validation procedure of the coupled model the coupled model has been calibrated and validated using independent variables allowing to verify multiple processes in fig 1 the strategy is shown firstly satellite data of lst are used at pixel scale over the whole area for soil parameters calibration then satellite lai are used for crop parameters calibration at local scale finally the validation step is based on local ground measures of et sm and yield as well as satellite lai for the whole area the procedure is described below in more detail the water and energy budget s parameters coming from the fest ewb model were calibrated pixel by pixel looking for the minimization of the root mean square error rmse between the simulated ret and the observed satellite lst in each single pixel based on the procedure developed by corbari and mancini 2014 where each single pixel parameter is tuned independently from the other pixels the model was then validated at local scale against soil moisture and evapotranspiration measurements this is feasible due to the fact that ret is an internal model variable directly linked to the latent and sensible heat fluxes as well as soil moisture condition hence thanks to this approach sm and et are improved at the pixel scale as well as globally the fest ewb model is initialized using literature suggested values for soil parameters according to the soil type these are then modified iteratively for each single pixel of the irrigation consortium regions by a percentage until the objective function tends toward zero the parameter values are always kept within their physical ranges for each soil class rawls and brakensiek 1985 in corbari and mancini 2022 the model has been extensively calibrated and validated for both consortia areas in its energy water balance components in particular in the capitanata consortium a pixel by pixel mae of 2 7 c is obtained between the remotely sensed lsts and the fest ewb rets over the calibration period 2014 and 2016 and a mae of 3 5 c in the validation years of 2017 2018 while of the chiese area a mae of 3 4 c is found for the calibration period between 2005 and 2011 and a value of 2 9 c for the validation period between 2011 and 2016 the safy crop growth parameters were calibrated against remotely observed lai data from all available sensors at the local scale where information on planting and harvesting dates are known as well as the type of crop cultivar the calibration has been done by tuning the model parameters values to minimize the differences between the modeled and observed variable battude et al 2016 the model has then been validated against local crop yield information as well as against satellite lai data over the whole analysed area some of crop specific parameters of table 1 εc tmin topt tmax β kext hi are fixed according to literature values for maize from battude et al 2016 while for tomatoes from der van ploeg and heuvelink 2005 the hi for the conversion from biomass to yield has been set equal to 0 5 as proposed by fao reference value steduto et al 2009 the calibrated parameters for soil and crop equations are reported in table 1 for both case studies model robustness is quantified through the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse the relative root mean square error rrme which are computed as follows 18 mae i 1 n s i m i n 19 rmse i 1 n s i m i 2 n 20 r r m e i 1 n s i m i 2 n m where s i is the ith simulated variable mi is the ith measured variable n the sample size and m the average observed variable 2 2 case study and data the study is carried out in italy considering two different irrigation consortium areas the capitanata one located in the south of italy and the chiese one in the north of italy in the pianura padana area fig 2 these two case studies are profoundly different in terms of climate crops techniques and irrigation strategies these diversities will contribute to the demonstration of the robustness of the analysis the capitanata irrigation consortium with an area of about 50 000 ha is the largest area in the south of italy devoted to irrigated agriculture with a spring summer crop season when mainly wheat and tomatoes are cultivated italy is a world leading producer of processed tomatoes representing approximately 13 of the global production and 48 of europe s production and the apulia region produces more than half of italy s processing tomatoes seasonal volume of water used to irrigate processing tomato fields depends on the climatic trends it generally ranges between 4 000 and 6 000 m3 ha 1 the climate is characterized by hot dry summers and warm wet winters a pressurized water network pumping water from two reservoirs distributes irrigation on demand to the fields from april to october with a mean seasonal amount of 600 mm over a seasonal precipitation average of about 150 mm daily irrigation volumes over the whole consortium are available from 2013 to 2018 the fields are mainly irrigated with drip and micro sprinklers techniques the chiese irrigation consortium 20 000 ha in the north of italy is a highly irrigated area cultivated with summer crops such as maize and forage and winter wheat the irrigation is supplied through a dense channel network of 1400 km based on a priori fixed irrigation turn every between 7 ½ and 8 ½ days from april to september the surface irrigation technique is the most common one with a mean turn volume of about 100 mm over the crop season a mean rainfall of 250 mm is present while the average irrigation is 1200 mm 2 2 1 meteorological data the meteorological data used by the fest ewb safy model are precipitation air temperature and relative humidity incoming solar radiation and wind speed these data are available for both case studies by the stations of the official arpa networks of puglia and lombardia regions for the capitanata and chiese consortia respectively and from the private association meteonetwork fig 2 21 stations provided data at hourly time stamps from 2013 to 2018 for the capitanata area while 15 stations for the chiese one from 2005 to 2018 2 2 2 satellite data multiple satellites data are used for model calibration and validation in order to improve the model calibration accuracy multiple satellite data were combined overcoming the problems related to cloud cover as well as the limited revisit time of a single satellite thus lst data were retrieved from landsat 7 8 satellites at high spatial and low temporal resolutions and from the modis sensor on board terra and aqua satellites at low spatial and high temporal resolutions vegetation data are obtained from the same sensors plus the sentinel 2 data at high spatial resolution among all the images used during the analyzed period for the capitanata area a total amount of 40 sentinel 2 images are used 67 from landsat 8 and 63 from landsat 7 from 2014 to 2017 for the chiese area 3965 images from modis are analyzed 24 from landsat 8 and 21 from landsat 7 51 from sentinel 2 for the years from 2011 to 2018 all images in the visible and near infrared spectrum have been atmospherically corrected with 6 s landsat 8 case or sen2corr sentinel 2 case software to estimate the bottom of atmosphere reflectance and then following the procedure implemented in corbari et al 2020 the vegetation fraction fv is computed as gutman and ignatov 1998 while lai is then calculated as function of fv and the light extinction coefficient choudhury 1987 the leaf area index from modis data http ladsweb nascom nasa gov index html has been obtained from mod15a2 leaf area index product generated over an 8 day compositing period myneni et al 2002 through the fv images from july and august the maize and tomato crops areas were identified firstly by discriminating among bare soil and vegetated areas fv 0 05 in fact in the chiese consortium 95 of the area is cultivated with maize during the summer season while in the capitanata area during summer the only cultivated crop is tomatoes about 40 of the area istat 2018 for the capitanata consortium lst from landsat 7 and 8 are computed as described in skokovic et al 2017 and sobrino et al 1996 based on a single channel and split window algorithms for l7 and l8 respectively then the lst spatial resolution is further improved from 100 m l8 and 60 m l7 to 30 m using the nearest neighbor temperature sharpening algorithm skokovic 2017 daily lst data for the chiese consortium are obtained from the modis terra lst e daily l3 global 1 km grid product mod11a1 at a spatial resolution of 1 km which is then improved to 500 m following the disaggregation procedure for radiometric surface temperature distrad kustas et al 2003 2 2 3 local evapotranspiration and soil moisture data in both case studies different experimental fields are monitored with eddy covariance stations fig 2 allowing to measure among other variables evapotranspiration and soil moisture which are used for the model calibration and validation in the capitanata consortium three tomato fields are monitored two fields during 2016 in a silty clay and sandy soil and a field during 2017 while in the chiese consortium a single field has been monitored during the maize season from 2016 to 2018 station configuration instruments characteristics and eddy covariance data analysis are described in corbari et al 2020 and corbari and mancini 2021 in particular soil moisture measurements are performed by tdr time domain reflectometer sensors that have been installed at the depths of 15 cm in the tomato fields and at 45 cm in the maize ones for all the analyzed fields the dates of the irrigation events and the water volumes are known 2 2 4 crop yield data three different levels of crop yield data are used for model validation both at local and regional scales local yield data are available from the farmers knowledge for the experimental tomato and maize fields of both case studies where the eddy covariance stations are installed crop yield data are also available from the farm accountancy data network fadn database which collects annual surveys at european level by liaison agencies of each state member of the european commission european commission 2021 the italian dataset come from the rete di informazione contabile agricola rica farms the dataset mainly intended for agricultural economic studies also includes physical data as the crop yield at farm level the irrigated land and the water used for irrigation measured on a volume basis m3 ha 1 in the capitanata consortium data of 264 plots from 117 farms have been extracted for the years from 2014 to 2016 the average tomato fresh yield was 92 4 ton ha 1 higher than the average value observed in the literature 65 95 ton ha 1 with a variability related to the zone and tomatoes variety for the chiese consortium a sample of 100 farms was considered from 2011 to 2018 an average crop yield of 12 7 ton ha 1 is found which is in line with the average value of 12 5 ton ha 1 in northern italy regional yield estimates are then available from the italian national statistics institute istat website https www istat it it agricoltura dati this dataset provides aggregated information of total yield and cultivated hectare of tomato crops for the province of foggia in puglia region where the capitanata consortium is located and of maize of brescia province in the lombardia region which partially covers the chiese consortium 2 2 5 soil type information soil characteristics are accessible from the regional datasets of regione puglia http www sit puglia it portal sit portal for the capitanata consortium and of regione lombardia http www cartografia regione lombardia it rlregisdownload for the chiese consortium information on the different soil classes according to the usda triangle allows estimation of the soil hydraulic properties used as input of the fest ewb model according to rawls and brakensiek 1985 the active soil depth involved in the water cycle computation and relevant for the evapotranspiration process is initially set to be equal to 0 5 m in the capitanata consortium being representative of the root development zone of the most diffuse fresh vegetable in the area while a value of 1 2 m in the chiese consortium as significant for maize roots the main soil parameters are indicated for both case studies after the fest ewb safy model calibration in table 1 3 results 3 1 model calibration at local and irrigation consortium scales 3 1 1 calibration of crop parameters at eddy covariance stations sites the coupled fest ewb safy model was first calibrated for crop parameters at field sites for both tomato and maize crops against remotely sensed lai in the capitanata consortium over the three analyzed tomato fields the simulated leaf area index is following the temporal dynamic of the measured lai from sentinel 2 landsat 7 and 8 data over the 3 years throughout the whole growing and senescence periods fig 3a a mean r2 of 0 83 and a rmse of 0 92 are obtained with a high consistency among the different analyzed fields table 2 it is interesting to note the difference in lai data among the 2016 field 1 and 2016 field 2 and 2017 being the second field cultivated with a different variety of tomatoes in the chiese irrigation consortium for the experimental field over the three monitored years the lai is reproduced by fest ewb safy with a mean r2 of 0 79 and a rmse of 1 with respect to the measured satellite data with a high consistency between the years table 2 catching also the temporal dynamic over the whole crop season from sowing to harvest fig 3b shows the results for the three years of data the obtained parameters are reported in table 1 being the values comparable with literature ones battude et al 2016 each field has been calibrated independently one from the other but to extend the analysis at basin scale mean values of the crops parameters are then considered 3 1 1 1 impact of multiple satellite sensors lai on model estimates the effect of lai estimates from multiple satellite sensors on the calibration of fest ewb safy model has then been evaluated as all sensors data was used for calibration first a comparison among only satellite lai estimates is performed using l8 data as a baseline for l7 s2 and modis evaluation for both case studies areas for the capitanata tomato fields fig 4a the angular slope coefficient of 0 86 and a r2 of 0 87 are obtained when landsat 7 and 8 are compared while 0 73 and 0 89 respectively are found for l8 against sentinel 2 data thus showing that the lai estimates are weakly affected by the satellite type when these satellite estimates are compared with the modeled fest ewb safy lai fig 4b no relevant differences are observed among the different satellite data used a similar r2 of 0 82 and 0 86 is obtained for l8 and l7 respectively while a lower r2 of 0 73 for s2 which is computed over a higher number of data corresponding also to a higher spatial resolution than the other satellites the statistical indices are reported in table 3 where a rmse ranging in between 0 3 and 0 5 and the rrmse between 37 and 39 are obtained similar results are obtained for the maize fields of the chiese consortium fig 4c where a r2 of 0 88 is found when landsat 7 and 8 are compared while a value of 0 7 stands for l8 and sentinel 2 comparison confirming the smooth differences on satellites data and the advantage of using a combination of them for increasing the temporal frequency an opposite result is obtained for modis data which as expected has a lower agreement with landsat8 data reporting a r2 of 0 44 this is highly probably attributable to the low spatial resolution 250 m of modis in respect to the high resolution 30 m of l8 data fest ewb safy estimates of lai seem to be not influenced by the choice of the satellite information also in the maize field fig 4d in fact a r2 around 0 77 is found when compared against the high resolution satellite lai estimates as well as against the low resolution one this is mainly due to the homogeneity of the chiese consortium area in terms of cultivated crops as most of the plain area of lombardy region corbari et al 2015 these results are confirmed by the rmse and rrmse indices in table 3 3 2 model validation at local and irrigation consortium scales 3 2 1 fest ewb safy model validation at local scale the coupled fest ewb safy model was validated at field sites for both the tomato and maize crops against soil moisture and evapotranspiration measurements at the eddy covariance stations as well as in comparison to the observed yields provided by the farmers in the capitanata consortium results show a similar behavior between the observed and modeled daily sm and et estimates fig 5 sm values are reproduced with a rmse in between 0 11 and 0 15 table 2 either in the sandy soil field 2 2016 and in the silty clay one field 1 2016 which have extreme differences in soil infiltration properties very little rainfall is observed in both fields with the sm dynamic which is highly influenced by irrigation through the whole crop season the et dynamic shows increasing values during the crop growing phase followed by almost constant et values period and then a decreasing et phase during the senescence period before harvesting daily et estimates are reproduced with a rmse of 1 3 mm for the 2017 field sites where an almost complete series of observed data are available 95 of data over the season instead for field 1 in the year 2016 only 9 days of data are available over the whole season allowing a less reliable comparison with a higher rmse of 3 4 mm this lack of data is due to the eddy covariance technique and its theoretical assumption validity corbari et al 2021 no data is available for field 2 in 2016 tomato yield estimates are reproduced with a rmse value of 1 2 ton ha 1 in the north of italy in the chiese irrigation consortium the fest ewb safy model is also able to reproduce the observed soil moisture dynamic fig 5 over the three crop seasons especially following the irrigation events a rmse in between 0 09 and 0 13 table 2 is obtained unfortunately observed et are available only for the year 2016 due to station malfunctioning the fest ewb safy model reproduces the et dynamic with a rmse of 3 1 mm table 2 showing increasing et values as the crop lai grows and a decreasing et during the maize senescence maize yields are compared with observed data at their maximum harvest values showing a rmse of 1 5 ton ha 1 3 2 2 fest ewb safy model validation at rica stations against crop yield the fest ewb safy calibrated model has then been validated at several rica fields where crop yield data are available for tomatoes in the capitanata area and maize in the chiese area at the end of the crop season fig 6a presents the scatterplot of observed and simulated tomato yields considering all the available years 2014 2016 the model estimated yields with respect to the observed data have a slope of the linear regression equal to 0 97 a r2 of 0 8 a rmse of 13 4 ton ha 1 and rrmse of 13 3 in table 4 the statistical indices of mae and rmse are also reported for each separate year the model validation for the maize yields is shown in fig 6b reporting a slope of the linear regression between observed and modeled data equal to 0 66 a r2 of 0 6 a rmse of 1 4 ton ha 1 and a rrmse of 10 5 the statistical indices in table 4 confirm no significant differences among the analyzed years indicating insignificant dependencies of the results on the different yearly climatic conditions or crop and irrigation management these last results on maize are in line with the previously obtained ones with the original safy model battude et al 2016 while with higher variability among the different fields this might be related to the incompleteness of the observed rica database which lacks of sowing and harvesting dates and of the timing of the irrigation volume along the season 3 2 3 fest ewb safy model validation at consortium scale against satellite lai images and yield statistics the fest ewb safy maps of lai have then been validated pixel by pixel over the whole consortium area against observed lai from the combined temporal series of landsat 7 and 8 and sentinel 2 only the cultivated fields with tomatoes and maize are considered as the model crops parameters have been locally calibrated only for these plants an average areal pixel by pixel bias of 0 2 and a rmse around 1 1 table 5 are obtained for the capitanata area with a small variance among the different years while for chiese area an average areal pixel by pixel bias of 0 5 and a rmse of about 1 1 are found the lai maps presented in fig 7 show the simulated and landsat 7 and 8 measured values for the tomato fields of the capitanata consortium for some example dates of 2014 following the crop season the maps of the 5 may 2014 show low lai values mean 1 1 with a high standard deviation of 1 5 due to the different planting dates of tomatoes which is generally varying in this area between mid april to mid may in the 22 june date the tomatoes lai growing is clearly visible in both maps with mean and standard deviation values around 2 1 finally the 9 august maps reveal that lai has reached its maximum value in several fields with a smaller standard deviation as we approach the harvest date the differences among the fields are mainly due to the different planting dates of tomatoes as well as for different agronomic practices to quantify the agreement between observed and modeled lai a box plot is computed for each year fig 8 on each box the central mark indicates the median and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles respectively the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered outliers the results highlight the capability of the coupled fest ewb safy model in reproducing the observed lai even though showing a higher variability either in the low and high values range this might be due to the difficulties in correctly identifying the crop planting date which is then reflected on all the crop development due to the scarce temporal availability of satellite information which is in turn related to the low revisit time of the satellite data e g from 2014 to 2016 only landsat 7 and 8 data are available plus the cloud coverage regarding the chiese consortium in fig 9 as example images from the maize season of 2012 are compared the first maps of the 13 may from fest ewb safy and modis show the rapid maize biomass increase while the 12 june lai maps are in accordance with an almost fully developed maize at its maximum values in fig 8 the lai boxplots for each year are reported also for the chiese consortium the median values as well as the 25th and 75th percentiles are well in accordance between fest ewb safy and modis with the model having more sparse values when the crop is fully developed while the satellite data have a higher variability during the growing phase this might be due to the different maize cultivars e g for grain production or biogas as well as a different irrigation strategy in fact the use of the same hi value for all maize fields has been demonstrated to be not correct if stressed crops are considered hsiao et al 2009 for each pixel of the estimated lai from the coupled model a crop yield map is generated hence the modeled yield is compared with the observed yield at regional level obtained from the italian national statistics database in table 6 the observed average yearly fresh yield as ton ha 1 are reported for maize and tomatoes as well as the estimates from fest ewb safy which are computed as the average values over the simulated fields in the capitanata consortium a mean absolute bias of tomato yields over the years is equal to 6 3 ton ha 1 while the relative error is 7 3 instead over the chiese consortium the observed maize yield is reproduced with a mean absolute bias of 0 5 ton ha 1 and a relative error of 4 7 some of the obtained differences might be primarily due to the accuracy of the national statistical database where aggregated data are reported and being derived from farmers questionnaires moreover the data are referred to the administrative boundaries of i the province of brescia which covers almost all of the chiese consortium area but which extent further for ¾ of its area ii the province of foggia which covers almost the 95 of the capitanata consortium area another issue might be related to the correct identification of the cultivated crop areas of tomatoes and maize which is used as input to the fest ewb safy model lastly regarding the tomato yield estimates the coefficient of conversion between the computed dry biomass and the fresh yield may play a relevant role in model performances rinaldi et al 2011 4 discussion the results from this study demonstrate the ability of a coupled crop growth and energy water balance model to reproduce both the crop dynamic e g lai and yield and the land water and energy fluxes e g sm and et at regional as well as field scale this exclusively relying on satellite data of lai and lst besides meteorological data as calibration variables 4 1 comparison with previous studies the obtained results are in accordance with previous works in terms of accuracy in reproducing crops yields evapotranspiration and soil moisture at local field scale for example corbari et al 2021 applied the widely diffused aquacrop model steduto 2009 to the same tomato and maize fields analysed in this paper obtaining similar accuracy in model estimates moreover the present work contributes in demonstrating that for regional application there is the need of a multi objective calibration which is not only based on local ground measurements but also on distributed information in particular corbari and mancini 2014 corbari et al 2015 and corbari et al 2019a 2019b used remotely sensed lst for calibrating the parameters at pixel scale of the fest ewb energy water balance model showing its potentiality with respect to the traditional calibration with ground river discharge data crow et al 2003 showed that a calibration based on discharge and land surface temperature improves the estimates of monthly evapotranspiration with respect to a calibration based only on discharge lu et al 2021 showed that assimilating both remote sensing sm and lai into an agro hydrological model outperforms the results of using only sm or lai the strength of a pixel by pixel calibration lies in the ability of the coupled model to reproduce at regional level but at high spatial resolution the crop growth dynamic and its yield as well as the soil moisture and evapotranspiration dynamic in contrast if uniform parameters calibrated with site specific information are applied over extended areas the model capacity in reproducing observed data might be strongly reduced being especially not capable of detecting the spatial variability of the processes kang and ozdogan 2019 battude et al 2016 in fact the pixel by pixel calibration procedure allows to considers for a specific crop hybrid cultivar or different management technique e g mulch whereas the specific crops parameters are often unavailable jégo et al 2010 as well as to overcome low quality information on soil type or irrigation volumes morell et al 2016 moreover unlike most et models su 2002 kustas and norman 1999 which require satellite lst as an input variable and are thus heavily dependent on satellite data availability limited by clouds and satellite revisit time fest ewb computes lst as an internal variable and has physically based formulations for the components of the energy balance corbari et al 2011 this modelled lst has been used together with remotely sensed lst to calibrate hydrological models soil parameters corbari and mancini 2014 corbari et al 2020 instead of dedicated ground measurements 4 2 model limitations uncertainties in the model calibration might lie in satellite data accuracy and their spatial resolutions in fact spatial and spectral accuracy can cause data inconsistencies between the sentinel and landsat lai estimates fig 6 jin et al 2019 additional new data which can increase the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed lai thus further improves fest ewb safy accuracy might come from unmanned aerial vehicles at centimeters scale but with a reduced time frequency mccabe et al 2017 or space borne cubesats which can produce 3 m resolution vegetation data at sub daily resolution houborg and mccabe 2018 satellite lst data might be also affected by errors mainly due to the retrieval algorithm the definition of satellite lst over heterogeneous area the angle of view of the sensor and the surface emissivity sobrino et al 2015 1994 kustas et al 2004 another uncertainty might be due to the crop growth model hypotheses in fact the safy model has been developed for satellite data applications relying on a simple algorithm and a small number of parameters duchemin et al 2008 leading to possible lower accuracy at field scale in respect to more complex crop models jones et al 2003 ceres maize dyke et al 1986 stics brisson et al 2003 these lasts however due to the larger number of parameters which regulates the processes are much harder to apply with high accuracy over large areas 4 3 potential improvement in future studies reduction of model errors might be pursued by improving the calibration of the safy module pixel by pixel using the satellite lai data e g following the procedure developed for the fest ewb model with lst data allowing to better detect the different hybrids cultivars of the same crop which show some similarities and differences in model growth parameters model simulation uncertainties can be effectively constrained by using data assimilation techniques considering one or multiple variables this will help in detecting crops shocks not reproduced by the model e g different nitrogen rates hailstorm pest disease or also other anthropogenic effects several studies assimilated directly lai data wang et al 2013 chen et al 2018 or the fractional canopy cover linker and ilya 2017 for improving the crop growth dynamic or some studies have assimilated sm data from ground or remote sensing to improve soil moisture and et estimates zhang et al 2020a 2020b multiple data sources are assimilated by lei et al 2020 who assimilated of high resolution thermal and radar remote sensing into the tseb model retrievals for soil moisture monitoring in a drip irrigated vineyard or by lu et al 2021 who assimilated soil moisture and canopy cover to improve maize yield simulation 5 conclusions the main results of the study are 1 the development of the coupled crop energy water balance model fest ewb safy which allowed providing simultaneously estimates with high accuracy of lst sm et lai and crop yield continuously in time 1 h and distributed in space pixel based 2 the calibration of the coupled model parameters in a distributed way in each pixel independently one from the other by comparing modeled and satellite observed lst and lai data allowing to overcome the lack of detailed information at pixel scale e g planting date crop type irrigation management 3 the model calibration and validation has been done using completely independent variables allowing to verify multiple processes lst and lai during calibration et sm and yield in validation and not as it is traditionally done by splitting a single variable time series into two separate series one for calibration and one for validation looking at only one process the model has been applied in the maize and tomato cropping systems over two large areas in the north and south of italy the combined model was calibrated at consortium scale against remotely sensed lst in its soil parameters while the crop parameters have been calibrated against satellite lai and then was validated with sm and et at local scale and yield estimates at both local and regional scales moreover the crop growth model safy has been applied for the first time for simulating tomato crops at field scale lai is reproduced with a mean rmse of 0 92 and yield estimates with a rmse of 1 2 ton ha 1 daily soil moisture and evapotranspiration estimates are reproduced with a rmse in between 0 11 and 0 15 and of 1 3 mm respectively in respect to observed data for the maize crop lai is modeled with a rmse of 1 at field scale while a rmse of 1 5 ton ha 1 is obtained for crop yield estimates sm and et are also reproduced with a rmse in between 0 09 and 0 13 and of 3 1 mm respectively at the regional scale modelled and satellite lai estimates show low rmse values around 1 1 for the tomato fields of the capitanata consortium as well as for the maize fields of the chiese consortium simulated crop yields at consortium scale are in agreement with measured data at the rica fields with a rmse of 13 4 ton ha 1 and a rrmse of 13 3 for tomatoes while a rmse of 1 4 ton ha 1 and a rrmse of 10 5 are found for maize

9348,agricultural crop management requires extensive and comprehensive tools that allow for a full knowledge of the crops status and growth dynamic this study aims at estimating crop yield for maize and tomato crops over large areas at field scale for this purpose we developed a fully coupled model based on a parameter saving crop growth model simple algorithm for yield estimates safy with a water energy balance model flash flood event based spatially distributed rainfall runoff transformation energy water balance model fest ewb with a double exchange of leaf area index lai and soil moisture sm information both models are driven by remote sensing data and are calibrated independently from in situ measurements satellite lai data are used to calibrate the crop growth model parameters while the energy water balance parameters are calibrated against satellite land surface temperature lst data multiple satellite data are used either at high spatial resolution sentinel 2 and landsat 7 and 8 and at low resolution modis two italian case studies are selected to test the model accuracy the chiese irrigation consortium northern italy mainly devoted to maize crop cultivation and the capitanata irrigation consortium southern italy where tomatoes are largely diffused at local scale lai is reproduced for tomatoes with a mean rmse of 0 92 and yield with a rmse of 1 2 ton ha 1 while for maize a rmse of 1 is found for lai and a rmse of 1 5 ton ha 1 for yield results show an overall correspondence of daily soil moisture and evapotranspiration estimates with a rmse in between 0 11 and 0 15 and of 1 3 3 mm respectively at the regional scale lai estimates show a rmse around 1 1 for both case studies while a rmse of 13 4 ton ha 1 is obtained for tomato yield and of 1 4 ton ha 1 for maize keywords crop growth energy water balance remote sensing tomatoes and maize data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world s population is projected to increase to 8 5 billion by 2030 demanding for a substantial increase in both water and food which is expected to increase by 70 by 2050 simultaneously with the diet style quality increase thus improving crop production and water use management is a fundamental step to achieve sustainable food and water security alexandratos and bruinsma 2012 crop models are robust instruments for analyzing crop dynamics and yield while considering the relative impacts of agricultural practices including irrigation meteorological conditions and the energy and water cycles boote et al 2013 2008 a number of models have been developed over the years built on physical or empirical equations or a combination of both and involving a variable number of parameters estes et al 2013 these models differ one from the other in their complexity structure and calculation processes in how they water dynamics solar radiation impacts nutrients and carbon dioxide concentration steduto 2003 complex process based models governed by a large number of crop and soil parameters are available to study crops dynamic as dssat jones et al 2003 ceres maize dyke et al 1986 and stics brisson et al 2003 but these have a limited applicability over large areas due to data unavailability and uncertainty semi empirical approaches to reduce model complexity have been studied such as aquacrop steduto et al 2009 wofost supit et al 1994 or safy duchemin et al 2008 which have been show to provide accurate estimates of crop yield at field scale the combined use of remote sensing information with crop models allows the estimation of crop yield over larger areas at high spatial resolution as well as monitoring irrigation water needs battude et al 2017 morari et al 2021 li et al 2014 lu et al 2021 remotely sensed leaf area index lai or vegetation fraction fv are in fact able to accurately describe the crop evolution over time and space of different types of crops with high accuracy bsaibes et al 2009 claverie et al 2013 over the last few years simple regressions have also been developed to estimate crop yield from remotely sensed vegetation indices skakun et al 2019 moreover the development of land surface water energy balance schemes based on remotely sensed land surface temperature lst and or soil moisture sm as alexi anderson et al 1997 sebs su 2002 tseb kustas and norman 1999 sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 fest ewb corbari et al 2011 allow to estimate the evolution of evapotranspiration and or soil moisture over time at high spatial and temporal resolutions these land surface models coupled with crop growth models might provide new insight in the crop yield and biomass evolution along with the land water energy fluxes partitioning with an improved accuracy and allowing to compute also crop water needs or defining optimal irrigation management van den hoof et al 2011 song et al 2013 zhang et al 2020a 2020b liu et al 2016 included in the noah mp model a dynamic crop module for corn and soybean showing a good correspondence with observed data for lai and energy fluxes in the us steduto et al 2009 developed the aquacrop model for simulating the interaction between crop yield production and irrigation practices accounting for soil moisture dynamics battude et al 2017 improved the safy model by adding a crop coefficient based evapotranspiration computation to evaluate the irrigation water needs of maize in france 1 1 objectives in this context the objective of this paper is the development of a fully coupled model based on a low parameter crop growth model integrated with a water energy balance model with a double exchange of lai and sm information to estimate maize and tomato crop yields as well as soil moisture evapotranspiration and lai in particular the safy simple algorithm for yield estimate crop model duchemin et al 2008 has been integrated with the fest ewb energy water balance model flash flood event based spatially distributed rainfall runoff transformation energy water balance model corbari et al 2011 the sub objectives are i to evaluate the capability of the coupled model to estimate sm et lai yield at point scale as well as over the irrigation consortium area ii to calibrate the coupled model at pixel scale relying only on satellite information lai data to calibrate the inputs parameters derived from the safy model while the inputs parameters of the fest ewb energy water balance model against satellite lst the coupled fest ewb safy model will be validated by comparison with multi annual local measurements of soil moisture and evapotranspiration et data as well as crop yield data two case studies are selected to test model accuracy the chiese irrigation consortium area in the north of italy mainly devoted to maize crop cultivation and the capitanata irrigation consortium area in the south of italy characterized by a summer intensive cultivation of tomatoes and winter vegetables these areas are extremely different in climatic conditions crops types irrigation strategies and techniques multiple satellite data of both lai and lst are obtained at high spatial resolution from sentinel 2 and landsat 7 and 8 satellites as well as at low resolution from modis terra sensor ground based eddy covariance data of sm and et are available in different maize and tomato fields in both case studies as well as information on crop yields from farmers knowledge or national databases details in section 2 2 4 the main innovative aspects of this study are 1 coupling of a parsimonious crop growth model into a time continuous energy water balance model not based on lst as input data 2 a robust calibration independent from ground data which relies on a pixel wise comparison against lst and lai satellite images 3 model calibration and validation using completely independent variables allowing to verify multiple processes 4 the use of safy model to simulate tomato crop growth which it has never been used before 2 materials and methods 2 1 the fest ewb safy coupled model the fest ewb distributed hydrological model based on the system of water and energy balances equations has been fully coupled in two ways with the crop growth model safy the essence of this modeling coupling is that the safy model provides the leaf area index lai evolution through time which is then used by the fest ewb for computation of evapotranspiration fig 1 while the fest ewb model provides soil moisture sm to safy model which is used to compute the water stress to the crop growing the main variables of the coupled model are listed in table 1 including symbols meanings and units of measurement model calibration and evaluation have then been performed at two different scales local and regional the coupled model is calibrated against satellite data of lst and lai at pixel by pixel scale at the regional scale while it is then validated against yield data obtained from two italian national statistics databases with data for specific farms and aggregated per regional boundaries as well as at the local scale against a large database of in situ measurements of soil moisture land surface temperature and evapotranspiration which are available from field scale eddy covariance measurements while yield information is from farmers knowledge 2 1 1 the safy model the safy model simple algorithm for yield estimates is a parsimonious agronomical model that simulates the green area index gai and dry aboveground mass dam at a daily time step duchemin et al 2008 the model combines monteith s 1972 light use efficiency theory with a leaf partitioning function based on the maas 1993 formulation the safy model has been previously demonstrated to produce reliable estimates of dry biomass for wheat in semi arid regions duchemin et al 2008 2015 fieuzal et al 2011 as well for over irrigated or rainfed maize sunflower and soybean in the south west of france battude et al 2016 it has a set of 13 parameters 7 of which are to be calibrated the model does not require additional information about the agricultural practices the dam production is a function of the effective light use efficiency elue the daily temperature ta and the daily photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy apar eqs 1 3 where rg is the daily global incoming radiation ε c is the climatic efficiency and kext is the light extinction coefficient monsi and saeki 2005 the daily dam change is partitioned to the dry leaf biomass by the mean of the partition to leaf function pl eq 5 the gai is obtained by converting daily leaf mass production dam x pl into daily leaf area growth gai based on the specific leaf area sla eq 4 leaf senescence gai begins when the sum of temperature smt reaches a given threshold the sum of temperature for senescence stt which is calibrated based on remotely sensed lai it is modeled by a function based on the rate of senescence coefficient rs eqs 6 and 7 the crop yield can be obtained by multiplying the final dam value with a crop dependent harvest index hi eq 8 a full description of the model is available in duchemin et al 2008 1 dam elue x f t ta x apar 2 apar 1 e k ext

ffresh the coefficient of transformation between dry biomass and fresh yield is set as equal to 0 055 for tomatoes rinaldi et al 2011 the effect of the temperature on plant growth is considered with the f t t a eq 3 it is a classical polynomial of β degree defined by an optimal daily mean temperature topt and two extreme temperatures tmin and tmax which is usually set equal to 2 brisson et al 2003 all other agro environmental stress factors that could affect plant growth nitrogen diseases or water stress are supposed to be considered through the gai and the elue in the safy model alternative implementation of safy that includes a water budget module considering the evapotranspiration using the fao56 methodology has been suggested in duchemin et al 2015 when safy is coupled with fest ewb the vegetation growth might be limited by a linear temperature stress coefficient f t ta and a water stress coefficient kstress based on soil moisture hence eq 1 might be rewritten as 9 dam elue x f t ta x k stre ss sm xapar 10 k stress sm taw dr taw raw taw dr 1 p taw 11 taw fc wp dz 12 dr fc sm dz where taw is the total taw the total available soil water in the root zone mm fc the

that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress reduction in et occurs 0 1 dr root zone depletion mm the p coefficient is tabulated according to fao56 allen et al 1998 and applies for etc of about 5 mm day the value for p can be adjusted for different etc according to 13 p new p 0 04 5 etc where p is expressed as a fraction and etc as mm day 1 2 1 2 the fest ewb model the fest ewb flash flood event based spatially distributed rainfall runoff transformation energy water balance model is a time continuous distributed land surface energy water balance model corbari et al 2011 which computes all the main processes of the water land surface cycle fest ewb has been demonstrated to be able to simulate et and sm at local scale against eddy covariance stations measurements corbari et al 2011 as well as at irrigation consortium scale in comparison to satellite land surface temperature lst data considering also irrigation distribution corbari et al 2013 2020 and at catchment scale against remotely sensed lst and river discharge in the po and yangtze river basins corbari and mancini 2014 corbari et al 2019b fest ewb has also been used for smart irrigation management combined with remote sensing data and meteorological forecast in an asparagus field in southern italy corbari et al 2019a fest ewb resolves the system of the energy and water budget equations in each pixel of the analysed area searching for the representative equilibrium temperature ret as the land surface temperature that allows closing the energy balance equation the two energy and water balances equations are then connected by the evapotranspiration flux the system is calculated as 14 sm i j t 1 dz i j p i j r i j pe i j et i j r n i j g i j h i j l e i j 0 where sm i j is soil moisture p is precipitation rate mm h 1 r is runoff flux mm h 1 pe is drainage flux mm h 1 et is evapotranspiration rate mm h 1 z is the soil depth m rn wm 2 is the net radiation g wm 2 is the soil heat flux h wm 2 is the sensible heat flux while le wm 2 is the latent heat flux i and j are the pixel coordinates surface and subsurface river discharges are not computed being the analyzed case studies located into agricultural areas the latent heat fluxes which is the heat used in the phase change from a liquid to a gas is considered for bare soil les and of canopy lec are 15 l e c l e s f

pa ra is the aerodynamic resistance sm 1 which determines the transfer of heat and water vapour from the evapotranspirating surface into the air above the canopy correction functions for atmospheric stability or instability are included using the thom model thom 1975 the canopy resistance rc sm 1 which describes the resistance of vapour flow through the transpiring crop is expressed as jarvis

a t θ 2 3 33 5 the model requires as input all the meteorological variables air temperature and relative humidity solar radiation wind velocity and precipitation plus the irrigation amount the model parameters regulating the water and energy budgets are reported in table 1 2 1 3 calibration and validation procedure of the coupled model the coupled model has been calibrated and validated using independent variables allowing to verify multiple processes in fig 1 the strategy is shown firstly satellite data of lst are used at pixel scale over the whole area for soil parameters calibration then satellite lai are used for crop parameters calibration at local scale finally the validation step is based on local ground measures of et sm and yield as well as satellite lai for the whole area the procedure is described below in more detail the water and energy budget s parameters coming from the fest ewb model were calibrated pixel by pixel looking for the minimization of the root mean square error rmse between the simulated ret and the observed satellite lst in each single pixel based on the procedure developed by corbari and mancini 2014 where each single pixel parameter is tuned independently from the other pixels the model was then validated at local scale against soil moisture and evapotranspiration measurements this is feasible due to the fact that ret is an internal model variable directly linked to the latent and sensible heat fluxes as well as soil moisture condition hence thanks to this approach sm and et are improved at the pixel scale as well as globally the fest ewb model is initialized using literature suggested values for soil parameters according to the soil type these are then modified iteratively for each single pixel of the irrigation consortium regions by a percentage until the objective function tends toward zero the parameter values are always kept within their physical ranges for each soil class rawls and brakensiek 1985 in corbari and mancini 2022 the model has been extensively calibrated and validated for both consortia areas in its energy water balance components in particular in the capitanata consortium a pixel by pixel mae of 2 7 c is obtained between the remotely sensed lsts and the fest ewb rets over the calibration period 2014 and 2016 and a mae of 3 5 c in the validation years of 2017 2018 while of the chiese area a mae of 3 4 c is found for the calibration period between 2005 and 2011 and a value of 2 9 c for the validation period between 2011 and 2016 the safy crop growth parameters were calibrated against remotely observed lai data from all available sensors at the local scale where information on planting and harvesting dates are known as well as the type of crop cultivar the calibration has been done by tuning the model parameters values to minimize the differences between the modeled and observed variable battude et al 2016 the model has then been validated against local crop yield information as well as against satellite lai data over the whole analysed area some of crop specific parameters of table 1 εc tmin topt tmax β kext hi are fixed according to literature values for maize from battude et al 2016 while for tomatoes from der van ploeg and heuvelink 2005 the hi for the conversion from biomass to yield has been set equal to 0 5 as proposed by fao reference value steduto et al 2009 the calibrated parameters for soil and crop equations are reported in table 1 for both case studies model robustness is quantified through the mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse the relative root mean square error rrme which are computed as follows 18 mae i 1 n s i m i n 19 rmse i 1 n s i m i 2 n 20 r r m e i 1 n s i m i 2 n m where s i is the ith simulated variable mi is the ith measured variable n the sample size and m the average observed variable 2 2 case study and data the study is carried out in italy considering two different irrigation consortium areas the capitanata one located in the south of italy and the chiese one in the north of italy in the pianura padana area fig 2 these two case studies are profoundly different in terms of climate crops techniques and irrigation strategies these diversities will contribute to the demonstration of the robustness of the analysis the capitanata irrigation consortium with an area of about 50 000 ha is the largest area in the south of italy devoted to irrigated agriculture with a spring summer crop season when mainly wheat and tomatoes are cultivated italy is a world leading producer of processed tomatoes representing approximately 13 of the global production and 48 of europe s production and the apulia region produces more than half of italy s processing tomatoes seasonal volume of water used to irrigate processing tomato fields depends on the climatic trends it generally ranges between 4 000 and 6 000 m3 ha 1 the climate is characterized by hot dry summers and warm wet winters a pressurized water network pumping water from two reservoirs distributes irrigation on demand to the fields from april to october with a mean seasonal amount of 600 mm over a seasonal precipitation average of about 150 mm daily irrigation volumes over the whole consortium are available from 2013 to 2018 the fields are mainly irrigated with drip and micro sprinklers techniques the chiese irrigation consortium 20 000 ha in the north of italy is a highly irrigated area cultivated with summer crops such as maize and forage and winter wheat the irrigation is supplied through a dense channel network of 1400 km based on a priori fixed irrigation turn every between 7 ½ and 8 ½ days from april to september the surface irrigation technique is the most common one with a mean turn volume of about 100 mm over the crop season a mean rainfall of 250 mm is present while the average irrigation is 1200 mm 2 2 1 meteorological data the meteorological data used by the fest ewb safy model are precipitation air temperature and relative humidity incoming solar radiation and wind speed these data are available for both case studies by the stations of the official arpa networks of puglia and lombardia regions for the capitanata and chiese consortia respectively and from the private association meteonetwork fig 2 21 stations provided data at hourly time stamps from 2013 to 2018 for the capitanata area while 15 stations for the chiese one from 2005 to 2018 2 2 2 satellite data multiple satellites data are used for model calibration and validation in order to improve the model calibration accuracy multiple satellite data were combined overcoming the problems related to cloud cover as well as the limited revisit time of a single satellite thus lst data were retrieved from landsat 7 8 satellites at high spatial and low temporal resolutions and from the modis sensor on board terra and aqua satellites at low spatial and high temporal resolutions vegetation data are obtained from the same sensors plus the sentinel 2 data at high spatial resolution among all the images used during the analyzed period for the capitanata area a total amount of 40 sentinel 2 images are used 67 from landsat 8 and 63 from landsat 7 from 2014 to 2017 for the chiese area 3965 images from modis are analyzed 24 from landsat 8 and 21 from landsat 7 51 from sentinel 2 for the years from 2011 to 2018 all images in the visible and near infrared spectrum have been atmospherically corrected with 6 s landsat 8 case or sen2corr sentinel 2 case software to estimate the bottom of atmosphere reflectance and then following the procedure implemented in corbari et al 2020 the vegetation fraction fv is computed as gutman and ignatov 1998 while lai is then calculated as function of fv and the light extinction coefficient choudhury 1987 the leaf area index from modis data http ladsweb nascom nasa gov index html has been obtained from mod15a2 leaf area index product generated over an 8 day compositing period myneni et al 2002 through the fv images from july and august the maize and tomato crops areas were identified firstly by discriminating among bare soil and vegetated areas fv 0 05 in fact in the chiese consortium 95 of the area is cultivated with maize during the summer season while in the capitanata area during summer the only cultivated crop is tomatoes about 40 of the area istat 2018 for the capitanata consortium lst from landsat 7 and 8 are computed as described in skokovic et al 2017 and sobrino et al 1996 based on a single channel and split window algorithms for l7 and l8 respectively then the lst spatial resolution is further improved from 100 m l8 and 60 m l7 to 30 m using the nearest neighbor temperature sharpening algorithm skokovic 2017 daily lst data for the chiese consortium are obtained from the modis terra lst e daily l3 global 1 km grid product mod11a1 at a spatial resolution of 1 km which is then improved to 500 m following the disaggregation procedure for radiometric surface temperature distrad kustas et al 2003 2 2 3 local evapotranspiration and soil moisture data in both case studies different experimental fields are monitored with eddy covariance stations fig 2 allowing to measure among other variables evapotranspiration and soil moisture which are used for the model calibration and validation in the capitanata consortium three tomato fields are monitored two fields during 2016 in a silty clay and sandy soil and a field during 2017 while in the chiese consortium a single field has been monitored during the maize season from 2016 to 2018 station configuration instruments characteristics and eddy covariance data analysis are described in corbari et al 2020 and corbari and mancini 2021 in particular soil moisture measurements are performed by tdr time domain reflectometer sensors that have been installed at the depths of 15 cm in the tomato fields and at 45 cm in the maize ones for all the analyzed fields the dates of the irrigation events and the water volumes are known 2 2 4 crop yield data three different levels of crop yield data are used for model validation both at local and regional scales local yield data are available from the farmers knowledge for the experimental tomato and maize fields of both case studies where the eddy covariance stations are installed crop yield data are also available from the farm accountancy data network fadn database which collects annual surveys at european level by liaison agencies of each state member of the european commission european commission 2021 the italian dataset come from the rete di informazione contabile agricola rica farms the dataset mainly intended for agricultural economic studies also includes physical data as the crop yield at farm level the irrigated land and the water used for irrigation measured on a volume basis m3 ha 1 in the capitanata consortium data of 264 plots from 117 farms have been extracted for the years from 2014 to 2016 the average tomato fresh yield was 92 4 ton ha 1 higher than the average value observed in the literature 65 95 ton ha 1 with a variability related to the zone and tomatoes variety for the chiese consortium a sample of 100 farms was considered from 2011 to 2018 an average crop yield of 12 7 ton ha 1 is found which is in line with the average value of 12 5 ton ha 1 in northern italy regional yield estimates are then available from the italian national statistics institute istat website https www istat it it agricoltura dati this dataset provides aggregated information of total yield and cultivated hectare of tomato crops for the province of foggia in puglia region where the capitanata consortium is located and of maize of brescia province in the lombardia region which partially covers the chiese consortium 2 2 5 soil type information soil characteristics are accessible from the regional datasets of regione puglia http www sit puglia it portal sit portal for the capitanata consortium and of regione lombardia http www cartografia regione lombardia it rlregisdownload for the chiese consortium information on the different soil classes according to the usda triangle allows estimation of the soil hydraulic properties used as input of the fest ewb model according to rawls and brakensiek 1985 the active soil depth involved in the water cycle computation and relevant for the evapotranspiration process is initially set to be equal to 0 5 m in the capitanata consortium being representative of the root development zone of the most diffuse fresh vegetable in the area while a value of 1 2 m in the chiese consortium as significant for maize roots the main soil parameters are indicated for both case studies after the fest ewb safy model calibration in table 1 3 results 3 1 model calibration at local and irrigation consortium scales 3 1 1 calibration of crop parameters at eddy covariance stations sites the coupled fest ewb safy model was first calibrated for crop parameters at field sites for both tomato and maize crops against remotely sensed lai in the capitanata consortium over the three analyzed tomato fields the simulated leaf area index is following the temporal dynamic of the measured lai from sentinel 2 landsat 7 and 8 data over the 3 years throughout the whole growing and senescence periods fig 3a a mean r2 of 0 83 and a rmse of 0 92 are obtained with a high consistency among the different analyzed fields table 2 it is interesting to note the difference in lai data among the 2016 field 1 and 2016 field 2 and 2017 being the second field cultivated with a different variety of tomatoes in the chiese irrigation consortium for the experimental field over the three monitored years the lai is reproduced by fest ewb safy with a mean r2 of 0 79 and a rmse of 1 with respect to the measured satellite data with a high consistency between the years table 2 catching also the temporal dynamic over the whole crop season from sowing to harvest fig 3b shows the results for the three years of data the obtained parameters are reported in table 1 being the values comparable with literature ones battude et al 2016 each field has been calibrated independently one from the other but to extend the analysis at basin scale mean values of the crops parameters are then considered 3 1 1 1 impact of multiple satellite sensors lai on model estimates the effect of lai estimates from multiple satellite sensors on the calibration of fest ewb safy model has then been evaluated as all sensors data was used for calibration first a comparison among only satellite lai estimates is performed using l8 data as a baseline for l7 s2 and modis evaluation for both case studies areas for the capitanata tomato fields fig 4a the angular slope coefficient of 0 86 and a r2 of 0 87 are obtained when landsat 7 and 8 are compared while 0 73 and 0 89 respectively are found for l8 against sentinel 2 data thus showing that the lai estimates are weakly affected by the satellite type when these satellite estimates are compared with the modeled fest ewb safy lai fig 4b no relevant differences are observed among the different satellite data used a similar r2 of 0 82 and 0 86 is obtained for l8 and l7 respectively while a lower r2 of 0 73 for s2 which is computed over a higher number of data corresponding also to a higher spatial resolution than the other satellites the statistical indices are reported in table 3 where a rmse ranging in between 0 3 and 0 5 and the rrmse between 37 and 39 are obtained similar results are obtained for the maize fields of the chiese consortium fig 4c where a r2 of 0 88 is found when landsat 7 and 8 are compared while a value of 0 7 stands for l8 and sentinel 2 comparison confirming the smooth differences on satellites data and the advantage of using a combination of them for increasing the temporal frequency an opposite result is obtained for modis data which as expected has a lower agreement with landsat8 data reporting a r2 of 0 44 this is highly probably attributable to the low spatial resolution 250 m of modis in respect to the high resolution 30 m of l8 data fest ewb safy estimates of lai seem to be not influenced by the choice of the satellite information also in the maize field fig 4d in fact a r2 around 0 77 is found when compared against the high resolution satellite lai estimates as well as against the low resolution one this is mainly due to the homogeneity of the chiese consortium area in terms of cultivated crops as most of the plain area of lombardy region corbari et al 2015 these results are confirmed by the rmse and rrmse indices in table 3 3 2 model validation at local and irrigation consortium scales 3 2 1 fest ewb safy model validation at local scale the coupled fest ewb safy model was validated at field sites for both the tomato and maize crops against soil moisture and evapotranspiration measurements at the eddy covariance stations as well as in comparison to the observed yields provided by the farmers in the capitanata consortium results show a similar behavior between the observed and modeled daily sm and et estimates fig 5 sm values are reproduced with a rmse in between 0 11 and 0 15 table 2 either in the sandy soil field 2 2016 and in the silty clay one field 1 2016 which have extreme differences in soil infiltration properties very little rainfall is observed in both fields with the sm dynamic which is highly influenced by irrigation through the whole crop season the et dynamic shows increasing values during the crop growing phase followed by almost constant et values period and then a decreasing et phase during the senescence period before harvesting daily et estimates are reproduced with a rmse of 1 3 mm for the 2017 field sites where an almost complete series of observed data are available 95 of data over the season instead for field 1 in the year 2016 only 9 days of data are available over the whole season allowing a less reliable comparison with a higher rmse of 3 4 mm this lack of data is due to the eddy covariance technique and its theoretical assumption validity corbari et al 2021 no data is available for field 2 in 2016 tomato yield estimates are reproduced with a rmse value of 1 2 ton ha 1 in the north of italy in the chiese irrigation consortium the fest ewb safy model is also able to reproduce the observed soil moisture dynamic fig 5 over the three crop seasons especially following the irrigation events a rmse in between 0 09 and 0 13 table 2 is obtained unfortunately observed et are available only for the year 2016 due to station malfunctioning the fest ewb safy model reproduces the et dynamic with a rmse of 3 1 mm table 2 showing increasing et values as the crop lai grows and a decreasing et during the maize senescence maize yields are compared with observed data at their maximum harvest values showing a rmse of 1 5 ton ha 1 3 2 2 fest ewb safy model validation at rica stations against crop yield the fest ewb safy calibrated model has then been validated at several rica fields where crop yield data are available for tomatoes in the capitanata area and maize in the chiese area at the end of the crop season fig 6a presents the scatterplot of observed and simulated tomato yields considering all the available years 2014 2016 the model estimated yields with respect to the observed data have a slope of the linear regression equal to 0 97 a r2 of 0 8 a rmse of 13 4 ton ha 1 and rrmse of 13 3 in table 4 the statistical indices of mae and rmse are also reported for each separate year the model validation for the maize yields is shown in fig 6b reporting a slope of the linear regression between observed and modeled data equal to 0 66 a r2 of 0 6 a rmse of 1 4 ton ha 1 and a rrmse of 10 5 the statistical indices in table 4 confirm no significant differences among the analyzed years indicating insignificant dependencies of the results on the different yearly climatic conditions or crop and irrigation management these last results on maize are in line with the previously obtained ones with the original safy model battude et al 2016 while with higher variability among the different fields this might be related to the incompleteness of the observed rica database which lacks of sowing and harvesting dates and of the timing of the irrigation volume along the season 3 2 3 fest ewb safy model validation at consortium scale against satellite lai images and yield statistics the fest ewb safy maps of lai have then been validated pixel by pixel over the whole consortium area against observed lai from the combined temporal series of landsat 7 and 8 and sentinel 2 only the cultivated fields with tomatoes and maize are considered as the model crops parameters have been locally calibrated only for these plants an average areal pixel by pixel bias of 0 2 and a rmse around 1 1 table 5 are obtained for the capitanata area with a small variance among the different years while for chiese area an average areal pixel by pixel bias of 0 5 and a rmse of about 1 1 are found the lai maps presented in fig 7 show the simulated and landsat 7 and 8 measured values for the tomato fields of the capitanata consortium for some example dates of 2014 following the crop season the maps of the 5 may 2014 show low lai values mean 1 1 with a high standard deviation of 1 5 due to the different planting dates of tomatoes which is generally varying in this area between mid april to mid may in the 22 june date the tomatoes lai growing is clearly visible in both maps with mean and standard deviation values around 2 1 finally the 9 august maps reveal that lai has reached its maximum value in several fields with a smaller standard deviation as we approach the harvest date the differences among the fields are mainly due to the different planting dates of tomatoes as well as for different agronomic practices to quantify the agreement between observed and modeled lai a box plot is computed for each year fig 8 on each box the central mark indicates the median and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles respectively the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered outliers the results highlight the capability of the coupled fest ewb safy model in reproducing the observed lai even though showing a higher variability either in the low and high values range this might be due to the difficulties in correctly identifying the crop planting date which is then reflected on all the crop development due to the scarce temporal availability of satellite information which is in turn related to the low revisit time of the satellite data e g from 2014 to 2016 only landsat 7 and 8 data are available plus the cloud coverage regarding the chiese consortium in fig 9 as example images from the maize season of 2012 are compared the first maps of the 13 may from fest ewb safy and modis show the rapid maize biomass increase while the 12 june lai maps are in accordance with an almost fully developed maize at its maximum values in fig 8 the lai boxplots for each year are reported also for the chiese consortium the median values as well as the 25th and 75th percentiles are well in accordance between fest ewb safy and modis with the model having more sparse values when the crop is fully developed while the satellite data have a higher variability during the growing phase this might be due to the different maize cultivars e g for grain production or biogas as well as a different irrigation strategy in fact the use of the same hi value for all maize fields has been demonstrated to be not correct if stressed crops are considered hsiao et al 2009 for each pixel of the estimated lai from the coupled model a crop yield map is generated hence the modeled yield is compared with the observed yield at regional level obtained from the italian national statistics database in table 6 the observed average yearly fresh yield as ton ha 1 are reported for maize and tomatoes as well as the estimates from fest ewb safy which are computed as the average values over the simulated fields in the capitanata consortium a mean absolute bias of tomato yields over the years is equal to 6 3 ton ha 1 while the relative error is 7 3 instead over the chiese consortium the observed maize yield is reproduced with a mean absolute bias of 0 5 ton ha 1 and a relative error of 4 7 some of the obtained differences might be primarily due to the accuracy of the national statistical database where aggregated data are reported and being derived from farmers questionnaires moreover the data are referred to the administrative boundaries of i the province of brescia which covers almost all of the chiese consortium area but which extent further for ¾ of its area ii the province of foggia which covers almost the 95 of the capitanata consortium area another issue might be related to the correct identification of the cultivated crop areas of tomatoes and maize which is used as input to the fest ewb safy model lastly regarding the tomato yield estimates the coefficient of conversion between the computed dry biomass and the fresh yield may play a relevant role in model performances rinaldi et al 2011 4 discussion the results from this study demonstrate the ability of a coupled crop growth and energy water balance model to reproduce both the crop dynamic e g lai and yield and the land water and energy fluxes e g sm and et at regional as well as field scale this exclusively relying on satellite data of lai and lst besides meteorological data as calibration variables 4 1 comparison with previous studies the obtained results are in accordance with previous works in terms of accuracy in reproducing crops yields evapotranspiration and soil moisture at local field scale for example corbari et al 2021 applied the widely diffused aquacrop model steduto 2009 to the same tomato and maize fields analysed in this paper obtaining similar accuracy in model estimates moreover the present work contributes in demonstrating that for regional application there is the need of a multi objective calibration which is not only based on local ground measurements but also on distributed information in particular corbari and mancini 2014 corbari et al 2015 and corbari et al 2019a 2019b used remotely sensed lst for calibrating the parameters at pixel scale of the fest ewb energy water balance model showing its potentiality with respect to the traditional calibration with ground river discharge data crow et al 2003 showed that a calibration based on discharge and land surface temperature improves the estimates of monthly evapotranspiration with respect to a calibration based only on discharge lu et al 2021 showed that assimilating both remote sensing sm and lai into an agro hydrological model outperforms the results of using only sm or lai the strength of a pixel by pixel calibration lies in the ability of the coupled model to reproduce at regional level but at high spatial resolution the crop growth dynamic and its yield as well as the soil moisture and evapotranspiration dynamic in contrast if uniform parameters calibrated with site specific information are applied over extended areas the model capacity in reproducing observed data might be strongly reduced being especially not capable of detecting the spatial variability of the processes kang and ozdogan 2019 battude et al 2016 in fact the pixel by pixel calibration procedure allows to considers for a specific crop hybrid cultivar or different management technique e g mulch whereas the specific crops parameters are often unavailable jégo et al 2010 as well as to overcome low quality information on soil type or irrigation volumes morell et al 2016 moreover unlike most et models su 2002 kustas and norman 1999 which require satellite lst as an input variable and are thus heavily dependent on satellite data availability limited by clouds and satellite revisit time fest ewb computes lst as an internal variable and has physically based formulations for the components of the energy balance corbari et al 2011 this modelled lst has been used together with remotely sensed lst to calibrate hydrological models soil parameters corbari and mancini 2014 corbari et al 2020 instead of dedicated ground measurements 4 2 model limitations uncertainties in the model calibration might lie in satellite data accuracy and their spatial resolutions in fact spatial and spectral accuracy can cause data inconsistencies between the sentinel and landsat lai estimates fig 6 jin et al 2019 additional new data which can increase the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed lai thus further improves fest ewb safy accuracy might come from unmanned aerial vehicles at centimeters scale but with a reduced time frequency mccabe et al 2017 or space borne cubesats which can produce 3 m resolution vegetation data at sub daily resolution houborg and mccabe 2018 satellite lst data might be also affected by errors mainly due to the retrieval algorithm the definition of satellite lst over heterogeneous area the angle of view of the sensor and the surface emissivity sobrino et al 2015 1994 kustas et al 2004 another uncertainty might be due to the crop growth model hypotheses in fact the safy model has been developed for satellite data applications relying on a simple algorithm and a small number of parameters duchemin et al 2008 leading to possible lower accuracy at field scale in respect to more complex crop models jones et al 2003 ceres maize dyke et al 1986 stics brisson et al 2003 these lasts however due to the larger number of parameters which regulates the processes are much harder to apply with high accuracy over large areas 4 3 potential improvement in future studies reduction of model errors might be pursued by improving the calibration of the safy module pixel by pixel using the satellite lai data e g following the procedure developed for the fest ewb model with lst data allowing to better detect the different hybrids cultivars of the same crop which show some similarities and differences in model growth parameters model simulation uncertainties can be effectively constrained by using data assimilation techniques considering one or multiple variables this will help in detecting crops shocks not reproduced by the model e g different nitrogen rates hailstorm pest disease or also other anthropogenic effects several studies assimilated directly lai data wang et al 2013 chen et al 2018 or the fractional canopy cover linker and ilya 2017 for improving the crop growth dynamic or some studies have assimilated sm data from ground or remote sensing to improve soil moisture and et estimates zhang et al 2020a 2020b multiple data sources are assimilated by lei et al 2020 who assimilated of high resolution thermal and radar remote sensing into the tseb model retrievals for soil moisture monitoring in a drip irrigated vineyard or by lu et al 2021 who assimilated soil moisture and canopy cover to improve maize yield simulation 5 conclusions the main results of the study are 1 the development of the coupled crop energy water balance model fest ewb safy which allowed providing simultaneously estimates with high accuracy of lst sm et lai and crop yield continuously in time 1 h and distributed in space pixel based 2 the calibration of the coupled model parameters in a distributed way in each pixel independently one from the other by comparing modeled and satellite observed lst and lai data allowing to overcome the lack of detailed information at pixel scale e g planting date crop type irrigation management 3 the model calibration and validation has been done using completely independent variables allowing to verify multiple processes lst and lai during calibration et sm and yield in validation and not as it is traditionally done by splitting a single variable time series into two separate series one for calibration and one for validation looking at only one process the model has been applied in the maize and tomato cropping systems over two large areas in the north and south of italy the combined model was calibrated at consortium scale against remotely sensed lst in its soil parameters while the crop parameters have been calibrated against satellite lai and then was validated with sm and et at local scale and yield estimates at both local and regional scales moreover the crop growth model safy has been applied for the first time for simulating tomato crops at field scale lai is reproduced with a mean rmse of 0 92 and yield estimates with a rmse of 1 2 ton ha 1 daily soil moisture and evapotranspiration estimates are reproduced with a rmse in between 0 11 and 0 15 and of 1 3 mm respectively in respect to observed data for the maize crop lai is modeled with a rmse of 1 at field scale while a rmse of 1 5 ton ha 1 is obtained for crop yield estimates sm and et are also reproduced with a rmse in between 0 09 and 0 13 and of 3 1 mm respectively at the regional scale modelled and satellite lai estimates show low rmse values around 1 1 for the tomato fields of the capitanata consortium as well as for the maize fields of the chiese consortium simulated crop yields at consortium scale are in agreement with measured data at the rica fields with a rmse of 13 4 ton ha 1 and a rrmse of 13 3 for tomatoes while a rmse of 1 4 ton ha 1 and a rrmse of 10 5 are found for maize

9349,the introduction of heavy metals from wastewater irrigation to the soil crop human biological domain has become a vital environmental and human health challenge we evaluated the impact of wastewater irrigation ww on the severity of heavy metal pollution and health risk potential in different vegetables under ww versus fresh water fw irrigation a multifaceted assessment was conducted using the pollution index pi ecological risk er bio concentration factor bcf hazard quotient hq overall hazard index hi carcinogenic risk cr the bio concentration factor bcf and total carcinogenic risk tcr the findings revealed that ww irrigation increased metal concentrations across all soil samples and vegetables in the order of cd zn pb cu and zn cu pb cd respectively the pi and er indices indicated a significant increase of 27 330 and 260 310 respectively in the ww irrigated soils compared to the fw irrigated soils the heavy metals concentrations in the edible tissues of vegetables and their associated bcf values under ww irrigation exhibited the orders zn cu pb cd and zn cu cd pb respectively cabbage had the greatest potential to take up heavy metals compared with other crops the mean hq and hi were in the low risk category 0 1 hq and hi 1 likewise cr and tcr values were within acceptable limits 1 00e 06 1 00e 04 by consuming veggies produced with ww to children and adults implying that there are no significant health risks to local inhabitants however the levels of hq hi cr and tcr were significantly higher in vegetables grown with ww than in those irrigated with fw suggesting that wastewater irrigation may have a detrimental impact on human health keywords heavy metal health risk assessment soil health fresh water vegetable wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater ww reuse for irrigation can potentially reduce the dependency to freshwater resources particularly in water limited climates where growers access to freshwater is challenged by population growth and climate change the use of wastewater for crop irrigation can help to maintain production jahany and rezapour 2020 the current global production of wastewater is approximately 380 billion m3 per year which is expected to increase by 24 by 2030 and 51 by 2050 qadir et al 2020 with an annual rate of 159 billion m3 asia is the largest ww producer accounting for 42 of all urban wastewater generated globally followed by north america 67 billion m3 and europe 68 billion m3 qadir et al 2020 around 200 million hectares of farmland area is irrigated with either untreated or treated wastewater in over 50 nations around the world almost 10 of the world s population receives crops grown through ww irrigation united nations 2018 farmers are encouraged to utilize ww on croplands for a variety of environmental and economic reasons especially in urban and sub urban areas according to several studies ww irrigation can improve soil fertility and agricultural productivity by increasing nitrogen phosphorous potassium and trace metals cu mn fe and zn inputs mendoza espinosa et al 2008 tahtouh et al 2019 long term continuous ww irrigation on the other hand may cause certain unintended damages to soil health over time excessive accumulation of dissolved salts runoff generation and soil erosion due to surface sealing and heavy metal contamination are among the potential agronomic health and environmental risks qadir et al 2020 obiri nyarko et al 2021 such deteriorations in soil environment can lead to the reduced crop yields plant cover soil health and production efficiency however the extent of risk is generally assessed by the origin of ww level of purification type and concentration of toxic components application rate and frequency and soil type heavy metals have been identified as leading threats to soil quality and sustainability rezapour et al 2018 and 2019 these metals are referred to as omnipresent environmental pollutants because they are neither biodegradable nor leachable thereby exhausting soil resources interfering with plant development and declining crop yields mazurek et al 2017 qiu et al 2021 as a result heavy metal concentrations distribution destiny effect and origins have piqued interest in both natural and agricultural ecosystems around the world heavy metals often exist in wastewater and frequent irrigation with ww may lead to metal buildup in soils and crops rezapour et al 2019 consumption of crops and vegetables produced in heavy metal polluted soil can leads to a variety of health issues including blood pressure fluctuations liver lungs and renal malfunction and immune system insufficiency ming ho 2005 in spite of the fact that with shrinking freshwater resources tendency toward using wastewater for irrigation is growing the ecological impact of long term wastewater induced heavy metal accumulation in farmlands and its intrusion into food chain is not well understood the dearth of information is even more notable regarding the calcareous soils calcareous soils are characterized with high levels of calcium carbonate content and basic saturation with a ph ranging near neutral to alkaline calcareous soils occupy almost one third of the earth s terrestrial surface marschner 1995 brady and weil 2016 they have a strong buffering capacity for stabilizing heavy metals kabata pendias 2010 that generally leads to the liberation of wastewater application however long term wastewater irrigation can irreversibly damage the buffering capability of calcareous soil to immobilize and pacify the heavy metals ma et al 2021 resulting in the transformation of calcareous cropland from a sink to source of metals accordingly increased number of geographically representative investigations can yield more reliable information to better support the remediation decisions and to develop ecologically sustainable wastewater irrigation management systems the study region isin a calcareous semi arid environment in urmia northwestern iran farmlands are in close proximity to various small and medium sized services and industries e g food processors cold storage dyeing facilities metal plating etc whose effluents and wastes make their way directly or indirectly into the agricultural lands furthermore large volumes of sewage initiated from residential areas and service centers in suburban urmia are disposed to the margins of the regional farmlands therefore this area is exposed to threat and degradation by anthropogenic processes most of the previous studies were focused merely on soil physicochemical alterations or heavy metal levels and modifications in ww irrigated soils aydin et al 2015 abegunrin et al 2016 jahany and rezapour 2020 however there is relatively limited research on the ecological risk and distribution of heavy metals in the soil vegetable systems furthermore no thorough data on the health risk of ww initiated heavy metals is available for residents the objectives of this research were to 1 investigate the accumulation and concentration of heavy metals in water soil and edible tissues of lettuce cabbage green beans and pepper grown in wastewater and freshwater irrigated croplands 2 determine how ww irrigation may affect the ecological health as surrogated by pollution index ecological risk and bcf of zn cu cd ni and pb 3 determine the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks associated with heavy metal buildup in vegetables irrigated with ww 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the research was conducted in urmia city 45º05 to 45º08 e and 37º32 to 37º38 n located in northwestern iran fig 1 according to the local growers wastewater ww irrigation has been a common practice in the region for over five decades the study region has a semi arid mediterranean climate with cold winters and hot summers the mean annual rainfall and temperature are 330 mm and 13 c respectively the experimental sites were allocated within the green bean cabbage pepper and lettuce vegetable fields the growing season for the vegetable cropping systems generally extends from april to september the wastewater is generated from municipal household and local industries in urmia city and applied directly by local farmers through flood irrigation technique without any preprocessing 2 2 soil and crop sampling within a total of six farms covering an area of 12 ha 36 pairs of composite soil samples 6 samples per farm were collected randomly from the ww irrigated and the adjacent freshwater fw irrigated sites each composite soil sample was a mixture of five sub samples collected from 0 to 50 cm soil depth wastewater and freshwater samples used for irrigation were also collected from each experimental farm for each of the six farms study areas within ww and fw treatments were selected on the portion of lands with similar slope land use physiographic unit and soil type so that the results could be comparable therefore differences in the values of soil heavy metals hms content and ecological risk indices between the ww irrigated and fw irrigated sites were primarily due to the irrigation water effects at maturity edible parts of green beans phaseolus vulgaris cabbage brassica oleracea peppers capsicum annuum l and lettuce lactuca sativa l were collected from both ww and fw treatment areas of each field 2 3 laboratory analysis the chemical properties of ww and fw water samples were determined as outlined by eaton et al 1995 using the standard methods all soil samples were analyzed for particle size distribution ph electrical conductivity ec calcium carbonate equivalent cce organic carbon oc and cation exchange capacity cec klute and page 1996 to extract the total content of zn cu cd and pb the soil samples were processed in strong nitric acid 4 m hno3 soon and abboud 1993 the edible parts of the vegetables were washed in double distilled water and dried at 70 ºc in a drying oven tissue samples were crushed separately using a steel grinder and passed through a1 mm sieve 100 mesh for subsequent examination all of the samples were stored in clean plastic bags at room temperature one gram of powdered vegetable samples were washed at 500 c for 12 h extracted with 2 m hcl and filtered by a centrifuge to quantify the heavy metals content ryan et al 2001 the concentration of zn cu cd and pb in ww fw soil and crop samples were analyzed using shimadzu aa 6300 the certified standard solutions 1000 mg l 1 merck germany of all five metals were applied as a stock solution for instrument standardization 2 4 pollution indices and bioaccumulation factor the soil pollution index pi was calculated using eq 1 liu et al 2005 1 pi c p c b where cp and cb are the heavy metal concentration values in the ww irrigated soil and the fw control respectively the ecological risk index er was calculated as the sum of the risk factor of the heavy metals using eqs 2 and 3 hakanson 1980 2 er i n e i 3 ei tipi where ei denotes the monomial ecological risk factor and ti is the toxicity response coefficient of heavy metals considered as zn 1 cd 30 and cu and pb 5 5 for cu and pb hakanson 1980 the er is the sum of the all four risk factors for heavy metals which were grouped into four categories as low potential ecological risk er 50 modest risk to the environment 50 er 100 considerable risk to the environment 100 er 200 and strong risk to the environmental er 200 hakanson 1980 the bio concentration factor bcf was assessed using eq 4 to assess the migration potential of heavy metals from soil to the edible portion of the study vegetables kabata pendias 2010 rezapour et al 2019 4 bcf c crop c soil where ccrop and csoil represent the concentrations of heavy metals in the vegetables edible portion on dry weight basis and soil respectively 2 5 health risk assessment chronic daily intake cdi of a metal was estimated as follow us epa 2004 5 cdi c m c f d fi bw where cm is the heavy metal concentration in vegetables mg kg 1 cf is conversion factor of 0 085 dfi is the daily intake of vegetables with 0 232 and 0 345 kg day 1 for children and adults respectively and bw is the mean body weight 32 7 and 55 9 kg for children and adults the following equations were used to determine the hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi representing the non carcinogenic risk during a lifetime for each metal and the overall potential non carcinogenic impacts respectively 6 hq cdi rfd 7 hi i n hq where rfd is the highest tolerable heavy metal ingestion for humans on a daily basis mg kg 1 day 1 the rfd value is 0 3 0 04 0 001 and 0 04 mg kg 1 day 1 for zn cu cd and pb respectively hq and hi 1 indicate no potential non carcinogenic effect while hq and hi 1 indicate the possibility of non carcinogenic effect using eq 8 carcinogenic risk cr was also assessed to determine the cancer risk for individuals over a lifetime because of their exposure to a carcinogenic metal rais 2017 8 cr cdi sf the sf is the slope factor the case of 1 10 6 cr 1 10 4 is considered acceptable risk while cr 1 10 4 carries potential carcinogenic risk 2 6 statistical analysis the descriptive statistics including maximum minimum average standard deviation and pearson correlation were calculated for soil and plant data in microsoft excel and spss 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa the means of heavy metal concentration values obtained from soils and plant analyses were compared between the ww irrigated soils and the fw irrigated soils using the paired t test 3 results and discussion 3 1 ww and fw characteristics the results of the chemical analysis for ww and fw control are presented in table 1 the values of chemical properties were significantly p 0 05 different between ww and fw except for ph the mean value of ec for ww was 2 4 foldhigher than fw resulting in increased salt concentration and osmotic tension in the soil irrigated with ww rezapour et al 2019 likewise n and p concentrations were above their recommended limits who fao 2001 which may result in a positive effect on soil fertility in farms irrigated with ww similarly cu and cd concentration of ww were above their maximum admissible limits who fao 2001 for irrigation practices this may be explained by the chemicals that are released from industrial units in surrounding urban and suburban areas and discharged into the wastewater rezapour et al 2019 3 2 baseline characteristics of the study soil as shown in table 2 soil sand content ranged from 12 4 to 83 3 with a mean value of 50 silt particles ranged from 7 2 to 55 with a mean content of 35 6 and clay particles had a range of 5 8 50 1 with a mean content 23 4 variable rates of soil particles resulted in a range of soil textural classes from loam comprising 47 of the total soil samples to clay loam comprising 25 of the total samples the entire study area is characterized by strongly calcareous and alkaline soils as represented by high ph a mean value 7 5 and calcium carbonate equivalent mean value 15 gregorich et al 2001 soil ec ranged between 0 2 and 3 42 ds m 1 and with a standard deviation of 74 3 showed a large variability across the study soils however all soil samples were non saline similar to other soil properties a large variation was found in soil organic matter which ranged from 0 64 to 3 85 and with an average of 1 6 suggesting poor 0 6 1 to very strong 3 soil organic matter content hazelton and murphy 2016 wu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 the mean values of cec values were within the range of 8 5 34 4 cmol kg 1 placing samples in the low 12 25 cmol kg 1 to high 25 40 cmol kg 1 cec ranges hazelton and murphy 2016 except for ph the coefficient of variation cv for all measured soil properties was greater than 35 implying a high variability across the study area wilding and dress 1983 based on the wrb system iuss working group and wrb 2015 and the key to soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 all farm soils were classified as cambisols and inceptisols respectively 3 3 soil heavy metals the magnitude of heavy metals concentrations in the soils with ww irrigation followed the order of zn 53 2 91 5 mg kg 1 pb 30 1 73 1 mg kg 1 cu 28 4 38 36 mg kg 1 cd 2 43 6 83 mg kg 1 table 2 all soil heavy metals had relatively high coefficient of variations cv 20 in the order of cd pb zn cu table 2 implying that a considerable part of the metals has anthropogenic origins irrigation by ww resulted in a significant build up of zn cu cd and pb compared with soil irrigated with fw fig 2 depending on the farm site an average increase of 29 360 in heavy metals was observed under ww irrigated compared with fw irrigated soils the greatest increase 220 360 was found for cd followed by zn 74 6 117 6 pb 43 71 4 and cu 29 54 3 suggesting that all soils were substantially enriched by heavy metals originated from ww irrigation in only 25 of the soil samples however the amount of cd was over the acceptable limit 5 mg kg 1 kabata pendias 2010 the values of other metals were within their associated acceptable ranges in all soil samples these results imply that some parts of fields affected by ww irrigation might not be suitable for further agricultural activities due to phytotoxic issues caused by cd for crops similar studies were carried out by farahat and linderholm 2015 el hassanina et al 2020 and shahid et al 2020 ma et al 2021 reported that ww irrigation significantly increased cd substantially above its acceptable range 3 4 soil pollution indices using pollution index pi single ecological risk factor ei and potential ecological risk er the contamination levels of zn cu cd and pb in both the farms under irrigation by wastewater and freshwater were assessed the pi values were in the range of 1 8 3 1 1 4 20 4 7 13 4 and 1 14 3 4 for zn cu cd and pb respectively for the ww irrigated soils and 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 and 1 1 1 7 respectively for the fw irrigated soils table 3 the mean comparison of pi values showed increases of 65 5 108 7 for zn 30 84 57 for cu 3 04 3 3 time for cd and 27 101 8 for pb in the ww irrigated soils compared with the fw irrigated soils fig 3 these increases downgraded the pi class from low pollution 1 pi 2 in the fw irrigated soils to moderate pollution 2 pi 3 in the ww irrigated soils in 90 of the samples for zn 10 4 of the samples for cu and 47 9 of the samples for pb for pi cd the majority of soil samples showed a scope of low or moderate pollution in the fw irrigated versus high pollution level observed in 100 of the samples of ww irrigated soils these observations imply that ww irrigation significantly increased both the pi values and the scope of the metals in the order of cd zn pb cu cd was recognized as the major pollutant heavy metal in the study region similarly previous studies e g rezapour et al 2019 shahid et al 2020 and du et al 2020 found significant increase in soil cd content and its pollution by anthropogenic processes in iran pakistan and china the ei data associated with cd indicated that 4 2 83 3 and 12 5 of the samples were in the scope of considerable high and very high risk respectively in ww irrigated soils while 8 4 70 8 and 20 8 of the samples were in the scope of low moderate and considerable risk respectively in the fw irrigated soils table 3 this result shows that the cd ecological risk factor dropped by two grades in most soil samples after wastewater irrigation the potential ecological risk er analysis showed that ww irrigation resulted in a significant decrease in the er values min 162 2 max 423 mean 287 8 compared with fw irrigated soils min 48 7 max 106 6 mean 77 7 fig s1 a considerable and high risk was found in 45 8 and 54 2 of soil samples respectively under ww irrigation while 25 and 75 of soil samples under fw irrigation showed a low and moderate risk respectively this results revealed that on average the er degree dropped by two grade after wastewater irrigation for both ww and fw irrigated soils cd showed the highest contribution to er accounting for 91 94 and 80 83 of er scores in ww and fw irrigated soils respectively the magnitude of cd contribution to er score followed by pb cu and zn fig s1 these findings are consistent with those of islam et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 rezapour et al 2020 and liu et al 2021 who found that cd was found to be the major contributor to the er scores 3 5 concentration of heavy metals in vegetables summary statistics including the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation sd of heavy metals concentrations in the edible part of all crops under ww and fw are given in table 4 heavy metal concentrations followed the order zn cu pb cd in all vegetables under ww and fw irrigation table 4 the varying rates of heavy metal concentrations are likely related to the crop specific physiological demand and capacity of heavy metal uptake similar findings were reported by qureshi et al 2016 sharmaa et al 2019 and njuguna et al 2019 who found higher zn and cu in vegetables irrigated by wastewater from pakistan india and china respectively additionally the capacity of different vegetables to accumulate the same metal varied among vegetable types which is likely associated with vegetable physiology metal uptake mechanism by vegetables soil attributes and heavy metal chemistry in soil kabata pendias 2010 sharma et al 2018 the following is the sequence in which heavy metals accumulate in each vegetable zn and cu cabbage lettuce green bean pepper cd cabbage lettuce pepper green bean and pb cabbage lettuce pepper green bean similar orders were almost true for fw irrigated soils fig 5 this result suggests that cabbage has a higher capacity to absorb heavy metals than other vegetables which is consistent with earlier research findings qureshi et al 2016 ji et al 2018 the levels of heavy metals identified in the vegetable crops were compared to fao who threshold criteria who fao 2007 the findings from ww irrigated soils indicated that cu and pb contents in all crops were considerably lower than the fao who recommended acceptable limits for metals who fao 2007 the zn concentration surpassed the permissible limits 60 mg kg 1 in 17 17 and 11 of the cabbage lettuce and pepper samples respectively also cd levels were higher than the safe limit 0 2 mg kg 1 in 20 of the cabbage samples following ww irrigation this implies that using wastewater to irrigate vegetables may constitute a major issue in terms of zn and cd contamination in vegetables which is in line with previous studies aydin et al 2915 shaheen et al 2016 gebeyehu and bayissa 2020 gupta et al 2021 as a result continued use of heavy metal contaminated vegetables particularly cabbage may cause detrimental health consequences 3 6 the bio concentration factor of heavy metals to assess the accumulation of heavy metals transferred from soil to edible tissues of plants the bio concentration factor bcf was calculated the findings revealed that the accumulation of certain heavy metals differ amongst plants the sequence of average bcf values decreased in the order of zn cu cd pb in both ww and fw irrigated soils which aligns with other studies sharma et al 2018 njuguna et al 2019 the data indicates that leafy greens are more prone to zn transfer from soil than other metals for most vegetables the average bcf of soils irrigated with ww was significantly greater than those irrigated with fw fig 4 suggesting a greater transfer and accumulation of heavy metals in ww irrigated vegetables depending on vegetable type a mean increase of 5 44 was found in the bcf index of all vegetables under ww irrigation compared with fw irrigated soils the greatest increase was observed for bcf cu 20 44 followed by bcf pb 19 32 cd 7 21 and zn 5 16 implying that the uptake and transport of heavy metals in most vegetables has is surged by ww irrigation however the bcf values for all heavy metals were 1 in all vegetables under ww and fw irrigation these results suggests a low potential of vegetables to accumulate these metals differences in soil characteristics e g soil texture ph ec om and cec crop species metal bioavailability interface between plant roots and surrounding soil and metal translocation and transpiration rate in root leaf vegetables may all influence metals transport from soil to crop tissues among the wastewater irrigated vegetables bcf was highest with cabbage in the majority of samples followed by lettuce green beans and peppers a similar pattern to soils irrigated by fw the order of heavy metals bcf in the vegetables irrigated by ww was found as follows zn cabbage min 0 63 max 0 98 mean 0 81 lettuce min 0 56 max 0 94 mean 0 78 green bean min 0 4 max 0 89 mean 0 56 pepper min 0 34 max 0 91 mean 0 54 cu lettuce min 0 29 max 0 37 mean 0 33 cabbage min 0 13 max 0 37 mean 0 3 green bean min 0 1 max 0 26 mean 0 2 pepper min 0 1 max 0 21 mean 0 18 cd cabbage min 0 035 max 0 049 mean 0 042 lettuce min 0 036 max 0 044 mean 0 04 pepper min 0 036 max 0 039 mean 0 034 green bean min 0 032 max 0 035 mean 0

attributed to the variations in the soil physicochemical attributes water quality used for irrigating vegetables crop type and physiology and quantity and availability of soil heavy metal gebeyehu and bayissa 2020 nabulo et al 2010 guadie et al 2021 3 7 chronic daily intake cdi of heavy metals the cdi value for each metal zn cu cd and pb was calculated using the metal concentration accumulated in vegetables and their respective consumption rates for both ww and fw irrigated soils the mean values of cdi were in the order of zn cu cd pb for almost every vegetable that youngsters and adults eat table 5 the cdi values were higher for children than adults as a result of differences in the body weight used in calculations similar results were found in the past works huang et al 2018 hussain and qureshi 2020 the pattern for cdi zn and cdi cu in vegetables grown with ww was in the order of cabbage lettuce green beans pepper and for cdi cd and cdi pb were in the order of cabbage lettuce pepper green beans approximately the same trend was found for vegetables grown with fw the cdi values linked with ww irrigated vegetables were considerably greater than those associated with fw irrigated vegetables ranging from 65 5 to 80 3 cdi zn 72 1 93 5 cdi cu 52 4 97 7 cdi cd and 74 1 94 1 cdi pb irrespective of the population group and vegetable type however the dim values of zn cu cd and pb were 32 4 52 6 8 3 16 68 8 108 8 and 25 45 6 and 28 100 times lower respectively compared to the fao hwo approved daily consumption of vegetable grown in ww irrigated soils 2007 therefore for each heavy metal the mean daily ingestion dose could be admissible and would pose little or no detrimental health impact to the residents nevertheless in addition to heavy metal ingestion via food there are additional routes of exposure e g dermal contact and dust inhalation that might threaten human health 3 8 health risk assessment 3 8 1 non carcinogenic risk the hq and hi values of heavy metals were used to estimate the non carcinogenic health risk in virtu of vegetables ingestion by children and adults the hq values in both children and adults and for all vegetables were less than 1 indicating that eating for a short period of time would have no major risk to human health table s1 irrespective of the population group hq values in the vegetables irrigated with ww were significantly elevated than vegetables irrigated with fw ranged from 65 5 to 80 3 hq zn 72 1 93 5 hq cu 52 4 97 7 hq cd and 74 1 94 1 the results show that the possible human health hazards associated with the consumption of ww grown vegetables are a serious concern that should not be overlooked among vegetables irrigated with ww the highest hi was found in cabbage min 0 3 max 0 39 mean 0 35 followed by lettuce min 0 29 max 0 37 mean 0 32 green beans min 0 2 max 0 27 mean 0 24 and pepper min 0 19 max 0 25 mean 0 23 in both children and adults this result indicates that the risk of non cancerous illnesses is minimal 0 1 hi 1 for the vegetable consumers in this region compared to the fw irrigated soils the mean values of hi were significantly higher in the ww irrigated soils by 2 4 84 2 for lettuce 88 2 94 7 for cabbage 67 70 for green beans and 66 7 69 2 for pepper a similar trend to those of cdi and hq fig 5 several studies rehman et al 2019 hussain and qureshi 2020 guadie et al 2021 have highlighted the high hi values for different foodstuffs irrigated with wastewater which resulted in potential threat to all age groups particularly children among heavy metals exposure to cu 37 43 had the greatest role in high hi values the relative contribution of cu to hi was followed by cd zn and pb which accounted for 28 33 27 30 and 0 9 1 of the total hi score respectively for different vegetables fig 5 thus copper was the primary metal leading to the possible health risk for the consumers of ww irrigated vegetables overexposure to copper has been documented with acute health risks to humans including liver and kidney damage anaemia immunotoxicity and developmental toxicity ali et al 2019 gupta et al 2019 3 8 2 carcinogenic risk cr cd and pb were taken into account in this study while assessing cancer risk the cr cd values for children and adults consuming the ww grown vegetables was in the range of 2 98e 05 4 35e 05 and 2 59e 05 3 79e 05 for lettuce 3 44e 05 4 81e 05 and 2 99e 05 4 19e 05 for cabbage 1 83e 05 3 44e 05 and 1 59e 05 2 99e 05 for green beans and 2 29e 05 3 667e 05 and 1 99e 05 3 19e 05 for pepper respectively table s2 the corresponding cr value for pb were 9 23e 07 1 54e 06 and 8 03e 07 1 34e 06 lettuce 8 71e 07 1 49e 06 and 7 58e 07 1 29e 06 cabbage 6 15e 07 9 23e 07 and 5 35e 07 8 03e 07 green beans and 7 18e 07 1 08e 06 and 6 24e 07 9 36e 07 pepper for children and adult respectively these results suggest that cr is nearly within the acceptable range 1 00e 06 1 00e 04 for children and adults consuming ww irrigated vegetables us epa 2004 however cd had significantly higher cr than pb for all ww irrigated veetables fig 6 the carcinogenic risk of cd on the basis of population fraction was 2 8 100000 3 7 100000 and 2 5 100000 3 6 100000 for children and adults respectively this result corroborates the findings of wang et al 2019 gebeyehu and bayissa 2020 and roman ochoa et al 2021 who observed higher cr for cd than other metals the carcinogenic health risk due to cd and pb was substantially greater for children than adults in all vegetables irrigated with ww and fw fig 6 demonstrating that children were more susceptible than adults amon vegetables the total carcinogenic risk tcr due to cd and pb was the highest for cabbage min 3 55e 05 max 4 95e 05 mean 4 29e 05 in children followed by lettuce min 3 55e 05 max 4 95e 05 mean 4 29e 05 pepper min 2 37e 05 max 3 76e 05 mean 3 19e 05 and green beans min 1 90e 05 max 3 51e 05 mean 2 89e 05 table s2 an identical order was observed for adults analogous to cr cd and cr pb the tcr values for ww irrigation grown vegetable consumer children and adults were between 1 00e 06 1 00e 04 indicating no substantial health risk román ochoa et al 2021 given cr cd cr pb and tcr scores the health risk of children and adults by consumption of vegetables irrigated with ww was significantly greater than those irrigated with fw fig 6 this suggest a significant detrimental influence of wastewater irrigation on human health this finding accords with the earlier studies which found that irrigating plants with ww on a regular basis may encourage the heavy metal buildup in soils and initiate acute health risks to crop consumers rezapour et al 2019 rehman et al 2019 njuguna et al 2019 4 conclusion we quantified the impact of ww irrigation on the accumulation of zn cu cd and pb heavy metals in the calcareous soil vegetable cropping systems additionally we assessed the potential risk of heavy metal contaminated vegetable consumption for human health the potential health risk of consuming lettuce cabbage green bean and pepper grown under ww irrigation was identified using pi er and bcf indices and carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk models ww irrigation significantly increased the concentration of heavy metals and associated pi scores in the order of cd zn pb cu the er scores of most ww irrigated soils were within the high risk class the high ecological risk of heavy metals was primarily due to cd contamination than other metals among the vegetables irrigated with wastewater the bcf score and heavy metal concentration were highest in cabbage followed by lettuce compared to the other plants indicating a greater capacity of cabbage to absorb heavy metals the results of the health risk assessment revealed that the hq and hi values for vegetable consumers adults and children were 1 in the ww irrigated soils suggesting that the residents are exposed to a nonsignificant non carcinogenic risk however cr and tcr values for ww irrigated soils was substantially higher than for fw irrigated soils a similar trend to those of hq and hi the carcinogenic risk of the metals in terms of the fraction of the population was 2 5 100000 3 6 100000 within acceptable range 1 00e 06 cr tcr 1 00e 04 dwindling water resources necessitates the development of sustainable strategies for the reuse of wastewater for crop irrigation this study

9349,the introduction of heavy metals from wastewater irrigation to the soil crop human biological domain has become a vital environmental and human health challenge we evaluated the impact of wastewater irrigation ww on the severity of heavy metal pollution and health risk potential in different vegetables under ww versus fresh water fw irrigation a multifaceted assessment was conducted using the pollution index pi ecological risk er bio concentration factor bcf hazard quotient hq overall hazard index hi carcinogenic risk cr the bio concentration factor bcf and total carcinogenic risk tcr the findings revealed that ww irrigation increased metal concentrations across all soil samples and vegetables in the order of cd zn pb cu and zn cu pb cd respectively the pi and er indices indicated a significant increase of 27 330 and 260 310 respectively in the ww irrigated soils compared to the fw irrigated soils the heavy metals concentrations in the edible tissues of vegetables and their associated bcf values under ww irrigation exhibited the orders zn cu pb cd and zn cu cd pb respectively cabbage had the greatest potential to take up heavy metals compared with other crops the mean hq and hi were in the low risk category 0 1 hq and hi 1 likewise cr and tcr values were within acceptable limits 1 00e 06 1 00e 04 by consuming veggies produced with ww to children and adults implying that there are no significant health risks to local inhabitants however the levels of hq hi cr and tcr were significantly higher in vegetables grown with ww than in those irrigated with fw suggesting that wastewater irrigation may have a detrimental impact on human health keywords heavy metal health risk assessment soil health fresh water vegetable wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater ww reuse for irrigation can potentially reduce the dependency to freshwater resources particularly in water limited climates where growers access to freshwater is challenged by population growth and climate change the use of wastewater for crop irrigation can help to maintain production jahany and rezapour 2020 the current global production of wastewater is approximately 380 billion m3 per year which is expected to increase by 24 by 2030 and 51 by 2050 qadir et al 2020 with an annual rate of 159 billion m3 asia is the largest ww producer accounting for 42 of all urban wastewater generated globally followed by north america 67 billion m3 and europe 68 billion m3 qadir et al 2020 around 200 million hectares of farmland area is irrigated with either untreated or treated wastewater in over 50 nations around the world almost 10 of the world s population receives crops grown through ww irrigation united nations 2018 farmers are encouraged to utilize ww on croplands for a variety of environmental and economic reasons especially in urban and sub urban areas according to several studies ww irrigation can improve soil fertility and agricultural productivity by increasing nitrogen phosphorous potassium and trace metals cu mn fe and zn inputs mendoza espinosa et al 2008 tahtouh et al 2019 long term continuous ww irrigation on the other hand may cause certain unintended damages to soil health over time excessive accumulation of dissolved salts runoff generation and soil erosion due to surface sealing and heavy metal contamination are among the potential agronomic health and environmental risks qadir et al 2020 obiri nyarko et al 2021 such deteriorations in soil environment can lead to the reduced crop yields plant cover soil health and production efficiency however the extent of risk is generally assessed by the origin of ww level of purification type and concentration of toxic components application rate and frequency and soil type heavy metals have been identified as leading threats to soil quality and sustainability rezapour et al 2018 and 2019 these metals are referred to as omnipresent environmental pollutants because they are neither biodegradable nor leachable thereby exhausting soil resources interfering with plant development and declining crop yields mazurek et al 2017 qiu et al 2021 as a result heavy metal concentrations distribution destiny effect and origins have piqued interest in both natural and agricultural ecosystems around the world heavy metals often exist in wastewater and frequent irrigation with ww may lead to metal buildup in soils and crops rezapour et al 2019 consumption of crops and vegetables produced in heavy metal polluted soil can leads to a variety of health issues including blood pressure fluctuations liver lungs and renal malfunction and immune system insufficiency ming ho 2005 in spite of the fact that with shrinking freshwater resources tendency toward using wastewater for irrigation is growing the ecological impact of long term wastewater induced heavy metal accumulation in farmlands and its intrusion into food chain is not well understood the dearth of information is even more notable regarding the calcareous soils calcareous soils are characterized with high levels of calcium carbonate content and basic saturation with a ph ranging near neutral to alkaline calcareous soils occupy almost one third of the earth s terrestrial surface marschner 1995 brady and weil 2016 they have a strong buffering capacity for stabilizing heavy metals kabata pendias 2010 that generally leads to the liberation of wastewater application however long term wastewater irrigation can irreversibly damage the buffering capability of calcareous soil to immobilize and pacify the heavy metals ma et al 2021 resulting in the transformation of calcareous cropland from a sink to source of metals accordingly increased number of geographically representative investigations can yield more reliable information to better support the remediation decisions and to develop ecologically sustainable wastewater irrigation management systems the study region isin a calcareous semi arid environment in urmia northwestern iran farmlands are in close proximity to various small and medium sized services and industries e g food processors cold storage dyeing facilities metal plating etc whose effluents and wastes make their way directly or indirectly into the agricultural lands furthermore large volumes of sewage initiated from residential areas and service centers in suburban urmia are disposed to the margins of the regional farmlands therefore this area is exposed to threat and degradation by anthropogenic processes most of the previous studies were focused merely on soil physicochemical alterations or heavy metal levels and modifications in ww irrigated soils aydin et al 2015 abegunrin et al 2016 jahany and rezapour 2020 however there is relatively limited research on the ecological risk and distribution of heavy metals in the soil vegetable systems furthermore no thorough data on the health risk of ww initiated heavy metals is available for residents the objectives of this research were to 1 investigate the accumulation and concentration of heavy metals in water soil and edible tissues of lettuce cabbage green beans and pepper grown in wastewater and freshwater irrigated croplands 2 determine how ww irrigation may affect the ecological health as surrogated by pollution index ecological risk and bcf of zn cu cd ni and pb 3 determine the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks associated with heavy metal buildup in vegetables irrigated with ww 2 materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the research was conducted in urmia city 45º05 to 45º08 e and 37º32 to 37º38 n located in northwestern iran fig 1 according to the local growers wastewater ww irrigation has been a common practice in the region for over five decades the study region has a semi arid mediterranean climate with cold winters and hot summers the mean annual rainfall and temperature are 330 mm and 13 c respectively the experimental sites were allocated within the green bean cabbage pepper and lettuce vegetable fields the growing season for the vegetable cropping systems generally extends from april to september the wastewater is generated from municipal household and local industries in urmia city and applied directly by local farmers through flood irrigation technique without any preprocessing 2 2 soil and crop sampling within a total of six farms covering an area of 12 ha 36 pairs of composite soil samples 6 samples per farm were collected randomly from the ww irrigated and the adjacent freshwater fw irrigated sites each composite soil sample was a mixture of five sub samples collected from 0 to 50 cm soil depth wastewater and freshwater samples used for irrigation were also collected from each experimental farm for each of the six farms study areas within ww and fw treatments were selected on the portion of lands with similar slope land use physiographic unit and soil type so that the results could be comparable therefore differences in the values of soil heavy metals hms content and ecological risk indices between the ww irrigated and fw irrigated sites were primarily due to the irrigation water effects at maturity edible parts of green beans phaseolus vulgaris cabbage brassica oleracea peppers capsicum annuum l and lettuce lactuca sativa l were collected from both ww and fw treatment areas of each field 2 3 laboratory analysis the chemical properties of ww and fw water samples were determined as outlined by eaton et al 1995 using the standard methods all soil samples were analyzed for particle size distribution ph electrical conductivity ec calcium carbonate equivalent cce organic carbon oc and cation exchange capacity cec klute and page 1996 to extract the total content of zn cu cd and pb the soil samples were processed in strong nitric acid 4 m hno3 soon and abboud 1993 the edible parts of the vegetables were washed in double distilled water and dried at 70 ºc in a drying oven tissue samples were crushed separately using a steel grinder and passed through a1 mm sieve 100 mesh for subsequent examination all of the samples were stored in clean plastic bags at room temperature one gram of powdered vegetable samples were washed at 500 c for 12 h extracted with 2 m hcl and filtered by a centrifuge to quantify the heavy metals content ryan et al 2001 the concentration of zn cu cd and pb in ww fw soil and crop samples were analyzed using shimadzu aa 6300 the certified standard solutions 1000 mg l 1 merck germany of all five metals were applied as a stock solution for instrument standardization 2 4 pollution indices and bioaccumulation factor the soil pollution index pi was calculated using eq 1 liu et al 2005 1 pi c p c b where cp and cb are the heavy metal concentration values in the ww irrigated soil and the fw control respectively the ecological risk index er was calculated as the sum of the risk factor of the heavy metals using eqs 2 and 3 hakanson 1980 2 er i n e i 3 ei tipi where ei denotes the monomial ecological risk factor and ti is the toxicity response coefficient of heavy metals considered as zn 1 cd 30 and cu and pb 5 5 for cu and pb hakanson 1980 the er is the sum of the all four risk factors for heavy metals which were grouped into four categories as low potential ecological risk er 50 modest risk to the environment 50 er 100 considerable risk to the environment 100 er 200 and strong risk to the environmental er 200 hakanson 1980 the bio concentration factor bcf was assessed using eq 4 to assess the migration potential of heavy metals from soil to the edible portion of the study vegetables kabata pendias 2010 rezapour et al 2019 4 bcf c crop c soil where ccrop and csoil represent the concentrations of heavy metals in the vegetables edible portion on dry weight basis and soil respectively 2 5 health risk assessment chronic daily intake cdi of a metal was estimated as follow us epa 2004 5 cdi c m c f d fi bw where cm is the heavy metal concentration in vegetables mg kg 1 cf is conversion factor of 0 085 dfi is the daily intake of vegetables with 0 232 and 0 345 kg day 1 for children and adults respectively and bw is the mean body weight 32 7 and 55 9 kg for children and adults the following equations were used to determine the hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi representing the non carcinogenic risk during a lifetime for each metal and the overall potential non carcinogenic impacts respectively 6 hq cdi rfd 7 hi i n hq where rfd is the highest tolerable heavy metal ingestion for humans on a daily basis mg kg 1 day 1 the rfd value is 0 3 0 04 0 001 and 0 04 mg kg 1 day 1 for zn cu cd and pb respectively hq and hi 1 indicate no potential non carcinogenic effect while hq and hi 1 indicate the possibility of non carcinogenic effect using eq 8 carcinogenic risk cr was also assessed to determine the cancer risk for individuals over a lifetime because of their exposure to a carcinogenic metal rais 2017 8 cr cdi sf the sf is the slope factor the case of 1 10 6 cr 1 10 4 is considered acceptable risk while cr 1 10 4 carries potential carcinogenic risk 2 6 statistical analysis the descriptive statistics including maximum minimum average standard deviation and pearson correlation were calculated for soil and plant data in microsoft excel and spss 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa the means of heavy metal concentration values obtained from soils and plant analyses were compared between the ww irrigated soils and the fw irrigated soils using the paired t test 3 results and discussion 3 1 ww and fw characteristics the results of the chemical analysis for ww and fw control are presented in table 1 the values of chemical properties were significantly p 0 05 different between ww and fw except for ph the mean value of ec for ww was 2 4 foldhigher than fw resulting in increased salt concentration and osmotic tension in the soil irrigated with ww rezapour et al 2019 likewise n and p concentrations were above their recommended limits who fao 2001 which may result in a positive effect on soil fertility in farms irrigated with ww similarly cu and cd concentration of ww were above their maximum admissible limits who fao 2001 for irrigation practices this may be explained by the chemicals that are released from industrial units in surrounding urban and suburban areas and discharged into the wastewater rezapour et al 2019 3 2 baseline characteristics of the study soil as shown in table 2 soil sand content ranged from 12 4 to 83 3 with a mean value of 50 silt particles ranged from 7 2 to 55 with a mean content of 35 6 and clay particles had a range of 5 8 50 1 with a mean content 23 4 variable rates of soil particles resulted in a range of soil textural classes from loam comprising 47 of the total soil samples to clay loam comprising 25 of the total samples the entire study area is characterized by strongly calcareous and alkaline soils as represented by high ph a mean value 7 5 and calcium carbonate equivalent mean value 15 gregorich et al 2001 soil ec ranged between 0 2 and 3 42 ds m 1 and with a standard deviation of 74 3 showed a large variability across the study soils however all soil samples were non saline similar to other soil properties a large variation was found in soil organic matter which ranged from 0 64 to 3 85 and with an average of 1 6 suggesting poor 0 6 1 to very strong 3 soil organic matter content hazelton and murphy 2016 wu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 the mean values of cec values were within the range of 8 5 34 4 cmol kg 1 placing samples in the low 12 25 cmol kg 1 to high 25 40 cmol kg 1 cec ranges hazelton and murphy 2016 except for ph the coefficient of variation cv for all measured soil properties was greater than 35 implying a high variability across the study area wilding and dress 1983 based on the wrb system iuss working group and wrb 2015 and the key to soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 all farm soils were classified as cambisols and inceptisols respectively 3 3 soil heavy metals the magnitude of heavy metals concentrations in the soils with ww irrigation followed the order of zn 53 2 91 5 mg kg 1 pb 30 1 73 1 mg kg 1 cu 28 4 38 36 mg kg 1 cd 2 43 6 83 mg kg 1 table 2 all soil heavy metals had relatively high coefficient of variations cv 20 in the order of cd pb zn cu table 2 implying that a considerable part of the metals has anthropogenic origins irrigation by ww resulted in a significant build up of zn cu cd and pb compared with soil irrigated with fw fig 2 depending on the farm site an average increase of 29 360 in heavy metals was observed under ww irrigated compared with fw irrigated soils the greatest increase 220 360 was found for cd followed by zn 74 6 117 6 pb 43 71 4 and cu 29 54 3 suggesting that all soils were substantially enriched by heavy metals originated from ww irrigation in only 25 of the soil samples however the amount of cd was over the acceptable limit 5 mg kg 1 kabata pendias 2010 the values of other metals were within their associated acceptable ranges in all soil samples these results imply that some parts of fields affected by ww irrigation might not be suitable for further agricultural activities due to phytotoxic issues caused by cd for crops similar studies were carried out by farahat and linderholm 2015 el hassanina et al 2020 and shahid et al 2020 ma et al 2021 reported that ww irrigation significantly increased cd substantially above its acceptable range 3 4 soil pollution indices using pollution index pi single ecological risk factor ei and potential ecological risk er the contamination levels of zn cu cd and pb in both the farms under irrigation by wastewater and freshwater were assessed the pi values were in the range of 1 8 3 1 1 4 20 4 7 13 4 and 1 14 3 4 for zn cu cd and pb respectively for the ww irrigated soils and 1 1 1 5 1 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 and 1 1 1 7 respectively for the fw irrigated soils table 3 the mean comparison of pi values showed increases of 65 5 108 7 for zn 30 84 57 for cu 3 04 3 3 time for cd and 27 101 8 for pb in the ww irrigated soils compared with the fw irrigated soils fig 3 these increases downgraded the pi class from low pollution 1 pi 2 in the fw irrigated soils to moderate pollution 2 pi 3 in the ww irrigated soils in 90 of the samples for zn 10 4 of the samples for cu and 47 9 of the samples for pb for pi cd the majority of soil samples showed a scope of low or moderate pollution in the fw irrigated versus high pollution level observed in 100 of the samples of ww irrigated soils these observations imply that ww irrigation significantly increased both the pi values and the scope of the metals in the order of cd zn pb cu cd was recognized as the major pollutant heavy metal in the study region similarly previous studies e g rezapour et al 2019 shahid et al 2020 and du et al 2020 found significant increase in soil cd content and its pollution by anthropogenic processes in iran pakistan and china the ei data associated with cd indicated that 4 2 83 3 and 12 5 of the samples were in the scope of considerable high and very high risk respectively in ww irrigated soils while 8 4 70 8 and 20 8 of the samples were in the scope of low moderate and considerable risk respectively in the fw irrigated soils table 3 this result shows that the cd ecological risk factor dropped by two grades in most soil samples after wastewater irrigation the potential ecological risk er analysis showed that ww irrigation resulted in a significant decrease in the er values min 162 2 max 423 mean 287 8 compared with fw irrigated soils min 48 7 max 106 6 mean 77 7 fig s1 a considerable and high risk was found in 45 8 and 54 2 of soil samples respectively under ww irrigation while 25 and 75 of soil samples under fw irrigation showed a low and moderate risk respectively this results revealed that on average the er degree dropped by two grade after wastewater irrigation for both ww and fw irrigated soils cd showed the highest contribution to er accounting for 91 94 and 80 83 of er scores in ww and fw irrigated soils respectively the magnitude of cd contribution to er score followed by pb cu and zn fig s1 these findings are consistent with those of islam et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 rezapour et al 2020 and liu et al 2021 who found that cd was found to be the major contributor to the er scores 3 5 concentration of heavy metals in vegetables summary statistics including the minimum maximum mean and standard deviation sd of heavy metals concentrations in the edible part of all crops under ww and fw are given in table 4 heavy metal concentrations followed the order zn cu pb cd in all vegetables under ww and fw irrigation table 4 the varying rates of heavy metal concentrations are likely related to the crop specific physiological demand and capacity of heavy metal uptake similar findings were reported by qureshi et al 2016 sharmaa et al 2019 and njuguna et al 2019 who found higher zn and cu in vegetables irrigated by wastewater from pakistan india and china respectively additionally the capacity of different vegetables to accumulate the same metal varied among vegetable types which is likely associated with vegetable physiology metal uptake mechanism by vegetables soil attributes and heavy metal chemistry in soil kabata pendias 2010 sharma et al 2018 the following is the sequence in which heavy metals accumulate in each vegetable zn and cu cabbage lettuce green bean pepper cd cabbage lettuce pepper green bean and pb cabbage lettuce pepper green bean similar orders were almost true for fw irrigated soils fig 5 this result suggests that cabbage has a higher capacity to absorb heavy metals than other vegetables which is consistent with earlier research findings qureshi et al 2016 ji et al 2018 the levels of heavy metals identified in the vegetable crops were compared to fao who threshold criteria who fao 2007 the findings from ww irrigated soils indicated that cu and pb contents in all crops were considerably lower than the fao who recommended acceptable limits for metals who fao 2007 the zn concentration surpassed the permissible limits 60 mg kg 1 in 17 17 and 11 of the cabbage lettuce and pepper samples respectively also cd levels were higher than the safe limit 0 2 mg kg 1 in 20 of the cabbage samples following ww irrigation this implies that using wastewater to irrigate vegetables may constitute a major issue in terms of zn and cd contamination in vegetables which is in line with previous studies aydin et al 2915 shaheen et al 2016 gebeyehu and bayissa 2020 gupta et al 2021 as a result continued use of heavy metal contaminated vegetables particularly cabbage may cause detrimental health consequences 3 6 the bio concentration factor of heavy metals to assess the accumulation of heavy metals transferred from soil to edible tissues of plants the bio concentration factor bcf was calculated the findings revealed that the accumulation of certain heavy metals differ amongst plants the sequence of average bcf values decreased in the order of zn cu cd pb in both ww and fw irrigated soils which aligns with other studies sharma et al 2018 njuguna et al 2019 the data indicates that leafy greens are more prone to zn transfer from soil than other metals for most vegetables the average bcf of soils irrigated with ww was significantly greater than those irrigated with fw fig 4 suggesting a greater transfer and accumulation of heavy metals in ww irrigated vegetables depending on vegetable type a mean increase of 5 44 was found in the bcf index of all vegetables under ww irrigation compared with fw irrigated soils the greatest increase was observed for bcf cu 20 44 followed by bcf pb 19 32 cd 7 21 and zn 5 16 implying that the uptake and transport of heavy metals in most vegetables has is surged by ww irrigation however the bcf values for all heavy metals were 1 in all vegetables under ww and fw irrigation these results suggests a low potential of vegetables to accumulate these metals differences in soil characteristics e g soil texture ph ec om and cec crop species metal bioavailability interface between plant roots and surrounding soil and metal translocation and transpiration rate in root leaf vegetables may all influence metals transport from soil to crop tissues among the wastewater irrigated vegetables bcf was highest with cabbage in the majority of samples followed by lettuce green beans and peppers a similar pattern to soils irrigated by fw the order of heavy metals bcf in the vegetables irrigated by ww was found as follows zn cabbage min 0 63 max 0 98 mean 0 81 lettuce min 0

attributed to the variations in the soil physicochemical attributes water quality used for irrigating vegetables crop type and physiology and quantity and availability of soil heavy metal gebeyehu and bayissa 2020 nabulo et al 2010 guadie et al 2021 3 7 chronic daily intake cdi of heavy metals the cdi value for each metal zn cu cd and pb was calculated using the metal concentration accumulated in vegetables and their respective consumption rates for both ww and fw irrigated soils the mean values of cdi were in the order of zn cu cd pb for almost every vegetable that youngsters and adults eat table 5 the cdi values were higher for children than adults as a result of differences in the body weight used in calculations similar results were found in the past works huang et al 2018 hussain and qureshi 2020 the pattern for cdi zn and cdi cu in vegetables grown with ww was in the order of cabbage lettuce green beans pepper and for cdi cd and cdi pb were in the order of cabbage lettuce pepper green beans approximately the same trend was found for vegetables grown with fw the cdi values linked with ww irrigated vegetables were considerably greater than those associated with fw irrigated vegetables ranging from 65 5 to 80 3 cdi zn 72 1 93 5 cdi cu 52 4 97 7 cdi cd and 74 1 94 1 cdi pb irrespective of the population group and vegetable type however the dim values of zn cu cd and pb were 32 4 52 6 8 3 16 68 8 108 8 and 25 45 6 and 28 100 times lower respectively compared to the fao hwo approved daily consumption of vegetable grown in ww irrigated soils 2007 therefore for each heavy metal the mean daily ingestion dose could be admissible and would pose little or no detrimental health impact to the residents nevertheless in addition to heavy metal ingestion via food there are additional routes of exposure e g dermal contact and dust inhalation that might threaten human health 3 8 health risk assessment 3 8 1 non carcinogenic risk the hq and hi values of heavy metals were used to estimate the non carcinogenic health risk in virtu of vegetables ingestion by children and adults the hq values in both children and adults and for all vegetables were less than 1 indicating that eating for a short period of time would have no major risk to human health table s1 irrespective of the population group hq values in the vegetables irrigated with ww were significantly elevated than vegetables irrigated with fw ranged from 65 5 to 80 3 hq zn 72 1 93 5 hq cu 52 4 97 7 hq cd and 74 1 94 1 the results show that the possible human health hazards associated with the consumption of ww grown vegetables are a serious concern that should not be overlooked among vegetables irrigated with ww the highest hi was found in cabbage min 0 3 max 0 39 mean 0 35 followed by lettuce min 0 29 max 0 37 mean 0 32 green beans min 0 2 max 0 27 mean 0 24 and pepper min 0 19 max 0 25 mean 0 23 in both children and adults this result indicates that the risk of non cancerous illnesses is minimal 0 1 hi 1 for the vegetable consumers in this region compared to the fw irrigated soils the mean values of hi were significantly higher in the ww irrigated soils by 2 4 84 2 for lettuce 88 2 94 7 for cabbage 67 70 for green beans and 66 7 69 2 for pepper a similar trend to those of cdi and hq fig 5 several studies rehman et al 2019 hussain and qureshi 2020 guadie et al 2021 have highlighted the high hi values for different foodstuffs irrigated with wastewater which resulted in potential threat to all age groups particularly children among heavy metals exposure to cu 37 43 had the greatest role in high hi values the relative contribution of cu to hi was followed by cd zn and pb which accounted for 28 33 27 30 and 0 9 1 of the total hi score respectively for different vegetables fig 5 thus copper was the primary metal leading to the possible health risk for the consumers of ww irrigated vegetables overexposure to copper has been documented with acute health risks to humans including liver and kidney damage anaemia immunotoxicity and developmental toxicity ali et al 2019 gupta et al 2019 3 8 2 carcinogenic risk cr cd and pb were taken into account in this study while assessing cancer risk the cr cd values for children and adults consuming the ww grown vegetables was in the range of 2 98e 05 4 35e 05 and 2 59e 05 3 79e 05 for lettuce 3 44e 05 4 81e 05 and 2 99e 05 4 19e 05 for cabbage 1 83e 05 3 44e 05 and 1 59e 05 2 99e 05 for green beans and 2 29e 05 3 667e 05 and 1 99e 05 3 19e 05 for pepper respectively table s2 the corresponding cr value for pb were 9 23e 07 1 54e 06 and 8 03e 07 1 34e 06 lettuce 8 71e 07 1 49e 06 and 7 58e 07 1 29e 06 cabbage 6 15e 07 9 23e 07 and 5 35e 07 8 03e 07 green beans and 7 18e 07 1 08e 06 and 6 24e 07 9 36e 07 pepper for children and adult respectively these results suggest that cr is nearly within the acceptable range 1 00e 06 1 00e 04 for children and adults consuming ww irrigated vegetables us epa 2004 however cd had significantly higher cr than pb for all ww irrigated veetables fig 6 the carcinogenic risk of cd on the basis of population fraction was 2 8 100000 3 7 100000 and 2 5 100000 3 6 100000 for children and adults respectively this result corroborates the findings of wang et al 2019 gebeyehu and bayissa 2020 and roman ochoa et al 2021 who observed higher cr for cd than other metals the carcinogenic health risk due to cd and pb was substantially greater for children than adults in all vegetables irrigated with ww and fw fig 6 demonstrating that children were more susceptible than adults amon vegetables the total carcinogenic risk tcr due to cd and pb was the highest for cabbage min 3 55e 05 max 4 95e 05 mean 4 29e 05 in children followed by lettuce min 3 55e 05 max 4 95e 05 mean 4 29e 05 pepper min 2 37e 05 max 3 76e 05 mean 3 19e 05 and green beans min 1 90e 05 max 3 51e 05 mean 2 89e 05 table s2 an identical order was observed for adults analogous to cr cd and cr pb the tcr values for ww irrigation grown vegetable consumer children and adults were between 1 00e 06 1 00e 04 indicating no substantial health risk román ochoa et al 2021 given cr cd cr pb and tcr scores the health risk of children and adults by consumption of vegetables irrigated with ww was significantly greater than those irrigated with fw fig 6 this suggest a significant detrimental influence of wastewater irrigation on human health this finding accords with the earlier studies which found that irrigating plants with ww on a regular basis may encourage the heavy metal buildup in soils and initiate acute health risks to crop consumers rezapour et al 2019 rehman et al 2019 njuguna et al 2019 4 conclusion we quantified the impact of ww irrigation on the accumulation of zn cu cd and pb heavy metals in the calcareous soil vegetable cropping systems additionally we assessed the potential risk of heavy metal contaminated vegetable consumption for human health the potential health risk of consuming lettuce cabbage green bean and pepper grown under ww irrigation was identified using pi er and bcf indices and carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk models ww irrigation significantly increased the concentration of heavy metals and associated pi scores in the order of cd zn pb cu the er scores of most ww irrigated soils were within the high risk class the high ecological risk of heavy metals was primarily due to cd contamination than other metals among the vegetables irrigated with wastewater the bcf score and heavy metal concentration were highest in cabbage followed by lettuce compared to the other plants indicating a greater capacity of cabbage to absorb heavy metals the results of the health risk assessment revealed that the hq and hi values for vegetable consumers adults and children were 1 in the ww irrigated soils suggesting that the residents are exposed to a nonsignificant non carcinogenic risk however cr and tcr values for ww irrigated soils was substantially higher than for fw irrigated soils a similar trend to those of hq and hi the carcinogenic risk of the metals in terms of the fraction of the population was 2 5 100000 3 6 100000 within acceptable range 1 00e 06 cr tcr 1 00e 04 dwindling water resources necessitates the development of sustainable strategies for the reuse of wastewater for crop irrigation this study gives further insight into the ecological risk of heavy metal contaminated ww irrigation advancements in bioclinical approaches is crucial for timely detection and prevention of heavy metals incursion
