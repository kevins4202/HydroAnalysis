resources has limited their development deficit irrigation di is a novel water saving irrigation method but there is a risk of yield reduction in practice therefore a meta analysis was conducted to quantitatively analyze the impact of di on fruit yield and water use efficiency wue to explore the most suitable di strategy for fruit trees overall compared to full irrigation di decreased the fruit yield by 6 05 and increased wue by 5 05 however the effectiveness of di depended on di factors fruit tree varieties and environmental factors in order to achieve a win win goal of water saving and yield increasing a win win analysis was conducted on collected data it was found that di was suitable for drought tolerant tree varieties in the arid region with medium textured and large bulk density soil adopting subsurface irrigation methods for low or moderate deficit irrigation limit 55 θ f before the fruit growth stage i e bud burst to leafing stage and flowering to fruit set stage was recommended our findings can provide implications for applying di to fruit trees keywords deficit irrigation fruit tree meta analysis yield water use efficiency 1 introduction economical fruit trees are specific forests with obvious economic and ecological benefits and become an essential source of cash income in rural households cao et al 2018 tamang et al 2019 according to usda 2020 statistics the global outcomes of apples pears and grapes in 2019 were 75 8 million 2 3 million and 2 34 million tons respectively which achieved significant economic benefits and greatly improved the survival environment of local farmers however with the increasing scarcity of water resources and the rapid expansion of the global population more and more countries are facing serious water resource challenges brown et al 2019 furthermore agricultural water consumption accounts for more than 70 of the world s freshwater use which is one of the primary causes of water utilization pressure lovarelli et al 2016 especially for economical fruit trees such as apples pears peaches grapes etc are mainly distributed in semi arid and arid areas of hills mountains beaches and saline alkali land these areas usually have complex terrain a shortage of water resources and high irrigation costs du et al 2004 besides fruit trees with considerable ecological and economic benefits depend on the appropriate water environment and reasonable management system for orchard irrigation du et al 2004 xia et al 2020 therefore how to use water saving irrigation methods for efficient water use to promote the development of economical fruit trees is a major issue to be solved deficit irrigation di is a novel strategy to save water and maintain yield through the purpose of water deficit in certain stages of crop growth crops regulate their growth dynamics so as to improve wue and achieve the effect of water saving and high yield kang 2004 there have been numerous current studies on di for apple kilili et al 1996 mpelasoka et al 2001 pear cui et al 2009 marsal et al 2000 peach guizani et al 2019 marsal et al 2016 and other fruit trees garcia tejero et al 2010 iniesta et al 2009 liu et al 2021 found that wue of subsurface drip irrigation were higher than furrow irrigation under di of alfalfa and the performance of yield was different at various growth stages mustafa et al 2017 simulated different soil textures under di and moderate fertility levels of soil were recommended dacosta and huang 2006 demonstrated that water use characteristics of di varied with species in different climate regions and di could be practiced in summer to increase wue these results have indicated that the effect of di was influenced by climate crop species irrigation methods soil types and deficit stages however the existing studies are all performed following specific experimental conditions and there is a lack of systematic analysis of application conditions for di of fruit trees therefore in order to maximize the interests of di on the fruit trees grow and reduce water consumption effectively for improving the rational allocation of water and soil resources in different regions of fruit trees it is necessary to employ an analytical strategy to quantitatively analyze the application of di in practice and get the optimized di strategy for fruit trees meta analysis is a comprehensive analysis statistical model utilizing multiple data points for quantitative analysis stanley and jarrell 2005 it is used to systematically explain the impact of potential factors on dependent variables there have been few studies of meta analysis on di and the main focus crops were food crops and greenhouse vegetables such as wheat yu et al 2020 tomato lu et al 2019 and cotton cheng et al 2021 a systematic analysis of fruit tree yield and water use efficiency wue under di is lacking therefore to cope with the pressure of water resources decline and explore the optimal di strategy for fruit trees the objectives of this meta analysis were to 1 quantitatively analyze the effect of di for fruit trees wue and yield 2 identify the main factors affecting the wue and yield of fruit trees 3 explore the optimized di strategy for fruit trees by ascertaining maximum benefits 2 material and methods 2 1 data collection and classification data collection was conducted on web of science google scholar elsevier cnki china national knowledge internet to search relevant peer reviewed literature from january 1990 to march 2021 using the search terms yield or water use efficiency or wue and regulated deficit irrigation or deficit irrigation and apple or pear or jujube or grape or peach publications were screened by the following criteria 1 experiment site and year of study were clear 2 experimental treatment included both di experimental group and full irrigation control group with the same irrigation management measures 3 paired data of yield and wue of experimental and control groups were included together with sample number and standard deviation 4 temperature and rainfall during the growing season were documented 5 pot experiments were excluded in total 38 published papers involving 315 observations satisfied the selection criteria of meta analysis the lists of publications and data are listed in appendix a when the data were presented as figures the figures were extracted with the numerical values by using get data graph digitizer http www getdata graph digitizer com if the above data were not available the original data were obtained by contacting the author when the number of sample repetitions n and standard error se were given the standard deviation sd was calculated by sd se n otherwise the standard deviation sd was assumed to be 1 10 of the mean luo et al 2006 in this meta analysis the relationship between yield and water was the focus therefore wue was considered at the field crop level calculating by wue yield et where et is evapotranspiration in addition we used several subgroups to further analyze the response of fruit tree yield and wue under di the data were classified and recorded as follows 1 deficit degree included low deficit 70 θ f 85 θ f moderate deficit 55 θ f 70 θ f and severe deficit 40 θ f 55 θ f lower limit exceeds 85 θ f was considered as full irrigation where θ f is the field capacity 2 the stage when di adopted was divided into whole growth stage whole stage bud burst to leafing stage stage ⅰ flowering to fruit set stage stage ⅱ fruit growth stage stage ⅲ fruit maturation stage stage ⅳ 3 irrigation methods included bubbled root irrigation surface drip irrigation subsurface drip irrigation small tube irrigation and furrow irrigation 4 climate region according to the average precipitation was divided into two categories 400 mm is the humid region 400 mm is the arid region 5 soil texture was divided into the fine textured medium textured coarse textured usda 1993 6 soil bulk density was divided into two ranges 1 4 g cm³ 1 4 g cm³ 2 2 data analysis according to the meta analysis method the natural log response ratio lnr was used as the measure of effect size hedges et al 1999 lnr ln x e x c for each study x e and x c were average values of di and full irrigation for different fruit tree yields and wue respectively the variance of effect size v l nr was calculated as follow benitez lopez et al 2017 v l nr s e 2 n e x e 2 s c 2 n c x c 2 here s e and s c were the standard deviations of the target variable in the experimental group and control group respectively n e and n c were the sample sizes of the target variable in the experimental group and control group respectively for the effect size of each study weighted integration calculation the overall effect size was obtained the weight of each study w i the overall effect size l n rr and the 95 confidence interval 95 ci were calculated as follows w i 1 v i l n rr i 1 k w i lnr i i 1 k w i 95 c i l n r r 1 96 1 i 1 k w i where v i was the sum of variance vi between each study data and the variance between studies t2 namely v i v i t 2 if the 95 ci does not overlap with 0 it is considered that there is a significant difference between full irrigation and di l n rr will be calculated by e lnrr 1 100 when lnrr 0 0 and 0 it means positive effect negative effect and little or no effect respectively the meta analysis was conducted in metawin 2 1 software funnel plots and forest plots were mapped by stata se 12 1 software and origin 2018 software respectively 2 3 publication heterogeneity and bias in order to explore the heterogeneity between studies qt value based on chi square test was selected as examining the heterogeneity in studies higgins and thompson 2002 the significant value of qt p 0 05 indicates that the effect size is not equal in each study which means that other variables are affecting the results and the random effect model should be selected on the contrary the fixed effect model should be selected the calculation formula for qt was as follows q t i 1 n w i ln r i 2 ln r i 2 i 1 n w i ln r i 2 i 1 n w i ln r i 2 i 1 n w i due to the heterogeneity among studies the qt and p values of yield and wue were 1656 34 p 0 001 and 1137 52 p 0 001 respectively a random effect model was used in this study the funnel chart is used to assess whether each variable is biased in the entire database irwig et al 1998 as shown in fig 1 the yield and wue were symmetrical indicating that there was no publication bias 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset the database was collected from 38 published papers in 7 countries including 315 pairs of observations of fruit yield and wue data under di effect sizes of fruit tree yield and wue were normally distributed fig 2 overall compared to full irrigation di reduced fruit tree yield by 6 05 95 ci 6 83 to 5 27 but increased wue by 5 05 95 ci 4 04 to 6 09 fig 3 the result demonstrated that although there might be a risk of yield reduction of fruit trees in di wue was highly improved however there was significant heterogeneity in the random effect of yield and wue it is necessary to use subgroup data to reveal specific effects of di factors fruit tree varieties and environmental factors climate regions and soil factors on fruit tree yield and wue to determine a better strategy for fruit trees under di 3 2 di factors effect sizes of di factors on fruit tree yield and wue were affected by deficit degree timing and irrigation methods fig 4 across all studies of deficit degree effect sizes of low and moderate degree on fruit tree yield were significantly different from severe degree compared to the full irrigation effect sizes of the low and moderate degree on fruit tree yield were 3 55 and 4 13 respectively but the effect size of the severe degree on yield was as high as 11 50 fig 4a the same trend was observed for wue low and moderate deficit degrees significantly increased wue by 6 67 and 7 99 respectively while severe deficit degree increased wue only by 0 49 fig 4b therefore appropriate water deficits low or moderate degree declined the risk of fruit tree yield reduction with improving wue significantly considering the timing of di employing di at stage ⅰ stage ⅱ or stage ⅳ had little impact on fruit tree yield compared to full irrigation with effect sizes of 0 33 1 28 and 3 50 respectively however fruit tree yield was a notably negative impact by employing di at stage ⅲ or the whole stage which effect sizes were 14 78 and 11 11 respectively fig 4 c di conducted at stage ⅰ stage ⅱ stage ⅳ or the whole stage all improved wue of fruit trees compared to full irrigation increments were 6 34 8 51 5 00 and 10 21 but di at stage ⅲ noticeably reduced wue 2 55 fig 4 d consequently it is recommended that di conducted at stage ⅰ or stage ⅱ before stage ⅲ was more suitable for improving the yield and wue of fruit trees not only fruit tree yield was decreased not significantly or even increased slightly but also wue was enormously improved in terms of irrigation methods the application of furrow irrigation surface drip irrigation and small tube irrigation for di resulted in a large reduction in fruit yield by 6 01 4 41 and 8 98 respectively compared to full irrigation besides adopting the bubbled root irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation for di had no significant effect on yield 1 19 2 46 and 1 10 1 19 fig 4 e for wue when adopting subsurface drip irrigation furrow irrigation and bubbled root irrigation di improved fruit tree wue effectively among them bubbled root irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation had the most obvious increase with the increase exceeding 10 00 11 74 and 12 11 respectively employing small tube irrigation 0 55 3 61 and surface drip irrigation 1 69 1 17 for di had no significant effect on wue fig 4 f these results displayed that using subsurface irrigation methods such as bubbled root irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation for di could achieve a win win situation for saving water and increasing yield 3 3 fruit tree varieties fruit trees varieties have different sensitivity to water conditions thereby the response of yield and wue to di may be quite different rahmati et al 2018 fig 5 shows the effect of fruit tree varieties on fruit tree yield and wue under di compared to full irrigation the application of di to jujube and pear trees had no significant effect on yield 0 42 3 23 and 0 36 2 04 whereas yields of peach grape and apple trees were decreased by 5 89 7 46 and 10 16 respectively fig 5 a furthermore the application of di was improved the wue of jujube apple pear and peach trees among them pear and peach trees were increased significantly by 18 59 and 21 98 respectively but wue of grape trees was decreased by 0 73 fig 5 b hence di might be suitable for drought tolerant fruit trees such as jujube and pear tree while it is not recommended for water sensitive trees due to the high risk of yield reduction 3 4 climate regions and soil factors effect sizes of di on fruit tree yield and wue were affected by climate regions soil texture and soil bulk density fig 6 using di in arid and humid regions reduced fruit tree yield but improved wue the reduction of fruit tree yield in arid regions was smaller than that in humid regions compared to full irrigation fruit tree yield in arid and humid regions were decreased by 5 86 and 7 87 respectively fig 6 a wue was increased by 3 08 and 8 67 respectively fig 6 b therefore it is evident that di was suitable for application in arid regions as the basis of crop production and development soil provides a stable growth environment for the root zone of fruit trees day et al 2010 while the soil environment is affected by factors such as bulk density and texture campbell and hawkins 2003 employing di in soil with larger bulk density reduced fruit tree yield and increased wue significantly when the soil bulk density was greater than 1 4 g cm³ and lower than 1 4 g cm³ fruit tree yield was reduced by 4 38 and 12 77 and wue was increased by 7 30 and 3 13 respectively fig 6 c and fig 6 d as for soil textures adopting di in different soil textures reduced fruit tree yield with medium textured soils fruit trees had the smallest yield reduction of 5 37 while with fine and coarse textured soils fruit tree yield was reduced by 12 67 and 6 10 respectively fig 6 e applying di in different soil textures all increased wue especially medium textured soils had the highest increase of 8 34 while fine and coarse textured soils were only increased by 1 91 and 3 40 respectively fig 6 f therefore it was in the soil with a large bulk density 1 4 g cm³ and medium textured that the risk of yield reduction for fruit trees under di was smaller and wue was significantly increased 4 discussion our study implicated that the application of di on fruit trees might have a risk of yield reduction but limited water resources would be fully utilized however fruit tree yield and wue were not only affected by irrigation but also closely related to fruit tree varieties climate and soil factors therefore it is necessary to identify how these factors affected fruit tree yield and wue and determine the management strategy of di to increase fruit tree yield and wue simultaneously 4 1 di factors effect on yield and wue a low or moderate degree of water deficits decreased the risk of fruit tree yield reduction while increased significantly wue figs 4a and 4b the previous study demonstrated that an appropriate water deficit can affect the distribution of photosynthetic products to different tissues and organs of fruit trees ma et al 2015 this process will prompt assimilates transfer to the root system spontaneously increasing root vitality li et al 2011 ma et al 2010 fruit trees will reduce excess vegetative growth of the above ground part and supply suitable nutrients for reproductive growth hence fruit tree yield is less affected bissuel belaygue et al 2002 lilley and fukai 1994 simultaneously compared to full irrigation using di reduces the amount of irrigation water for fruit trees thereby significantly increasing wue liang et al 2018 however applying a severe water deficit of di the water absorption capacity of fruit tree roots will be reduced consequently roots cannot be fully restored after re watering asseng et al 1998 which seriously affects the normal growth of fruit trees resulting in a sharp decline in fruit tree yield using di at bud burst to leafing stage stage ⅰ or flowering to fruit set stage stage ⅱ of fruit trees improved wue significantly without reducing yield or even increasing yield slightly compared to full irrigation results were expected because bud burst to leafing stage stage ⅰ and flowering to fruit set stage stage ⅱ are the most active stages for fruit tree branches growing reyes et al 2016 in these two stages adopting di can not only inhibit the excessive vegetative growth of fruit trees effectively but also reduce the number of excess branches remarkably girona et al 2005 perez pastor et al 2014 ruiz sanchez et al 2010 besides the expansion process of fruit tissue cells is inhibited and photosynthetic metabolites are accumulated goufo et al 2017 hein et al 2016 hura et al 2011 after re watering these metabolites can be used for cell wall synthesis and other processes related to fruit growth fabregas and fernie 2019 luan 2002 zhao et al 2017 so that the growth of fruit trees is compensated and fruit tree yield will not be significantly affected however the fruit growth stage stage ⅲ and the fruit maturation stage stage ⅳ are essential stages of fruit growth and development which are sensitive to water ma et al 2007 using di at these two stages will directly affect fruit growth resulting in a significant decline in yield irrigation methods also significantly affected fruit tree yield and wue figs 4e and 4f subsurface irrigation methods such as bubbled root irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation achieved a win win situation of water saving and yield increasing it is plausible that emitters for subsurface drip irrigation and bubbled root irrigation are buried in the subsurface soil which can transport water and fertilizer to the root zone of fruit trees camp 1998 fu et al 2021 furthermore subsurface emitters inhibit evaporation of surface soil water effectively communar and friedman 2010 the water environment where the root system developing is more suitable for root growth and the root growth will be more vigorous el nesr et al 2014 ma et al 2020 it will cause that the ability of fruit trees to cope with water stress is stronger gao et al 2020 polania et al 2017 therefore the fruit tree yield is less affected however furrow irrigation and small tube irrigation can cause water distribution uniformity and inefficient utilization araujo et al 2019 due to a long time for water to reach the roots of fruit trees similarly surface drip irrigation has low utilization efficiency since large water evaporation on the soil surface umair et al 2019 these irrigation methods are a tendency to lower water use efficiency which is unable to meet the requirements of the growth environment of fruit tree roots under di 4 2 climate regions and fruit tree varieties effect on yield and wue the results showed that di was more suitable for drought tolerant fruit trees such as jujube and pear in arid regions drought tolerant fruit trees are more resistant to drought when fruit trees are subjected to water stress the xylem of roots tends to transmit aba signals to leaves with a decreased stomatal aperture and water loss christmann et al 2007 farrell et al 2017 jiang and zhang 2004 besides the cell osmotic adjustment ability of drought tolerant fruit trees is stronger it is easier to accumulate solutes in tissue cells to maintain certain turgor pressure at the water stress phase del carmen gijon et al 2011 lemcoff et al 2002 tan et al 1992 after re watering cell turgor pressure is more conducive to maintaining cell water and various metabolic processes in fruit trees borchert 1994 thereby the risk of fruit tree yield reduction is declined conversely tree varieties planted in humid regions mostly have poor drought tolerance ability and are more sensitive to water these trees have the weak ability of stomatal regulation cell osmotic adjustment and growth compensation generating the risk of yield reduction 4 3 soil factors effect on yield and wue in the soil with larger bulk density and medium textured the risk of yield reduction of fruit trees under di was lower and the increase of wue was higher soil texture and bulk density synergistically determine soil aperture and compactness lebron et al 2002 which successively affect soil water conservation capacity and aeration perrier et al 1996 rajkai et al 2015 fine textured soil with more clay and less sand has smaller soil aperture and poor aeration mentges et al 2016 but the soil water conservation capacity is better kumar et al 2020 while coarse textured soil is the opposite medium textured soil has a water conservation capacity and aeration capacity between fine textured and coarse textured soils larger bulk density improves the compactness of medium textured soil and enhances the water conservation capacity of the soil but it will reduce soil aeration hakansson and lipiec 2000 adopting di reduces soil moisture which results in the improvement of soil aeration and soil moisture environment turner 2019 it ensures the growth and development of fruit trees and has little effect on yield 4 4 suitable conditions and limitations in order to maximize yield and wue benefits and determine appropriate conditions for di of fruit trees a win win analysis was conducted on collected data fig 7 shows five zones of fruit tree yield and wue responses to di zone a showed a positive response in both fruit tree yield and wue conversely zone c presented a negative response in both fruit tree yield and wue which was recommended to be avoided in practice zone b and zone d had partial positive responses and negative responses of fruit tree yield and wue which were comprehensively considered to obtain yield increase or water saving zone e presented a situation with the most negligible yield loss effect sizes were larger than average thereby zone a and e were considered as the aim area in practice according to the results 161 data points in zone a and e accounted for 51 11 of total data there were 80 and 74 data points in zone c and d respectively but the data point in zone b is 0 indicating that no condition increased yield but reduced wue under di compared to full irrigation table 1 illustrated the distribution of factors in each zone for deficit degrees low and moderate degrees of di tended to maximize the benefits of yield and wue and effect sizes accounted for 53 96 and 56 32 in zone a and zone e respectively for the timing of di effect sizes of bud burst to leafing stage stage ⅰ and flowering to fruit set stage stage ⅱ accounted for the largest distribution in zone a and zone e which were 72 86 and 59 68 respectively while the effect size of the fruit growth stage stage ⅲ accounted for the smallest proportion 18 60 for irrigation methods subsurface irrigation methods such as bubbled root irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation achieved di more effectively and effect sizes accounted for 76 19 and 64 84 in zone a and e respectively for fruit tree varieties and climate regions jujube trees and pear trees drought resistant varieties in arid regions accounted for a larger proportion in zones a and e for soil factors applying di with large bulk density and medium textured soil achieved better results however our study still has some limitations for fruit trees fruit quality is one of the important indicators of fruit trees but quality indicators of each fruit tree variety are different for example grapes are more focused on the content of anthocyanin because it is conducive to the production of wine and the increase of flavonol content in wine garcia et al 2011 makris et al 2006 consequently the effects of quality are not considered in this study moreover results in asia accounted for a large proportion which will lead to insufficient representativeness when providing references for other regions therefore it is recommended to select multiple regions to increase sample representativeness in prospective di experiments 5 conclusions in this study the effects of di on fruit yield and wue were quantitatively analyzed by meta analysis overall compared to full irrigation employing di reduced fruit tree yield by 6 05 and increased wue by 5 05 but the effectiveness of di was affected by di factors deficit degree timing and irrigation methods fruit tree varieties and environmental factors climate regions and soil factors our result showed that di performed better with a low or moderate degree deficit irrigation limit 55 θ f which can reduce the risk of fruit tree yield reduction while greatly improving wue using di before the fruit growth stage i e bud burst to leafing stage or flowering to fruit set stage is more appropriate for fruit trees bubbled root irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation were more beneficial for fruit tree yield and wue than furrow irrigation small tube irrigation and surface drip irrigation under di in arid regions yield and wue with drought tolerant fruit trees under di were higher than that of water sensitive fruit trees in humid regions in the soil with large bulk density 1 4 g cm³ and medium textured the risk of yield reduction for fruit trees under di was smaller and wue significantly was increased importantly a win win analysis showed proportions of various subgroups in the aim area zone a zone e to determine appropriate conditions for di of fruit trees our findings provide a suitable di strategy for fruit trees and suggest that di is a promising water saving and yield increasing in practice declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

n e and n c were the sample sizes of the target variable in the experimental group and control group respectively for the effect size of each study weighted integration calculation the overall effect size was obtained the weight of each study w i the overall effect size l n rr and the 95 confidence interval 95 ci were calculated as follows w i 1 v i l n rr i 1 k w i lnr i i 1 k w i 95 c i l n r r 1 96 1 i 1 k w i where v i was the sum of variance vi between each study data and the variance between studies t2 namely v i v i t 2 if the 95 ci does not overlap with 0 it is considered that there is a significant difference between full irrigation and di l n rr will be calculated by e lnrr 1 100 when lnrr 0 0 and 0 it means positive effect negative effect and little or no effect respectively the meta analysis was conducted in metawin 2 1 software funnel plots and forest plots were mapped by stata se 12 1 software and origin 2018 software respectively 2 3 publication heterogeneity and bias in order to explore the heterogeneity between studies qt value based on chi square test was selected as examining the heterogeneity in studies higgins and thompson 2002 the significant value of qt p 0 05 indicates that the effect size is not equal in each study which means that other variables are affecting the results and the random effect model should be selected on the contrary the fixed effect model should be selected the calculation formula for qt was as follows q t i 1 n w i ln r i 2 ln r i 2 i 1 n w i ln r i 2 i 1 n w i ln r i 2 i 1 n w i due to the heterogeneity among studies the qt and p values of yield and wue were 1656 34 p 0 001 and 1137 52 p 0 001 respectively a random effect model was used in this study the funnel chart is used to assess whether each variable is biased in the entire database irwig et al 1998 as shown in fig 1 the yield and wue were symmetrical indicating that there was no publication bias 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset the database was collected from 38 published papers in 7 countries including 315 pairs of observations of fruit yield and wue data under di effect sizes of fruit tree yield and wue were normally distributed fig 2 overall compared to full irrigation di reduced fruit tree yield by 6 05 95 ci 6 83 to 5 27 but increased wue by 5 05 95 ci 4 04 to 6 09 fig 3 the result demonstrated that although there might be a risk of yield reduction of fruit trees in di wue was highly improved however there was significant heterogeneity in the random effect of yield and wue it is necessary to use subgroup data to reveal specific effects of di factors fruit tree varieties and environmental factors climate regions and soil factors on fruit tree yield and wue to determine a better strategy for fruit trees under di 3 2 di factors effect sizes of di factors on fruit tree yield and wue were affected by deficit degree timing and irrigation methods fig 4 across all studies of deficit degree effect sizes of low and moderate degree on fruit tree yield were significantly different from severe degree compared to the full irrigation effect sizes of the low and moderate degree on fruit tree yield were 3 55 and 4 13 respectively but the effect size of the severe degree on yield was as high as 11 50 fig 4a the same trend was observed for wue low and moderate deficit degrees significantly increased wue by 6 67 and 7 99 respectively while severe deficit degree increased wue only by 0 49 fig 4b therefore appropriate water deficits low or moderate degree declined the risk of fruit tree yield reduction with improving wue significantly considering the timing of di employing di at stage ⅰ stage ⅱ or stage ⅳ had little impact on fruit tree yield compared to full irrigation with effect sizes of 0 33 1 28 and 3 50 respectively however fruit tree yield was a notably negative impact by employing di at stage ⅲ or the whole stage which effect sizes were 14 78 and 11 11 respectively fig 4 c di conducted at stage ⅰ stage ⅱ stage ⅳ or the whole stage all improved wue of fruit trees compared to full irrigation increments were 6 34 8 51 5 00 and 10 21 but di at stage ⅲ noticeably reduced wue 2 55 fig 4 d consequently it is recommended that di conducted at stage ⅰ or stage ⅱ before stage ⅲ was more suitable for improving the yield and wue of fruit trees not only fruit tree yield was decreased not significantly or even increased slightly but also wue was enormously improved in terms of irrigation methods the application of furrow irrigation surface drip irrigation and small tube irrigation for di resulted in a large reduction in fruit yield by 6 01 4 41 and 8 98 respectively compared to full irrigation besides adopting the bubbled root irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation for di had no significant effect on yield 1 19 2 46 and 1 10 1 19 fig 4 e for wue when adopting subsurface drip irrigation furrow irrigation and bubbled root irrigation di improved fruit tree wue effectively among them bubbled root irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation had the most obvious increase with the increase exceeding 10 00 11 74 and 12 11 respectively employing small tube irrigation 0 55 3 61 and surface drip irrigation 1 69 1 17 for di had no significant effect on wue fig 4 f these results displayed that using subsurface irrigation methods such as bubbled root irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation for di could achieve a win win situation for saving water and increasing yield 3 3 fruit tree varieties fruit trees varieties have different sensitivity to water conditions thereby the response of yield and wue to di may be quite different rahmati et al 2018 fig 5 shows the effect of fruit tree varieties on fruit tree yield and wue under di compared to full irrigation the application of di to jujube and pear trees had no significant effect on yield 0 42 3 23 and 0 36 2 04 whereas yields of peach grape and apple trees were decreased by 5 89 7 46 and 10 16 respectively fig 5 a furthermore the application of di was improved the wue of jujube apple pear and peach trees among them pear and peach trees were increased significantly by 18 59 and 21 98 respectively but wue of grape trees was decreased by 0 73 fig 5 b hence di might be suitable for drought tolerant fruit trees such as jujube and pear tree while it is not recommended for water sensitive trees due to the high risk of yield reduction 3 4 climate regions and soil factors effect sizes of di on fruit tree yield and wue were affected by climate regions soil texture and soil bulk density fig 6 using di in arid and humid regions reduced fruit tree yield but improved wue the reduction of fruit tree yield in arid regions was smaller than that in humid regions compared to full irrigation fruit tree yield in arid and humid regions were decreased by 5 86 and 7 87 respectively fig 6 a wue was increased by 3 08 and 8 67 respectively fig 6 b therefore it is evident that di was suitable for application in arid regions as the basis of crop production and development soil provides a stable growth environment for the root zone of fruit trees day et al 2010 while the soil environment is affected by factors such as bulk density and texture campbell and hawkins 2003 employing di in soil with larger bulk density reduced fruit tree yield and increased wue significantly when the soil bulk density was greater than 1 4 g cm³ and lower than 1 4 g cm³ fruit tree yield was reduced by 4 38 and 12 77 and wue was increased by 7 30 and 3 13 respectively fig 6 c and fig 6 d as for soil textures adopting di in different soil textures reduced fruit tree yield with medium textured soils fruit trees had the smallest yield reduction of 5 37 while with fine and coarse textured soils fruit tree yield was reduced by 12 67 and 6 10 respectively fig 6 e applying di in different soil textures all increased wue especially medium textured soils had the highest increase of 8 34 while fine and coarse textured soils were only increased by 1 91 and 3 40 respectively fig 6 f therefore it was in the soil with a large bulk density 1 4 g cm³ and medium textured that the risk of yield reduction for fruit trees under di was smaller and wue was significantly increased 4 discussion our study implicated that the application of di on fruit trees might have a risk of yield reduction but limited water resources would be fully utilized however fruit tree yield and wue were not only affected by irrigation but also closely related to fruit tree varieties climate and soil factors therefore it is necessary to identify how these factors affected fruit tree yield and wue and determine the management strategy of di to increase fruit tree yield and wue simultaneously 4 1 di factors effect on yield and wue a low or moderate degree of water deficits decreased the risk of fruit tree yield reduction while increased significantly wue figs 4a and 4b the previous study demonstrated that an appropriate water deficit can affect the distribution of photosynthetic products to different tissues and organs of fruit trees ma et al 2015 this process will prompt assimilates transfer to the root system spontaneously increasing root vitality li et al 2011 ma et al 2010 fruit trees will reduce excess vegetative growth of the above ground part and supply suitable nutrients for reproductive growth hence fruit tree yield is less affected bissuel belaygue et al 2002 lilley and fukai 1994 simultaneously compared to full irrigation using di reduces the amount of irrigation water for fruit trees thereby significantly increasing wue liang et al 2018 however applying a severe water deficit of di the water absorption capacity of fruit tree roots will be reduced consequently roots cannot be fully restored after re watering asseng et al 1998 which seriously affects the normal growth of fruit trees resulting in a sharp decline in fruit tree yield using di at bud burst to leafing stage stage ⅰ or flowering to fruit set stage stage ⅱ of fruit trees improved wue significantly without reducing yield or even increasing yield slightly compared to full irrigation results were expected because bud burst to leafing stage stage ⅰ and flowering to fruit set stage stage ⅱ are the most active stages for fruit tree branches growing reyes et al 2016 in these two stages adopting di can not only inhibit the excessive vegetative growth of fruit trees effectively but also reduce the number of excess branches remarkably girona et al 2005 perez pastor et al 2014 ruiz sanchez et al 2010 besides the expansion process of fruit tissue cells is inhibited and photosynthetic metabolites are accumulated goufo et al 2017 hein et al 2016 hura et al 2011 after re watering these metabolites can be used for cell wall synthesis and other processes related to fruit growth fabregas and fernie 2019 luan 2002 zhao et al 2017 so that the growth of fruit trees is compensated and fruit tree yield will not be significantly affected however the fruit growth stage stage ⅲ and the fruit maturation stage stage ⅳ are essential stages of fruit growth and development which are sensitive to water ma et al 2007 using di at these two stages will directly affect fruit growth resulting in a significant decline in yield irrigation methods also significantly affected fruit tree yield and wue figs 4e and 4f subsurface irrigation methods such as bubbled root irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation achieved a win win situation of water saving and yield increasing it is plausible that emitters for subsurface drip irrigation and bubbled root irrigation are buried in the subsurface soil which can transport water and fertilizer to the root zone of fruit trees camp 1998 fu et al 2021 furthermore subsurface emitters inhibit evaporation of surface soil water effectively communar and friedman 2010 the water environment where the root system developing is more suitable for root growth and the root growth will be more vigorous el nesr et al 2014 ma et al 2020 it will cause that the ability of fruit trees to cope with water stress is stronger gao et al 2020 polania et al 2017 therefore the fruit tree yield is less affected however furrow irrigation and small tube irrigation can cause water distribution uniformity and inefficient utilization araujo et al 2019 due to a long time for water to reach the roots of fruit trees similarly surface drip irrigation has low utilization efficiency since large water evaporation on the soil surface umair et al 2019 these irrigation methods are a tendency to lower water use efficiency which is unable to meet the requirements of the growth environment of fruit tree roots under di 4 2 climate regions and fruit tree varieties effect on yield and wue the results showed that di was more suitable for drought tolerant fruit trees such as jujube and pear in arid regions drought tolerant fruit trees are more resistant to drought when fruit trees are subjected to water stress the xylem of roots tends to transmit aba signals to leaves with a decreased stomatal aperture and water loss christmann et al 2007 farrell et al 2017 jiang and zhang 2004 besides the cell osmotic adjustment ability of drought tolerant fruit trees is stronger it is easier to accumulate solutes in tissue cells to maintain certain turgor pressure at the water stress phase del carmen gijon et al 2011 lemcoff et al 2002 tan et al 1992 after re watering cell turgor pressure is more conducive to maintaining cell water and various metabolic processes in fruit trees borchert 1994 thereby the risk of fruit tree yield reduction is declined conversely tree varieties planted in humid regions mostly have poor drought tolerance ability and are more sensitive to water these trees have the weak ability of stomatal regulation cell osmotic adjustment and growth compensation generating the risk of yield reduction 4 3 soil factors effect on yield and wue in the soil with larger bulk density and medium textured the risk of yield reduction of fruit trees under di was lower and the increase of wue was higher soil texture and bulk density synergistically determine soil aperture and compactness lebron et al 2002 which successively affect soil water conservation capacity and aeration perrier et al 1996 rajkai et al 2015 fine textured soil with more clay and less sand has smaller soil aperture and poor aeration mentges et al 2016 but the soil water conservation capacity is better kumar et al 2020 while coarse textured soil is the opposite medium textured soil has a water conservation capacity and aeration capacity between fine textured and coarse textured soils larger bulk density improves the compactness of medium textured soil and enhances the water conservation capacity of the soil but it will reduce soil aeration hakansson and lipiec 2000 adopting di reduces soil moisture which results in the improvement of soil aeration and soil moisture environment turner 2019 it ensures the growth and development of fruit trees and has little effect on yield 4 4 suitable conditions and limitations in order to maximize yield and wue benefits and determine appropriate conditions for di of fruit trees a win win analysis was conducted on collected data fig 7 shows five zones of fruit tree yield and wue responses to di zone a showed a positive response in both fruit tree yield and wue conversely zone c presented a negative response in both fruit tree yield and wue which was recommended to be avoided in practice zone b and zone d had partial positive responses and negative responses of fruit tree yield and wue which were comprehensively considered to obtain yield increase or water saving zone e presented a situation with the most negligible yield loss effect sizes were larger than average thereby zone a and e were considered as the aim area in practice according to the results 161 data points in zone a and e accounted for 51 11 of total data there were 80 and 74 data points in zone c and d respectively but the data point in zone b is 0 indicating that no condition increased yield but reduced wue under di compared to full irrigation table 1 illustrated the distribution of factors in each zone for deficit degrees low and moderate degrees of di tended to maximize the benefits of yield and wue and effect sizes accounted for 53 96 and 56 32 in zone a and zone e respectively for the timing of di effect sizes of bud burst to leafing stage stage ⅰ and flowering to fruit set stage stage ⅱ accounted for the largest distribution in zone a and zone e which were 72 86 and 59 68 respectively while the effect size of the fruit growth stage stage ⅲ accounted for the smallest proportion 18 60 for irrigation methods subsurface irrigation methods such as bubbled root irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation achieved di more effectively and effect sizes accounted for 76 19 and 64 84 in zone a and e respectively for fruit tree varieties and climate regions jujube trees and pear trees drought resistant varieties in arid regions accounted for a larger proportion in zones a and e for soil factors applying di with large bulk density and medium textured soil achieved better results however our study still has some limitations for fruit trees fruit quality is one of the important indicators of fruit trees but quality indicators of each fruit tree variety are different for example grapes are more focused on the content of anthocyanin because it is conducive to the production of wine and the increase of flavonol content in wine garcia et al 2011 makris et al 2006 consequently the effects of quality are not considered in this study moreover results in asia accounted for a large proportion which will lead to insufficient representativeness when providing references for other regions therefore it is recommended to select multiple regions to increase sample representativeness in prospective di experiments 5 conclusions in this study the effects of di on fruit yield and wue were quantitatively analyzed by meta analysis overall compared to full irrigation employing di reduced fruit tree yield by 6 05 and increased wue by 5 05 but the effectiveness of di was affected by di factors deficit degree timing and irrigation methods fruit tree varieties and environmental factors climate regions and soil factors our result showed that di performed better with a low or moderate degree deficit irrigation limit 55 θ f which can reduce the risk of fruit tree yield reduction while greatly improving wue using di before the fruit growth stage i e bud burst to leafing stage or flowering to fruit set stage is more appropriate for fruit trees bubbled root irrigation and subsurface drip irrigation were more beneficial for fruit tree yield and wue than furrow irrigation small tube irrigation and surface drip irrigation under di in arid regions yield and wue with drought tolerant fruit trees under di were higher than that of water sensitive fruit trees in humid regions in the soil with large bulk density 1 4 g cm³ and medium textured the risk of yield reduction for fruit trees under di was smaller and wue significantly was increased importantly a win win analysis showed proportions of various subgroups in the aim area zone a zone e to determine appropriate conditions for di of fruit trees our findings provide a suitable di strategy for fruit trees and suggest that di is a promising water saving and yield increasing in practice declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9806,satellite remote sensing based surface energy balance seb techniques have emerged as useful tools for quantifying spatialized actual evapotranspiration at various temporal and spatial scales however discontinuous data acquisitions and or gaps in image acquisition due to cloud cover can limit the applicability of satellite remote sensing rs in agriculture water management where continuous time series of daily crop actual evapotranspiration etc act are more valued the aim of the research is to construct continuous time series of daily etc act starting from temporal estimates of actual evapotranspiration obtained by seb modelling eta eb on landsat tm images sebal model was integrated with the fao 56 evaporation model rs retrieved vegetative biomass dynamics by ndvi and on field

the integrated modeling approach showed a good reproduction of the time series dynamics of observed etc act r2 0 71 mae 0 54 mm d 1 rmse 0 73 mm d 1 a daily and a cumulative monthly temporal analysis showed the importance of integrating parameters that capture changes in the soil plant atmosphere spa continuum between landsat acquisitions the comparison with daily etc act obtained by the referenced et fraction etrf method that considers only weather variability by eto confirmed the lead of the proposed procedure in the spring early summer periods when vegetation biomass changes and soil water evaporation have a significant weight in the et process the applied modelling approach was also robust in constructing the missing etc act data under scenarios of limited cloud free landsat acquisitions the presented integrated approach has a great potential for the near real time monitoring and scheduling of irrigation practices further testing of this approach with diverse dataset and the integration with the soil water modeling is to be analyzed in future work keywords surface energy balance evaporation transpiration ndvi soil moisture eddy covariance 1 introduction evapotranspiration et in arid and semi arid environments is a major component of the hydrological cycle and one of the most important physical processes of the land surface in agriculture quantifying the spatial variability and the temporal dynamic of et at the field or larger spatial scales is of great importance for irrigation scheduling identifying water productivity and water use efficiency molden et al 2010 stanhill 1986 these activities are particularly relevant in the modern precision agriculture applications over large areas such as irrigation districts or basins time series of spatialized evapotranspiration data serve for assessing crop water requirements for adapting collective irrigation schemes and for planning an optimal allocation of water resources in the coming years with the reduced availability of natural water resources and increased water consumption in agriculture masia et al 2021 recursively updated et maps will serve for designing or validating strategies of adaptation to climatic changes local measurements of evapotranspiration such as lysimeters or micrometeorological methods i e bowen ratio eddy covariance and scintillometers have proven to be reliable to measure crop actual evapotranspiration and can be considered as the references against which spatialized etc act estimation methods could be validated however local measurements are considered labor and cost intensive droogers et al 2000 elhaddad and garcia 2008 and are rarely available worldwide ochoa sánchez et al 2019 the spatial extrapolation or interpolation of local etc act measurements over larger spatial scales is problematic moreover it cannot be representative of land cover and or management practices diverse from those of the measurement site in this context comes the need to find reliable and non expensive alternative procedures capable of quantifying the spatial variability of etc act both on the field and at larger spatial scales this issue directed part of the scientific research towards developing and fine tuning of mathematical models capable of providing a detailed description of mass and energy exchange processes in the soil plant atmosphere spa continuum in parallel a significant effort was given to integrating modeling and observations from satellite or aerial platforms with the scope of computing spatialized etc act values low cost remote sensing techniques can be used to retrieve the space time variability of numerous physical variables needed in the applications of the etc act modeling bastiaanssen et al 2000 d urso 2001 kustas et al 2003 menenti 2000 morse et al 2000 for example mathematical modeling based on the application of hydrological balance in the spa system can benefit from data operating in the visible and near infrared vis nir regions of the electromagnetic spectrum for the retrieval of the biophysical properties of the vegetation cover d urso 2001 consoli and vanella 2014 on the other hand surface energy balance seb based approaches can use in addition to the data acquired in the vis and nir regions those acquired in the thermal infrared tir for the estimation of eta eb as a residual of the seb equation after quantifying the rest of the instantaneous fluxes gowda et al 2008 wagle et al 2017 bhattarai et al 2016 maltese et al 2018 minacapilli et al 2016 seb models like sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a sebs su 2002 and metric allen et al 2007 are single source seb models that treat a pixel as a single transfer layer wagle et al 2017 other dual source seb based models such as tseb norman et al 1995 and the stseb häusler et al 2018 parametrize and differentiate between the radiative and convective exchange processes between soil and vegetation and the atmosphere timmermans et al 2007 satellite based seb models have been applied and validated extensively in various parts of the world awada et al 2021 allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998b bhattarai et al 2016 maltese et al 2018 timmermans et al 2007 such modelling approaches has been widely applied in irrigation management allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 2001 1996 senay et al 2017 water accounting molden and sakthivadivel 1999 assessing irrigation system performance akbari et al 2007 al zayed et al 2015 awada et al 2019 agricultural water productivity blatchford et al 2018 zwart et al 2010 groundwater management ahmad et al 2005 2014 rodell et al 2009 and hydrological modelling cammalleri et al 2010 droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 immerzeel and droogers 2008 muthuwatta et al 2010 satellite based seb approaches can capture large geographical extents and provide eta eb estimations at different spatial and temporal scales however some limitations to the use of the satellite images still exist due to the platform s spatial resolutions revisit times and the cloudiness at the overpass times for example the aatsr envisat the modis and the sentinel 3 satellites have a short revisit time 1 day but a 1000 m spatial resolution of the thermal infrared the use of these data in eta eb modelling is limited to the spatial extent of the tir data and is not recommended in fragmented and heterogeneous agriculture especially when the parcels are smaller than the tir pixel alternatively relatively high spatial resolution tir imagery from 60 to 120 m can be obtained from platforms such as landsat and aster however images are available every 16 days if clear sky condition exists at the overpass time mccabe and wood 2006 found a high degree of consistency of eta eb retrievals from landsat and aster and showed that low spatial resolution modis based estimates were unable to discriminate the influence of land surface heterogeneity at the field spatial scale the ecosystem spaceborne thermal radiometer experiment on space station ecostress recently launched measures tir data along an irregular non polar orbit at a 70 m spatial resolution and an overpass time of 1 5 days this represents a significant improvement in terms of temporal sampling of land surface temperature lst required to derive reliable eta eb products at the field scale however ecostress is a thermal only experimental sensor it does not provide data for high latitudes and its use in seb modeling is dependent on vswir visible to shortwave infrared bands data from other platforms for agricultural applications e g irrigation scheduling or water resources management etc act values are required on a daily basis over extended periods e g irrigation season allen et al 2007 and with a fine spatial scale e g agricultural field several approaches have been proposed to produce continuous data series of daily etc act at the field scale by using remote sensing techniques bisquert et al 2016 and kustas et al 2003 applied disaggregation techniques to downscale the tir data of modis to the spatial resolution of vis nir of spot 5 10 m spatial resolution and 5 day revisit time other researchers downscaled the tir data from low resolution sensors modis aatsr or sentinel 3 to the spatial scale of medium high resolution sensors aster landsat bindhu et al 2013 bisquert et al 2016 olivera guerra et al 2017 besides disaggregation techniques data fusion methods are based on the spectral and spatial relationship between an existing high low resolution image pair cammalleri et al 2013 gao et al 2006 semmens et al 2016 bhattarai et al 2014 ma et al 2018 this relationship is used to realize high spatial resolution data for dates when only the low resolution images are available bisquert et al 2016 however methods that fuse intermediate variables directly related to the evapotranspiration process vegetation indices vi and lst are subject to several limitations indeed remote sensing parameters e g bit parameters bandwidth acquisition time and spectral response function acquired from different satellite sensors on the same date may not provide comparable data ma et al 2018 another limitation is that rs platforms used in these approaches have different acquisition times during the day furthermore modeling the dynamics of these intermediate variables used in etc act retrieval can add uncertainties differently from the above mentioned approaches which integrate data from different platforms other authors awada et al 2019 allen et al 2007 alfieri et al 2017 singh et al 2012 trezza et al 2013 used the daily actual crop coefficient as a reference to construct the continuous times series of daily etc act starting from eta eb determined by rs seb models in cloud free image acquisition days precisely a so called referenced et fraction etrf unitless is computed as eta eb eto on the image acquisition days and used together with the daily changes of daily reference crop evapotranspiration eto continuously monitored in a weather station to drive the etc act changes in the other days in the etc act construction period between the acquisition days the etrf is kept constant or is changed by interpolation using this daily etc act construction approach some authors considered that typically one or two cloud free landsat images are considered enough to derive monthly etc act allen et al 2007 bhattarai et al 2012 conversely trezza et al 2018 considered that the estimation error in monthly etc act is relatively high when image availability is limited to an eight day revisit time satellite data and suggested a four day revisit time to robustly represent time integrated etc act estimates over months and growing seasons alfieri et al 2017 assessed daily etc act estimations derived using different temporal autocorrelation reference variables including the eto and interpolation methods they found that a return interval of earth observations of a minimum of five days is necessary to estimate daily etc act with relative errors smaller than 20 moreover constructing the time series of daily etc act by the etrf approach considers the variability of the meteorological inputs embedded in the daily eto still it cannot account for the effect of soil moisture dynamics due to precipitation irrigation and etc act plant stress and or the vegetation biomass changes i e crop development cuttings in case of forage crops that occur between images acquisitions besides methods involving the linear or cubic spline interpolation of etrf allen et al 2007 singh et al 2012 limit the applicability for near real time modelling of daily etc act this paper proposes a simple integrated model based procedure to construct the daily etc act data between satellite image acquisition days the dynamics of meteorological variables vegetation biomass changes and or plant stress caused by soil water restriction drive the etc act changes between different acquisitions to estimate eta eb on image acquisition days we applied the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998a the model was selected because of its relative simplicity and low requirement for ancillary data moreover it was extensively applied and validated over a range of environmental conditions and vegetation types awada et al 2021 bastiaanssen et al 2002 2005 1998b li and zhao 2010 zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 sebal was applied with landsat 5 thematic mapper tm images and limited meteorological inputs the integrated etc act construction procedure was tested over a vineyard with partial soil coverage in the south of sardinia island italy the etc act construction approach combines the daily values of eto remotely sensed vegetation indices observed soil moisture in the root zone and a modeling approach for the soil water evaporation specifically the research was carried out with the following objectives i constructing a continuous time series of daily etc act values for the vegetation period of a vineyard starting from few eta eb data estimated by sebal daily eto ndvi from satellite and on field observed soil moisture ii evaluating the performance of the proposed methodology by comparison with in situ eddy covariance ec flux measurements 2 the core structure of the daily etc act construction procedure to obtain the continuous time series of daily etc act the actual evapotranspiration obtained by a seb model on acquisition days is integrated with an etc act construction modelling procedure this latter accounts for the temporal dynamics of daily eto satellite derived vegetation indices soil moisture data and includes a water balance modelling approach for the estimation of canopy water interception and soil water evaporation thus the procedure accounts for changes in daily weather vegetative biomass and plant water stress that occur between the tir satellite data acquisitions the proposed etc act construction approach computes separately the daily actual values of canopy water interception ic soil water evaporation es and crop actual transpiration tc act the canopy water interception and soil water evaporation are modeled on an hourly

datalogger campbell scientific logan ut usa instruments were set up at 2 8 m above the ground and the studied vineyard is located on a flat surface surrounded by other vineyards the instrumentation height was decided after preliminary footprint analysis the minimum distance from the end of the canopy is 150 m and the footprint analysis carried out during all the measurements period confirmed that we were sampling the vineyard canopy the fetch was estimated at about 500 m in all directions as reported in marras et al 2016 instrument positioning was also the result of several years of experience measuring eddy fluxes over vineyards indicating that fluxes are not affected by the surface roughness data were acquired at 10 hz and covariances were calculated every 30 min the station

data were used to run the sebal model and to compute the hourly and daily reference evapotranspiration eto by the penman monteith method marras et al 2016 evaluated the energy balance closure during the years 2009 and 2010 by comparing the available energy rn g to the turbulent fluxes that is the sum of latent λet and sensible h heat fluxes the average observed energy balance closure was 87 and the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 9 a discrepancy between 20 and 30 from the ideal 100 closure is commonly observed in surface energy budget measurements wilson et al 2002 allen et al 2011 considered that measurements with 15 energy budget closure error are reliable in this paper the studied period was restricted from april to november 2010 which was the period from the bud break to the harvesting of the vineyard the measured fluxes were corrected by forcing the energy closure using the bowen ratio half hour data quality was evaluated by the energy balance closure cr by rationing available energy to the turbulent flux components wilson et al 2002 prueger et al 2005 suggested that cr was assessed for rn greater than 100 w m 2 the half hour energy budget closure was considered satisfactory when cr 0 85 prueger et al 2005 wilson et al 2002 for lesser cr the energy budget closure was forced by attributing rn g to h and λet with the preservation of the bowen ratio β defined as

obtain daily latent heat flux densities mj m 2 d 1 and converted to daily actual evapotranspiration values etc act ec mm d 1 the etc act ec values were used as a reference for evaluating the performance of the integrated etc act construction model the model results were considered acceptable if the differences between simulated and observed actual crop evapotranspiration values were in range of commonly observed eddy covariance seb closure errors 20 as reported by wilson et al 2002 model results with errors less than 15 were considered good estimations in reference to reliable eddy

two landsat acquisitions 3 7 the stress index ks the crop water stress was simulated considering the observed soil moisture changes the dimensionless weighed stress index ks was derived from the relative water deficit in the different soil layers of the root zone jarvis 1989 ks was computed considering an effective root depth of 0 6 m the soil moisture at each centimeter of the root zone i 0

of the sebal model the sebal model performance was evaluated at the image acquisition days in comparison with the on field ec observations this type of analysis is significant as the sebal performance influences the whole etc act j construction process there was a good agreement between modeled eta eb and observed etc act ec fig 4 the comparison yielded a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 96 and a mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse of 0 39 mm d 1 and 0 48 mm d 1 respectively furthermore a non parametric mann whitney test suggested no significant difference between the observed ec data and sebal estimations and that the null hypothesis can be accepted at significance level α of 0 05 galleguillos et al 2011 found a rmse of 0 48 mm d 1 comparing the performance of the s sebi model estimates of daily evapotranspiration to ec observations over a mediterranean vineyard and applied on 11 aster images in another drip irrigated vineyard the metric model applied on 13 landsat images overestimated the ec observed data with an average error of 9 an rmse of 0 62 mm d 1and a mae of 0 50 mm d 1 carrasco benavides et al 2012 knipper et al 2019 applied the alexi disalexi surface energy balance model with a large dataset of landsat images over a vineyard and obtained an average estimation error of 15 and a mae and rmse of 0 58 mm d 1 and 0 76 mm d 1 respectively the overall average sebal estimation error was 11 8 the performance of the model on single days was within the error bounds of the state of the art et instruments 20 except for eta eb estimates on the 21st of april and 10th of july that overestimated the observed etc act ec by 29 and 21 these two acquisitions days fall in a period where the measured data seb closure errors were exacerbated as observed by marras et al 2016 and therefore the tendency to misestimate etc act ec can be partly attributed to issues with the flux measurements closure and not the sebal model alone 4 2 performance of the integrated daily etc act construction procedure fig 5 compares the daily etc act derived from the integrated construction procedure to the measured daily actual evapotranspiration etc act ec from the 21st of april doy 111 to the 6th of november 2010 doy 310 on average the modeled etc act slightly underestimated the observed data a non parametric mann whitney test suggested no significant difference between etc act and etc act ec at significance level α of 0 05 the average error of the etc act estimations for the whole studied period was 18 the comparison statistics r2 0 71 mae 0 54 mm d 1 rmse 0 73 mm d 1 could be judged satisfactory considering that in addition to sebal estimation errors and systematic eddy covariance energy balance closure uncertainties the etc act j construction approach superimposes different kinds of simplifications an example is the assumption of linearity between the crop water uptake vegetation indices and crop water stress coefficients eq 2 such assumptions become less important as the time between acquisition days reduces as for short time intervals also non linear processes could be linearized with a sufficient degree of precision hence the application of eq 2 potentially benefits from the relatively high availability of clear sky image acquisitions which could be provided by the upcoming capability of rs systems in capturing rapid changes even in the tir domain see section 4 3 for further discussion moreover several studies carried out in different areas supported a linear crop coefficient vi relationships beeri et al 2019 campos et al 2010 consoli and vanella 2014 consoli and barbagallo 2012 o connell et al 2011 in opposition er raki et al 2013 used for a vineyard an exponential equation for fitting the experimental crop coefficient vi relationship however also their relationship can be approximated by a linear regression without losing the goodness of fit furthermore the direct proportionality of crop water uptake and water stress coefficients is at the basis of the ks stress coefficient estimation in the fao 56 approach for modelling actual crop evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 the linearity between the crop water uptake vis and crop water stress coefficients was embedded in several modelling approaches and was sufficient for assessing actual etc for irrigation requirements in several crops including vineyards and orchards campos et al 2010 consoli and vanella 2014 consoli and barbagallo 2012 pôças et al 2015 rallo and provenzano 2013 in this application due to data limitation the daily vegetation indices time series was obtained by linear interpolation between two landsat acquisitions this could misrepresent the real vegetative biomass dynamic thus the temporal change of the transpiration mass and the fractional cover mainly when the time gap between two cloud free acquisitions is long however the good performance of the etc act j construction approach particularly in the period of low vegetation cover after the bud break where the evaporative component prevailed suggests that the landsat derived and interpolated vegetation indices were able to simulate the transpiration mass canopy water interception and evaporative surface furthermore the current presence of diverse spaceborne systems with a higher spatial resolution and lower revisit time can better represent the vegetation dynamics even if the vegetation dynamics between two acquisitions is still retrieved by linear interpolation platforms such as the sentinels 2 can capture the 5 days vegetation changes in cloud free conditions at a relatively high spatial resolution 10 m an additional analysis was performed to separate the effect of sebal eta eb estimation errors on the performance of the etc act j construction procedure the model was executed by substituting the eta eb by the observed etc act ec data in the selected landsat acquisition days in this way errors in the constructed etc act j can be attributed to the model structure keeping in mind observed seb closure uncertainties using the observed ec data instead of eta eb yielded a performance r2 0 72 mae 0 56 mm d 1 rmse 0 78 mm d 1 in average comparable to that reported in fig 5 this analysis may indicate that both sebal model estimation errors and seb closure errors in the considered acquisition days had a similar weight on the performance of the integrated construction procedure in addition to the statistical performance metrics documented in fig 5 and in aims to further analyze the performance of the integrated etc act construction model the temporal dynamics of etc act j and etc act ec are plotted in fig 6a the proposed procedure reproduced efficiently the general etc act ec trend the modeled and observed actual et show similar patterns of monthly and daily variability the integrated approach allowed adequately simulating actual et under contrasting dry and wet conditions once again the best performance was obtained from late july to november where marras et al 2016 observed the better energy balance closure for the ec data the worst performance was noticed in the early summer from doy 175 198 due to the sebal underestimation of the observed etc act ec on doy 191 however the average error less than 20 was still in the range of accuracy of typical eddy covariance installations 15 30 allen et al 2011 the performance was also satisfactory from april to june from doy 111 175 fig 6a as expected in the early spring period due to the low crop cover the model demonstrated the significant weight of soil water evaporation in the evapotranspiration process still successively the transpiration component prevailed due to the crop cover establishment fig 6b in addition to the increase of the atmospheric water demand in the period april july from about 3 6 mm d 1 the main driver of the increased transpiration fluxes was the vineyard biomass accumulation in this period landsat derived ndvi augmented from 0 18 to 0 51 and the fc from 0 09 to 0 5 in agreement with the trend of on field observed lai that increased from 0 3 to 2 5 marras et al 2016 this highlighted the importance of considering vegetation changes in modelling etc act especially in crops like vines subjected to major changes during the growth cycle in the irrigation period the model simulated significant transpiration values supported by adequate soil water availability and small evaporation peaks resulting from local irrigation interventions the low soil water evaporation was a result of the small wetted soil surface in drip irrigation and the lower energy available at the soil surface due to the higher fractional cover successively the transpiration component declined due to the decrease of atmospheric demand and a slight soil water deficit θ 0 22 fig 2 which was simulated as a moderate plant stress in the etc act construction approach as seen in fig 6b the evaporation model showed notable sensitivity to superficial soil moisture changes due to precipitation and irrigation the distinguished performance of the integrated etc act construction approach during the rainy spring period when evaporative fluxes are significant and vegetation coverage is low supported the importance of integrating a soil water evaporation model in the construction procedure in construction approaches etc act is usually estimated as the product of a scaling factor that must be easy to measure or to estimate every day and to which etc act is largely proportional or positively correlated to show the added value of the proposed integrated etc act construction approach to the forward construction using the referenced et fraction etrf method that considers only meteorological variations we compare in fig 7 and table 2 the observed monthly cumulated etc act ec values with the simulated etc act j and those obtained by the referenced et fraction etc act rf the proposed method yielded good monthly cumulated etc act estimations with errors less than 15 in all considered months it over performed the referenced et fraction etrf method particularly in may and june where biomass changes and soil water evaporation have a significant weight in governing the et process knowing that no soil moisture deficit occurred in this period instead from july to october the monthly performance of the simulated etc act j and etc act rf were similar since the crop actual evapotranspiration changes were more governed by the variations of the atmospheric et demand this factor is accounted for in the etrf method knowing that the vines were not subjected to substantial water stress in this period overall the model showed a better performance in simulating daily etc act values as indicated by the lower mae and rmse table 2 4 3 the sensitivity of the integrated daily etc act construction procedure to tir image availability the proposed etc act j construction approach benefits from the relatively high availability of clear sky image acquisitions nevertheless frequent cloudy sky conditions may hinder an adequate satellite image collection as an example in our application the eta eb estimated by sebal on the 21 april 2010 was propagated forwardly for a month and a half due to the absence of clear sky landsat images till the date of 8 june 2010 in this section we evaluate how the etc act j construction model performs to the temporal availability of sebal retrieved eta eb to do this we hypothesized the worst case that only one clear sky image is available to be processed by sebal for the entire study period the real limitation to be assessed is the presence of cloud free tir data required by the seb models although the upcoming capability of rs systems to capture rapid changes in the tir domain is promising an example is the already operating ecostress sensor that will provide a foundation for the proposed hyperspectral infrared imager hyspiri mission with a five day revisit lee et al 2015 guillevic et al 2019 the copernicus land surface temperature monitoring lstm that will have a spatial resolution of 30 50 m and a temporal resolution lower than three days koetz et al 2018 and the french space agency cnes and the indian space research organization isro trishna satellite mission that will combine high tir spatial resolution 50 m and high revisit capacities of two to three days lagouarde et al 2018 moreover in addition to landsat 8 the recent launch september 2021 of landsat 9 with the tirs 2 and oli 2 instruments aboard will increase the temporal coverage of both vswir and tir data in this sensitivity analysis the ndvi dynamics is still represented by the values interpolated between landsat image acquisitions the eta eb obtained by sebal in the acquisition days reported in table 1 are used within the proposed etc act j construction model one at a time to obtain the complete time series of daily etc act j the eta eb acquired on 21 april was used to forward construct etc act j till the 6th of november the eta eb values in other dates were used for both the forward and backward construction of etc act j between the 21st of april and the 6th of november these applications allowed to obtain modeled etc act j time series homogeneous in length table 3 and fig 8 reports the results of the applied sensitivity analysis the predicted pattern of the daily and cumulated etc act j values were evaluated compared to the observed etc act ec data on average the construction procedure reproduced efficiently the observed daily and cumulated etc act ec data the absolute error in the modeled cumulated etc act did not exceed the 17 of final observed value except for the backward etc act construction using the eta eb of 6 nov the best performance was obtained when the summer values of eta eb were used for etc act j construction the worst performance was obtained for 21 apr and 6 nov where there was a low evapotranspiration this suggested that low values of eta eb such as those obtained in wet spring and autumn should be used with caution for the etc act series construction over long period months overall the sensitivity analysis results suggest that the integrated proposed approach could simulate etc act even in scarce data conditions this integrated modelling approach can sustain and or reduce the need for low revisit intervals of high spatial resolution satellite based tir knowing that an adequate vswir and tir satellite image collections for etc act estimation can still be hindered by frequent cloudy sky conditions although low revisit time systems may provide a significant improvement in temporal sampling to monitor etc act an integrated modelling approach is still required to properly simulate the rapid dynamics of soil plant atmosphere continuum that can be missed even with revisit time of few days in cloud free conditions particularly in intensive irrigated agriculture indeed delogu et al 2021 considered that the future tendency to produce robust etc act estimates at plot scale will probably rely not only on remote sensing data acquired at different wavelengths and or resolutions but also on their combination with local water balance models constrained at regular intervals by eta eb estimates from the tir domain 5 conclusions the paper presented a simple but effective procedure to construct continuous time series of actual evapotranspiration starting from infrequent estimations of eta eb obtained by a seb model applied on landsat satellite data the proposed approach integrated two widely used models the sebal for the retrieval of eta eb on image acquisition days and the fao 56 model to estimate daily soil water evaporation the daily etc act construction approach propagates over time the actual crop transpiration obtained on the satellite image acquisition days by using remotely sensed ndvi and on field measurements of potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture the integrated daily etc act construction procedure reproduced efficiently the observed daily values of etc act ec during the complete vegetative annual cycle of a vineyard with partial soil coverage the temporal analysis of the modeled daily et data stream emphasized the importance of integrating the vegetative biomass dynamics and a soil water evaporation model in the daily etc act construction approach considering the vegetation dynamics through ndvi increase in late spring allowed to account for the rise in the grapevine s transpiration due to the development of the plant green biomass furthermore the evaporation model was fundamental for reproducing the evaporation peaks after significant rain events particularly in the early spring period with low soil coverage nevertheless further testing of the evaporation model should be performed a cumulative monthly comparison with the referenced et fraction etrf method showed the lead of the proposed approach particularly when biomass changes and soil water evaporation have a significant weight in governing the et process the inclusion of a stress coefficient is required for considering the variation of plant transpiration due to soil moisture changes between acquisition days soil moisture data indicated that the studied vineyard suffered of mild water limitation for a short period in late summer which didn t permit a profound analysis of the effect of plant water stress on transpiration more investigation with diverse dataset is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the plant stress correction term in constructing of the transpiration time series the proposed construction approach is well suited for the near real time modelling of daily etc act which is of great importance in water management and irrigation scheduling although in this application the used landsat ndvi data permits only a historical analysis nowadays several available free or low cost satellite platforms can provide ndvi scenes with a range of few days e g sentinels 2 supporting the near real time monitoring of vegetation dynamics moreover this approach can benefit from low revisit time and high spatial resolution systems e g ecostress that may provide a significant improvement in temporal sampling to monitor etc act on plot scale nevertheless results also shown that integrating a local water balance modelling approach that accounts to soil properties and simulate the dynamics in the soil vegetation atmosphere transfer system can significantly reduce the need of temporal tir data here soil moisture was directly observed in the field for applications over a larger scale this approach can be supported by the current availability of low cost soil probes differently spatialized pixel surface soil moisture dynamics over large areas can be derived by physically based models using optical microwave synthetic aperture radar or tir remote sensing data even though the application of these methods both on field scale and on daily bases is still a matter of research alternatively soil moisture dynamics in the root zone can be estimated by hydrological modeling approaches for example by using the transient flow richards equation the current and future development of diverse spaceborne remote sensing platforms able of acquiring data at different wavelengths and or resolutions will definitely improve etc act estimates at plot scale however a robust etc act estimation will also rely on their combination with local water balance models the application of data assimilation fusion techniques and integrating the proposed etc act construction procedure with the soil water balance modeling is an objective we intend

9806,satellite remote sensing based surface energy balance seb techniques have emerged as useful tools for quantifying spatialized actual evapotranspiration at various temporal and spatial scales however discontinuous data acquisitions and or gaps in image acquisition due to cloud cover can limit the applicability of satellite remote sensing rs in agriculture water management where continuous

evapotranspiration et in arid and semi arid environments is a major component of the hydrological cycle and one of the most important physical processes of the land surface in agriculture quantifying the spatial variability and the temporal dynamic of et at the field or larger spatial scales is of great importance for irrigation scheduling identifying water productivity and water use efficiency molden et al 2010 stanhill 1986 these activities are particularly relevant in the modern precision agriculture applications over large areas such as irrigation districts or basins time series of spatialized evapotranspiration data serve for assessing crop water requirements for adapting collective irrigation schemes and for planning an optimal allocation of water resources in the coming years with the reduced availability of natural water resources and increased water consumption in agriculture masia et al 2021 recursively updated et maps will serve for designing or validating strategies of adaptation to climatic changes local measurements of evapotranspiration such as lysimeters or micrometeorological methods i e bowen ratio eddy covariance and scintillometers have proven to be reliable to measure crop actual evapotranspiration and can be considered as the references against which spatialized etc act estimation methods could be validated however local measurements are considered labor and cost intensive droogers et al 2000 elhaddad and garcia 2008 and are rarely available worldwide ochoa sánchez et al 2019 the spatial extrapolation or interpolation of local etc act measurements over larger spatial scales is problematic moreover it cannot be representative of land cover and or management practices diverse from those of the measurement site in this context comes the need to find reliable and non expensive alternative procedures capable of quantifying the spatial variability of etc act both on the field and at larger spatial scales this issue directed part of the scientific research towards developing and fine tuning of mathematical models capable of providing a detailed description of mass and energy exchange processes in the soil plant atmosphere spa continuum in parallel a significant effort was given to integrating modeling and observations from satellite or aerial platforms with the scope of computing spatialized etc act values low cost remote sensing techniques can be used to retrieve the space time variability of numerous physical variables needed in the applications of the etc act modeling bastiaanssen et al 2000 d urso 2001 kustas et al

seb based approaches can use in addition to the data acquired in the vis and nir regions those acquired in the thermal infrared tir for the estimation of eta eb as a residual of the seb equation after quantifying the rest of the instantaneous fluxes gowda et al 2008 wagle et al 2017 bhattarai et al 2016 maltese et al 2018 minacapilli et al 2016 seb models like sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a sebs su

rodell et al 2009 and hydrological modelling cammalleri et al 2010 droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 immerzeel and droogers 2008 muthuwatta et al 2010 satellite based seb approaches can capture large geographical extents and provide eta eb estimations at different spatial and temporal scales however some limitations to the use of the satellite images still exist due to the platform s spatial resolutions revisit times and the cloudiness at the overpass times for example the aatsr envisat the modis and the sentinel 3 satellites have a short revisit time 1 day but a 1000 m spatial resolution of the thermal infrared the use of these data in eta eb modelling is limited to the spatial extent of the tir data and is not recommended in fragmented and heterogeneous agriculture especially when the parcels are smaller than the tir pixel alternatively relatively high spatial resolution tir imagery from 60 to 120 m can be obtained from platforms such as landsat and aster however images are available every 16 days if clear sky condition exists at the overpass time mccabe and wood 2006 found a high degree of consistency of eta eb retrievals from landsat and aster and showed that low spatial resolution modis based estimates were unable to discriminate the influence of land surface heterogeneity at the field spatial scale the ecosystem spaceborne thermal radiometer experiment on space station ecostress recently launched measures tir data along an irregular non polar orbit at a 70 m spatial resolution and an overpass time of 1 5 days this represents a significant improvement in terms of temporal sampling of land surface temperature lst required to derive reliable eta eb products at the field scale however ecostress is a thermal only experimental sensor it does not provide data for high latitudes and its use in seb modeling is dependent on vswir visible to shortwave infrared bands data from other platforms for agricultural applications e g irrigation scheduling or water

have been proposed to produce continuous data series of daily etc act at the field scale by using remote sensing techniques bisquert et al 2016 and kustas et al 2003 applied disaggregation techniques to downscale the tir data of modis to the spatial resolution of vis nir of spot 5 10 m spatial resolution and 5 day revisit time other researchers downscaled the tir data from low resolution sensors modis aatsr or sentinel 3 to the spatial scale of medium high resolution sensors aster landsat bindhu et al 2013 bisquert et al 2016 olivera guerra et al 2017 besides disaggregation techniques data fusion methods are based on the spectral and spatial relationship between an existing high low resolution image pair cammalleri et al 2013 gao et al 2006 semmens et al 2016 bhattarai et al 2014 ma et al 2018 this relationship is used to realize high spatial resolution data for dates when only the low resolution images are available bisquert et al 2016 however methods that fuse intermediate variables directly related to the evapotranspiration process vegetation indices vi and lst are subject to several limitations indeed remote sensing parameters e g bit parameters bandwidth acquisition time and spectral response function acquired from different satellite sensors on the same date may not provide comparable data ma et al 2018 another limitation is that rs platforms used in these approaches have different acquisition times during the day furthermore modeling the dynamics of these intermediate variables used in etc act retrieval can add uncertainties differently from the above mentioned approaches which integrate data from different platforms other authors awada et al 2019 allen et al 2007 alfieri et al 2017 singh et al 2012 trezza et al 2013 used the daily actual crop coefficient as a reference to construct the continuous times series of daily etc act starting from eta eb determined by rs seb models in cloud free image acquisition days precisely a so called referenced et fraction etrf unitless is computed as eta eb eto on the image acquisition days and used together with the daily changes of daily reference crop evapotranspiration eto continuously monitored in a weather station to drive the etc act changes in the other days in the etc act construction period between the acquisition days the etrf is kept constant or is changed by interpolation using this daily etc act construction approach some authors considered that typically one or two cloud free landsat images are considered enough to derive monthly etc act allen et al 2007 bhattarai et al 2012 conversely trezza et al 2018 considered that the estimation error in monthly etc act is relatively high when image availability is limited to an eight day revisit time satellite data and suggested a four day revisit time to robustly represent time integrated etc act estimates over months and growing seasons alfieri et al 2017 assessed daily etc act estimations derived using different temporal autocorrelation reference variables including the eto and interpolation methods they found that a return interval of earth observations of a minimum of five days is necessary to estimate daily etc act with relative errors smaller than 20 moreover constructing the time series of daily etc act by the etrf approach considers the variability of the meteorological inputs embedded in the daily eto still it cannot account for the effect of soil moisture dynamics due to precipitation irrigation and etc act plant stress and or the vegetation biomass changes i e crop development cuttings in case of forage crops that occur between images acquisitions besides methods involving the linear or cubic spline interpolation of etrf allen et al 2007 singh et al 2012 limit the applicability for near real time modelling of daily etc act this paper proposes a simple integrated model based procedure to construct the daily etc act data between satellite image acquisition days the dynamics of meteorological variables vegetation biomass changes and or plant stress caused by soil water restriction drive the etc act changes between different acquisitions to estimate eta eb on image

ancillary data moreover it was extensively applied and validated over a range of environmental conditions and vegetation types awada et al 2021 bastiaanssen et al 2002 2005 1998b li and zhao 2010 zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 sebal was applied with landsat 5 thematic mapper tm images and limited meteorological inputs the integrated etc act construction procedure was tested over a vineyard with partial soil coverage in the south of sardinia island italy the etc act construction approach combines the daily values of eto remotely sensed vegetation indices observed soil moisture in the root zone and a modeling approach for the soil water evaporation specifically the research was carried out with the following objectives i constructing a continuous time series of daily etc act values for the vegetation period of a vineyard starting from few eta eb data estimated by sebal daily eto ndvi from satellite and on field observed soil moisture ii evaluating the performance of the proposed methodology by comparison with in situ eddy covariance ec flux measurements 2 the core structure of the daily etc act construction procedure to obtain the continuous time series of daily etc act the actual evapotranspiration obtained by a seb model on acquisition days is integrated with an etc act construction modelling procedure this latter accounts for the temporal dynamics of daily eto satellite derived vegetation indices soil moisture data and includes a water balance modelling approach for the estimation of canopy water interception and soil water evaporation thus the procedure accounts for changes in daily weather vegetative biomass and plant water stress that occur between the tir satellite data acquisitions the proposed etc act construction approach computes separately the daily actual values of canopy water interception ic soil water evaporation es and crop actual transpiration tc act the canopy water interception and soil water evaporation are modeled on an hourly

height was decided after preliminary footprint analysis the minimum distance from the end of the canopy is 150 m and the footprint analysis carried out during all the measurements period confirmed that we were sampling the vineyard canopy the fetch was estimated at about 500 m in all directions as reported in marras et al 2016 instrument positioning was also the result of several years of

the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 9 a discrepancy between 20 and 30 from the ideal 100 closure is commonly observed in surface energy budget measurements wilson et al 2002 allen et al 2011 considered that measurements with 15 energy budget closure error are reliable in this paper the studied period was restricted from april to november 2010 which was the period from the bud break to the harvesting of the vineyard the measured fluxes were corrected by forcing the energy closure using the bowen ratio half hour data quality was evaluated by the energy balance closure cr by rationing

satisfactory when cr 0 85 prueger et al 2005 wilson et al 2002 for lesser cr the energy budget closure was forced by attributing rn g to h and λet with the preservation of the bowen ratio β defined as

of the sebal model the sebal model performance was evaluated at the image acquisition days in comparison with the on field ec observations this type of analysis is significant as the sebal performance influences the whole etc act j construction process there was a good agreement between modeled eta eb and observed etc act ec fig 4 the comparison yielded a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 96 and a mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse of 0 39 mm d 1 and 0 48 mm d 1 respectively furthermore a non parametric mann whitney test suggested no significant difference between the observed ec data and sebal estimations and that the null hypothesis can be accepted at significance level α of 0 05 galleguillos et al 2011 found a rmse of 0 48 mm d 1 comparing the performance of the s sebi model estimates of daily evapotranspiration to ec observations over a mediterranean vineyard and applied on 11 aster images in another drip irrigated vineyard the metric model applied on 13 landsat images overestimated the ec observed data with an average error of 9 an rmse of 0 62 mm d 1and a mae of 0 50 mm d 1 carrasco benavides et al 2012 knipper et al 2019 applied the alexi disalexi surface energy balance model with a large dataset of landsat images over a vineyard and obtained an average estimation error of 15 and a mae and rmse of 0 58 mm d 1 and 0 76 mm d 1 respectively the overall average sebal estimation error was 11 8 the performance of the model on single days was within the error bounds of the state of the art et instruments 20 except for eta eb estimates on the 21st of april and 10th of july that overestimated the observed etc act ec by 29 and 21 these two acquisitions days fall in a period where the measured data seb closure errors were exacerbated as observed by marras et al 2016 and therefore the tendency to misestimate etc act ec can be partly attributed to issues with the flux measurements closure and not the sebal model alone 4 2 performance of the integrated daily etc act construction procedure fig 5 compares the daily etc act derived from the integrated construction procedure to the measured daily actual evapotranspiration etc act ec from the 21st of april doy 111 to the 6th of november 2010 doy 310 on average the modeled etc act slightly underestimated the observed data a non parametric mann whitney test suggested no significant difference between etc act and etc act ec at significance level α of 0 05 the average error of the etc act estimations for the whole studied period was 18 the comparison statistics r2 0 71 mae 0 54 mm d 1 rmse 0 73 mm d 1 could be judged satisfactory considering that in addition to sebal estimation errors and systematic eddy covariance energy balance closure uncertainties the etc act j construction approach superimposes different kinds of simplifications an example is the assumption of linearity between the crop water uptake vegetation indices and crop water stress coefficients eq 2 such assumptions become less important as the time between acquisition days reduces as for short time intervals also non linear processes could be linearized with a sufficient degree of precision hence the application of eq 2 potentially benefits from the relatively high availability of clear sky image acquisitions which could be provided by the upcoming capability of rs systems in capturing rapid changes even in the tir domain see section 4 3 for further discussion moreover several studies carried out in different areas supported a linear crop coefficient vi relationships beeri et al 2019 campos et al 2010 consoli and vanella 2014 consoli and barbagallo 2012 o connell et al 2011 in opposition er raki et al 2013 used for a vineyard an exponential equation for fitting the experimental crop coefficient vi relationship however also their relationship can be approximated by a linear regression without losing the goodness of fit furthermore the direct proportionality of crop water uptake and water stress coefficients is at the basis of the ks stress coefficient estimation in the fao 56 approach for modelling actual crop evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 the linearity between the crop water uptake vis and crop water stress coefficients was embedded in several modelling approaches and was sufficient for assessing actual etc for irrigation requirements in several crops including vineyards and orchards campos et al 2010 consoli and vanella 2014 consoli and barbagallo 2012 pôças et al 2015 rallo and provenzano 2013 in this application due to data limitation the daily vegetation indices time series was obtained by linear interpolation between two landsat acquisitions this could misrepresent the real vegetative biomass dynamic thus the temporal change of the transpiration mass and the fractional cover mainly when the time gap between two cloud free acquisitions is long however the good performance of the etc act j construction approach particularly in the period of low vegetation cover after the bud break where the evaporative component prevailed suggests that the landsat derived and interpolated vegetation indices were able to simulate the transpiration mass canopy water interception and evaporative surface furthermore the current presence of diverse spaceborne systems with a higher spatial resolution and lower revisit time can better represent the vegetation dynamics even if the vegetation dynamics between two acquisitions is still retrieved by linear interpolation platforms such as the sentinels 2 can capture the 5 days vegetation changes in cloud free conditions at a relatively high spatial resolution 10 m an additional analysis was performed to separate the effect of sebal eta eb estimation errors on the performance of the etc act j construction procedure the model was executed by substituting the eta eb by the observed etc act ec data in the selected landsat acquisition days in this way errors in the constructed etc act j can be attributed to the model structure keeping in mind observed seb closure uncertainties using the observed ec data instead of eta eb yielded a performance r2 0 72 mae 0 56 mm d 1 rmse 0 78 mm d 1 in average comparable to that reported in fig 5 this analysis may indicate that both sebal model estimation errors and seb closure errors in the considered acquisition days had a similar weight on the performance of the integrated construction procedure in addition to the statistical performance metrics documented in fig 5 and in aims to further analyze the performance of the integrated etc act construction model the temporal dynamics of etc act j and etc act ec are plotted in fig 6a the proposed procedure reproduced efficiently the general etc act ec trend the modeled and observed actual et show similar patterns of monthly and daily variability the integrated approach allowed adequately simulating actual et under contrasting dry and wet conditions once again the best performance was obtained from late july to november where marras et al 2016 observed the better energy balance closure for the ec data the worst performance was noticed in the early summer from doy 175 198 due to the sebal underestimation of the observed etc act ec on doy 191 however the average error less than 20 was still in the range of accuracy of typical eddy covariance installations 15 30 allen et al 2011 the performance was also satisfactory from april to june from doy 111 175 fig 6a as expected in the early spring period due to the low crop cover the model demonstrated the significant weight of soil water evaporation in the evapotranspiration process still successively the transpiration component prevailed due to the crop cover establishment fig 6b in addition to the increase of the atmospheric water demand in the period april july from about 3 6 mm d 1 the main driver of the increased transpiration fluxes was the vineyard biomass accumulation in this period landsat derived ndvi augmented from 0 18 to 0 51 and the fc from 0 09 to 0 5 in agreement with the trend of on field observed lai that increased from 0 3 to 2 5 marras et al 2016 this highlighted the importance of considering vegetation changes in modelling etc act especially in crops like vines subjected to major changes during the growth cycle in the irrigation period the model simulated significant transpiration values supported by adequate soil water availability and small evaporation peaks resulting from local irrigation interventions the low soil water evaporation was a result of the small wetted soil surface in drip irrigation and the lower energy available at the soil surface due to the higher fractional cover successively the transpiration component declined due to the decrease of atmospheric demand and a slight soil water deficit θ 0 22 fig 2 which was simulated as a moderate plant stress in the etc act construction approach as seen in fig 6b the evaporation model showed notable sensitivity to superficial soil moisture changes due to precipitation and irrigation the distinguished performance of the integrated etc act construction approach during the rainy spring period when evaporative fluxes are significant and vegetation coverage is low supported the importance of integrating a soil water evaporation model in the construction procedure in construction approaches etc act is usually estimated as the product of a scaling factor that must be easy to measure or to estimate every day and to which etc act is largely proportional or positively correlated to show the added value of the proposed integrated etc act construction approach to the forward construction using the referenced et fraction etrf method that considers only meteorological variations we compare in fig 7 and table 2 the observed monthly cumulated etc act ec values with the simulated etc act j and those obtained by the referenced et fraction etc act rf the proposed method yielded good monthly cumulated etc act estimations with errors less than 15 in all considered months it over performed the referenced et fraction etrf method particularly in may and june where biomass changes and soil water evaporation have a significant weight in governing the et process knowing that no soil moisture deficit occurred in this period instead from july to october the monthly performance of the simulated etc act j and etc act rf were similar since the crop actual evapotranspiration changes were more governed by the variations of the atmospheric et demand this factor is accounted for in the etrf method knowing that the vines were not subjected to substantial water stress in this period overall the model showed a better performance in simulating daily etc act values as indicated by the lower mae and rmse table 2 4 3 the sensitivity of the integrated daily etc act construction procedure to tir image availability the proposed etc act j construction approach benefits from the relatively high availability of clear sky image acquisitions nevertheless frequent cloudy sky conditions may hinder an adequate satellite image collection as an example in our application the eta eb estimated by sebal on the 21 april 2010 was propagated forwardly for a month and a half due to the absence of clear sky landsat images till the date of 8 june 2010 in this section we evaluate how the etc act j construction model performs to the temporal availability of sebal retrieved eta eb to do this we hypothesized the worst case that only one clear sky image is available to be processed by sebal for the entire study period the real limitation to be assessed is the presence of cloud free tir data required by the seb models although the upcoming capability of rs systems to capture rapid changes in the tir domain is promising an example is the already operating ecostress sensor that will provide a foundation for the proposed hyperspectral infrared imager hyspiri mission with a five day revisit lee et al 2015 guillevic et al 2019 the copernicus land surface temperature monitoring lstm that will have a spatial resolution of 30 50 m and a temporal resolution lower than three days koetz et al 2018 and the french space agency cnes and the indian space research organization isro trishna satellite mission that will combine high tir spatial resolution 50 m and high revisit capacities of two to three days lagouarde et al 2018 moreover in addition to landsat 8 the recent launch september 2021 of landsat 9 with the tirs 2 and oli 2 instruments aboard will increase the temporal coverage of both vswir and tir data in this sensitivity analysis the ndvi dynamics is still represented by the values interpolated between landsat image acquisitions the eta eb obtained by sebal in the acquisition days reported in table 1 are used within the proposed etc act j construction model one at a time to obtain the complete time series of daily etc act j the eta eb acquired on 21 april was used to forward construct etc act j till the 6th of november the eta eb values in other dates were used for both the forward and backward construction of etc act j between the 21st of april and the 6th of november these applications allowed to obtain modeled etc act j time series homogeneous in length table 3 and fig 8 reports the results of the applied sensitivity analysis the predicted pattern of the daily and cumulated etc act j values were evaluated compared to the observed etc act ec data on average the construction procedure reproduced efficiently the observed daily and cumulated etc act ec data the absolute error in the modeled cumulated etc act did not exceed the 17 of final observed value except for the backward etc act construction using the eta eb of 6 nov the best performance was obtained when the summer values of eta eb were used for etc act j construction the worst performance was obtained for 21 apr and 6 nov where there was a low evapotranspiration this suggested that low values of eta eb such as those obtained in wet spring and autumn should be used with caution for the etc act series construction over long period months overall the sensitivity analysis results suggest that the integrated proposed approach could simulate etc act even in scarce data conditions this integrated modelling approach can sustain and or reduce the need for low revisit intervals of high spatial resolution satellite based tir knowing that an adequate vswir and tir satellite image collections for etc act estimation can still be hindered by frequent cloudy sky conditions although low revisit time systems may provide a significant improvement in temporal sampling to monitor etc act an integrated modelling approach is still required to properly simulate the rapid dynamics of soil plant atmosphere continuum that can be missed even with revisit time of few days in cloud free conditions particularly in intensive irrigated agriculture indeed delogu et al 2021 considered that the future tendency to produce robust etc act estimates at plot scale will probably rely not only on remote sensing data acquired at different wavelengths and or resolutions but also on their combination with local water balance models constrained at regular intervals by eta eb estimates from the tir domain 5 conclusions the paper presented a simple but effective procedure to construct continuous time series of actual evapotranspiration starting from infrequent estimations of eta eb obtained by a seb model applied on landsat satellite data the proposed approach integrated two widely used models the sebal for the retrieval of eta eb on image acquisition days and the fao 56 model to estimate daily soil water evaporation the daily etc act construction approach propagates over time the actual crop transpiration obtained on the satellite image acquisition days by using remotely sensed ndvi and on field measurements of potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture the integrated daily etc act construction procedure reproduced efficiently the observed daily values of etc act ec during the complete vegetative annual cycle of a vineyard with partial soil coverage the temporal analysis of the modeled daily et data stream emphasized the importance of integrating the vegetative biomass dynamics and a soil water evaporation model in the daily etc act construction approach considering the vegetation dynamics through ndvi increase in late spring allowed to account for the rise in the grapevine s transpiration due to the development of the plant green biomass furthermore the evaporation model was fundamental for reproducing the evaporation peaks after significant rain events particularly in the early spring period with low soil coverage nevertheless further testing of the evaporation model should be performed a cumulative monthly comparison with the referenced et fraction etrf method showed the lead of the proposed approach particularly when biomass changes and soil water evaporation have a significant weight in governing the et process the inclusion of a stress coefficient is required for considering the variation of plant transpiration due to soil moisture changes between acquisition days soil moisture data indicated that the studied vineyard suffered of mild water limitation for a short period in late summer which didn t permit a profound analysis of the effect of plant water stress on transpiration more investigation with diverse dataset is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the plant stress correction term in constructing of the transpiration time series the proposed construction approach is well suited for the near real time modelling of daily etc act which is of great importance in water management and irrigation scheduling although in this application the used landsat ndvi data permits only a historical analysis nowadays several available free or low cost satellite platforms can provide ndvi scenes with a range of few days e g sentinels 2 supporting the near real time monitoring of vegetation dynamics moreover this approach can benefit from low revisit time and high spatial resolution systems e g ecostress that may provide a significant improvement in temporal sampling to monitor etc act on plot scale nevertheless results also shown that integrating a local water balance modelling approach that accounts to soil properties and simulate the dynamics in the soil vegetation atmosphere transfer system can significantly reduce the need of temporal tir data here soil moisture was directly observed in the field for applications over a larger scale this approach can be supported by the current availability of low cost soil probes differently spatialized pixel surface soil moisture dynamics over large areas can be derived by physically based models using optical microwave synthetic aperture radar or tir remote sensing data even though the application of these methods both on field scale and on daily bases is still a matter of research alternatively soil moisture dynamics in the root zone can be estimated by hydrological modeling approaches for example by using the transient flow richards equation the current and future development of diverse spaceborne remote sensing platforms able of acquiring data at different wavelengths and or resolutions will definitely improve etc act estimates at plot scale however a robust etc act estimation will also rely on their combination with local water balance models the application of data assimilation fusion techniques and integrating the proposed etc act construction procedure with the soil water balance modeling is an objective we intend

9807,understanding the characteristics of water use efficiency wue and its controlling factors in the agricultural ecosystem can help us better understand the coupled process between water use and carbon assimilation spatially the characteristics of the leaf and ecosystem level water carbon and wue variations as well as their drivers in a kiwifruit orchard were systematically analyzed during

relationship between tr and pn vpdl 0 5 at the leaf scale the coupled relationship between et and gpp was strengthened after incorporating the effect of vpd on gpp due to reduced time lags among gpp et and vpd at the ecosystem scale rg ta u2 and vpd contributed to greater effects through et than that of gpp on ewue while the differences between them were reduced after incorporating vpd on gpp which may be the source of the dependence of iwue gpp vpd et and uwue gpp vpd et on environmental conditions this study enriches the scarce literature on what drives multi scale water and carbon in a

assimilation to water loss has become an effective integral trait for quantifying the link of the water cycle and the carbon cycle brummer et al 2012 campoy et al 2019 yang et al 2016 furthermore wue

cultivation has developed a pillar industry for rural economic development and industrial poverty alleviation in southwest china optimal kiwifruit production requires precise agronomy and water management in practice which is expected to benefit from an understanding of the coupled process of carbon and water in the kiwifruit orchard song et al 2017 testi et al 2008 the appearance of carbon

plant phenological and physiological controls e g stomatal conductance gs lei et al 2018 wang and yamanaka 2014 leaf area index lai wang et al 2017 2018 however the importance of these factors varies among climatic zones and ecosystems besides there are some differences of the most controlling meteorological factors in water use and carbon at different scales zhang et al 2016b 2016a for example zhang et al 2016b 2016a indicated leaf tr and ecosystem et could be well characterized by net radiation ta vpd and wind speed u but the transpiration of plants could not be characterized by them although a wealth of literature is available on the drivers of plant water use and carbon gain process most of them concentrated on arid and semi arid regions chen et al 2018 gong et al 2017 fan et al 2021 hu and lei 2021 zheng et al 2021 the variation characteristics of wue are complex law et al 2002 wagle et al 2016 since the conditions in climate the strength of coupling between carbon gain and water use and their responses to climate and other environmental changes affect wue gu et al 1999 hu et al 2008 yu et al 2008 therefore the characteristics of water and carbon fluxes and wue in humid farmlands still need to be investigated numerous studies have addressed the relationships between variables and wue by analyzing their correlations brummer et al 2012 gao et al 2019 lin et al 2018a wang et al 2018 however the effect of one factor on wue may be offset by other covarying factors it is still unclear how the factors regulate wue through plant water use or carbon assimilation processes li et al 2018 found that rg exerted a stronger positive effect on et than gpp and resulted in negative wue across biomes lai had a significantly greater positive effect on gpp than et resulting in a positive reaction of wue to the increase of lai however fewer studies have clarified the characteristics of multi scale wue and the differences in the quantitative responses of leaf and ecosystem scale water use and carbon gain to the environmental and vegetation physiological factors which limits the understanding of plant water and carbon cycle processes ecosystem wue ewue is calculated as a ratio of carbon gain to water consumption at the ecosystem scale ewue has been frequently observed to decrease under higher vpd conditions across various time scales law et al 2002 since stomatal conductance is limited by higher vpd and thus limits plant s photosynthesis ability due to reduced co2 concentrations inside leaves schulze et al 1975 ewue multiplication with vpd or vpd0 5 leads to a quantity called inherent wue iwue gpp vpd et or underlying wue uwue gpp vpd0 5 et to incorporate the effect of vpd regarding the photosynthesis transpiration relationship through stomatal conductance beer et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 the relationship between gpp vpd and et is stronger than that between gpp and et after considering the nonlinear effect of vpd on et beer et al 2009 therefore iwue has been widely used to identify the ecosystem responses to environmental changes such as rising co2 concentrations since the ratio is related to the difference between ambient and inner leaf partial pressures of co2 ca ci beer et al 2009 however the gpp vpd versus et relationship depends on the assumed constancy of the ratio of interleaf over ambient partial pressure of co2 ci ca within the canopy under certain environmental conditions while ci ca at the leaf scale varies both diurnally and seasonally which may lead to nonlinear relationships between gpp vpd and et at the ecosystem scale zhou et al 2014 showed uwue did not exhibit a significant seasonal trend like ewue or iwue and other environmental variables because of the stronger linear relationship between gpp vpd0 5 and et than that between gpp vpd and et several studies have shown that variations in ci ca depend on vpd farquhar et al 1993 batista et al 2012 therefore the independence of uwue on environmental changes may indicate a possible adaptive adjustment of plant physiology gs net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration tr etc to a changing atmospheric environment zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 2016 however the dependent mechanism and function of carbon processes incorporating vpd on wue at both leaf and ecosystem scales have not yet been considered in previous studies in this study a successive three year experiment was conducted in a kiwifruit orchard in the humid region of southwest china the objectives of the present study were to 1 investigate the characteristics of water

the study was conducted during the kiwifruit growing seasons of 2018 2020 from bud burst in early march to maturation in early november at the kiwifruit experimental base in chenba village pujiang county located in chengdu plain china 30 19 n 103 25 e approximately 560 m a s l this region is classified as am subtropical monsoon humid climate according to the köppen climate classification with an average annual air temperature of 16 3 rainfall of 1301 mm low sunshine duration of 1122 h y 1 and high relative humidity of 84 during 1960 2019 the main soil type is yellow soil with an averaged soil bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 consisting of 76 80 silt 12 29 sand and 10 91 clay the saturated volumetrical soil water content θs and field capacity θf were 47 and 34 respectively kiwifruit trees actinidia chinensis deliciosa cv jin yan were chosen as experimental trees the trees were planted in 2006 with a distance of 5 0 4 5 m and began to bear fruits in 2009 the orchard field was approximately 753 ha in size understory weeds mainly included alternanthera philoxeroides mart griseb echinochloa crusgalli l besuv and malachium aquatieurn l fries and was maintained at low densities through the use of herbicides the kiwi field was irrigated using the drip irrigation system the drip irrigation tape was arranged between two rows with a dripper of 1 6 l h irrigation was applied only when the swc fell below 70 θf and the upper limit of irrigation was 85 θf irrigation amount was calculated as follows 1 m 1000 h p β 1 β 2 θ f where m is the irrigation amount mm γ is the averaged soil bulk density g cm 3 h is the root depth 0 6 m θf is the field capacity g cm 3 β1 and β2 represent 85 θf and 70 θf respectively p is the wetting ratio 50 based on the formula and relevant

of n p and k were described by zheng et al 2020 2 2 leaf transpiration and photosynthesis measurements a li 6400 photosynthesis system li cor usa was used to measure leaf transpiration rate tr net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs and climatic parameters on three cloudless sunny days 9 00 19 00 during the annual cycle three exposed leaves from the top and three shaded leaves from the lower parts of the canopy were selected as the measured leaves the leaves maintained natural orientation to the sun s rays for each measurement and these measurements were conducted within 2 h to avoid the larger discrepancy in the environmental conditions 2 3 flux data measurement processes and gap filling a close path ec system was equipped with a fast response 3d sonic anemometer csat3a campbell scientific inc ut usa to measure the fluctuations in the wind velocity components and sonic air temperature and a close path co2 h2o gas analyzer ec155 campbell scientific inc usa to measure the water vapor and carbon dioxide density fluctuations the ec system was installed at the east central part of the kiwifruit orchard with the sensors installing at a height of 8 0 m the orchard can provide a large and homogeneous fetch raw high frequency 10 hz flux data were processed using the eddypro software following the standard routines including double coordinate rotation time lags compensation low and high frequency corrections falge 2001 the data were then collected and averaged at half hour intervals using the datalogger support software 4 4 campbell scientific inc usa the half hour data were then carefully screened according to the following criteria 1 incomplete half hourly measurements and periods with rain events were removed 2 the processed eddypro data carrying quality flags in values ranging from 0 higher quality to 9 lower quality and the fluxes with a quality flag of 7 9 were discarded 3 friction velocity u was used as the main criterion of turbulence intensity and only the flux data with high turbulence conditions were thus regarded as reliable data u 0 15 m s 1 and the threshold 0 15 m s 1 was determined according to an objective method described by papale et al 2006 zhu et al 2006 a total of 11 7 daytime and 41 5 nighttime le data were removed according to the above criteria shorter gaps 2 h were filled with linear interpolation and larger gaps 2 h were filled using mean diurnal variation mdv with a window of 7 days falge 2001 if there were no similar meteorological conditions within the time window the averaging window was expanded to 14 days reichstein et al 2005 the energy balance closure ebc statistics were used to check the quality of flux data the ebc was the slope of the linear regression between the measured eddy turbulent fluxes le h and the available energy rn g the ebc values calculated by half hour data were 0 96 0 97 and 0 88 with the determined coefficient r2 of 0 76 0 81 and 0 73 during the 2018 2020 growing seasons fig 1 respectively the ebc values were 1 09 1 11 and 1 02 when using the daily value accumulating from the half hourly data with the r2 of 0 97 0 95 and 0 94 during 2018 2020 growing seasons respectively the degree of ebc of this site was comparable to the reported results in global fluxnet ranging from 0 53 to 0 99 wilson et al 2001 indicating that estimates on the surface energy exchanges and components by the ec system provided in the humid orchard were reasonably satisfactory as both co2 and water vapor concentrations in the air were measured with the same infrared gas analyzer the higher ebc also reflected the accuracy of co2 flux measured anapalli et al 2019a 2019b data gaps 2 h in missing carbon flux data were filled with linear interpolation for large gaps 2 h

sun et al 2020 a detailed description can be found in the references khazaie et al 2011 xing et al 2016 in this study the path analysis method was applied to determine the relative direct and indirect

wue at the leaf ecosystem scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations of environmental and vegetation factors the variations of the main meteorological factors during the growing seasons of 2018 2020 are illustrated in fig 2 ta increased gradually from mid march but decreased gradually after reaching its maximum in july with the mean of 21 36 20 81 and 22 59 during the three growing seasons respectively rg shared a similar seasonal variation and fluctuated significantly due to frequent cloudy and rainy weather with the mean of 148 28 133 43 and 158 08 w m 2 during the three growing seasons respectively vpd was lower than 10 hpa for most days with the mean of 6 76 5 94 and 6 16 hpa during the three growing seasons respectively u2 showed a decreasing trend during the growing seasons both lait and laic presented single curves lait was above 1 m2 m 2 in the initial growing season due to the weed growth reached its peak value of 4 06 m2 m 2 in 2018 3 87 m2 m 2 in 2019 and 3 94 m2 m 2 in 2020 and then decreased gradually due to the leaf senescence the seasonal and diurnal variations of laisu and laish are illustrated in fig s1 laish increased rapidly when laisu was stabilized and occupied a larger proportion at higher lait ranges laisu and laish changed during the daytime due to the changes of the sun rays laisu reached its minimum value at noon while the trend of laish was opposite to that of laisu the total precipitation was 1429 0 1322 4 and 1257 7 mm during the three growing seasons respectively and mainly concentrated in june september volumetric soil water content swc increased with increasing soil depth and was generally above 35 for most days except for several days at the initial growth stage the actual irrigation amount was 147 7 134 3 and 107

wuei in exposed and shaded leaves the diurnal patterns of kiwifruit tr pn and wuei of exposed leaves and shaded leaves on three typical sunny days are illustrated in fig 4 exposed and shaded leaf tr and pn generally increased with the increasing solar radiation reached their maximum values at noon around 11 00 15 00 and then decreased with the decline in solar radiation the values of tr and pn in exposed leaves were higher than those of shaded leaves the mean diurnal values of tr were 3 54 4 62 and 4 30 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 and the values of pn were 7 41 6 95 7 06 µmol co2 m 2 s 1 in the exposed leaf on the three measured dates 5 13 6 05 and 7 25 of 2018 growing season respectively however the corresponding values in shaded leaf were 1 57 1 67 and 1 60 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 for tr 0 78 1 01 and 0 94 µmol co2 m 2 s 1 for pn respectively tr in exposed leaves was 2 25 2 77 times higher than that of the shaded leaves while pn in exposed leaves was 8 32 9 44 times higher than that of the shaded leaves this demonstrated that the water and carbon patterns in shaded and exposed leaves were significantly different within the canopy xiloyannis et al 2000 indicated that tr in exposed leaves was twice higher than that of shaded kiwifruit and apricot leaves while pn was 2 4 times higher than that of the shaded one higher tr and pn in upper leaves than lower leaves were also found in other species due to differences in light availability medrano et al 2012 meir et al 2002 niinemets 2007 zhang et al 2016a exposed leaf wuei decreased with the increasing par and reached their minimum at the noon which agreed with the observations of xiloyannis et al 2000 and montanaro et al 2009 shaded leaf wuei attained their maximum at the noon fig 4 mean diurnal values of exposed leaf wuei were 2 11 1 52 and 1 73 µmol co2 mmol h2o 1 while the values in shaded leaf wuei were 0 56 0 60 and 0 58 µmol co2 mmol h2o 1 which were 2 53 3 77 times higher than those of the shaded leaf on the three measured days respectively the more effective pn than tr caused the higher wuei in exposed leaves xiloyannis et al 2000 also pointed out that exposed leaves showed a 3 8 times higher wuei than shaded leaves in apricot plants the exposed leaf area accounted for 47 96 45 19 and 41 79 of the total canopy leaf area on the three days respectively taking into account the ratio of the exposed and shaded leaves the contributions of the exposed and shaded portions of the canopy to the total tr and pn were obtained fig 5 exposed and shaded leaves contributed 86 51 89 64 and 10 36 13 49 to the total pn while 65 88 69 46 and 30 54 34 12 were their contributions to the total tr respectively the results demonstrated that shaded leaves consumed a high amount of water while they did not contribute to increase daily carbon and improve wue xiloyannis et al 2000 also found exposed kiwifruit leaves can contribute to 62 tr and 98 pn during the whole cycle respectively and exposed apricot leaves can contribute to 66 tr and 81 pn respectively reasonable utilization of agricultural water resources not only relies on the appropriate choice of the irrigation technique but also the wue of the canopy therefore it is thus fundamental to obtain a correct architecture of the canopy and particularly the exposed shaded leaves ratio this can be done through appropriate training systems and using summer pruning and or removing shaded leaves to improve the exposed shaded leaves ratio within the canopy which would be possible to improve the daily carbon balance and wue 3 2 2 responses of leaf tr pn and wue to climate and physiological factors ta par vpdl and gs jointly explained 70 and 84 variance of pn and tr respectively p 0 01 table 2 the critical factors affecting pn were par and gs with the total effects of 0 76 and 0 71 respectively p 0 01 ta par vpdl and gs significantly affected leaf tr with the total effects of 0 52 0 62 0 44 p 0 05 and 0 87 respectively p 0 01 par had a significant direct effect on pn while gs had a significant direct effect on tr p 0 01 demonstrating that water consumption was controlled by gs while photosynthetic activity was more related to par previous studies have also proved that leaf tr was linearly related to gs whereas pn may be limited by a variety of other factors and did not respond linearly to instantaneous changes in gs fig s2 hu et al 2008 massmann et al 2019 besides none of the factors had a significant indirect effect on leaf scale tr or pn the explained variance was low in wuei 8 wueu 27 and wuel 0 table 2 vpdl significantly affected leaf wuel with the total effects of 0 53 p 0 01 besides there was no factor with significant total effects on wuei and wueu the explained variances of wuei wuel and wueu were improved to 90 85 and 87 when taking tr and pn pn vpdl in wuel pn vpdl 0 5 in wueu as the factors into the path analysis fig 6 the indirect effects of ta par vpdl and gs through tr on wuei were 0 86 1 02 0 72 and 1 42 and were 0 54 1 17 0 43 and 1 09 through pn respectively fig 7a the indirect effects of the factors through tr and pn on wuei were adverse and were thus partially offset resulting in lower capacity of tr and pn to solely explain the variation of wuei fig 6a besides ta vpdl and gs had larger indirect effects through tr than that of pn on wuei the quantified differences between the two were 0 32 0 29 and 0 33 demonstrating the factors ta vpdl and gs affected wuei mainly through leaf water consumption while par affected wuei mainly through leaf photosynthetic process the indirect effects of ta par vpdl and gs through tr on wuel were 0 81 0 98 0 72 and 1 33 while they were 0 42 0 82 0 1 04 and 1 23 through pn vpdl on wuel respectively fig 7b the quantified indirect effects of the factors through tr and pn vpdl on wuel were not enhanced apparently and even reduced compared to those of wuei fig 6a also showed that pn vpdl possessed higher explanation rate 31 84 than tr 0 53 indicating wuel could not well balance the tr pn vpdl coupling relationship at the leaf scale the indirect effects of ta par vpdl and gs through tr on wueu were 0 94 1 14 0 79 and 1 56 while the values were 0 86 1 14 0 84 and 1 48 through pn vpdl 0 5 on wueu respectively fig 7c the increased indirect effects of ta par vpdl and gs through tr and pn vpdl 0 5 on wueu were found compared to those of wuei and wuel demonstrating the enhanced coupled pattern between tr and pn vpdl 0 5 fig 6a also showed that both pn vpdl 0 5 and tr possessed lower explanation rate due to the enhanced tr pn vpdl 0 5 coupling relationship with the values of 3 47 and 7 11 respectively besides the differences between the indirect effects of the factors ta par vpdl and gs through tr and pn vpdl 0 5 on wueu were 0 08 0 00 0 03 and 0 08 respectively the equal but adverse indirect effects of the factors through tr and pn vpdl 0 5 were offset demonstrating that ta par vpdl and gs contributed to nearly equal effects on wueu by affecting leaf water consumption and photosynthetic process the decreased differences between the two demonstrated wueu could well balance the climatic factors ta par and vpdl and physiological factor gs affecting water consumption and photosynthetic process at the leaf scale we further studied how the exponent of vpdl dependence affected the form of leaf scale tr pn relationship using the fitted relationships tr vs gpp vpdl i fig 8 pn exhibited a stronger linear relationship with tr r2 0 66 p 0 01 however the stronger linear relationship between tr and pn vpdl i was found when i 1 and 0 5 with the r2 of 0 69 and 0 73 respectively fig 8c d therefore the enhanced linear correlation between tr pn vpdl 0 5 may be the reason for the increased effects of ta par vpd and gs through tr and pn vpd0 5 on wueu 3 3 seasonal variations of ecosystem scale et gpp and wue and their controlling factors 3 3 1 seasonal variations of et gpp and wue seasonal variations of daily et gpp and wue are illustrated in fig 9 et and gpp gradually increased to a seasonal maximum during the active growing season in august and then decreased remarkably due to unfavorable environmental conditions light and heat availability and leaf senescence the daily average et varied between 1 95 and 2 34 mm d 1 and gpp varied between 5 88 and 6 77 g c m 2 d 1 during the three growing seasons the values were comparable to the observations in a primary subtropical evergreen forest by the ec method in southwest china with et of 2 37 mm d 1 and gpp of 5 86 g c m 2 d 1 song et al 2017 the cumulated et was 637 33 549 88 and 452 30 mm during the 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively table 3 the cumulated gpp was 1669 35 1469 67 and 1206 76 g c m 2 during the 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively the less cumulated value of et and gpp in 2020 was mainly due to the short measured period lack of 40 and 51 days compared to that of the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons respectively affected by et and gpp wue hardly showed apparent seasonal variations during the growing seasons due to frequent precipitation events over the growing seasons fig 9c e daily mean ewue mainly varied between 2 and 4 g c kg h2o 1 while growing season iwue and uwue mainly varied between 1 and 2 g c kpa kg 1 h2o 1 3 g c kpa0 5 kg h2o 1 respectively mean growing season ewue was 2 68 0 07 g c kg h2o 1 which was comparable to previous studies on corn soybean yield 3 1 g c kg h2o 1 and an adjacent coniferous forest site 2 28 2 68 g c kg h2o 1 song et al 2017 however the value was larger than the value of 1 73 g c kg h2o 1 estimated from global croplands ai et al 2020 this study focused on growing seasons during which greater seasonal carbon uptake by kiwifruit trees offset higher water use which caused a higher ewue than other annul cropland ewue estimates furthermore the growing season averaged iwue was 1 68 0 07 g c kpa kg h2o 1 uwue was 2 12 0 04 g c kpa0 5 kg h2o 1 respectively the uwue values were comparable with those obtained at soybean sites 2 27 2 66 g c kpa0 5 kg h2o 1 zhou et al 2015 but higher than the value observed in a primary subtropical evergreen forest in southwest china by the ec method 1 35 1 51 g c kpa0 5 kg h2o 1 song et al 2017 the lower value at their site may be related to the lower vpd 3 30 0 23 hpa 3 3 2 responses of et gpp and wue to climatic and vegetation factors the considered factors rg ta the concentration of h2o ch2o and co2 cco2 u2 vpd swc and lait could explain 72 87 variation of et and 62 78 variation of gpp table 4 among them rg was recognized as the most important abiotic factor affecting et followed by vpd and ta with the r value of 0 87 0 03 0 76 0 04 0 63 0 05 respectively rg vpd and ta were also strongly correlated with gpp with the r value of 0 73 0 04 0 73 0 04 and 0 72 0 05 p 0 01 respectively rg was generally considered as the important driver for et and gpp and several studies have proved that et is mainly driven by global radiation in humid regions aguilos et al 2019 zhang et al 2016b 2016a also indicated that net radiation was the main controlling meteorological factor affecting leaf plant transpiration and ecosystem et ta and vpd were also widely reported as important factors regulating water consumption and carbon consequences wagner et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a besides ch2o and cco2 were significantly correlated with et with the r value of 0 36 0 04 0 37 0 07 p 0 05 and were also significantly correlated with gpp with the r value of 0 47 0 13 0 42 0 05 respectively p 0 01 table 4 photosynthetic process released water vapor and absorbed co2 ch2o and cco2 were thus changed oppositely within the day did not show resulting in the opposite correlation with et and gpp evrendilek et al 2008 u2 was significantly positively correlated with et r 0 37 0 07 p 0 05 because it could affect the water vapor diffusion process from the canopy to the atmosphere by changing the aerodynamic resistance based on the penman monteith equation penman 1948 the relation of et and gpp to swc was weaker previous studies also reported that swc was not the dominant driving force of seasonal et or gpp in humid region ecosystems hu et al 2008 williams et al 2012 the vegetation factor lait was significantly positively correlated with et 0 55 0 02 and gpp 0 62 0 05 p 0 01 respectively which was consistent with the previous finding that lai was the dominant driving force for both et and gpp brummer et al 2012 lei et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 the considered factors rg ta ch2o and cco2 u2 vpd swc and lait could jointly explain 37 38 variation of ewue 34 58 variation of iwue and 31 41 variation of uwue during the 2018 2020 growing seasons respectively table 5 for the climate factors rg and u2 showed a significantly negative correlation with ewue with the r value of 0 48 0 07 and 0 42 0 05 p 0 01 respectively which agrees with the results of zhang et al 2019 and li et al 2018 besides ta ch2o and vpd significantly correlated with iwue with the r value of 0 49 0 15 0 42 0 09 0 45 0 12 p 0 01 respectively while no factor showed a significant correlation with uwue the explanation rate could be improved to 58 in ewue 75 in iwue 67 in uwue when considering et and gpp vpdi i 0 for ewue 1 for iwue and 0 5 for uwue as the factors in the path analysis fig 10 the indirect effects of the factors mainly through affecting et and gpp vpdi on wue since wue was calculated as the ratio of the two aguilos et al 2019 rg ta u2 and vpd had a larger indirect effect quantified value above 0 50 through et or gpp on ewue fig 11a specifically the indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et were 1 25 0 91 0 54 and 1 03 while they were 0 70 0 71 0 15 and 0 66 through gpp on ewue respectively it s interesting to find that the negative indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et were larger than that of the positive effects through gpp on ewue demonstrating that rg ta u2 and vpd contributed to larger negative effects on ewue mainly through affecting water consumption process previous study indicated that et was more sensitive to climate factors variation than gpp aguilos et al 2018 wagle and kakani 2014 for example li et al 2018 found that rg exerted a stronger positive effect on et than gpp and ultimately resulted in negative responses of wue to increased rg furthermore the indirect effects of lait through et and gpp on ewue were 0 69 and 0 62 respectively demonstrating lait had a larger indirect effect through both et and gpp on ewue resulting in insignificant relations with ewue this result is consistent with results reported for other temperate forests beer et al 2009 and crop sites jiang et al 2020 xie et al 2016 different types of wue responded differently to climate and vegetation factors even all of them were calculated at the ecosystem scale due to the incorporating of the effects of vpd on gpp table 5 the indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et on iwue were 1 14 0 83 0 50 and 0 94 while they were 0 95 0 94 0 25 and 1 08 through gpp vpd on iwue respectively fig 11b however the indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et on uwue were 1 35 0 98 0 59 and 1 12 while they were 1 30 0 96 0 25 and 1 08 through gpp vpd0 5 on uwue respectively fig 11c it is worth noting that the quantified indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et and gpp vpd vpd0 5 on iwue uwue were higher than that of ewue demonstrating the enhanced coupled relationship between et and gpp vpd vpd0 5 at the ecosystem scale fig s3 also can prove it with the increasing correlation between et and gpp gpp vpd and gpp vpd0 5 with the r2 of 0 64 0 74 and 0 80 at half hourly scale and 0 70 0 72 and 0 75 at daily scale besides the differences between the indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et and gpp on ewue were 0 55 0 20 0 39 and 0 37 respectively while the differences were 0 19 0 11 0 25 0 14 between the indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et and gpp vpd on iwue and were 0 05 0 02 0 34 and 0 04 between the indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et and gpp vpd0 5 on uwue respectively the generally declined differences were found after gpp incorporating vpd or vpd0 5 the enhanced et gpp vpdi coupled pattern demonstrated that iwue especially uwue could better balance the influence of climate factors on wue through water consumption and carbon assimilation process which may be the source of the independence of uwue on environmental conditions we have found wueu could well balance the climatic factors and physiological factors affecting water consumption and photosynthetic process due to the strengthen coupled relationship between tr pn vpdl 0 5 at the leaf scale transpiration and photosynthesis measurements at leaf scale can be upscale to ecosystem scale water consummation and productivity alam et al 2021 ding et al 2013 li et al 2015 roupsard et al 2009 therefore the effect of vpd on the photosynthesis transpiration relationship may be also suitable at the ecosystem scale the growing season average half hourly diurnal variations of vpd gpp vpd gpp vpd0 5 gpp and et are illustrated in fig 12 to explore the enhanced coupled patterns between et and gpp vpdi we found that the time lags between vpd et and gpp existed and resulted in hysteresis curves fig 12b c specifically there was a counterclockwise loop for the et vs vpd relationship and a clockwise hysteresis loop in the et vs gpp relationship using the product of gpp and vpd the hysteresis curves between et vs gpp vpd were reduced fig 12d while gpp vpd0 5 was more effective in minimizing the time lags between gpp and et and gpp vpd0 5 thus agreed very well with the diurnal variations in et with higher correlation coefficient r 0 99 fig 12e daily et and gpp values were the sums of the half hour data which may explicate why uwue was more independent of both et and gpp vpd0 5 variations notably uwue as a robust ecosystem scale indicator greatly simplified the complex plant physiological processes related to water and carbon in land atmosphere systems lin et al 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2019 the exponent of vpd to et in ecosystem or tr at the leaf scale may not be consistent and even varied across the different ecosystems zhou et al 2014 some purely empirical results that fitted the exponent of vpd dependence to data have demonstrated that the exponent varied slightly from 0 5 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 therefore further study is still needed to explore the mechanism of vpd on affecting water carbon coupling at different spatiotemporal scales besides with one study it will be too difficult to conclude all the factors influencing the water carbon flux and wue the effects of other agronomic factors such as fertilizer application water management wue should be considered for further study 4 conclusions leaf and ecosystem level water carbon wue variations and their controlling factors were analyzed based on water and carbon measurements during three consecutive growing seasons in a kiwifruit orchard in southwest china the main conclusions were as follows 1 tr and pn in exposed leaves were different from those of shaded leaves due to the difference in light availability resulting in different diurnal variations of wuei in exposed and shaded leaves shaded leaves consumed a high amount of water but did not contribute to increase carbon and improve wuei par and gs were the most important factors affecting leaf pn and tr respectively vpdl significantly affected wuel p 0 01 ta vpdl and gs affected wuei mainly through leaf water consumption while par affected wuei mainly through leaf photosynthetic process 2 et and gpp were mainly affected by rg ta vpd and lait rg and u2 were significantly correlated with ewue ta ch2o vpd and lait were significantly correlated with iwue while no factor was significantly correlated with uwue the climatic factors rg ta u2 and vpd contributed to larger indirect effects on ewue mainly through affecting et than gpp while the differences between the two were reduced after gpp incorporating vpdi which may be the source of the dependence of iwue and uwue on environmental conditions 3 wueu defined as the ratio of pn vpdl 0 5 and tr can be considered as an effective indicator quantifying the coupled relationship between tr and pn vpdl 0 5 at the leaf scale gpp and vpd0 5 combination was supported due to reducing time lags among gpp et and vpd in the day and resulted in an enhanced coupled relationship between et and gpp vpd0 5 at the ecosystem scale

9807,understanding the characteristics of water use efficiency wue and its controlling factors in the agricultural ecosystem can help us better understand the coupled process between water use and carbon assimilation spatially the characteristics of the leaf and ecosystem level water carbon and wue variations as well as their drivers in a kiwifruit orchard were systematically analyzed during the growing seasons of 2018 2020 the results showed that leaf transpiration rate tr net photosynthetic rate pn and instantaneous wue wuei in exposed leaves were 2 25 2 77 8 32 9 44 and 2 53 3 77 times higher than those of shaded leaves tr and pn were significantly affected by photosynthetic active radiation par and stomatal conductance gs air temperature ta leaf water vapor deficit vpdl and stomatal conductance gs affected wuei through leaf water consumption while par affected wuei through leaf photosynthetic process averaged evapotranspiration et gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem wue ewue were 551 30 75 92 kg h2o m 2 1475 37 59 201 25 g c m 2 and 2 68 0 04 g c kg 1 h2o respectively global total radiation rg ta and vpd were the dominant climatic factors affecting et and gpp while rg and wind speed u2 were significantly correlated with ewue p 0 01 wueu defined as the ratio of pn vpdl 0 5 and tr could be considered as an effective indicator quantifying the coupled relationship between tr and pn vpdl 0 5 at the leaf scale the coupled relationship between et and gpp was strengthened after incorporating the effect of vpd on gpp due to reduced time lags among gpp et and vpd at the ecosystem scale rg ta u2 and vpd contributed to greater effects through et than that of gpp on ewue while the differences between them were reduced after incorporating vpd on gpp which may be the source of the dependence of iwue gpp vpd et and uwue gpp vpd et on environmental conditions this study enriches the scarce literature on what drives multi scale water and carbon in a humid orchard and contributes to improving the understanding of the coupled process of water and carbon incorporating the effect of vpd at leaf and ecosystem scales keywords evapotranspiration transpiration gross primary productivity water use efficiency drip irrigation kiwifruit orchard 1 introduction water use efficiency wue generally defined as the ratio of carbon dioxide co2 assimilation to water loss has become an effective integral trait for quantifying the link of the water cycle and the carbon cycle brummer et al 2012 campoy et al 2019 yang et al 2016 furthermore wue is essential for water saving potential evaluation and adequate estimation of crop production gong et al 2017 li et al 2015 the kiwifruit actinidia deliciosa a chev is an increasingly important crop and the number of kiwifruit plantations in the agricultural areas of southwest china has increased rapidly and accounted for about 21 of the national total until 2018 zheng et al 2020 kiwifruit cultivation has developed a pillar industry for rural economic development and industrial poverty alleviation in southwest china optimal kiwifruit production requires precise agronomy and water management in practice which is expected to benefit from an understanding of the coupled process of carbon and water in the kiwifruit orchard song et al 2017 testi et al 2008 the appearance of carbon and water exchange measurement equipment provides the opportunity to study water use efficiency at multiple spatial scales eichelmann et al 2016 gong et al 2017 eddy covariance ec a sound micrometeorological theory based method for quantifying continuous exchange fluxes of gases energy and momentum between the atmosphere and land surface provides a unique method for quantifying wue at the crop ecosystem level for research and application in water management and climate change anapalli et al 2020 wilson et al 2001 water vapor and co2 flux exchange at the leaf level can be measured from the li 6400 photosynthesis system zhang et al 2016b 2016a numerous literatures have systematically analyzed the drivers of single water use and carbon gain process ai et al 2020 wang and yamanaka 2014 wang et al 2014 williams et al 2012 zhou et al 2019 these studies showed that water consumption and carbon assimilation are mainly controlled by environmental factors e g available energy chen et al 2018 air temperature ta vapor pressure deficit vpd wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a water availability zhang et al 2016a 2016b and atmospheric co2 concentration chen et al 2018 kergoat et al 2002 plant phenological and physiological controls e g stomatal conductance gs lei et al 2018 wang and yamanaka 2014 leaf area index lai wang et al 2017 2018 however the importance of these factors varies among climatic zones and ecosystems besides there are some differences of the most controlling meteorological factors in water use and carbon at different scales zhang et al 2016b 2016a for example zhang et al 2016b 2016a indicated leaf tr and ecosystem et could be well characterized by net radiation ta vpd and wind speed u but the transpiration of plants could not be characterized by them although a wealth of literature is available on the drivers of plant water use and carbon gain process most of them concentrated on arid and semi arid regions chen et al 2018 gong et al 2017 fan et al 2021 hu and lei 2021 zheng et al 2021 the variation characteristics of wue are complex law et al 2002 wagle et al 2016 since the conditions in climate the strength of coupling between carbon gain and water use and their responses to climate and other environmental changes affect wue gu et al 1999 hu et al 2008 yu et al 2008 therefore the characteristics of water and carbon fluxes and wue in humid farmlands still need to be investigated numerous studies have addressed the relationships between variables and wue by analyzing their correlations brummer et al 2012 gao et al 2019 lin et al 2018a wang et al 2018 however the effect of one factor on wue may be offset by other covarying factors it is still unclear how the factors regulate wue through plant water use or carbon assimilation processes li et al 2018 found that rg exerted a stronger positive effect on et than gpp and resulted in negative wue across biomes lai had a significantly greater positive effect on gpp than et resulting in a positive reaction of wue to the increase of lai however fewer studies have clarified the characteristics of multi scale wue and the differences in the quantitative responses of leaf and ecosystem scale water use and carbon gain to the environmental and vegetation physiological factors which limits the understanding of plant water and carbon cycle processes ecosystem wue ewue is calculated as a ratio of carbon gain to water consumption at the ecosystem scale ewue has been frequently observed to decrease under higher vpd conditions across various time scales law et al 2002 since stomatal conductance is limited by higher vpd and thus limits plant s photosynthesis ability due to reduced co2 concentrations inside leaves schulze et al 1975 ewue multiplication with vpd or vpd0 5 leads to a quantity called inherent wue iwue gpp vpd et or underlying wue uwue gpp vpd0 5 et to incorporate the effect of vpd regarding the photosynthesis transpiration relationship through stomatal conductance beer et al 2009 zhou et al 2015 the relationship between gpp vpd and et is stronger than that between gpp and et after considering the nonlinear effect of vpd on et beer et al 2009 therefore iwue has been widely used to identify the ecosystem responses to environmental changes such as rising co2 concentrations since the ratio is related to the difference between ambient and inner leaf partial pressures of co2 ca ci beer et al 2009 however the gpp vpd versus et relationship depends on the assumed constancy of the ratio of interleaf over ambient partial pressure of co2 ci ca within the canopy under certain environmental conditions while ci ca at the leaf scale varies both diurnally and seasonally which may lead to nonlinear relationships between gpp vpd and et at the ecosystem scale zhou et al 2014 showed uwue did not exhibit a significant seasonal trend like ewue or iwue and other environmental variables because of the stronger linear relationship between gpp vpd0 5 and et than that between gpp vpd and et several studies have shown that variations in ci ca depend on vpd farquhar et al 1993 batista et al 2012 therefore the independence of uwue on environmental changes may indicate a possible adaptive adjustment of plant physiology gs net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration tr etc to a changing atmospheric environment zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 2016 however the dependent mechanism and function of carbon processes incorporating vpd on wue at both leaf and ecosystem scales have not yet been considered in previous studies in this study a successive three year experiment was conducted in a kiwifruit orchard in the humid region of southwest china the objectives of the present study were to 1 investigate the characteristics of water and carbon fluxes and wue 2 quantify the effects of the main driver variables on water and carbon fluxes and wue 3 compare the quantitative effects of environmental and vegetation factors on wue through tr et and pn gpp using the path analysis method and 4 reveal the coupled mechanism of carbon flux incorporating vpd on wue at leaf and ecosystem scales 2 material and methods 2 1 study site

soil bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 consisting of 76 80 silt 12 29 sand and 10 91 clay the saturated volumetrical soil water content θs and field capacity θf were 47 and 34 respectively kiwifruit trees actinidia chinensis deliciosa cv jin yan were chosen as experimental trees the trees were planted in 2006 with a distance of 5 0 4 5 m and began to bear fruits in 2009 the orchard field was approximately 753 ha in size understory weeds mainly included alternanthera philoxeroides mart griseb echinochloa crusgalli l besuv and malachium aquatieurn l fries and was maintained at low densities through the use of herbicides the kiwi field was irrigated using the drip irrigation system the drip irrigation tape was arranged between two rows with a dripper of 1 6 l h irrigation was applied only when the swc fell below 70 θf and the upper limit of irrigation was 85 θf irrigation amount was calculated as follows 1 m 1000 h p β 1 β 2 θ f where m is the irrigation amount mm γ is the averaged soil bulk density g cm 3 h is the root depth 0 6 m θf is the field capacity g cm 3 β1 and β2 represent 85 θf and 70 θf respectively p is the wetting ratio 50 based on the formula and relevant parameters m was calculated to be 15 3 mm the n p and k fertilizers application rates during the whole season were 141 8 kg ha 1 179 3 kg ha 1 and 296 1 kg ha 1 respectively the detailed application of n p and k were described by zheng et al 2020 2 2 leaf transpiration and photosynthesis measurements a li 6400 photosynthesis system li cor usa was used to measure leaf transpiration rate tr net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs and climatic parameters on three cloudless sunny days 9 00 19 00 during the annual cycle three exposed leaves from the top and three shaded leaves from the lower parts of the canopy were selected as the measured leaves the leaves maintained natural orientation to the sun s rays for each measurement and these measurements were conducted within 2 h to avoid the larger discrepancy in the environmental conditions 2 3 flux data measurement processes and gap filling a close path ec system was equipped with a fast response 3d sonic anemometer csat3a campbell scientific inc ut usa to measure the fluctuations in the wind velocity components and sonic air temperature and a close path co2 h2o gas analyzer ec155 campbell scientific inc usa to measure the water vapor and carbon dioxide density fluctuations the ec system was installed at the east central part of the kiwifruit orchard with the sensors installing at a height of 8 0 m the orchard can provide a large and homogeneous fetch raw high frequency 10 hz flux data were processed using the eddypro software following the standard routines including double coordinate rotation time lags compensation low and high frequency corrections falge 2001 the data were then collected and averaged at half hour intervals using the datalogger support software 4 4 campbell scientific inc usa the half hour data were then carefully screened according to the following criteria 1 incomplete half hourly measurements and periods with rain events were removed 2 the processed eddypro data carrying quality flags in values ranging from 0 higher quality to 9 lower quality and the fluxes with a quality flag of 7 9 were discarded 3 friction velocity u was used as the main criterion of turbulence intensity and only the flux data with high turbulence conditions were thus regarded as reliable data u 0 15 m s 1 and the threshold 0 15 m s 1 was determined according to an objective method described by papale et al 2006 zhu et al 2006 a total of 11 7 daytime and 41 5 nighttime le data were removed according to the above criteria shorter gaps 2 h were filled with linear interpolation and larger gaps 2 h were filled using mean diurnal variation mdv with a window of 7 days falge 2001 if there were no similar meteorological conditions within the time window the averaging window was expanded to 14 days reichstein et al 2005 the energy balance closure ebc statistics were used to check the quality of flux data the ebc was the slope of the linear regression between the measured eddy turbulent fluxes le h and the available energy rn g the ebc values calculated by half hour data were 0 96 0 97 and 0 88 with the determined coefficient r2 of 0 76 0 81 and 0 73 during the 2018 2020 growing seasons fig 1 respectively the ebc values were 1 09 1 11 and 1 02 when using the daily value accumulating from the half hourly data with the r2 of 0 97 0 95 and 0 94 during 2018 2020 growing seasons respectively the degree of ebc of this site was comparable to the reported results in global fluxnet ranging from 0 53 to 0 99 wilson et al 2001 indicating that estimates on the surface energy exchanges and components by the ec system provided in the humid orchard were reasonably satisfactory as both co2 and water vapor concentrations in the air were measured with the same infrared gas analyzer the higher ebc also reflected the accuracy of co2 flux measured anapalli et al 2019a 2019b data gaps 2 h in missing carbon flux data were filled with linear interpolation for large gaps 2 h

analysis is a typical multivariate statistical analysis method to explore relationships among numerous variables khazaie et al 2011 zhang et al 2016a this method can elucidate the degree of the direct effect of independent variables on the dependent variables as well as the indirect effect of one independent variable on the dependent variables through other independent variables khazaie et al 2011 sun et al 2020 a detailed description can be found in the references khazaie et al 2011 xing et al 2016 in this study the path analysis method was applied to determine the relative direct and indirect effects of environmental and physiological factors on tr pn and wue at the leaf scale and also the indirect effects of environmental and vegetation physiological factors through tr et and pn gpp on wue at the leaf ecosystem scale 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations of environmental and vegetation factors the variations of the main meteorological factors during the growing seasons of 2018 2020 are illustrated in fig 2 ta increased gradually from mid march but decreased gradually after reaching its maximum in july with the mean of 21 36 20 81 and 22 59 during the three growing seasons respectively rg shared a similar seasonal variation and fluctuated significantly due to frequent cloudy and rainy weather with the mean of 148 28 133 43 and 158 08 w m 2 during the three growing seasons respectively vpd was lower than 10 hpa for most days with the mean of 6 76 5 94 and 6 16 hpa during the three growing seasons respectively u2 showed a decreasing trend during the growing seasons both lait and laic presented single curves lait was above 1 m2 m 2 in the initial growing season due to the weed growth reached its peak value of 4 06 m2 m 2 in 2018 3 87 m2 m 2 in 2019 and 3 94 m2 m 2 in 2020 and then decreased gradually due to the leaf senescence the seasonal and diurnal variations of laisu and laish are illustrated in fig s1 laish increased rapidly when laisu was stabilized and occupied a larger proportion at higher lait ranges laisu and laish changed during the daytime due to the changes of the sun rays laisu reached its minimum value at noon while the trend of laish was opposite to that of laisu the total precipitation was 1429 0 1322 4 and 1257 7 mm during the three growing seasons respectively and mainly concentrated in june september volumetric soil water content swc increased with increasing soil depth and was generally above 35 for most days except for several days at the initial growth stage the actual irrigation amount was 147 7 134 3 and 107 4 mm during the three growing seasons respectively and mainly concentrated in march may fig 3 3 2 diurnal variations of leaf tr pn wue and their controlling factors 3 2 1 diurnal patterns of tr pn and wuei in exposed and shaded leaves the diurnal patterns of kiwifruit tr pn and wuei of exposed leaves and shaded leaves on three typical sunny days are illustrated in fig 4 exposed and shaded leaf tr and pn generally increased with the increasing solar radiation reached their maximum values at noon around 11 00 15 00 and then decreased with the decline in solar radiation the values of tr and pn in exposed leaves were higher than those of shaded leaves the mean diurnal values of tr were 3 54 4 62 and 4 30 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 and the values of pn were 7 41 6 95 7 06 µmol co2 m 2 s 1 in the exposed leaf on the three measured dates 5 13 6 05 and 7 25 of 2018 growing season respectively however the corresponding values in shaded leaf were 1 57 1 67 and 1 60 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 for tr 0 78 1 01 and 0 94 µmol co2 m 2 s 1 for pn respectively tr in exposed leaves was 2 25 2 77 times higher than that of the shaded leaves while pn in exposed leaves was 8 32 9 44 times higher than that of the shaded leaves this demonstrated that the water and carbon patterns in shaded and exposed leaves were significantly different within the canopy xiloyannis et al 2000 indicated that tr in exposed leaves was twice higher than that of shaded kiwifruit and apricot leaves while pn was 2 4 times higher than that of the shaded one higher tr and pn in upper leaves than lower leaves were also found in other species due to differences in light availability medrano et al 2012 meir et al 2002 niinemets 2007 zhang et al 2016a exposed leaf wuei decreased with the increasing par and reached their minimum at the noon which agreed with the observations of xiloyannis et al 2000 and montanaro et al 2009 shaded leaf wuei attained their maximum at the noon fig 4 mean diurnal values of exposed leaf wuei were 2 11 1 52 and 1 73 µmol co2 mmol h2o 1 while the values in shaded leaf wuei were 0 56 0 60 and 0 58 µmol co2 mmol h2o 1 which were 2 53 3 77 times higher than those of the shaded leaf on the three measured days respectively the more effective pn than tr caused the higher wuei in exposed leaves xiloyannis et al 2000 also pointed out that exposed leaves showed a 3 8 times higher wuei than shaded leaves in apricot plants the exposed leaf area accounted for 47 96 45 19 and 41 79 of the total canopy leaf area on the three days respectively taking into account the ratio of the exposed and shaded leaves the contributions of the exposed and shaded portions of the canopy to the total tr and pn were obtained fig 5 exposed and shaded leaves contributed 86 51 89 64 and 10 36 13 49 to the total pn while 65 88 69 46 and 30 54 34 12 were their contributions to the total tr respectively the results demonstrated that shaded leaves consumed a high amount of water while they did not contribute to increase daily carbon and improve wue xiloyannis et al 2000 also found exposed kiwifruit leaves can contribute to 62 tr and 98 pn during the whole cycle respectively and exposed apricot leaves can contribute to 66 tr and 81 pn respectively reasonable utilization of agricultural water resources not only relies on the appropriate choice of the irrigation technique but also the wue of the canopy therefore it is thus fundamental to obtain a correct architecture of the canopy and particularly the exposed shaded leaves ratio this can be done through appropriate training systems and using summer pruning and or removing shaded leaves to improve the exposed shaded leaves ratio within the canopy which would be possible to improve the daily carbon balance and wue 3 2 2 responses of leaf tr pn and wue to climate and physiological factors ta par vpdl and gs jointly explained 70 and 84 variance of pn and tr respectively p 0 01 table 2 the critical factors affecting pn were par and gs with the total effects of 0 76 and 0 71 respectively p 0 01 ta par vpdl and gs significantly affected leaf tr with the total effects of 0 52 0 62 0 44 p 0 05 and 0 87 respectively p 0 01 par had a significant direct effect on pn while gs had a significant direct effect on tr p 0 01 demonstrating that water consumption was controlled by gs while photosynthetic activity was more related to par previous studies have also proved that leaf tr was linearly related to gs whereas pn may be limited by a variety of other factors and did not respond linearly to instantaneous changes in gs fig s2 hu et al 2008 massmann et al 2019 besides none of the factors had a significant indirect effect on leaf scale tr or pn the explained variance was low in wuei 8 wueu 27 and wuel 0 table 2 vpdl significantly affected leaf wuel with the total effects of 0 53 p 0 01 besides there was no factor with significant total effects on wuei and wueu the explained variances of wuei wuel and wueu were improved to 90 85 and 87 when taking tr and pn pn vpdl in wuel pn vpdl 0 5 in wueu as the factors into the path analysis fig 6 the indirect effects of ta par vpdl and gs through tr on wuei were 0 86 1 02 0 72 and 1 42 and were 0 54 1 17 0 43 and 1 09 through pn respectively fig 7a the indirect effects of the factors through tr and pn on wuei were adverse and were thus partially offset resulting in lower capacity of tr and pn to solely explain the variation of wuei fig 6a besides ta vpdl and gs had larger indirect effects through tr than that of pn on wuei the quantified differences between the two were 0 32 0 29 and 0 33 demonstrating the factors ta vpdl and gs affected wuei mainly through leaf water consumption while par affected wuei mainly through leaf photosynthetic process the indirect effects of ta par vpdl and gs through tr on wuel were 0 81 0 98 0 72 and 1 33 while they were 0 42 0 82 0 1 04 and 1 23 through pn vpdl on wuel respectively fig 7b the quantified indirect effects of the factors through tr and pn vpdl on wuel were not enhanced apparently and even reduced compared to those of wuei fig 6a also showed that pn vpdl possessed higher explanation rate 31 84 than tr 0 53 indicating wuel could not well balance the tr pn vpdl coupling relationship at the leaf scale the indirect effects of ta par vpdl and gs through tr on wueu were 0 94 1 14 0 79 and 1 56 while the values were 0 86 1 14 0 84 and 1 48 through pn vpdl 0 5 on wueu respectively fig 7c the increased indirect effects of ta par vpdl and gs through tr and pn vpdl 0 5 on wueu were found compared to those of wuei and wuel demonstrating the enhanced coupled pattern between tr and pn vpdl 0 5 fig 6a also showed that both pn vpdl 0 5 and tr possessed lower explanation rate due to the enhanced tr pn vpdl 0 5 coupling relationship with the values of 3 47 and 7 11 respectively besides the differences between the indirect effects of the factors ta par vpdl and gs through tr and pn vpdl 0 5 on wueu were 0 08 0 00 0 03 and 0 08 respectively the equal but adverse indirect effects of the factors through tr and pn vpdl 0 5 were offset demonstrating that ta par vpdl and gs contributed to nearly equal effects on wueu by affecting leaf water consumption and photosynthetic process the decreased differences between the two demonstrated wueu could well balance the climatic factors ta par and vpdl and physiological factor gs affecting water consumption and photosynthetic process at the leaf scale we further studied how the exponent of vpdl dependence affected the form of leaf scale tr pn relationship using the fitted relationships tr vs gpp vpdl i fig 8 pn exhibited a stronger linear relationship with tr r2 0 66 p 0 01 however the stronger linear relationship between tr and pn vpdl i was found when i 1 and 0 5 with the r2 of 0 69 and 0 73 respectively fig 8c d therefore the enhanced linear correlation between tr pn vpdl 0 5 may be the reason for the increased effects of ta par vpd and gs through tr and pn vpd0 5 on wueu 3 3 seasonal variations of ecosystem scale et gpp and wue and their controlling factors 3 3 1 seasonal variations of et gpp and wue seasonal variations of daily et gpp and wue are illustrated in fig 9 et and gpp gradually increased to a seasonal maximum during the active growing season in august and then decreased remarkably due to unfavorable environmental conditions light and heat availability and leaf senescence the daily average et varied between 1 95 and 2 34 mm d 1 and gpp varied between 5 88 and 6 77 g c m 2 d 1 during the three growing seasons the values were comparable to the observations in a primary subtropical evergreen forest by the ec method in southwest china with et of 2 37 mm d 1 and gpp of 5 86 g c m 2 d 1 song et al 2017 the cumulated et was 637 33 549 88 and 452 30 mm during the 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively table 3 the cumulated gpp was 1669 35 1469 67 and 1206 76 g c m 2 during the 2018 2019 and 2020 growing seasons respectively the less cumulated value of et and gpp in 2020 was mainly due to the short measured period lack of 40 and 51 days compared to that of the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons respectively affected by et and gpp wue hardly showed apparent seasonal variations during the growing seasons due to frequent precipitation events over the growing seasons fig 9c e daily mean ewue mainly varied between 2 and 4 g c kg h2o 1 while growing season iwue and uwue mainly varied between 1 and 2 g c kpa kg 1 h2o 1 3 g c kpa0 5 kg h2o 1 respectively mean growing season ewue was 2 68 0 07 g c kg h2o 1 which was comparable to previous studies on corn soybean yield 3 1 g c kg h2o 1 and an adjacent coniferous forest site 2 28 2 68 g c kg h2o 1 song et al 2017 however the value was larger than the value of 1 73 g c kg h2o 1 estimated from global croplands ai et al 2020 this study focused on growing seasons during which greater seasonal carbon uptake by kiwifruit trees offset higher water use which caused a higher ewue than other annul cropland ewue estimates furthermore the growing season averaged iwue was 1 68 0 07 g c kpa kg h2o 1 uwue was 2 12 0 04 g c kpa0 5 kg h2o 1 respectively the uwue values were comparable with those obtained at soybean sites 2 27 2 66 g c kpa0 5 kg h2o 1 zhou et al 2015 but higher than the value observed in a primary subtropical evergreen forest in southwest china by the ec method 1 35 1 51 g c kpa0 5 kg h2o 1 song et al 2017 the lower value at their site may be related to the lower vpd 3 30 0 23 hpa 3 3 2 responses of et gpp and wue to climatic and vegetation factors the considered factors rg ta the concentration of h2o ch2o and co2 cco2 u2 vpd swc and lait could explain 72 87 variation of et and 62 78 variation of gpp table 4 among them rg was recognized as the most important abiotic factor affecting et followed by vpd and ta with the r value of 0 87 0 03 0 76 0 04 0 63 0 05 respectively rg vpd and ta were also strongly correlated with gpp with the r value of 0 73 0 04 0 73 0 04 and 0 72 0 05 p 0 01 respectively rg was generally considered as the important driver for et and gpp and several studies have proved that et is mainly driven by global radiation in humid regions aguilos et al 2019 zhang et al 2016b 2016a also indicated that net radiation was the main controlling meteorological factor affecting leaf plant transpiration and ecosystem et ta and vpd were also widely reported as important factors regulating water consumption and carbon consequences wagner et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a besides ch2o and cco2 were significantly correlated with et with the r value of 0 36 0 04 0 37 0 07 p 0 05 and were also significantly correlated with gpp with the r value of 0 47 0 13 0 42 0 05 respectively p 0 01 table 4 photosynthetic process released water vapor and absorbed co2 ch2o and cco2 were thus changed oppositely within the day did not show resulting in the opposite correlation with et and gpp evrendilek et al 2008 u2 was significantly positively correlated with et r 0 37 0 07 p 0 05 because it could affect the water vapor diffusion process from the canopy to the atmosphere by changing the aerodynamic resistance based on the penman monteith equation penman 1948 the relation of et and gpp to swc was weaker previous studies also reported that swc was not the dominant driving force of seasonal et or gpp in humid region ecosystems hu et al 2008 williams et al 2012 the vegetation factor lait was significantly positively correlated with et 0 55 0 02 and gpp 0 62 0 05 p 0 01 respectively which was consistent with the previous finding that lai was the dominant driving force for both et and gpp brummer et al 2012 lei et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 the considered factors rg ta ch2o and cco2 u2 vpd swc and lait could jointly explain 37 38 variation of ewue 34 58 variation of iwue and 31 41 variation of uwue during the 2018 2020 growing seasons respectively table 5 for the climate factors rg and u2 showed a significantly negative correlation with ewue with the r value of 0 48 0 07 and 0 42 0 05 p 0 01 respectively which agrees with the results of zhang et al 2019 and li et al 2018 besides ta ch2o and vpd significantly correlated with iwue with the r value of 0 49 0 15 0 42 0 09 0 45 0 12 p 0 01 respectively while no factor showed a significant correlation with uwue the explanation rate could be improved to 58 in ewue 75 in iwue 67 in uwue when considering et and gpp vpdi i 0 for ewue 1 for iwue and 0 5 for uwue as the factors in the path analysis fig 10 the indirect effects of the factors mainly through affecting et and gpp vpdi on wue since wue was calculated as the ratio of the two aguilos et al 2019 rg ta u2 and vpd had a larger indirect effect quantified value above 0 50 through et or gpp on ewue fig 11a specifically the indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et were 1 25 0 91 0 54 and 1 03 while they were 0 70 0 71 0 15 and 0 66 through gpp on ewue respectively it s interesting to find that the negative indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et were larger than that of the positive effects through gpp on ewue demonstrating that rg ta u2 and vpd contributed to larger negative effects on ewue mainly through affecting water consumption process previous study indicated that et was more sensitive to climate factors variation than gpp aguilos et al 2018 wagle and kakani 2014 for example li et al 2018 found that rg exerted a stronger positive effect on et than gpp and ultimately resulted in negative responses of wue to increased rg furthermore the indirect effects of lait through et and gpp on ewue were 0 69 and 0 62 respectively demonstrating lait had a larger indirect effect through both et and gpp on ewue resulting in insignificant relations with ewue this result is consistent with results reported for other temperate forests beer et al 2009 and crop sites jiang et al 2020 xie et al 2016 different types of wue responded differently to climate and vegetation factors even all of them were calculated at the ecosystem scale due to the incorporating of the effects of vpd on gpp table 5 the indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et on iwue were 1 14 0 83 0 50 and 0 94 while they were 0 95 0 94 0 25 and 1 08 through gpp vpd on iwue respectively fig 11b however the indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et on uwue were 1 35 0 98 0 59 and 1 12 while they were 1 30 0 96 0 25 and 1 08 through gpp vpd0 5 on uwue respectively fig 11c it is worth noting that the quantified indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et and gpp vpd vpd0 5 on iwue uwue were higher than that of ewue demonstrating the enhanced coupled relationship between et and gpp vpd vpd0 5 at the ecosystem scale fig s3 also can prove it with the increasing correlation between et and gpp gpp vpd and gpp vpd0 5 with the r2 of 0 64 0 74 and 0 80 at half hourly scale and 0 70 0 72 and 0 75 at daily scale besides the differences between the indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et and gpp on ewue were 0 55 0 20 0 39 and 0 37 respectively while the differences were 0 19 0 11 0 25 0 14 between the indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et and gpp vpd on iwue and were 0 05 0 02 0 34 and 0 04 between the indirect effects of rg ta u2 and vpd through et and gpp vpd0 5 on uwue respectively the generally declined differences were found after gpp incorporating vpd or vpd0 5 the enhanced et gpp vpdi coupled pattern demonstrated that iwue especially uwue could better balance the influence of climate factors on wue through water consumption and carbon assimilation process which may be the source of the independence of uwue on environmental conditions we have found wueu could well balance the climatic factors and physiological factors affecting water consumption and photosynthetic process due to the strengthen coupled relationship between tr pn vpdl 0 5 at the leaf scale transpiration and photosynthesis measurements at leaf scale can be upscale to ecosystem scale water consummation and productivity alam et al 2021 ding et al 2013 li et al 2015 roupsard et al 2009 therefore the effect of vpd on the photosynthesis transpiration relationship may be also suitable at the ecosystem scale the growing season average half hourly diurnal variations of vpd gpp vpd gpp vpd0 5 gpp and et are illustrated in fig 12 to explore the enhanced coupled patterns between et and gpp vpdi we found that the time lags between vpd et and gpp existed and resulted in hysteresis curves fig 12b c specifically there was a counterclockwise loop for the et vs vpd relationship and a clockwise hysteresis loop in the et vs gpp relationship using the product of gpp and vpd the hysteresis curves between et vs gpp vpd were reduced fig 12d while gpp vpd0 5 was more effective in minimizing the time lags between gpp and et and gpp vpd0 5 thus agreed very well with the diurnal variations in et with higher correlation coefficient r 0 99 fig 12e daily et and gpp values were the sums of the half hour data which may explicate why uwue was more independent of both et and gpp vpd0 5 variations notably uwue as a robust ecosystem scale indicator greatly simplified the complex plant physiological processes related to water and carbon in land atmosphere systems lin et al 2018a 2018b zhang et al 2019 the exponent of vpd to et in ecosystem or tr at the leaf scale may not be consistent and even varied across the different ecosystems zhou et al 2014 some purely empirical results that fitted the exponent of vpd dependence to data have demonstrated that the exponent varied slightly from 0 5 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 therefore further study is still needed to explore the mechanism of vpd on affecting water carbon coupling at different spatiotemporal scales besides with one study it will be too difficult to conclude all the factors influencing the water carbon flux and wue the effects of other agronomic factors such as fertilizer application water management wue should be considered for further study 4 conclusions leaf and ecosystem level water carbon wue variations and their controlling factors were analyzed based on water and carbon measurements during three consecutive growing seasons in a kiwifruit orchard in southwest china the main conclusions were as follows 1 tr and pn in exposed leaves were different from those of shaded leaves due to the difference in light availability resulting in different diurnal variations of wuei in exposed and shaded leaves shaded leaves consumed a high amount of water but did not contribute to increase carbon and improve wuei par and gs were the most important factors affecting leaf pn and tr respectively vpdl significantly affected wuel p 0 01 ta vpdl and gs affected wuei mainly through leaf water consumption while par affected wuei mainly through leaf photosynthetic process 2 et and gpp were mainly affected by rg ta vpd and lait rg and u2 were significantly correlated with ewue ta ch2o vpd and lait were significantly correlated with iwue while no factor was significantly correlated with uwue the climatic factors rg ta u2 and vpd contributed to larger indirect effects on ewue mainly through affecting et than gpp while the differences between the two were reduced after gpp incorporating vpdi which may be the source of the dependence of iwue and uwue on environmental conditions 3 wueu defined as the ratio of pn vpdl 0 5 and tr can be considered as an effective indicator quantifying the coupled relationship between tr and pn vpdl 0 5 at the leaf scale gpp and vpd0 5 combination was supported due to reducing time lags among gpp et and vpd in the day and resulted in an enhanced coupled relationship between et and gpp vpd0 5 at the ecosystem scale

9808,water availability in vineyards varies in space and time the spatiotemporal variability of water availability to vines is affected by terrain meteorology and irrigation this study aimed to analyze the response of vegetative and reproductive attributes of vines to spatiotemporal variability in water availability we quantified the spatial autocorrelation of terrain covariates and grapevine attributes and determined the relative influence ri of the covariates on these attributes in each of four growing seasons 2017 2020 in a vitis vinifera cv sauvignon blanc vineyard five vegetative and reproductive attributes were collected for 240 vines terrain covariates included elevation slope aspect topographic wetness index and categorical landforms and meteorological covariates consisted of annual rainfall and chilling hours a moran s i statistic was computed for each spatial covariate and each grapevine attribute during each season to define temporal changes in spatial variability a multivariate analysis using gradient boosted regression trees algorithm was applied to extract the ri of the covariates the results showed high spatial autocorrelation of the terrain covariates and a strong negative shift in spatial dependency of the grapevine attributes throughout the experiment yield and number of clusters per vine were highly affected by seasonal precipitation ri of 46 15 and 42 59 while changes in inter seasonal cluster weight and pruning weight were highly subjected to irrigation amounts ri of 23 and 26 66 with complementary terrain influences the number of canes per vine was mainly affected by terrain characteristics long term changes in grapevine attributes depended on meteorological shifts while higher precipitation amounts were associated with weaker responses of vines to irrigation strategies the spatial patterns of terrain affected water distribution in the vineyard and controlled the spatial dynamics of grapevine attributes knowledge regarding the space time trends of water availability effects on grapevine attributes may assist decision making of irrigation practices in vineyards keywords water availability terrain spatial autocorrelation vineyard irrigation management spatiotemporal analysis 1 introduction soil water availability is a major factor in grapevine growth and productivity medrano et al 2003 water distribution in vineyards often varies in space and time acevedo opazo et al 2008 depending on various factors spatial variability of water availability in the field may be governed by the spatial patterns of terrain attributes such as elevation slope and aspect ohana levi et al 2019 willwerth and reynolds 2020 while seasonal temporal dynamics in vineyard water regime depend mainly on meteorological conditions such as precipitation amounts wilson et al 2020 and temperature levels de rességuier et al 2020 as well as the irrigation provided to the grapevines ohana levi et al 2020a alongside other agrotechnical practices the spatial distribution of water availability is affected by multiple factors and impacts the spatial variability of the grapevines vegetative and reproductive attributes soil moisture varies from dry conditions in upper slopes to wet conditions in lower slopes where upslope hydrological process affect downslope water availability brolsma and bierkens 2007 this process was found to affect the spatial patterns of vegetation performance which rely on the distribution of soil water availability across the field in an experiment in an aglianico vineyard in southern italy basile et al 2020 found differences in physiological and vegetative responses of grapevines to slope gradient for example downslope vines had lower water stress than upslope vines similarly santesteban et al 2011a found differences in grapevine water stress in different slope aspects in a tempranillo vineyard in southern navarre spain however flat terrain seems to be less favorable to grapevine performance and irimia and patriche 2013 reported the optimal slope range to be 5 15 i e 2 85 8 5 similar slope ranges were reported in a study conducted in illinois by kaan kurtural et al 2008 ohana levi et al 2020a conducted a time series analysis of daily images of evapotranspiration et derived from remote sensing retrievals during four growing seasons in a pinot noir vineyard in california they found that soil type and elevation were the main contributors to et spatial variability furthermore topographic wetness index twi a calculation of the ratio between the absolute area and slope was found to be associated with soil moisture in a sangiovese vineyard central italy costantini et al 2009 and with water stress and canopy cover in a cabernet sauvignon vineyard in israel bahat et al 2021 the response of grapevine attributes to water availability is commonly spatially dependent and relies on the interrelations among multiple factors such as soil characteristics terrain and irrigation management these relationships among field properties are inconsistent and depend on natural and controllable factors such as the climatic region vine variety and rootstock smith and whigham 1999 the temporal distribution of water availability is affected by meteorological attributes such as precipitation and temperature and controllable attributes such as irrigation amounts precipitation has immediate influence on soil moisture while deeper soils are more affected by low intensity rainfall events dry conditions lead to sharp decrease in soil moisture with low spatial variability occurrences of long dry periods are known to have harmful effects on yield in terms of quantity and quality ramos and mulligan 2005 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2006 in an experiment in a california vineyard wilson et al 2020 found that the main component affecting water availability early in the season was precipitation during the wet season which had an impact on leaf area development furthermore larger amounts of seasonal precipitation leading to more stored water in the soil were related to an extended period of canopy growth they also showed that deficit in soil moisture was higher and dynamic during april and may when canopy develops and then stabilized at constant levels of water lost from the soil temporal effects in the seasonal scale may also be attributed to other factors such as chilling hours a chilling requirement must be fulfilled for buds to synchronously burst and is believed to be between 0 and 7 2 c while grapevines typically require between 50 and 400 chilling hours during winter to satisfy endodormancy insufficient chilling can lead to delayed and desynchronized budding and slowing of crop development londo and johnson 2014 fraga et al 2019 soil water content is also known to affect budbreak and further occurrence of phenological stages ramos and martínez casasnovas 2006 van leeuwen et al 2009 therefore modeling the interactions of temporally varying components is required to fully understand between season dynamics of grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes space time distribution of grapevine growth and yield components can be managed during the growing season by irrigation bellvert et al 2020 irrigation practices are intended to control the water stress of the grapevines through management of soil water availability and consequently the vegetative growth physiological conditions yield components and wine quality santesteban et al 2011b munitz et al 2016 however irrigation management is highly dependent on the amount timing and intensity of precipitation wilson et al 2020 reported that changes in irrigation amounts have an immediate effect on leaf area growth and that lower levels of soil moisture due to lower amounts of precipitation are more likely to generate a stronger response of the plant to the irrigation regime nolz et al 2016 showed the interactive effects of precipitation and irrigation levels on soil water content according to precipitation amounts soil depth and dryness of the soil prior to infiltration of precipitation irrigation water various studies illustrated the effects of the spatial factors in the field on vegetative physiological and reproductive attributes acevedo opazo et al 2008 ohana levi et al 2019 yu et al 2021 many works were conducted to quantify the impact of precipitation amounts timing and intensity on water availability in vineyards and consequently on grapevine performance ramos and martínez casasnovas 2009 camps and ramos 2012 ramos 2017 agam et al 2019 however to the best of our knowledge no studies focused on grapevine response to multivariate effects of spatial field attributes and temporal meteorological and controlled factors the innovation of this present research stems from two main notions the first focuses on generating an approach for applying an integrative space time analysis of the response of grapevine attributes to spatially and temporally varying field properties the second notion is to provide an overview on the interactions of factors affecting water availability including direct water sources such as precipitation and irrigation and indirect contributors such as terrain properties that affect water distribution in the field the suggested approach was established using a multivariate dataset collected during four years from a sauvignon blanc vineyard enabling a long term perception of processes and dynamics over space the main objective was to model the response of grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes to water availability in space and time the specific objectives were to 1 define measure and select the spatial and temporal variables to include in the model 2 quantify the spatial autocorrelation of the spatial variables and grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes and 3 determine the relative influence ri of the different covariates on grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes 2 methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the experiment took place between january 2017 and august 2020 in a vineyard located in the gilboa mountain region near kibbutz merav 32 44 n 35 42 e fig 1 vitis vinifera cv sauvignon blanc vines grafted onto 1103 paulsen rootstock were planted in a commercial vineyard during 2009 with vine spacing of 1 5 m along the rows and 3 m between rows the vineyard is located 430 m above sea level on heavy clay soil with limestone bedrock the region is characterized by mediterranean climate with warm dry summers and winter precipitation events ordinarily between october and may with a mean annual amount of 450 mm the experimental plot with an area of 4600 m2 was a part of a commercial vineyard the plot was characterized by a moderately dynamic elevation gradient and included 960 vines that were mainly faced north and north east the irrigation system included five treatments arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates the experimental layout consisted of five irrigation treatments each replicated four times fig 1 van es et al 2007 where each block included three rows one for data collection and two border rows treatments comprised of 16 vines per plot with the outer two vines from each side being buffer vines and the inner 12 vines being measurement vines a total of 240 measurement vines i e 12 vines 4 replicates 5 treatment fig 1b a drip irrigation system with one line per row and in line pressure compensated 2 4 l h 1 uniram drippers was employed with 0 5 m spacing between drippers netafim ltd hatzerim israel an irrigation control unit talgil computing control ltd haifa israel was used to separately irrigate each of the five irrigation treatments 2 2 data collection the data used in this study was based on three types of datasets first the inherent characteristics of the vineyard that were temporally constant and spatially variable second the meteorological conditions that varied through time and third the irrigation treatments and grapevine measurements the dataset consisted of covariates the explanatory variables and the response variables that included grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes table 1 provides descriptive statistics of the dataset including range of values mean standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv 2 2 1 spatial attributes vineyard characteristics spatial representation of the vineyard characteristics was achieved using terrain properties that are easy to acquire various topographic variables may be calculated from a digital elevation model dem amatulli et al 2018 illustrating the different terrain properties and patterns within the field in this study five terrain variables were used fig 2 to assess the effect of spatially dynamic attributes on grapevine attributes elevation a dem measured in meters was derived from a local elevation survey conducted across the vineyard with a spatial resolution of 1 m fig 2a elevation and its spatial variability is known to affect grapevine water demands in vineyards ohana levi et al 2020a in the merav experimental plot the variance in elevation values was very small table 1 slope extracted from the dem fig 2b and indicates the maximum rate of elevation change between one cell to its immediate neighbors the values are given in degrees while lower values correspond to flatter terrain ohana levi et al 2021 slope has been established as one of the most influencing factors on soil moisture thereby affecting water availability to the plants and water stress becker et al 1988 jasse et al 2021 slope was calculated using the raster package in r hijmans 2020 the slope values in the experimental site had the highest variance among the spatially dynamic variables with a cv of 0 12 table 1 northness represents the relative terrain aspect to the north fig 2c it is calculated by applying a cosine transformation to the celestial aspect computed from dem aspect was calculated as the gradient vector at each pixel location with respect to its neighbors such that north is defined as 0 and was computed using the r package raster hijmans 2020 it was then transformed to northness aspect is known to contribute to the vineyard s water demands and its spatial variability thereby affecting the grapevines conditions ohana levi et al 2020a in the experimental site this measure was characterized by a small range and low variance table 1 topographic wetness index twi provides a relative measure of static soil moisture conditions for each pixel in a defined area fig 2d this index quantifies the distribution of accumulated area across downslope pixels beven and kirkby 1979 and is calculated as 1 twi ln a tanβ where a is the upstream contributing area m2 for each pixel and β is the local slope in degrees and was calculated using dynatopmodel package in r metcalfe et al 2018 twi is known to have a strong effect on water stress in vineyards and its spatial patterns were shown to be strongly related to various physiological and yield attributes bahat et al 2021 twi values in the experimental site had a small variance table 1 landforms a categorical variable designed to partition the region into landform classes according to morphometry or identification of geomorphons geomorphologic phenotypes amatulli et al 2018 the elements composing the landforms are valley lower slope flat area middle slope upper slope and ridge these elements were derived using the topographic position index tpi which denotes the difference between the value of a pixel and the mean value of its surrounding neighbors weiss 2001 amatulli et al 2018 tpi is then partitioned into categories according to its values alhusban 2018 in this case sd values such that sd values lower than 1 were classified as valley sd between 1 and 0 5 were classified as lower slope 0 5 and 0 were defined as flat area sd between 0 and 0 5 were middle slope values between 0 5 and 1 were categorized as upper slope and ridge included values above 1 sd 2 2 2 temporal attributes meteorology the study was conducted over a period of four growing seasons each characterized by different meteorological conditions therefore three temporally varying variables table 1 were considered for modeling the temporal effects on grapevine physiology these variables were measured using a meteorological station located 4 5 km north of the experimental plot 32 48 n 35 41 e using a precipitation sensor 15188 lambrecht meteo gmbh gottingen germany seasonal precipitation the accumulated precipitation mm measured at the meteorological station during the winter and spring preceding each growing season table 2 during the experimental period the multiseasonal range was 250 8 555 5 mm table 1 spring precipitation the accumulated precipitation mm during the spring preceding each growing season calculated from march to august table 2 the range of values during the experimental period was very wide 24 4 149 5 mm table 1 with a very high cv 0 63 total chilling hours denote the number of cool hours during each winter preceding the growing seasons it is calculated using the following scoring system average hourly temperature below 7 c equals 1 chilling hour average hourly temperature between 7 c and 10 c equals 0 5 chilling hour average hourly temperature between 10 c and 18 c equals 0 chilling hour average hourly temperature above 18 c equals 1 chilling hour the daily chilling hours are then summed while negative chilling hours are counted as 0 daily chilling hours were accumulated between november and april and provided as total seasonal chilling hours table 2 during the experimental period the values ranged between 217 and 773 5 chilling hours table 1 2 2 3 spatiotemporal attributes irrigation treatments and vine measurements irrigation treatments the treatments included five different irrigation regimes table 3 applied twice a week similar to the local agricultural practices in the commercial vineyard the five treatments were irrigated using different irrigation coefficients based on a regression model developed specifically for wine grapes taking into account the relationship between leaf area index and crop coefficient kc munitz et al 2019 irrigation amounts were calculated as a proportion of crop evapotranspiration etc etc was calculated according to the equation etc eto kc where eto is the reference evapotranspiration calculated according to the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 using data obtained from a local meteorological station munitz et al 2020 treatment a was provided with 30 of estimated etc treatment b with 45 of estimated etc treatment c with 60 of etc estimation treatments d and e were provided with regulated deficit irrigation such that irrigation coefficients were dynamic throughout the season with treatment d provided with 30 of etc during phenological growth stages 1 and 2 and 60 during stage 3 and treatment e provided with 60 of etc during stage 1 and 30 during stages 2 and 3 the dataset used in this study related to the total amount of irrigation mm provided throughout each growing season harvest in 2017 took place during august 6 17 in 2018 between august 1 and 4 in 2019 between august 14 and 17 and in 2020 during august 23 26 a global positioning system gps of the measurement vines was used to ensure their appropriate distribution with respect to the spatial field covariates and measured using a trimble r2 receiver trimble navigation ltd sunnyvale ca usa the following attributes were measured for the 240 measurement vines during the research period clusters per vine the number of clusters were determined for each vine during harvest during the experimental period the range was 23 152 clusters per vine with sd of 18 5 table 1 yield per vine the yield was weighed for each vine kg during harvest this measure is quite variable with a cv of 0 31 table 1 cluster weight an average value kg calculated according to yield weight and number of clusters per vine ranges between 0 04 and 0 27 kg table 1 canes per vine the number of pruned canes were counted after winter pruning this variable was not measured prior to the 2019 growing season due to technical difficulties varies between 15 and 50 canes table 1 pruning weight to assess vegetative development pruned material fresh weight were weighed for each vine kg during winter pruning this variable was not measured prior to the 2019 growing season due to technical difficulties the most varying measure among the response variables with cv of 0 39 table 1 cane weight the average cane weight kg was calculated according to pruning weight and the number of canes per vine this variable was not measured prior to the 2019 growing season due to technical difficulties shifts between 0 01 and 0 09 kg table 1 throughout the experimental period 2 3 variable interactions and selection to assess the degree of correlation among variables a correlation matrix was produced for the entire set of continuous variables correlations between spatial and temporal variables were eliminated variables that showed a strong relationship were excluded from the analysis to avoid redundancy of information and multicollinearity 2 4 assessment of spatial autocorrelation experiments conducted within agricultural fields are subjected to influences of spatially dynamic factors each with a unique spatial distribution pattern across the field usowicz and lipiec 2017 the extent of spatial autocorrelation was computed for the spatially varying continuous variables defined in table 1 as spatial or spatiotemporal including the covariates that characterized the field i e terrain variables and the affected variables i e response table 1 for the latter the analysis was conducted using the data of each growing season to examine the multiseasonal spatial dynamics spatial autocorrelation was assessed using the global moran s i test moran 1948 the outcome values were transformed to z scores that enable evaluating the strength direction and significance α 0 05 of the spatial dependency for each variable where 1 96 z 1 96 denotes a non significant spatial autocorrelation meaning that there are no clear neighboring relations in space this analysis was conducted using lctools package in r kalogirou 2020 finally correlations among the spatial autocorrelation global moran s i z score values of the response variables were computed in order to indicate the similarities in spatial dependency over time among these variables 2 5 multivariate analysis each of the 240 vines received a set of values corresponding to the spatial covariates and irrigation treatments for each season the measurement vines also received values of the meteorological and irrigation covariates i e temporal the dataset used to analyze the extent of influence that each covariate had on each response variable therefore included a total of 960 values 240 4 growing seasons for each covariate some replicated throughout the seasons the spatial covariates and some replicated in space during each growing season the temporal covariates the multivariate analysis was conducted for the entire set of data and for each growing season independently for the latter the temporal covariates were not included in the regression model 2 5 1 validation the regression model was applied using each response variable using a training set that included 60 of the data the remaining 40 were used as a test set the training model was then used to conduct a forecast of the response variable for the 40 test vines for each response variable the forecast values were compared with the measured values of the response variable using the following statistics correlation between forecast and test values t test to establish differences in mean values root mean square error rmse to evaluate the error of the forecast values compared to the measured values rmse normalized to the range rmserange of the measured test values to evaluate the rate of change in in addition the training correlation values were provided for each regression model 2 5 2 relative influence the regression model used for analyzing the relationship between the variables was a gradient boosted regression trees brt algorithm as described in ohana levi et al 2019 in brief brt is a machine learning algorithm designed to fit a non linear model of multiple variables that uses a rule based regression tree to partition the data into groups with similar values for the response variable friedman 2001 this model analyzes both continuous and categorical variables as covariates and deals with missing data and was therefore suitable for our case study the output of the model included the list of covariates each assigned with its respective contribution in percent to the modeling of the response variable the brt algorithm was implemented using the dismo package in r elith et al 2008 3 results the following results relate to the analyses conducted for the response variables and covariates in space and time 3 1 variable interactions and selection the relationships among variables are illustrated in fig 3 spring precipitation and seasonal precipitation were found to be strongly correlated r 0 83 therefore spring precipitation was removed from the analyses furthermore the response variables pruning weight and cane weight were found to be highly correlated r 0 89 and cane weight was removed from the analysis resulting in five response variables the strongest relationship among the spatial covariates was attributed to elevation and slope r 0 68 slope was found to be positively correlated to all response variables 0 16 r 0 28 while all the other terrain covariates were found to be negatively correlated to the response variables with the exception of twi and canes per vine r 0 02 precipitation spring and seasonal was found to be positively correlated to all response variables with r ranging between 0 1 and 0 59 3 2 assessment of spatial autocorrelation the spatial autocorrelation of the spatial covariates was found to be very strong with z scores ranging between 27 52 and 42 23 fig 4a the moran s i analysis for the response variables revealed a decreasing spatial dependency as the experiment progressed through time concurrently a specific temporal pattern was found for each variable fig 4b pruning weight had a strong spatial autocorrelation in the 2017 growing season which decreased during the following seasons however spatial dependency was always significant for canes per vine the z scores were only significant during the 2017 growing season and very low during 2018 and 2020 cluster weight showed a mild decrease in z scores between 2017 and 2018 3 9 and 3 65 respectively and non significant values during 2019 and 2020 yield spatial autocorrelation dropped sharply between 2017 and 2018 with z scores of 9 51 and 3 81 respectively and continued to decrease in 2019 and 2020 however the z scores were always significant clusters per vine z scores were similar in 2017 and 2018 3 3 and 3 38 respectively during 2019 and 2020 it was found to have no significant spatial dependency fig 5 illustrates the correlations among the variables in terms of spatial dependency through time the strongest similarities of spatial dynamics through time were found between canes per vine pruning weight and yield 3 3 multivariate analysis the multivariate analysis was conducted for each response variable separately to assess the model performance and the extent of space time effects of the covariates 3 3 1 validation the model performance varied among the response variables table 4 for all variables the model was found to be overfitting with training correlation values higher than test correlation values the strongest difference was found for canes per vine which also displayed the lowest test correlation however the t test showed non significant differences between measured and forecast values for all variables signifying that the means were similar moreover the rmserange values ranged between 0 11 and 0 15 indicating an overall low moderate error rates for the model 3 3 2 relative influence the multiseasonal analysis shows a unique ri ranking for each response variable fig 6 each covariate had a specific direction of influence some are shown as partial dependence plots in figures a1 and a2 supplementary materials a clusters per vine and yield per vine were mostly affected by seasonal precipitation 42 59 and 46 15 respectively with irrigation as the second contributor 10 28 and 13 13 respectively higher precipitation levels contributed to higher yield and number of clusters figure a2 while increasing influence occurred for irrigation amounts above 480 mm season 1 between the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons slope was the third contributing factor for yield while steeper slope was linked to more yield for cluster weight the strongest contributor was irrigation followed by elevation higher irrigation amounts were associated with increased clusters weight seasonal irrigation levels above 500 mm did not show additional increase in cluster weight levels canes per vine was mostly affected by the terrain variables mainly northness 19 03 and elevation 18 46 north facing slopes and higher altitudes were associated with lower numbers of canes pruning weight was strongly affected by irrigation 26 66 followed by the terrain covariates mostly elevation 16 88 higher levels of irrigation and lower altitudes resulted in more weight of pruned material figure a3 the least affecting covariates were landforms and chilling hours chilling hours was ranked fifth only for cluster weight with a lower number of hours associated with a higher weight the multivariate analysis conducted for each growing season separately reflected the temporal dynamics of the covariates ri fig 7 during 2017 there was no strong influence of irrigation on the response variables clusters per vine was highly affected by the block i e the respective locations rows of the vines within the vineyard and the terrain covariates were the main contributors to the rest of the response variables during 2018 irrigation was the most contributing covariate for all response variables besides clusters per vine which was mainly influenced by slope 20 96 and block 20 6 with irrigation ranked third 14 47 during the 2019 season there were stronger effects of the terrain covariates with elevation 25 34 block 21 37 and northness 20 81 ranked highest for cluster weight yield and clusters per vine respectively growing season 2020 was characterized by block effects ranking as the strongest contributor for canes per vine 32 99 cluster weight 27 37 and clusters per vine 25 63 the most influencing covariate for yield was slope 36 64 followed by irrigation 28 31 pruning weight was strongly affected by elevation 35 44 as it was in 2019 and 2017 4 discussion soil water availability plays a major role in grapevine productivity and vegetative growth kizildeniz et al 2015 this current study suggested an approach for analyzing the effect of spatial and temporal covariates on grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes i e response variables through time the analyses considered the entire experimental timeframe and were also conducted for each season separately to control for intra seasonal temporal effects the findings show strong effects of seasonal precipitation on most response variables during growing seasons with preceding large amounts of precipitation the irrigation treatments were a less influential factor for grapevine productivity and vegetative growth the different treatments may introduce in season differences to the measured response variables however in the long term they had a lower effect on grapevine attributes the interrelations among covariates affecting grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes were analyzed and interpreted all the selected response variables were positively correlated fig 3 signifying that pruning material and yield properties have similar trends in space and time grapevines that tend to produce more yield also tend to have heavier longer canes and lower pruning weight is known to be associated with yield decrease dobrowski et al 2003 both yield properties and pruning material are closely related to water availability bindon et al 2008 and indeed the precipitation variables were found to be positively correlated to all response variables the terrain covariates all showed negative correlations to the response variables fig 3 the morphological properties in the field affect the water retention in the soil and consequently water availability to the plants which is reflected in the amounts of yield ohana levi et al 2019 and pruning material popescu and ursu 2017 in decreasing elevation soil moisture tends to increase guo et al 2020 slope affects runoff water accumulation and soil depth thus steep slopes are likely to be characterized by lower soil saturation hawley et al 1983 however in this current study higher slopes were generally characterized by greater yield fig 3 figure a1 most likely since the flatter terrain was located upslope at the south eastern part of the vineyard fig 2a upslope areas in vineyards are known to contribute to higher portions of soil loss resulting in smaller soil depth and reduction in nutrient content ramos and mulligan 2005 unamunzaga et al 2014 northness representative of aspect is related to the amount of solar radiation therefore affecting evapotranspiration levels and indirectly influencing plant water status kutiel and lavee 1999 twi is related to grapevine water status since it represents the soil water availability resulting from precipitation bahat et al 2021 the spatial variability of the terrain covariates and grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes was quite inconsistent fig 4 implying that the relationship between terrain characteristics and grapevine features may vary in space twi had the strongest spatial dependency within the experimental plot followed by northness these two terrain properties are linked to water availability leading to the assumption that the grapevine attributes also display a strong spatial autocorrelation during the 2017 growing season the spatial autocorrelation was indeed the highest except for clusters per vine and statistically significant for all grapevine attributes the irrigation experiment was at its early stages and the plants spatial variability was still affected by field spatial characteristics and patterns the irrigation regime has already been established during the 2018 growing season and indeed the z score values indicating spatial autocorrelation dropped quite sharply for all grapevine response variables excluding clusters per vine this temporal trend continued for the 2019 season and was similar among yield canes per vine and pruning weight fig 6 however this general decrease in z scores did not progress during the 2020 growing season for pruning weight canes per vine and cluster weight the values increased while yield and clusters per vine experienced a minor decrease in z scores this shift in direction and magnitude of spatial autocorrelation in time may be attributed to precipitation levels in 2020 which were exceptionally high 555 5 mm for the entire season and 149 5 mm during spring table 2 the spatial variability of soil moisture tends to decrease i e higher spatial autocorrelation when water availability is higher and water stress in the plant is lower e g after winter precipitation in a mediterranean climate davenport et al 2008 overall irrigation amounts were also higher during 2020 due to gradual development of leaf area during the experiment this escalation in canopy cover means that on average leaf area was found to increase from season to season table b1 supplementary materials b a process which initiated higher levels of grapevine evapotranspiration causing more water stress munitz et al 2018 found that high water availability leads to wider vessels and increased specific hydraulic conductivity in vines the anatomical memory of the xylem system may result in inter seasonal differences in the vine water demand and response to irrigation while the increased spatial variability within the vineyard during 2018 and 2019 was attributed to irrigation allocation according to treatments the growing spatial dependency during 2020 may have been the outcome of increase in water availability high amounts of precipitation and irrigation that introduced a masking effect over the differential irrigation in the vineyard these findings correspond with the results documented by trigo córdoba et al 2015 who claimed that rainfall events intermediate irrigation effects on yield and interfere with the development of water stress the quality assessment of the brt model showed medium high results for the metrics of the different response variables table 4 with no significant difference between the forecast and measured values of the test set furthermore the rmserange values for the test set were not higher than 0 15 the worst performance was attributed to canes per vine with the highest overfitting and the results for this variable should be treated with the respective uncertainty it is worth noting that canes per vine is highly determined by direct interference due to the agrotechnical procedure of pruning and is therefore influenced by additional factors other than terrain and meteorology however the brt models in this work were not designed for forecasting purposes but only for inferential analysis over the dataset in order to derive the ri of the covariates tittonell et al 2008 ohana levi et al 2018 2019 bahat et al 2021 the results of the brt model applied to the 2017 2020 dataset showed unique ri of the covariates for each response variable fig 6 clusters per vine and yield were both strongly dependent on seasonal precipitation while irrigation was ranked second these findings correspond to the work of camps and ramos 2012 who found strong association between precipitation and yield and reported a reduction of 20 30 kg ha per millimeter of water deficit increase yield was also found to be highly affected by precipitation amounts by dittrich et al 2021 mendez costabel et al 2014 found that grapevines that received larger amounts of winter precipitation maintained a lower soil matric potential during the rest of the season resulting in more yield greater berry growth and more clusters per vine their study also specified similar trends for pruning mass which was significantly higher for highly rainfed grapevines similarly our findings also found positive relations between pruning weight and irrigation irrigation is known to have positive effects on pruning weight for multiple grapevine cultivars for example padgett johnson et al 2003 found that non irrigated grapevines consistently showed lower weights of pruning material than irrigated grapevines the analysis for each growing season revealed a changing pattern of ri in time fig 7 during the first year of the experiment 2017 the response variables were mostly influenced by the terrain covariates specifically slope pruning weight canes per vine and yield and elevation cluster weight as well as blocks clusters per vine fig 7a this means that water availability was mainly affected by the water distribution patterns in the vineyard during this season and to a lesser extent by the differential irrigation applied to the vineyard during the first growing season of an irrigation experiment the vineyard is not fully adapted to the differential treatments and irrigation has a lower spatial effect on the different grapevine attributes this claim is also supported by fig 4 showing strong spatial autocorrelation during the first experimental season recent studies have also demonstrated this concept munitz et al 2020 showed that differences in trunk width dynamics of grapevines from various irrigation treatments through time measured using field dendrometers developed gradually having a more pronounced effect during the last season of the field experiment santesteban et al 2011a 2011b reported no significant differences in number of clusters per vine among different irrigation treatments during the first year of experiment as opposed to the following growing seasons the carry on effect of water availability on grapevine reproductive attributes was also presented in petrie et al 2004 they showed that the growing season following water deficit treatments was characterized by reduced shoot number and pruning weight as well as the number of clusters and yield the progression of the experiment was characterized by a shift of ri ranking in the 2018 growing season fig 7b irrigation was ranked as the strongest contributor for all response variables aside from clusters per vine the water regime imposed on the experimental site had a substantial effect on the grapevine vegetative and reproductive properties however during growing seasons that were characterized by higher than average precipitation i e 2019 2020 the ri ranking patterns shifted back to covariates that are related to terrain initiated water distribution in 2019 the response variables were affected by elevation block twi and northness and in 2020 where seasonal precipitation was highest 555 5 mm block was the strongest contributor for canes per vine cluster weight and clusters per vine and elevation and slope had major effects on pruning weight and yield per vine highlighting once more the masking effect of excess water availability over the differential irrigation in the vineyard block effects represent the integrative effect of the terrain and water distributed in the vineyard through irrigation it is known to be influenced by the terrain soil type and texture and the partitioning of experimental vines into blocks was reported to affect berry mass triolo et al 2018 landforms was found to be a weak contributor to all response variables during the entire experimental period and is probably not an optimal covariate for modeling small areas unraveling the ranked effects of specific vineyard characteristics on the grapevine performance may assist in decision making for field management and irrigation practices water accumulated in the soil during the rainy season may have a substantial effect on the productivity of the grapevines and the spatial autocorrelation of their vegetative and reproductive attributes future research should explore the effects of irrigation applied to the vineyard prior to budbreak on vines performance and productivity further knowledge on the vineyard attributes and their interrelations with irrigation regimes introduces new opportunities for smart irrigation planning to increase wine grapes revenue van leeuwen et al 2019 5 conclusions water availability in vineyards is dynamic in space and time this current study explored the spatial changes between growing seasons in a four year experiment in a mediterranean climate the findings show strong evidence that vineyard is affected by the local terrain and the water availability is subjected to the spatial patterns of elevation slope and aspect differential irrigation has pronounced effects when precipitation levels are low however when the growing season follows a winter with high precipitation amounts the irrigation effects are minimized compared to the general trend among seasons and grapevine attributes are spatially determined by the natural terrain induced water distribution rather than artificial water supply however within each growing season irrigation amounts were shown to affect the grapevines vegetative and reproductive attributes knowledge regarding the space time trends of water availability effects in vineyards may assist in smart irrigation practices addressing the inherent characteristics of the field when planning irrigation management is useful for achieving higher yield and grapevine performance furthermore the suggested framework is useful for assessing within field interrelations and beneficial for forecasting purposes both in space and time the framework may be applied to other environments including vineyards or orchards for extracting knowledge regarding trends and environmental effects in space and time the findings from this study may serve as input to a forecasting model based on winter precipitation irrigation plans and the terrain covariates to generate yield estimations more importantly such knowledge is practical for planning water supplies

9808,water availability in vineyards varies in space and time the spatiotemporal variability of water availability to vines is affected by terrain meteorology and irrigation this study aimed to analyze the response of vegetative and reproductive attributes of vines to spatiotemporal variability in water availability we quantified the spatial autocorrelation of terrain covariates and grapevine attributes and determined the relative influence ri of the covariates on these attributes in each of four growing seasons 2017 2020 in a vitis vinifera cv sauvignon blanc vineyard five vegetative and reproductive attributes were collected for 240 vines terrain covariates included elevation slope aspect topographic wetness index and categorical landforms and meteorological covariates consisted of annual rainfall and chilling hours a moran s i statistic was computed for each spatial covariate and each grapevine attribute during each season to define temporal changes in spatial variability a multivariate analysis using gradient boosted regression trees algorithm was applied to extract the ri of the covariates the results showed high spatial autocorrelation of the terrain covariates and a strong negative shift in spatial dependency of the grapevine attributes throughout the experiment yield and number of clusters per vine were highly affected by seasonal precipitation ri of 46 15 and 42 59 while changes in inter seasonal cluster weight and pruning weight were highly subjected to irrigation amounts ri of 23 and 26 66 with complementary terrain influences the number of canes per vine was mainly affected by terrain characteristics long term changes in grapevine attributes depended on meteorological shifts while higher precipitation amounts were associated with weaker responses of vines to irrigation strategies the spatial patterns of terrain affected water distribution in the vineyard and controlled the spatial dynamics of grapevine attributes knowledge regarding the space time trends of water availability effects on grapevine attributes may assist decision making of irrigation practices in vineyards keywords water availability terrain spatial autocorrelation vineyard irrigation management spatiotemporal analysis 1 introduction soil water availability is a major factor in grapevine growth and productivity medrano et al 2003 water distribution in vineyards often varies in space and time acevedo opazo et al 2008 depending on various factors spatial variability of water availability in the field may be governed by the spatial patterns of terrain attributes such as elevation slope and aspect ohana levi et al 2019 willwerth and reynolds 2020 while seasonal temporal dynamics in vineyard water regime depend mainly on meteorological conditions such as precipitation amounts wilson et al 2020 and temperature levels de rességuier et al 2020 as well as the irrigation provided to the grapevines ohana levi et al 2020a alongside other agrotechnical practices the spatial distribution of water availability is affected by multiple factors and impacts the spatial variability of the grapevines vegetative and reproductive attributes soil moisture varies from dry conditions in upper slopes to wet conditions in lower slopes where upslope hydrological process affect downslope water availability brolsma and bierkens 2007 this process was found to affect the spatial patterns of vegetation performance which rely on the distribution of soil water availability across the field in an experiment in an aglianico vineyard in southern italy basile et al 2020 found differences in physiological and vegetative responses of grapevines to slope gradient for example downslope vines had lower water stress than upslope vines similarly santesteban et al 2011a found differences in grapevine water stress in different slope aspects in a tempranillo vineyard in southern navarre spain however flat terrain seems to be less favorable to grapevine performance and irimia and patriche 2013 reported the optimal slope range to be 5 15 i e 2 85 8 5 similar slope ranges were reported in a study conducted in illinois by kaan kurtural et al 2008 ohana levi et al 2020a conducted a time series analysis of daily images of evapotranspiration et derived from remote sensing retrievals during four growing seasons in a pinot noir vineyard in california they found that soil type and elevation were the main contributors to et spatial variability furthermore topographic wetness index twi a calculation of the ratio between the absolute area and slope was found to be associated with soil moisture in a sangiovese vineyard central italy costantini et al 2009 and with water stress and canopy cover in a cabernet sauvignon vineyard in israel bahat et al 2021 the response of grapevine attributes to water availability is commonly spatially dependent and relies on the interrelations among multiple factors such as soil characteristics terrain and irrigation management these relationships among field properties are inconsistent and depend on natural and controllable factors such as the climatic region vine variety and rootstock smith and whigham 1999 the temporal distribution of water availability is affected by meteorological attributes such as precipitation and temperature and controllable attributes such as irrigation amounts precipitation has immediate influence on soil moisture while deeper soils are more affected by low intensity rainfall events dry conditions lead to sharp decrease in soil moisture with low spatial variability occurrences of long dry periods are known to have harmful effects on yield in terms of quantity and quality ramos and mulligan 2005 ramos and martínez casasnovas 2006 in an experiment in a california vineyard wilson et al 2020 found that the main component affecting water availability early in the season was precipitation during the wet season which had an impact on leaf area development furthermore larger amounts of seasonal precipitation leading to more stored water in the soil were related to an extended period of canopy growth they also showed that deficit in soil moisture was higher and dynamic during april and may when canopy develops and then stabilized at constant levels of water lost from the soil temporal effects in the seasonal scale may also be attributed to other factors such as chilling hours a chilling requirement must be fulfilled for buds to synchronously burst and is believed to be between 0 and 7 2 c while grapevines typically require between 50 and 400 chilling hours during winter to satisfy endodormancy insufficient chilling can lead to delayed and desynchronized budding and slowing of crop development londo and johnson 2014 fraga et al 2019 soil water content is also known to affect budbreak and further occurrence of phenological stages ramos and martínez casasnovas 2006 van leeuwen et al 2009 therefore modeling the interactions of temporally varying components is required to fully understand between season dynamics of grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes space time distribution of grapevine growth and yield components can be managed during the growing season by irrigation bellvert et al 2020 irrigation practices are intended to control the water stress of the grapevines through management of soil water availability and consequently the vegetative growth physiological conditions yield components and wine quality santesteban et al 2011b munitz et al 2016 however irrigation management is highly dependent on the amount timing and intensity of precipitation wilson et al 2020 reported that changes in irrigation amounts have an immediate effect on leaf area growth and that lower levels of soil moisture due to lower amounts of precipitation are more likely to generate a stronger response of the plant to the irrigation regime nolz et al 2016 showed the interactive effects of precipitation and irrigation levels on soil water content according to precipitation amounts soil depth and dryness of the soil prior to infiltration of precipitation irrigation water various studies illustrated the effects of the spatial factors in the field on vegetative physiological and reproductive attributes acevedo opazo et al 2008 ohana levi et al 2019 yu et al 2021 many works were conducted to quantify the impact of precipitation amounts timing and intensity on water availability in vineyards and consequently on grapevine performance ramos and martínez casasnovas 2009 camps and ramos 2012 ramos 2017 agam et al 2019 however to the best of our knowledge no studies focused on grapevine response to multivariate effects of spatial field attributes and temporal meteorological and controlled factors the innovation of this present research stems from two main notions the first focuses on generating an approach for applying an integrative space time analysis of the response of grapevine attributes to spatially and temporally varying field properties the second notion is to provide an overview on the interactions of factors affecting water availability including direct water sources such as precipitation and irrigation and indirect contributors such as terrain properties that affect water distribution in the field the suggested approach was established using a multivariate dataset collected during four years from a sauvignon blanc vineyard enabling a long term perception of processes and dynamics over space the main objective was to model the response of grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes to water availability in space and time the specific objectives were to 1 define measure and select the spatial and temporal variables to include in the model 2 quantify the spatial autocorrelation of the spatial variables and grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes and 3 determine the relative influence ri of the different covariates on grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes 2 methods 2 1 study site and experimental design the experiment took place between january 2017 and august 2020 in a vineyard located in the gilboa mountain region near kibbutz merav 32 44 n 35 42 e fig 1 vitis vinifera cv sauvignon blanc vines grafted onto 1103 paulsen rootstock were planted in a commercial vineyard during 2009 with vine spacing of 1 5 m along the rows and 3 m between rows the vineyard is located 430 m above sea level on heavy clay soil with limestone bedrock the region is characterized by mediterranean climate with warm dry summers and winter precipitation events ordinarily between october and may with a mean annual amount of 450 mm the experimental plot with an area of 4600 m2 was a part of a commercial vineyard the plot was characterized by a moderately dynamic elevation gradient and included 960 vines that were mainly faced north and north east the irrigation system included five treatments arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replicates the experimental layout consisted of five irrigation treatments each replicated four times fig 1 van es et al 2007 where each block included three rows one for data collection and two border rows treatments comprised of 16 vines per plot with the outer two vines from each side being buffer vines and the inner 12 vines being measurement vines a total of 240 measurement vines i e 12 vines 4 replicates 5 treatment fig 1b a drip irrigation system with one line per row and in line pressure compensated 2 4 l h 1 uniram drippers was employed with 0 5 m spacing between drippers netafim ltd hatzerim israel an irrigation control unit talgil computing control ltd haifa israel was used to separately irrigate each of the five irrigation treatments 2 2 data collection the data used in this study was based on three types of datasets first the inherent characteristics of the vineyard that were temporally constant and spatially variable second the meteorological conditions that varied through time and third the irrigation treatments and grapevine measurements the dataset consisted of covariates the explanatory variables and the response variables that included grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes table 1 provides descriptive statistics of the dataset including range of values mean standard deviation sd and coefficient of variation cv 2 2 1 spatial attributes vineyard characteristics spatial representation of the vineyard characteristics was achieved using terrain properties that are easy to acquire various topographic variables may be calculated from a digital elevation model dem amatulli et al 2018 illustrating the different terrain properties and patterns within the field in this study five terrain variables were used fig 2 to assess the effect of spatially dynamic attributes on grapevine attributes elevation a dem measured in meters was derived from a local elevation survey conducted across the vineyard with a spatial resolution of 1 m fig 2a elevation and its spatial variability is known to affect grapevine water demands in vineyards ohana levi et al 2020a in the merav experimental plot the variance in elevation values was very small table 1 slope extracted from the dem fig 2b and indicates the maximum rate of elevation change between one cell to its immediate neighbors the values are given in degrees while lower values correspond to flatter terrain ohana levi et al 2021 slope has been established as one of the most influencing factors on soil moisture thereby affecting water availability to the plants and water stress becker et al 1988 jasse et al 2021 slope was calculated using the raster package in r hijmans 2020 the slope values in the experimental site had the highest variance among the spatially dynamic variables with a cv of 0 12 table 1 northness represents the relative terrain aspect to the north fig 2c it is calculated by applying a cosine transformation to the celestial aspect computed from dem aspect was calculated as the gradient vector at each pixel location with respect to its neighbors such that north is defined as 0 and was computed using the r package raster hijmans 2020 it was then transformed to northness aspect is known to contribute to the vineyard s water demands and its spatial variability thereby affecting the grapevines conditions ohana levi et al 2020a in the experimental site this measure was characterized by a small range and low variance table 1 topographic wetness index twi provides a relative measure of static soil moisture conditions for each pixel in a defined area fig 2d this index quantifies the distribution of accumulated area across downslope pixels beven and kirkby 1979 and is calculated as 1 twi ln a tanβ where a is the upstream contributing area m2 for each pixel and β is the local slope in degrees and was calculated using dynatopmodel package in r metcalfe et al 2018 twi is known to have a strong effect on water stress in vineyards and its spatial patterns were shown to be strongly related to various physiological and yield attributes bahat et al 2021 twi values in the experimental site had a small variance table 1 landforms a categorical variable designed to partition the region into landform classes according to morphometry or identification of geomorphons geomorphologic phenotypes amatulli et al 2018 the elements composing the landforms are valley lower slope flat area middle slope upper slope and ridge these elements were derived using the topographic position index tpi which denotes the difference between the value of a pixel and the mean value of its surrounding neighbors weiss 2001 amatulli et al 2018 tpi is then partitioned into categories according to its values alhusban 2018 in this case sd values such that sd values lower than 1 were classified as valley sd between 1 and 0 5 were classified as lower slope 0 5 and 0 were defined as flat area sd between 0 and 0 5 were middle slope values between 0 5 and 1 were categorized as upper slope and ridge included values above 1 sd 2 2 2 temporal attributes meteorology the study was conducted over a period of four growing seasons each characterized by different meteorological conditions therefore three temporally varying variables table 1 were considered for modeling the temporal effects on grapevine physiology these variables were measured using a meteorological station located 4 5 km north of the experimental plot 32 48 n 35 41 e using a precipitation sensor 15188 lambrecht meteo gmbh gottingen germany seasonal precipitation the accumulated precipitation mm measured at the meteorological station during the winter and spring preceding each growing season table 2 during the experimental period the multiseasonal range was 250 8 555 5 mm table 1 spring precipitation the accumulated precipitation mm during the spring preceding each growing season calculated from march to august table 2 the range of values during the experimental period was very wide 24 4 149 5 mm table 1 with a very high cv 0 63 total chilling hours denote the number of cool hours during each winter preceding the growing seasons it is calculated using the following scoring system average hourly temperature below 7 c equals 1 chilling hour average hourly temperature between 7 c and 10 c equals 0 5 chilling hour average hourly temperature between 10 c and 18 c equals 0 chilling hour average hourly temperature above 18 c equals 1 chilling hour the daily chilling hours are then summed while negative chilling hours are counted as 0 daily chilling hours were accumulated between november and april and provided as total seasonal chilling hours table 2 during the experimental period the values ranged between 217 and 773 5 chilling hours table 1 2 2 3 spatiotemporal attributes irrigation treatments and vine measurements irrigation treatments the treatments included five different irrigation regimes table 3 applied twice a week similar to the local agricultural practices in the commercial vineyard the five treatments were irrigated using different irrigation coefficients based on a regression model developed specifically for wine grapes taking into account the relationship between leaf area index and crop coefficient kc munitz et al 2019 irrigation amounts were calculated as a proportion of crop evapotranspiration etc etc was calculated according to the equation etc eto kc where eto is the reference evapotranspiration calculated according to the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 using data obtained from a local meteorological station munitz et al 2020 treatment a was provided with 30 of estimated etc treatment b with 45 of estimated etc treatment c with 60 of etc estimation treatments d and e were provided with regulated deficit irrigation such that irrigation coefficients were dynamic throughout the season with treatment d provided with 30 of etc during phenological growth stages 1 and 2 and 60 during stage 3 and treatment e provided with 60 of etc during stage 1 and 30 during stages 2 and 3 the dataset used in this study related to the total amount of irrigation mm provided throughout each growing season harvest in 2017 took place during august 6 17 in 2018 between august 1 and 4 in 2019 between august 14 and 17 and in 2020 during august 23 26 a global positioning system gps of the measurement vines was used to ensure their appropriate distribution with respect to the spatial field covariates and measured using a trimble r2 receiver trimble navigation ltd sunnyvale ca usa the following attributes were measured for the 240 measurement vines during the research period clusters per vine the number of clusters were determined for each vine during harvest during the experimental period the range was 23 152 clusters per vine with sd of 18 5 table 1 yield per vine the yield was weighed for each vine kg during harvest this measure is quite variable with a cv of 0 31 table 1 cluster weight an average value kg calculated according to yield weight and number of clusters per vine ranges between 0 04 and 0 27 kg table 1 canes per vine the number of pruned canes were counted after winter pruning this variable was not measured prior to the 2019 growing season due to technical difficulties varies between 15 and 50 canes table 1 pruning weight to assess vegetative development pruned material fresh weight were weighed for each vine kg during winter pruning this variable was not measured prior to the 2019 growing season due to technical difficulties the most varying measure among the response variables with cv of 0 39 table 1 cane weight the average cane weight kg was calculated according to pruning weight and the number of canes per vine this variable was not measured prior to the 2019 growing season due to technical difficulties shifts between 0 01 and 0 09 kg table 1 throughout the experimental period 2 3 variable interactions and selection to assess the degree of correlation among variables a correlation matrix was produced for the entire set of continuous variables correlations between spatial and temporal variables were eliminated variables that showed a strong relationship were excluded from the analysis to avoid redundancy of information and multicollinearity 2 4 assessment of spatial autocorrelation experiments conducted within agricultural fields are subjected to influences of spatially dynamic factors each with a unique spatial distribution pattern across the field usowicz and lipiec 2017 the extent of spatial autocorrelation was computed for the spatially varying continuous variables defined in table 1 as spatial or spatiotemporal including the covariates that characterized the field i e terrain variables and the affected variables i e response table 1 for the latter the analysis was conducted using the data of each growing season to examine the multiseasonal spatial dynamics spatial autocorrelation was assessed using the global moran s i test moran 1948 the outcome values were transformed to z scores that enable evaluating the strength direction and significance α 0 05 of the spatial dependency for each variable where 1 96 z 1 96 denotes a non significant spatial autocorrelation meaning that there are no clear neighboring relations in space this analysis was conducted using lctools package in r kalogirou 2020 finally correlations among the spatial autocorrelation global moran s i z score values of the response variables were computed in order to indicate the similarities in spatial dependency over time among these variables 2 5 multivariate analysis each of the 240 vines received a set of values corresponding to the spatial covariates and irrigation treatments for each season the measurement vines also received values of the meteorological and irrigation covariates i e temporal the dataset used to analyze the extent of influence that each covariate had on each response variable therefore included a total of 960 values 240 4 growing seasons for each covariate some replicated throughout the seasons the spatial covariates and some replicated in space during each growing season the temporal covariates the multivariate analysis was conducted for the entire set of data and for each growing season independently for the latter the temporal covariates were not included in the regression model 2 5 1 validation the regression model was applied using each response variable using a training set that included 60 of the data the remaining 40 were used as a test set the training model was then used to conduct a forecast of the response variable for the 40 test vines for each response variable the forecast values were compared with the measured values of the response variable using the following statistics correlation between forecast and test values t test to establish differences in mean values root mean square error rmse to evaluate the error of the forecast values compared to the measured values rmse normalized to the range rmserange of the measured test values to evaluate the rate of change in in addition the training correlation values were provided for each regression model 2 5 2 relative influence the regression model used for analyzing the relationship between the variables was a gradient boosted regression trees brt algorithm as described in ohana levi et al 2019 in brief brt is a machine learning algorithm designed to fit a non linear model of multiple variables that uses a rule based regression tree to partition the data into groups with similar values for the response variable friedman 2001 this model analyzes both continuous and categorical variables as covariates and deals with missing data and was therefore suitable for our case study the output of the model included the list of covariates each assigned with its respective contribution in percent to the modeling of the response variable the brt algorithm was implemented using the dismo package in r elith et al 2008 3 results the following results relate to the analyses conducted for the response variables and covariates in space and time 3 1 variable interactions and selection the relationships among variables are illustrated in fig 3 spring precipitation and seasonal precipitation were found to be strongly correlated r 0 83 therefore spring precipitation was removed from the analyses furthermore the response variables pruning weight and cane weight were found to be highly correlated r 0 89 and cane weight was removed from the analysis resulting in five response variables the strongest relationship among the spatial covariates was attributed to elevation and slope r 0 68 slope was found to be positively correlated to all response variables 0 16 r 0 28 while all the other terrain covariates were found to be negatively correlated to the response variables with the exception of twi and canes per vine r 0 02 precipitation spring and seasonal was found to be positively correlated to all response variables with r ranging between 0 1 and 0 59 3 2 assessment of spatial autocorrelation the spatial autocorrelation of the spatial covariates was found to be very strong with z scores ranging between 27 52 and 42 23 fig 4a the moran s i analysis for the response variables revealed a decreasing spatial dependency as the experiment progressed through time concurrently a specific temporal pattern was found for each variable fig 4b pruning weight had a strong spatial autocorrelation in the 2017 growing season which decreased during the following seasons however spatial dependency was always significant for canes per vine the z scores were only significant during the 2017 growing season and very low during 2018 and 2020 cluster weight showed a mild decrease in z scores between 2017 and 2018 3 9 and 3 65 respectively and non significant values during 2019 and 2020 yield spatial autocorrelation dropped sharply between 2017 and 2018 with z scores of 9 51 and 3 81 respectively and continued to decrease in 2019 and 2020 however the z scores were always significant clusters per vine z scores were similar in 2017 and 2018 3 3 and 3 38 respectively during 2019 and 2020 it was found to have no significant spatial dependency fig 5 illustrates the correlations among the variables in terms of spatial dependency through time the strongest similarities of spatial dynamics through time were found between canes per vine pruning weight and yield 3 3 multivariate analysis the multivariate analysis was conducted for each response variable separately to assess the model performance and the extent of space time effects of the covariates 3 3 1 validation the model performance varied among the response variables table 4 for all variables the model was found to be overfitting with training correlation values higher than test correlation values the strongest difference was found for canes per vine which also displayed the lowest test correlation however the t test showed non significant differences between measured and forecast values for all variables signifying that the means were similar moreover the rmserange values ranged between 0 11 and 0 15 indicating an overall low moderate error rates for the model 3 3 2 relative influence the multiseasonal analysis shows a unique ri ranking for each response variable fig 6 each covariate had a specific direction of influence some are shown as partial dependence plots in figures a1 and a2 supplementary materials a clusters per vine and yield per vine were mostly affected by seasonal precipitation 42 59 and 46 15 respectively with irrigation as the second contributor 10 28 and 13 13 respectively higher precipitation levels contributed to higher yield and number of clusters figure a2 while increasing influence occurred for irrigation amounts above 480 mm season 1 between the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons slope was the third contributing factor for yield while steeper slope was linked to more yield for cluster weight the strongest contributor was irrigation followed by elevation higher irrigation amounts were associated with increased clusters weight seasonal irrigation levels above 500 mm did not show additional increase in cluster weight levels canes per vine was mostly affected by the terrain variables mainly northness 19 03 and elevation 18 46 north facing slopes and higher altitudes were associated with lower numbers of canes pruning weight was strongly affected by irrigation 26 66 followed by the terrain covariates mostly elevation 16 88 higher levels of irrigation and lower altitudes resulted in more weight of pruned material figure a3 the least affecting covariates were landforms and chilling hours chilling hours was ranked fifth only for cluster weight with a lower number of hours associated with a higher weight the multivariate analysis conducted for each growing season separately reflected the temporal dynamics of the covariates ri fig 7 during 2017 there was no strong influence of irrigation on the response variables clusters per vine was highly affected by the block i e the respective locations rows of the vines within the vineyard and the terrain covariates were the main contributors to the rest of the response variables during 2018 irrigation was the most contributing covariate for all response variables besides clusters per vine which was mainly influenced by slope 20 96 and block 20 6 with irrigation ranked third 14 47 during the 2019 season there were stronger effects of the terrain covariates with elevation 25 34 block 21 37 and northness 20 81 ranked highest for cluster weight yield and clusters per vine respectively growing season 2020 was characterized by block effects ranking as the strongest contributor for canes per vine 32 99 cluster weight 27 37 and clusters per vine 25 63 the most influencing covariate for yield was slope 36 64 followed by irrigation 28 31 pruning weight was strongly affected by elevation 35 44 as it was in 2019 and 2017 4 discussion soil water availability plays a major role in grapevine productivity and vegetative growth kizildeniz et al 2015 this current study suggested an approach for analyzing the effect of spatial and temporal covariates on grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes i e response variables through time the analyses considered the entire experimental timeframe and were also conducted for each season separately to control for intra seasonal temporal effects the findings show strong effects of seasonal precipitation on most response variables during growing seasons with preceding large amounts of precipitation the irrigation treatments were a less influential factor for grapevine productivity and vegetative growth the different treatments may introduce in season differences to the measured response variables however in the long term they had a lower effect on grapevine attributes the interrelations among covariates affecting grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes were analyzed and interpreted all the selected response variables were positively correlated fig 3 signifying that pruning material and yield properties have similar trends in space and time grapevines that tend to produce more yield also tend to have heavier longer canes and lower pruning weight is known to be associated with yield decrease dobrowski et al 2003 both yield properties and pruning material are closely related to water availability bindon et al 2008 and indeed the precipitation variables were found to be positively correlated to all response variables the terrain covariates all showed negative correlations to the response variables fig 3 the morphological properties in the field affect the water retention in the soil and consequently water availability to the plants which is reflected in the amounts of yield ohana levi et al 2019 and pruning material popescu and ursu 2017 in decreasing elevation soil moisture tends to increase guo et al 2020 slope affects runoff water accumulation and soil depth thus steep slopes are likely to be characterized by lower soil saturation hawley et al 1983 however in this current study higher slopes were generally characterized by greater yield fig 3 figure a1 most likely since the flatter terrain was located upslope at the south eastern part of the vineyard fig 2a upslope areas in vineyards are known to contribute to higher portions of soil loss resulting in smaller soil depth and reduction in nutrient content ramos and mulligan 2005 unamunzaga et al 2014 northness representative of aspect is related to the amount of solar radiation therefore affecting evapotranspiration levels and indirectly influencing plant water status kutiel and lavee 1999 twi is related to grapevine water status since it represents the soil water availability resulting from precipitation bahat et al 2021 the spatial variability of the terrain covariates and grapevine vegetative and reproductive attributes was quite inconsistent fig 4 implying that the relationship between terrain characteristics and grapevine features may vary in space twi had the strongest spatial dependency within the experimental plot followed by northness these two terrain properties are linked to water availability leading to the assumption that the grapevine attributes also display a strong spatial autocorrelation during the 2017 growing season the spatial autocorrelation was indeed the highest except for clusters per vine and statistically significant for all grapevine attributes the irrigation experiment was at its early stages and the plants spatial variability was still affected by field spatial characteristics and patterns the irrigation regime has already been established during the 2018 growing season and indeed the z score values indicating spatial autocorrelation dropped quite sharply for all grapevine response variables excluding clusters per vine this temporal trend continued for the 2019 season and was similar among yield canes per vine and pruning weight fig 6 however this general decrease in z scores did not progress during the 2020 growing season for pruning weight canes per vine and cluster weight the values increased while yield and clusters per vine experienced a minor decrease in z scores this shift in direction and magnitude of spatial autocorrelation in time may be attributed to precipitation levels in 2020 which were exceptionally high 555 5 mm for the entire season and 149 5 mm during spring table 2 the spatial variability of soil moisture tends to decrease i e higher spatial autocorrelation when water availability is higher and water stress in the plant is lower e g after winter precipitation in a mediterranean climate davenport et al 2008 overall irrigation amounts were also higher during 2020 due to gradual development of leaf area during the experiment this escalation in canopy cover means that on average leaf area was found to increase from season to season table b1 supplementary materials b a process which initiated higher levels of grapevine evapotranspiration causing more water stress munitz et al 2018 found that high water availability leads to wider vessels and increased specific hydraulic conductivity in vines the anatomical memory of the xylem system may result in inter seasonal differences in the vine water demand and response to irrigation while the increased spatial variability within the vineyard during 2018 and 2019 was attributed to irrigation allocation according to treatments the growing spatial dependency during 2020 may have been the outcome of increase in water availability high amounts of precipitation and irrigation that introduced a masking effect over the differential irrigation in the vineyard these findings correspond with the results documented by trigo córdoba et al 2015 who claimed that rainfall events intermediate irrigation effects on yield and interfere with the development of water stress the quality assessment of the brt model showed medium high results for the metrics of the different response variables table 4 with no significant difference between the forecast and measured values of the test set furthermore the rmserange values for the test set were not higher than 0 15 the worst performance was attributed to canes per vine with the highest overfitting and the results for this variable should be treated with the respective uncertainty it is worth noting that canes per vine is highly determined by direct interference due to the agrotechnical procedure of pruning and is therefore influenced by additional factors other than terrain and meteorology however the brt models in this work were not designed for forecasting purposes but only for inferential analysis over the dataset in order to derive the ri of the covariates tittonell et al 2008 ohana levi et al 2018 2019 bahat et al 2021 the results of the brt model applied to the 2017 2020 dataset showed unique ri of the covariates for each response variable fig 6 clusters per vine and yield were both strongly dependent on seasonal precipitation while irrigation was ranked second these findings correspond to the work of camps and ramos 2012 who found strong association between precipitation and yield and reported a reduction of 20 30 kg ha per millimeter of water deficit increase yield was also found to be highly affected by precipitation amounts by dittrich et al 2021 mendez costabel et al 2014 found that grapevines that received larger amounts of winter precipitation maintained a lower soil matric potential during the rest of the season resulting in more yield greater berry growth and more clusters per vine their study also specified similar trends for pruning mass which was significantly higher for highly rainfed grapevines similarly our findings also found positive relations between pruning weight and irrigation irrigation is known to have positive effects on pruning weight for multiple grapevine cultivars for example padgett johnson et al 2003 found that non irrigated grapevines consistently showed lower weights of pruning material than irrigated grapevines the analysis for each growing season revealed a changing pattern of ri in time fig 7 during the first year of the experiment 2017 the response variables were mostly influenced by the terrain covariates specifically slope pruning weight canes per vine and yield and elevation cluster weight as well as blocks clusters per vine fig 7a this means that water availability was mainly affected by the water distribution patterns in the vineyard during this season and to a lesser extent by the differential irrigation applied to the vineyard during the first growing season of an irrigation experiment the vineyard is not fully adapted to the differential treatments and irrigation has a lower spatial effect on the different grapevine attributes this claim is also supported by fig 4 showing strong spatial autocorrelation during the first experimental season recent studies have also demonstrated this concept munitz et al 2020 showed that differences in trunk width dynamics of grapevines from various irrigation treatments through time measured using field dendrometers developed gradually having a more pronounced effect during the last season of the field experiment santesteban et al 2011a 2011b reported no significant differences in number of clusters per vine among different irrigation treatments during the first year of experiment as opposed to the following growing seasons the carry on effect of water availability on grapevine reproductive attributes was also presented in petrie et al 2004 they showed that the growing season following water deficit treatments was characterized by reduced shoot number and pruning weight as well as the number of clusters and yield the progression of the experiment was characterized by a shift of ri ranking in the 2018 growing season fig 7b irrigation was ranked as the strongest contributor for all response variables aside from clusters per vine the water regime imposed on the experimental site had a substantial effect on the grapevine vegetative and reproductive properties however during growing seasons that were characterized by higher than average precipitation i e 2019 2020 the ri ranking patterns shifted back to covariates that are related to terrain initiated water distribution in 2019 the response variables were affected by elevation block twi and northness and in 2020 where seasonal precipitation was highest 555 5 mm block was the strongest contributor for canes per vine cluster weight and clusters per vine and elevation and slope had major effects on pruning weight and yield per vine highlighting once more the masking effect of excess water availability over the differential irrigation in the vineyard block effects represent the integrative effect of the terrain and water distributed in the vineyard through irrigation it is known to be influenced by the terrain soil type and texture and the partitioning of experimental vines into blocks was reported to affect berry mass triolo et al 2018 landforms was found to be a weak contributor to all response variables during the entire experimental period and is probably not an optimal covariate for modeling small areas unraveling the ranked effects of specific vineyard characteristics on the grapevine performance may assist in decision making for field management and irrigation practices water accumulated in the soil during the rainy season may have a substantial effect on the productivity of the grapevines and the spatial autocorrelation of their vegetative and reproductive attributes future research should explore the effects of irrigation applied to the vineyard prior to budbreak on vines performance and productivity further knowledge on the vineyard attributes and their interrelations with irrigation regimes introduces new opportunities for smart irrigation planning to increase wine grapes revenue van leeuwen et al 2019 5 conclusions water availability in vineyards is dynamic in space and time this current study explored the spatial changes between growing seasons in a four year experiment in a mediterranean climate the findings show strong evidence that vineyard is affected by the local terrain and the water availability is subjected to the spatial patterns of elevation slope and aspect differential irrigation has pronounced effects when precipitation levels are low however when the growing season follows a winter with high precipitation amounts the irrigation effects are minimized compared to the general trend among seasons and grapevine attributes are spatially determined by the natural terrain induced water distribution rather than artificial water supply however within each growing season irrigation amounts were shown to affect the grapevines vegetative and reproductive attributes knowledge regarding the space time trends of water availability effects in vineyards may assist in smart irrigation practices addressing the inherent characteristics of the field when planning irrigation management is useful for achieving higher yield and grapevine performance furthermore the suggested framework is useful for assessing within field interrelations and beneficial for forecasting purposes both in space and time the framework may be applied to other environments including vineyards or orchards for extracting knowledge regarding trends and environmental effects in space and time the findings from this study may serve as input to a forecasting model based on winter precipitation irrigation plans and the terrain covariates to generate yield estimations more importantly such knowledge is practical for planning water supplies

temperature crop growth yield characteristics and wue on the tibetan plateau the experiment comprised four treatments flat planting with film mulching fm flat planting with film mulching and biomaterial amendment fmba ridge furrow planting with film mulching rm and ridge furrow planting with film mulching and biomaterial amendment rmba the biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow mulching treatments increased soil water content in the 0 120 cm soil layer especially at 0 60 cm soil depth at early growth stages compared with fm furthermore the ridge furrow mulching treatments had

tibetan plateau also known as the third pole plays an important role in asian and global hydrological ecological and climatic systems however crop growth and yields are limited by low and erratic precipitation strong soil evaporation and low temperature stress due to the high altitude which could be exacerbated by climate change and the increasing population piao et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 and threaten local food security and agricultural sustainability paltridge et al 2009 several studies have investigated ways to increase crop yields to improve the local economy chen et al 2015 tang et al 2020 wolfberry lycium barbarum l is a preferred crop of local farmers for increasing income and avoiding damage from over grazing however the harsh climatic conditions low soil fertility and overfertilization can restrict its growth and cause economic losses and environmental pollution wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 previous studies have reported that the application rate of chemical fertilizers is about 4500 kg ha 1 for wolfberry in local orchards 30 higher than the recommended fertilizer application amount li 2019 wan et al 2016 in the local traditional planting system continuous and excessive chemical fertilizer applications have wasted fertilizer resources reduced fertilizer use efficiency and caused severe soil degradation guo et al 2010 jiang et al 2018 su et al 2007 in addition poor soil structure and low soil water storage capacity caused by soil erosion have resulted in serious deep percolation reducing agricultural production and water use efficiency wue chen et al 2018 therefore integrated approaches that combine soil management measures with suitable agricultural technologies are urgently needed to reduce chemical fertilizer applications and improve crop yields and wue soil amendments can improve soil quality reduce environmental pollution and increase crop yields and wue bocchi and tano 1994 wang et al 2017 biomaterial amendments can reduce unproductive soil evaporation improve soil water retention capacity and increase soil water availability during the entire growing season li et al 2018a novak and watts 2013 studies have reported that biomaterial amendments improve soil structure and aggregate stability reduce soil bulk density and enhance soil hydraulic characteristics which prevent soil degradation and erosion laird et al 2010 wang et al 2017 in addition the combined application of biomaterial amendments and chemical fertilizers can accelerate plant growth and development and improve soil fertility grain yield and resource utilization efficiency kiboi et al 2019 hu et al 2019 reported that a novel soil amendment combined with chemical fertilizers significantly improved soil physical properties and soil water content reduced inorganic fertilizer applications and increased grain yield and wue under deficit irrigation however the effects of soil amendments on the soil environment and crop yield vary with soil type organic material used and time somerville et al 2019 rainwater harvesting technologies can effectively collect rainfall and runoff relieve drought stress and increase grain yields and water use efficiency in arid and semi arid regions mo et al 2018b vohland and barry 2009 ridge furrow mulching is a widely adopted technology due to its efficient rainwater collection and utilization efficiency enhanced crop yields and high economic benefits gan et al 2013 in this system the ridges collect rainfall that can be absorbed and used by plants in the furrows increasing runoff efficiency and plant

yield and water productivity in a tropical area zhang et al 2021 reported that the combination of organic amendment and a rainwater collection technique significantly increased soil moisture improved soil structure and promoted root growth in an apple orchard on the loess plateau however the tibetan plateau has a harsher climate and poorer soil structure than the loess plateau and there is limited information on the effects of biomaterial amendments on soil hydrothermal conditions crop growth yield and wue in addition soil amendments are rarely used to maintain stable wolfberry yields and reduce chemical fertilizer applications in this area the few studies reporting that soil amendments combined with rainwater harvesting techniques affect soil water distribution and fine root growth

regions to increase crop yields and wue however the combined effects of ridge furrow mulching and biomaterial amendments on soil water temperature crop growth and yields are unknown therefore a field experiment was undertaken in 2018 and 2019 in the qaidam basin of the tibetan plateau in the northwest of qinghai province this study aimed to 1 evaluate the effects of biomaterial amendment ridge furrow mulching and their combination on soil water and temperature dynamics and plant growth 2 compare the differences in yield characteristics wue and berry quality among the different cultivation patterns and 3 identify a water saving and effective cultivation pattern for optimized crop production and water use in dry and cold agricultural regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted in the delingha city of the qaidam basin a significant part of the tibetan plateau fig 1 the research station is located in the huaitou tala irrigation district

international soil classification system in the upper 100 cm soil depth the sand 0 02 2 mm silt 0 002 0 02 mm clay 0 002 mm contents were 63 22 and 15 respectively table 1 lists the soil physical and chemical properties in the 0 100 cm soil layer 2 2 biomaterial amendments the main sources of biomaterial amendment were agricultural and industrial waste resources specifically 1 castor oil residue 2 mushroom residue 3 mixture of branches crushed straw and weeds and 4 solid cattle manure the four ingredients were mixed thoroughly in a 2 1 1 1 ratio based on a dry mass and fermented for about 20

in this study 2 3 field experiments a typical local wolfberry orchard was chosen as the research area in the huaitou tala irrigation district of the qaidam basin the wolfberry trees cv ningqi no 7 were five years old and about 1 m in height spaced 1 m apart in rows 1 5 m apart the study was conducted in a completely randomized design with three replicates of four planting patterns each plot was 30 m2 1 5 m wide 20 m long the four treatments were 1 flat planting with film mulching fm 2 flat planting with film mulching and biomaterial amendment fmba 3 ridge furrow planting with film mulching rm 4 ridge furrow planting with film mulching and biomaterial amendment rmba the biomaterial amendment fmba and rmba treatments was buried in the soil close to the roots to avoid damaging the root system or affecting wolfberry growth the biomaterial amendment was applied from 0 to 30 cm soil depth using the ditch method and mixed thoroughly with the soil at the beginning of each growing season fig 3 alternative ridges and furrows were then established and plastic film was applied after the biomaterial amendment the ridge furrow configurations were set up above the soils mixed with the biomaterial amendments in the rmba treatment for the rm and rmba treatments ridges 32 cm width and 10 cm height and furrows 30 cm width were mulched with black plastic film 0 08 mm thick to reduce soil evaporation black plastic film 0 08 mm thick was used to cover the flat surface in the fm and fmba treatments total applied n in each treatment was 0 14 kg plant 1 based on the equivalent nitrogen principle total n n from mineral fertilizer urea n from biomaterial amendment the n application rates for the different treatments are presented in table 3 drip irrigation lines were kept 10 cm from the experimental trees and placed in the center of each plot the irrigation water came from local bayin river reservoir drippers with a flow rate of 3 75 l h 1 were spaced 50 cm apart each irrigation lasted 4 h in all treatments during the wolfberry growing season and 10 h during winter after the experiment we regularly checked the irrigation to avoid irrigation and fertilizer contamination between plots as the experimental site was a demonstration base of wolfberry cropping in the qaidam basin li 2019 we adopted the local irrigation schedule irrigation was applied six and seven times in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons respectively with 30 mm of irrigation water containing soluble nutrients nitrogen 20 phosphorus 20 and potassium 20 applied each time according to local field management tree trimming weeding and manual pesticide application occurred regularly in each plot throughout the growing season 2 4 measurements and data analysis soil volumetric water content svwc was measured in each plot about every ten days in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons using a time domain reflectometry probe system imko germany time fm t3c the probe access tubes were installed mid way between two wolfberry trees at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 120 cm to record soil moisture in the ridge furrow mulching treatments the probe access tubes were installed at sampling locations in the middle of the furrows between two trees and the middle of the adjacent ridges in each plot the values were averaged to account for the heterogeneity in soil moisture due to variations in the soil surface shape the probe tubes were calibrated onsite by determining the soil volumetric water content from the direct soil samplings recommended in the user manual the soil water content values were averaged using three replications soil water storage sws mm was determined as follows 1 sws i 1 n w i h i 10 where n is the number of soil layers w i is soil volumetric water content and h i cm is soil depth soil temperatures were measured weekly with a set of mercury thermometers at 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm soil depth in each plot throughout the growing season the thermometers were kept 15 cm from the wolfberry tree trunk and installed in the connections between the ridges and furrows in the ridge furrow mulching treatments soil temperatures were recorded manually at 08 00 h 14 00 h and 20 00 h the daily average temperature was the mean of the three readings before the start of the experiment soil samples were collected in the 0 100 cm soil layer at 20 cm intervals to determine soil physical and chemical properties soil texture was measured using a model apa2000 laser particle size analyzer malvern instruments ltd soil bulk density was determined using the core sampling method khaliq and kaleem abbasi 2015 and soil porosity was calculated according to xin et al 2016 soil samples were oven dried to a constant weight after being saturated for 24 h to determine soil saturated water content soil available n p and k were measured using the alkaline hydrolysis diffusion olsen and colorimetric methods bao 2000 respectively the entire wolfberry growing season may to september was divided into five growth stages based on the plant physiological and growth characteristics in our study ⅰ sprout stage plants started to sprout ⅱ blossom stage plants started to blossom ⅲ summer harvest stage some wolfberries matured and could be harvested ⅳ autumn harvest stage remaining wolfberries could be harvested ⅴ dormancy stage plants stopped growing and leaves began to fall at each growth stage some plant growth parameters were measured in three representative trees randomly selected in each plot including plant height cm using a tape measure ground diameter trunk diameter 20 cm above the ground mm using a vernier caliper and leaf area index using an lai 2200c meter group usa in october 2019 three soil samples were taken 30 cm away from one selected wolfberry trunk in each plot using a hand auger 9 cm diameter to collect roots the soil samples were taken at 20 cm increments to 120 cm depth the roots were then removed from the soil samples using tweezers lastly the roots were scanned and the images were analyzed using delta t scan image analysis software delta t scan delta t devices company uk to determine root length li et al 2017b root length density rld m m 3 was calculated using the following formula 2 r l d r l v where rl m is root length and v m 3 is soil layer volume total evapotranspiration et mm was evaluated as 3 e t p i d r δ w where p mm is total precipitation in each growing season i mm is irrigation d mm is deep percolation r mm is runoff and δw mm is the sws difference between the beginning and end of growing season at 0 120 cm soil depth due to the generally low precipitation amounts during the growing season deep percolation was considered negligible runoff was not detected at the experimental site during the study therefore et can be calculated as follows 4 e t p i δ w gross yield was the sum of the summer and autumn wolfberry measurements berry diameter and length were recorded using a vernier caliper from 100 fresh wolfberries in each treatment about 500 g of wolfberries from each plot were selected to determine berry quality including total sugar ts total acid ta vitamin c protein and soluble solids content ssc

values among treatments were evaluated by the least significant differences lsd test at p 0 05 all experimental results were the averages of three replications all graphics were created using originpro 2016 3 results 3 1 soil water content both the ridge furrow planting and biomaterial amendment increased soil water content swc at different soil depths in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons fig 4 more so at the shallow soil depth 0 40 cm compared with the fm treatment the rmba treatment significantly increased swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer by 19 1 at early growth stages in both growing seasons while no significant differences occurred during later growth stages harvest and dormancy similarly the rmba treatment had significantly higher swc values in the 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil layers during early growth than the fm treatment the rm and fmba treatments also maintained higher swc in the 20 60 cm soil layer relative to fm but the differences were not significant in most cases in the 60 80 cm soil layer the rm and fmba treatments significantly decreased swc by 12 2 and 12 5 respectively during later growth harvest stage compared with the fm treatment there were no significant differences in swc between the rmba and fm treatments in this period the swc in the deep 80 120 cm soil layer remained relatively stable in all treatments across the growing season and did not significantly differ between treatments 3 2 soil temperature daily mean soil temperatures at 10 cm soil depth under the different treatments followed similar trends to air temperature during the growing season increasing during the vegetative growth stage and the lowest at the dormancy stage fig 5 during the whole growing season ridge furrow planting increased soil temperature compared with flat planting with significant differences at the sprout stage the rmba and rm treatments had 1 5 c and 1 2 c higher daily mean soil temperatures respectively than the fm treatment in addition differences in soil temperatures among the treatments varied with growth stage the rmba and rm treatments on average increased soil temperatures by 2 3 c at the sprout stage 1 9 c at the blossom stage and 0 8 c at the harvest stages relative to the fm treatment the biomaterial amendment increased soil temperature slightly but not significantly compared with conventional fertilization fm and rm treatments 3 3 plant height and ground diameter fig 6 shows the dynamic changes in plant height and ground diameter under different treatments at various growth stages in the two growing seasons the ridge furrow mulching system and biomaterial amendment positively affected plant growth and development in both years plant height increased rapidly at early growth stages in all treatments and remained stable during later growth periods the rmba treatment produced the tallest plant height followed by the fmba and rm treatments at the dormancy stage the rmba fmba and rm treatments significantly increased plant height by 9 9 5 6 and 4 2 respectively average across both years relative to the fm treatment plant height in the fmba treatment did not significantly differ from the rm treatment ground diameter followed a similar trend to plant height in each treatment in both growing seasons ground diameter increased gradually reaching the maximum values at the late blossom stage and declining during later growth mean ground diameter values increased by 2 9 cm in the rmba treatment 1 6 cm in the rm treatment and 1 2 cm in the fmba treatment compared with the fm treatment across both growing seasons 3 4 root growth fig 7 shows the vertical distribution of rld within the 0 120 cm soil layer under the different treatments the rmba rm and fmba treatments increased the sum of rld by 62 3 50 6 and 36 0 respectively relative to the fm treatment the rld distribution was identical under the different planting practices with the root systems concentrated at 0 60 cm soil depth accounting for 80 3 76 5 75 2 and 69 7 of total roots in the rmba rm fmba and fm treatments respectively the rmba treatment significantly enhanced rld at 0 40 cm soil depth compared with the fm treatment with no significant differences detected below 40 cm the rm and fmba treatments had higher rld values at 0 120 cm soil depth than the fm treatment but there were no significant differences among treatments in any soil layer 3 5 yield wue and berry quality both the biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow planting had positive effects on wolfberry yield characteristics and wue over the growing season table 4 the anova revealed significant effects of the biomaterial amendment on wue in 2018 and wolfberry diameter 100 berry weight yield and wue in 2019 ridge furrow planting significantly affected 100 berry weight yield and wue in both growing seasons the interaction of biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow planting had no significant effect on wolfberry characteristics yield et or wue the rmba treatment significantly increased wolfberry diameter by 8 2 wolfberry length by 11 3 and 100 berry weight by 22 6 averaged across both growing seasons relative to the fm treatment the wolfberry characteristics did not significantly differ between the rm and fmba treatments the yield and wue in each treatment were ranked rmba rm fmba fm mean yield and wue increased by 23 0 and 28 6 in the rmba treatment 17 1 and 18 9 in the rm treatment and 13 5 and 14 9 in the fmba treatment respectively relative to the fm treatment there were no significant differences in et among treatments in 2018 or 2019 the biomaterial amendment significantly affected vitamin c in fresh berry and ts ta vitamin c and protein in dry berry table 5 ridge furrow planting significantly affected ts in fresh berry and ta and protein in dry berry the interaction between biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow planting significantly affected ta in dry berry the rmba and fmba treatments increased ts by 46 0 and 5 7 in fresh berry and 12 7 and 7 2 in dry berry respectively relative to the fm treatment the rmba treatment produced the highest ts and vitamin c and lowest ta in fresh and dry berries indicating the greatest improvements in wolfberry quality the rmba rm and fmba treatments significantly increased protein in dry berry by 30 3 20 2 and 20 2 respectively compared with the fm treatment there were no significant differences in soluble solids content ssc in fresh berry among treatments 4 discussion 4 1 soil water water is a primary restricting factor for agricultural production in some semi arid and arid regions especially on the tibetan plateau with its high altitude and low precipitation drought spells usually limit local crop yield and wue due to the insufficient rainwater harvesting and utilization capacity mo et al 2018b studies have reported that soil amendments can increase soil water infiltration and plant transpiration and reduce soil evaporation thus improving wue and grain yield busscher et al 2007 chivenge et al 2009 leon et al 2006 in our study the rmba treatment significantly improved swc in the 0 60 cm soil layer at early growth stages relative to the fm treatment fig 4 the biomaterial amendment rmba and fmba treatments also increased swc in the 0 60 cm soil layer compared with the unamended treatments during early growth while the effects were not significant across the growing season in most cases this may be because soil amendments are like tiny reservoirs for absorbing water rapidly before releasing it slowly for plant use due to its porous structure zhang et al 2021 additionally biomaterial amendments can improve soil physical and hydraulic properties by reducing soil bulk density and increasing soil saturated hydraulic conductivity which could help explain the high soil water retention haider et al 2017 he et al 2019 ridge furrow mulching is an effective planting pattern for improving rainwater collection efficiency and suppressing soil evaporation thus enhancing soil water content during the growing season gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2020b this cultivation technique can harvest light rains from the ridges so that plants in the furrows receive more water than those under flat planting jiang and li 2015 plastic film mulching can also significantly reduce soil evaporation increase water infiltration and increase soil moisture compared to unmulched plots bu et al 2013 duan et al 2021 zhang et al 2011 in the present study black plastic film was used to cover the experimental plots in the different treatments but ridge furrow mulching rmba and rm treatments had higher swc values within the 0 120 cm soil layer than traditional flat planting fmba and fm treatments at early growth stages fig 4 indicating that the ridge furrow configuration has high rainwater harvesting efficiency and soil water availability gan et al 2013 similarly a ridge furrow mulching system significantly improved swc in the 0 200 cm soil profile and soil temperature at early growth stages relative to flat plots with mulching and increased maize yield and wue on the loess plateau zhang et al 2019 however the improvements in swc gradually declined as the crop developed with soil moisture at 60 80 cm soil depth in the rm and fmba treatments significantly lower than the fm treatment at the harvest stage fig 4 this may be due to the rapid growth and development of wolfberry in the rm and fmba treatments during this period resulting in higher plant transpiration and water absorption ability compared with fm gao et al 2014 the biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow mulching had the most significant positive effects on soil moisture in the rmba treatment compared with the fm treatment producing significantly higher swc in the 0 60 cm soil profile at early growth stages fig 4 for the rmba treatment the wolfberry root zones were concentrated in the 0 60 cm soil profile where most of the rainwater was stored due to the improved water collection capacity of the ridge furrow construction wang et al 2020 in addition the soil amendment mixed in the topsoil can retain water for longer than unamended soils making it available for plant use 4 2 soil temperature plastic film mulch can increase topsoil temperature ensure seedling establishment and accelerate crop development in arid semi arid and highland regions where cold stress usually restricts crop growth and maturation li et al 2019 wang et al 2015a the application of plastic film blocks water and gas exchange between air and soil thereby decreasing soil heat loss liu et al 2010 in our study black plastic film was used to increase surface soil temperature to avoid the adverse effect of cold stress the rmba and rm treatments significantly increased topsoil temperatures 0 10 cm at the sprout stage compared with the fm treatment especially in the rmba treatment fig 5 the mechanisms involved could be attributed to 1 ridge furrow configurations changing micro topographic heterogeneity and increasing the area of soil exposed to sunlight compared to flat planting jiang and li 2015 2 the presence of mulched ridges decreasing wind speed in the furrows reducing thermal loss from soil wang et al 2015b biomaterial amendment application rmba and fmba treatments slightly increased soil temperatures compared with the rm and fm treatments during the growing season which could be related to increased soil organic matter decomposition soil organic matter decomposition produces co2 and heat due to microbial activities but further investigation is needed jílková et al 2020 in the present study the warming effect caused by ridge furrow mulching gradually decreased with plant growth fig 5 as the larger plant canopies prevented solar radiation from reaching the soil surface zhou et al 2009 and decreasing the warming effect of the mulch gan et al 2013 liu et al 2009 mo et al 2018a reported greater differences in soil temperatures between mulched and unmulched treatments with crop growth than the current study which could be due to different plant canopy structures and planting methods 4 3 crop growth plant height and ground diameter are important plant growth parameters affecting crop yields freeman et al 2007 wang et al 2020 as found in our study kiboi et al 2019 reported that organic biomaterial significantly increased leaf area index and plant height due to enhanced soil water status relative to traditional fertilization biomaterial amendments can accelerate plant growth and enhance dry matter accumulation thereby increasing crop yield and wue chen et al 2012 maddonni and otegui 1996 some studies have shown that ridge furrow mulching significantly increased topsoil water content improved soil thermal condition and increased crop biomass and grain yields liu et al 2010 steinmetz et al 2016 in our study the rm and fmba treatments increased plant height and ground diameter in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons compared with the fm treatment with no significant differences during most of the growth stages fig 6 ridge furrow mulching treatments can increase crop growth and development due to improved soil water and temperature states relative to the fm treatment mo et al 2018a zhao et al 2012 a previous study reported that biomaterial amendment applications could increase plant height and leaf area by enhancing soil water content hu et al 2019 in most cases plant growth parameters did not significantly differ among the rm fmba and fm treatments likely due to the non significant soil water conditions among treatments compared with fm the rmba treatment significantly increased plant height and ground diameter due to the more favorable soil hydrothermal environment zhao et al 2014a plant height and ground diameter declined during the later growth period july august which could be due to variations in meteorological factors or crop physiology wang et al 2020 this phenomenon of estivation is consistent with the finding of su et al 2004 the distribution of crop root systems is important for building efficient and water saving agricultural management measures ali et al 2018 root length density can affect water and nutrient absorption by plants and indirectly determine canopy development and final yield jia et al 2018 yang et al 2004 biomaterial amendments can accelerate root growth and development by improving soil physical chemical and microbial properties zhao et al 2009 the ridge furrow mulching system can improve root parameters and distribution patterns relative to conventional flat planting xu et al 2016 in our study the rmba treatment significantly enhanced rld at the 0 40 cm soil depth compared to fm due to the more suitable soil environment i e higher swc and soil temperature which increased water and nutrient uptake by roots and promoted plant growth ali et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 there were no significant differences in rld at the 40 120 cm soil depth among the treatments fig 7 compared with the fm treatment the rm and fmba treatments also increased rld within the 0 120 cm soil layer due to increased soil water content in root zones but the differences were not significant the wolfberry root system was mainly concentrated in the 0 60 cm depth as reported by zhang et al 2016 roots tend to penetrate areas with better water and nutrient conditions and usually decrease with increasing soil depth song et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 rooting depth is also affected by local meteorological conditions soil texture and agricultural management practices clark et al 2003 4 4 wolfberry yield wue and quality for many agricultural researchers in arid and semi arid areas it is important to improve crop production and wue deng et al 2006 soil amendments can improve soil properties by increasing soil porosity and soil hydraulic conductivity and enhance soil water retention thus increasing aboveground biomass and grain yield laird et al 2010 zhao et al 2014b ridge furrow mulching increases rainwater conservation reduces soil evaporation and eventually improves final yield and wue mo et al 2018b zhou et al 2009 in the present study the biomaterial amendment significantly affected wue in 2018 and wolfberry diameter 100 berry weight yield and wue in 2019 table 4 ridge furrow planting significantly affected 100 berry weight yield and wue in 2018 and 2019 the effects of the biomaterial amendment varied between the two years which could be due to 1 the long lasting positive effects of soil amendments on soil environment and crop yields increasing gradually with increasing experimental year major et al 2010 wang et al 2017 thus the biomaterial amendment may have had more significant effects on yield components and wue in 2019 than that in 2018 due to the improved soil physical and hydraulic properties e g enhanced soil water retention capacity and decreased soil bulk density over time 2 the slow release rate of available nutrients from biomaterial amendments which may not significantly affect crop growth and yields in the first season but significantly improve root growth crop yields and resource use efficiency in the following season kiboi et al 2019 3 decompositions of biomaterial amendments are highly related to soil water condition turmel et al 2015 higher soil water content and storage in the 2019 growing season could have increased the biomaterial amendment decomposition rate and improved soil microbial activity thereby having greater effects on wolfberry characteristics yield and wue in 2019 than 2018 in contrast compared with flat planting ridge furrow mulching can effectively increase rainwater harvesting efficiency regulate soil hydrothermal status and improve plant growth in the first season thus significantly affecting wolfberry yield and wue in both growing seasons zhang et al 2019 the rmba rm and fmba treatments increased mean yield and wue by 23 0 and 28 6 17 1 and 18 9 and 13 5 and 14 9 respectively relative to the fm treatment yield characteristics such as wolfberry diameter wolfberry length and 100 berry weight also increased in these treatments compared to the fm treatment the rmba treatment produced the highest wolfberry yield yield components and wue in both years which was attributed to more optimal soil hydrothermal conditions than those in the fm treatment the improved soil environment enhanced plant growth and biomass accumulation thus increasing crop yield and wue gao et al 2014 mo et al 2018a biomaterial amendments can release nutrients slowly into soil and fully meet crop needs during critical growth periods adediran et al 2005 the improved water and heat status in the rmba treatment would increase soil nutrient especially nitrogen and fertilizer utilization efficiencies thereby promoting resource absorption capacity and crop yield gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2020b in our study all treatments in 2018 had lower wolfberry yields than 2019 table 4 despite similar rainfall plus irrigation amounts 313 8 mm in 2018 325 4 mm in 2019 this result could be due to the higher soil water content and storage during early growth in all treatments in 2019 than 2018 fig 4 zhang et al 2014 reported that high swc at sowing significantly improved grain yield and wue in northwest china similarly jiang et al 2018 reported that higher sws at early growth stages played an important role in crop production mitigating water stress during the maize growing season the reason for this result could be that crop yields were severely limited by irregular soil water availability and ineffective rainwater management rather than the amount of water supply during the whole growing season jiang et al 2018 zhu et al 2015 drought stress during early growth can affect plant dry matter accumulation and physiological characteristics thereby limiting crop production liu et al 2009 wolfberry growth and development were restricted by water stress at early growth stages in the qaidam basin of china reducing final crop yields and water use efficiency wang et al 2020 higher soil water content and storage during early growth in 2019 could help mitigate the negative effects during drought periods optimize crop growth and thus increase wolfberry production compared with 2018 the higher wue in the rmba treatment was directly related to the increased crop yield and lower et compared with the fm treatment table 4 the mechanisms responsible for increasing wue were mainly the improved plant transpiration and reduced non productive soil evaporation which promoted plant growth and yield li et al 2018b 2015 geographical location soil texture weather conditions and management practices have significant effects on berry quality orhan et al 2006 application of soil amendments can increase fruit quality and nutrient elements compared to chemical fertilizer carey et al 2009 stojanov et al 2019 biomaterial amendments can significantly improve soil physio chemical properties and microbial activity and increase soil humic substances and various nutrients which are beneficial for fruit quality nardi et al 2002 zhang et al 2020a in addition the ridge furrow mulching system can improve grain yield and quality by increasing n mineralization and nitrification rate and enhancing enzyme activity due to the improved soil environment li et al 2017a in the current study the biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow planting treatments had significant positive effects on berry quality especially in the rmba treatment which significantly increased ts vitamin c and protein and reduced ta contents relative to the fm treatment table 5 the rmba treatment also increased ts vitamin c and protein and reduced ta compared with the rm and fmba treatments indicating its superior ability to improve berry quality the ssc did not differ between treatments which may be because the taste compound was largely affected by growing season rather than fertilizer applications alleyne and clark 1997 economic profitability is an important driving factor for local farmers to accept innovative farming practices li et al 2019 in our study the input values mainly included the costs of labor 1666 7 rmb yuan ha 1 ridge furrow construction 666 7 rmb yuan ha 1 chemical fertilizer 2085 1 rmb yuan ha 1 biomaterial amendment 4666 7 rmb yuan ha 1 irrigation water 222 6 rmb yuan ha 1 and plastic film 500 0 rmb yuan ha 1 the output value in this study was wolfberry yield value and the price per unit was 50 rmb yuan per kg dry weight according to the cost benefit analysis the ridge furrow mulching treatments improved the economic benefit of crop production compared with the fm treatment the net income in each treatment was ranked rmba rm fmba fm across two growing seasons compared with the fm treatment the rmba rm and fmba treatments increased net income by 24 1 20 6 and 0 7 respectively in our two year study however net income in the fmba treatment decreased by 11 6 relative to the fm treatment in 2018 mainly due to the high cost in the biomaterial amendment and no significant yield difference despite the increased inputs the rmba treatment had the highest net economic profit due to its higher crop yield than the other treatments therefore we recommend the rmba treatment for improving crop yields and income of farmers in the dry and cold regions of the tibetan plateau 5 conclusion in the qaidam basin of china the biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow mulching treatments significantly increased soil water content topsoil temperature 0 10 cm and plant growth in both growing seasons plant height and ground diameter increased significantly in the ridge furrow mulching treatments relative to the fm treatment especially in the rmba treatment the rmba treatment also significantly increased rld in the 0 40 cm soil layer enhancing crop water and nutrient absorption ability both the biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow mulching significantly affected wolfberry yield wue and berry quality with the rmba treatment performing the best due to its superior soil hydrothermal conditions and various soil nutrients the rmba treatment also had the highest economic benefit and could be widely accepted and adopted by local farmers in this region we recommend the rmba treatment as an effective and promising planting pattern for improving crop growth and yields in dry and cold agricultural areas however further research is needed to evaluate whether the soil surface does not need to be mulched with plastic film after the biomaterial amendment application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9809,droughts intense soil evaporation and poor soil structure with low water holding capacity and nutrients restrict agricultural production in the qaidam basin on the tibetan plateau excessive chemical fertilizers have been applied to increase the yields of wolfberry lycium barbarum l a significant economic crop in northwest china which has further degraded soils biomaterial amendments and ridge furrow mulching are effective measures for increasing soil water availability crop yields and water use efficiency wue however the combined effects of biomaterial amendments and ridge furrow mulching on soil hydrothermal conditions crop growth and yield in this area are unknown a field study was undertaken in 2018 and 2019 to investigate their combined influences on soil moisture and temperature crop growth yield characteristics and wue on the tibetan plateau the experiment comprised four treatments flat planting with film mulching fm flat planting with film mulching and biomaterial amendment fmba ridge furrow planting with film mulching rm and ridge furrow planting with film mulching and biomaterial amendment rmba the biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow mulching treatments increased soil water content in the 0 120 cm soil layer especially at 0 60 cm soil depth at early growth stages compared with fm furthermore the ridge furrow mulching treatments had significantly higher soil temperatures than the fm treatment at the sprout stage the rmba treatment produced favorable soil hydrothermal properties which significantly increased mean plant height ground diameter and root length density rld the rmba treatment also produced the highest crop yield wue and berry quality in both growing seasons compared with fm the rmba treatment increased mean yield and wue by 23 0 and 28 6 respectively across the two growing seasons we conclude that the rmba treatment is an effective and promising cultivation pattern for alleviating water scarcity and improving soil hydrothermal conditions yield and wue on the tibetan plateau keywords biomaterial amendments ridge furrow mulching soil water crop growth yield water use efficiency 1 introduction the tibetan plateau also known as the third pole plays an important role in asian and global hydrological ecological and climatic systems however crop growth and yields are limited by low and erratic precipitation strong soil evaporation and low temperature stress due to the high altitude which could be exacerbated by climate change and the increasing population piao et al 2010 zhang et al 2013 and threaten local food security and agricultural sustainability paltridge et al 2009 several studies have investigated ways to increase crop yields to improve the local economy chen et al 2015 tang et al 2020 wolfberry lycium barbarum l is a preferred crop of local farmers for increasing income and avoiding damage from over grazing however the harsh climatic conditions low soil fertility and overfertilization can restrict its growth and cause economic losses and environmental pollution wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 previous studies have reported that the application rate of chemical fertilizers is about 4500 kg ha 1 for wolfberry in local orchards 30 higher than the recommended fertilizer application amount li 2019 wan et al 2016 in the local traditional planting system continuous and excessive chemical fertilizer applications have wasted fertilizer resources reduced fertilizer use efficiency and caused severe soil degradation guo et al 2010 jiang et al 2018 su et al 2007 in addition poor soil structure and low soil water storage capacity caused by soil erosion have resulted in serious deep percolation reducing agricultural production and water use efficiency wue chen et al 2018 therefore integrated approaches that combine soil management measures with suitable agricultural technologies are urgently needed to reduce chemical fertilizer applications and improve crop yields and wue soil amendments can improve soil quality reduce environmental pollution and increase crop yields and wue bocchi and tano 1994 wang et al 2017 biomaterial amendments can reduce unproductive soil evaporation improve soil water retention capacity and increase soil water availability during the entire growing season li et al 2018a novak and watts 2013 studies have reported that biomaterial amendments improve soil structure and aggregate stability reduce soil bulk density and enhance soil hydraulic characteristics which prevent soil degradation and erosion laird et al 2010 wang et al 2017 in addition the combined application of biomaterial amendments and chemical fertilizers can accelerate plant growth and development and improve soil fertility grain yield and resource utilization efficiency kiboi et al 2019 hu et al 2019 reported that a novel soil amendment combined with chemical fertilizers significantly improved soil physical properties and soil water content reduced inorganic fertilizer applications and increased grain yield and wue under deficit irrigation however the effects of soil amendments on the soil environment and crop yield vary with soil type organic material used and time somerville et al 2019 rainwater harvesting technologies can effectively collect rainfall and runoff relieve drought stress and increase grain yields and water use efficiency in arid and semi arid regions mo et al 2018b vohland and barry 2009 ridge furrow mulching is a widely adopted technology due to its efficient rainwater collection and utilization efficiency enhanced crop yields and high economic benefits gan et al 2013 in this system the ridges collect rainfall that can be absorbed and used by plants in the furrows increasing runoff efficiency and plant available water wang et al 2008 the ridge furrow mulching system increase soil temperatures at early growth stages and soil moisture availability by reducing evaporation and enhancing deep soil water infiltration wang et al 2008 the optimized soil water and thermal characteristics can significantly increase aboveground dry matter crop yield and precipitation use efficiency zhang et al 2020b zhao et al 2012 for example wang et al 2020 suggested that this planting pattern could be extended to agricultural areas on the tibetan plateau to improve soil water and thermal states thus increasing crop yield and wue numerous studies have reported that soil amendments can improve soil physicochemical properties crop growth and grain yield in dryland and irrigated agriculture with the effects differing by soil type crop species and meteorological conditions hu et al 2019 turmel et al 2015 wang et al 2017 for example chivenge et al 2009 reported positive effects of soil amendments on crop yield and water productivity in a tropical area zhang et al 2021 reported that the combination of organic amendment and a rainwater collection technique significantly increased soil moisture improved soil structure and promoted root growth in an apple orchard on the loess plateau however the tibetan plateau has a harsher climate and poorer soil structure than the loess plateau and there is limited information on the effects of biomaterial amendments on soil hydrothermal conditions crop growth yield and wue in addition soil amendments are rarely used to maintain stable wolfberry yields and reduce chemical fertilizer applications in this area the few studies reporting that soil amendments combined with rainwater harvesting techniques affect soil water distribution and fine root growth mainly used water storage pits which are not widely adopted for crop cultivation song et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 in contrast ridge furrow mulching systems have been used in many arid and semi arid regions to increase crop yields and wue however the combined effects of ridge furrow mulching and biomaterial amendments on soil water temperature crop growth and yields are unknown therefore a field experiment was undertaken in 2018 and 2019 in the qaidam basin of the tibetan plateau in the northwest of qinghai province this study aimed to 1 evaluate the effects of biomaterial amendment ridge furrow mulching and their combination on soil water and temperature dynamics and plant growth 2 compare the differences in yield characteristics wue and berry quality among the different cultivation patterns and 3 identify a water saving and effective cultivation pattern for optimized crop production and water use in dry and cold agricultural regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted in the delingha city of the qaidam basin a significant part of the tibetan plateau fig 1 the research station is located in the huaitou tala irrigation district

2018 and 2019 wolfberry growing seasons are presented in fig 2 total precipitation was 141 8 mm and 115 4 mm in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons respectively the daily mean temperatures were 16 1 c in both growing seasons differences between the mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures have remained stable since 1970 the soil texture at the experimental site is sandy loam according to the international soil classification system in the upper 100 cm soil depth the sand 0 02 2 mm silt 0 002 0 02 mm clay 0 002 mm contents were 63 22 and 15 respectively table 1 lists the soil physical and chemical properties in the 0 100 cm soil layer 2 2 biomaterial amendments the main sources of biomaterial amendment were agricultural and industrial waste resources specifically 1 castor oil residue 2 mushroom residue 3 mixture of branches crushed straw and weeds and 4 solid cattle manure the four ingredients were mixed thoroughly in a 2 1 1 1 ratio based on a dry mass and fermented for about 20 days in an airtight space at about 30 c before adding 37 5 kg ha 1 polyacrylamide to cure the fermented material castor oil and mushroom residues contain many nutrients trace elements and organic matter that can improve soil quality and promote crop growth muscolo et al 2019 straw and weed applications can improve soil physical properties and increase soil water content grain yield and wue maneepitak et al 2019 mo et al 2018b cattle manure a common local organic fertilizer has plenty of nutritional substances to improve the physical and chemical environment of soil gai et al 2018 polyacrylamide can rapidly uptake moisture and then slowly release it for crop use hu et al 2019 tadayonnejad et al 2017 table 2 shows the nutritional and heavy metal contents of the biomaterial used in this study 2 3 field experiments a typical local wolfberry orchard was chosen as the research area in the huaitou tala irrigation district of the qaidam basin the wolfberry trees cv ningqi no 7 were five years old and about 1 m in height spaced 1 m apart in rows 1 5 m apart the study was conducted in a completely randomized design with three replicates of four planting patterns each plot was 30 m2 1 5 m wide 20 m long the four treatments were 1 flat planting with film mulching fm 2 flat planting with film mulching and biomaterial amendment fmba 3 ridge furrow planting with film mulching rm 4 ridge furrow planting with film mulching and biomaterial amendment rmba the biomaterial amendment fmba and rmba treatments was buried in the soil close to the roots to avoid damaging the root system or affecting wolfberry growth the biomaterial amendment was applied from 0 to 30 cm soil depth using the ditch method and mixed thoroughly with the soil at the beginning of each growing season fig 3 alternative ridges and furrows were then established and plastic film was applied after the biomaterial amendment the ridge furrow configurations were set up above the soils mixed with the biomaterial amendments in the rmba treatment for the rm and rmba treatments ridges 32 cm width and 10 cm height and furrows 30 cm width were mulched with black plastic film 0 08 mm thick to reduce soil evaporation black plastic film 0 08 mm thick was used to cover the flat surface in the fm and fmba treatments total applied n in each treatment was 0 14 kg plant 1 based on the equivalent nitrogen principle total n n from mineral fertilizer urea n from biomaterial amendment the n application rates for the different treatments are presented in table 3 drip irrigation lines were kept 10 cm from the experimental trees and placed in the center of each plot the irrigation water came from local bayin river reservoir drippers with a flow rate of 3 75 l h 1 were spaced 50 cm apart each irrigation lasted 4 h in all treatments during the wolfberry growing season and 10 h during winter after the experiment we regularly checked the irrigation to avoid irrigation and fertilizer contamination between plots as the experimental site was a demonstration base of wolfberry cropping in the qaidam basin li 2019 we adopted the local irrigation schedule irrigation was applied six and seven times in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons respectively with 30 mm of irrigation water containing soluble nutrients nitrogen 20 phosphorus 20 and potassium 20 applied each time according to local field management tree trimming weeding and manual pesticide application occurred regularly in each plot throughout the growing season 2 4 measurements and data analysis soil volumetric water content svwc was measured in each plot about every ten days in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons using a time domain reflectometry probe system imko germany time fm t3c the probe access tubes were installed mid way between two wolfberry trees at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 120 cm to record soil moisture in the ridge furrow mulching treatments the probe access tubes were installed at sampling locations in the middle of the furrows between two trees and the middle of the adjacent ridges in each plot the values were averaged to account for the heterogeneity in soil moisture due to variations in the soil surface shape the probe tubes were calibrated onsite by determining the soil volumetric water content from the direct soil samplings recommended in the user manual the soil water content values were averaged using three replications soil water storage sws mm was determined as follows 1 sws i 1 n w i h i 10 where n is the number of soil layers w i is soil volumetric water content and h i cm is soil depth soil temperatures were measured weekly with a set of mercury thermometers at 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm soil depth in each plot throughout the growing season the thermometers were kept 15 cm from the wolfberry tree trunk and installed in the connections between the ridges and furrows in the ridge furrow mulching treatments soil temperatures were recorded manually at 08 00 h 14 00 h and 20 00 h the daily average temperature was the mean of the three readings before the start of the experiment soil samples were collected in the 0 100 cm soil layer at 20 cm intervals to determine soil physical and chemical properties soil texture was measured using a model apa2000 laser particle size analyzer malvern instruments ltd soil bulk density was determined using the core sampling method khaliq and kaleem abbasi 2015 and soil porosity was calculated according to xin et al 2016 soil samples were oven dried to a constant weight after being saturated for 24 h to determine soil saturated water content soil available n p and k were measured using the alkaline hydrolysis diffusion olsen and colorimetric methods bao 2000 respectively the entire wolfberry growing season may to september was divided into five growth stages based on the plant physiological and growth characteristics in our study ⅰ sprout stage plants started to sprout ⅱ blossom stage plants started to blossom ⅲ summer harvest stage some wolfberries matured and could be harvested ⅳ autumn harvest stage remaining wolfberries could be harvested ⅴ dormancy stage plants stopped growing and leaves began to fall at each growth stage some plant growth parameters were measured in three representative trees randomly selected in each plot including plant height cm using a tape measure ground diameter trunk diameter 20 cm above the ground mm using a vernier caliper and leaf area index using an lai 2200c meter group usa in october 2019 three soil samples were taken 30 cm away from one selected wolfberry trunk in each plot using a hand auger 9 cm diameter to collect roots the soil samples were taken at 20 cm increments to 120 cm depth the roots were then removed from the soil samples using tweezers lastly the roots were scanned and the images were analyzed using delta t scan image analysis software delta t scan delta t devices company uk to determine root length li et al 2017b root length density rld m m 3 was calculated using the following formula 2 r l d r l v where rl m is root length and v m 3 is soil layer volume total evapotranspiration et mm was evaluated as 3 e t p i d r δ w where p mm is total precipitation in each growing season i mm is irrigation d mm is deep percolation r mm is runoff and δw mm is the sws difference between the beginning and end of growing season at 0 120 cm soil depth due to the generally low precipitation amounts during the growing season deep percolation was considered negligible runoff was not detected at the experimental site during the study therefore et can be calculated as follows 4 e t p i δ w gross yield was the sum of the summer and autumn wolfberry measurements berry diameter and length were recorded using a vernier caliper from 100 fresh wolfberries in each treatment about 500 g of wolfberries from each plot were selected to determine berry quality including total sugar ts total acid ta vitamin c protein and soluble solids content ssc ts was determined using the fehling reagent method ta was measured by titrating juice samples with naoh solution vitamin c and protein were tested using the molybdenum blue and bradford methods respectively ssc was evaluated using a hand held refractometer wyt 4 china water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 was determined as 5 w u e y e t where y kg ha 1 is wolfberry yield and et mm is evapotranspiration during the growing season the experimental data for each growing season were analyzed by anova using spss 22 0 statistical software ibm usa significant differences of the mean values among treatments were evaluated by the least significant differences lsd test at p 0 05 all experimental results were the averages of three replications all graphics were created using originpro 2016 3 results 3 1 soil water content both the ridge furrow planting and biomaterial amendment increased soil water content swc at different soil depths in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons fig 4 more so at the shallow soil depth 0 40 cm compared with the fm treatment the rmba treatment significantly increased swc in the 0 20 cm soil layer by 19 1 at early growth stages in both growing seasons while no significant differences occurred during later growth stages harvest and dormancy similarly the rmba treatment had significantly higher swc values in the 20 40 and 40 60 cm soil layers during early growth than the fm treatment the rm and fmba treatments also maintained higher swc in the 20 60 cm soil layer relative to fm but the differences were not significant in most cases in the 60 80 cm soil layer the rm and fmba treatments significantly decreased swc by 12 2 and 12 5 respectively during later growth harvest stage compared with the fm treatment there were no significant differences in swc between the rmba and fm treatments in this period the swc in the deep 80 120 cm soil layer remained relatively stable in all treatments across the growing season and did not significantly differ between treatments 3 2 soil temperature daily mean soil temperatures at 10 cm soil depth under the different treatments followed similar trends to air temperature during the growing season increasing during the vegetative growth stage and the lowest at the dormancy stage fig 5 during the whole growing season ridge furrow planting increased soil temperature compared with flat planting with significant differences at the sprout stage the rmba and rm treatments had 1 5 c and 1 2 c higher daily mean soil temperatures respectively than the fm treatment in addition differences in soil temperatures among the treatments varied with growth stage the rmba and rm treatments on average increased soil temperatures by 2 3 c at the sprout stage 1 9 c at the blossom stage and 0 8 c at the harvest stages relative to the fm treatment the biomaterial amendment increased soil temperature slightly but not significantly compared with conventional fertilization fm and rm treatments 3 3 plant height and ground diameter fig 6 shows the dynamic changes in plant height and ground diameter under different treatments at various growth stages in the two growing seasons the ridge furrow mulching system and biomaterial amendment positively affected plant growth and development in both years plant height increased rapidly at early growth stages in all treatments and remained stable during later growth periods the rmba treatment produced the tallest plant height followed by the fmba and rm treatments at the dormancy stage the rmba fmba and rm treatments significantly increased plant height by 9 9 5 6 and 4 2 respectively average across both years relative to the fm treatment plant height in the fmba treatment did not significantly differ from the rm treatment ground diameter followed a similar trend to plant height in each treatment in both growing seasons ground diameter increased gradually reaching the maximum values at the late blossom stage and declining during later growth mean ground diameter values increased by 2 9 cm in the rmba treatment 1 6 cm in the rm treatment and 1 2 cm in the fmba treatment compared with the fm treatment across both growing seasons 3 4 root growth fig 7 shows the vertical distribution of rld within the 0 120 cm soil layer under the different treatments the rmba rm and fmba treatments increased the sum of rld by 62 3 50 6 and 36 0 respectively relative to the fm treatment the rld distribution was identical under the different planting practices with the root systems concentrated at 0 60 cm soil depth accounting for 80 3 76 5 75 2 and 69 7 of total roots in the rmba rm fmba and fm treatments respectively the rmba treatment significantly enhanced rld at 0 40 cm soil depth compared with the fm treatment with no significant differences detected below 40 cm the rm and fmba treatments had higher rld values at 0 120 cm soil depth than the fm treatment but there were no significant differences among treatments in any soil layer 3 5 yield wue and berry quality both the biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow planting had positive effects on wolfberry yield characteristics and wue over the growing season table 4 the anova revealed significant effects of the biomaterial amendment on wue in 2018 and wolfberry diameter 100 berry weight yield and wue in 2019 ridge furrow planting significantly affected 100 berry weight yield and wue in both growing seasons the interaction of biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow planting had no significant effect on wolfberry characteristics yield et or wue the rmba treatment significantly increased wolfberry diameter by 8 2 wolfberry length by 11 3 and 100 berry weight by 22 6 averaged across both growing seasons relative to the fm treatment the wolfberry characteristics did not significantly differ between the rm and fmba treatments the yield and wue in each treatment were ranked rmba rm fmba fm mean yield and wue increased by 23 0 and 28 6 in the rmba treatment 17 1 and 18 9 in the rm treatment and 13 5 and 14 9 in the fmba treatment respectively relative to the fm treatment there were no significant differences in et among treatments in 2018 or 2019 the biomaterial amendment significantly affected vitamin c in fresh berry and ts ta vitamin c and protein in dry berry table 5 ridge furrow planting significantly affected ts in fresh berry and ta and protein in dry berry the interaction between biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow planting significantly affected ta in dry berry the rmba and fmba treatments increased ts by 46 0 and 5 7 in fresh berry and 12 7 and 7 2 in dry berry respectively relative to the fm treatment the rmba treatment produced the highest ts and vitamin c and lowest ta in fresh and dry berries indicating the greatest improvements in wolfberry quality the rmba rm and fmba treatments significantly increased protein in dry berry by 30 3 20 2 and 20 2 respectively compared with the fm treatment there were no significant differences in soluble solids content ssc in fresh berry among treatments 4 discussion 4 1 soil water water is a primary restricting factor for agricultural production in some semi arid and arid regions especially on the tibetan plateau with its high altitude and low precipitation drought spells usually limit local crop yield and wue due to the insufficient rainwater harvesting and utilization capacity mo et al 2018b studies have reported that soil amendments can increase soil water infiltration and plant transpiration and reduce soil evaporation thus improving wue and grain yield busscher et al 2007 chivenge et al 2009 leon et al 2006 in our study the rmba treatment significantly improved swc in the 0 60 cm soil layer at early growth stages relative to the fm treatment fig 4 the biomaterial amendment rmba and fmba treatments also increased swc in the 0 60 cm soil layer compared with the unamended treatments during early growth while the effects were not significant across the growing season in most cases this may be because soil amendments are like tiny reservoirs for absorbing water rapidly before releasing it slowly for plant use due to its porous structure zhang et al 2021 additionally biomaterial amendments can improve soil physical and hydraulic properties by reducing soil bulk density and increasing soil saturated hydraulic conductivity which could help explain the high soil water retention haider et al 2017 he et al 2019 ridge furrow mulching is an effective planting pattern for improving rainwater collection efficiency and suppressing soil evaporation thus enhancing soil water content during the growing season gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2020b this cultivation technique can harvest light rains from the ridges so that plants in the furrows receive more water than those under flat planting jiang and li 2015 plastic film mulching can also significantly reduce soil evaporation increase water infiltration and increase soil moisture compared to unmulched plots bu et al 2013 duan et al 2021 zhang et al 2011 in the present study black plastic film was used to cover the experimental plots in the different treatments but ridge furrow mulching rmba and rm treatments had higher swc values within the 0 120 cm soil layer than traditional flat planting fmba and fm treatments at early growth stages fig 4 indicating that the ridge furrow configuration has high rainwater harvesting efficiency and soil water availability gan et al 2013 similarly a ridge furrow mulching system significantly improved swc in the 0 200 cm soil profile and soil temperature at early growth stages relative to flat plots with mulching and increased maize yield and wue on the loess plateau zhang et al 2019 however the improvements in swc gradually declined as the crop developed with soil moisture at 60 80 cm soil depth in the rm and fmba treatments significantly lower than the fm treatment at the harvest stage fig 4 this may be due to the rapid growth and development of wolfberry in the rm and fmba treatments during this period resulting in higher plant transpiration and water absorption ability compared with fm gao et al 2014 the biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow mulching had the most significant positive effects on soil moisture in the rmba treatment compared with the fm treatment producing significantly higher swc in the 0 60 cm soil profile at early growth stages fig 4 for the rmba treatment the wolfberry root zones were concentrated in the 0 60 cm soil profile where most of the rainwater was stored due to the improved water collection capacity of the ridge furrow construction wang et al 2020 in addition the soil amendment mixed in the topsoil can retain water for longer than unamended soils making it available for plant use 4 2 soil temperature plastic film mulch can increase topsoil temperature ensure seedling establishment and accelerate crop development in arid semi arid and highland regions where cold stress usually restricts crop growth and maturation li et al 2019 wang et al 2015a the application of plastic film blocks water and gas exchange between air and soil thereby decreasing soil heat loss liu et al 2010 in our study black plastic film was used to increase surface soil temperature to avoid the adverse effect of cold stress the rmba and rm treatments significantly increased topsoil temperatures 0 10 cm at the sprout stage compared with the fm treatment especially in the rmba treatment fig 5 the mechanisms involved could be attributed to 1 ridge furrow configurations changing micro topographic heterogeneity and increasing the area of soil exposed to sunlight compared to flat planting jiang and li 2015 2 the presence of mulched ridges decreasing wind speed in the furrows reducing thermal loss from soil wang et al 2015b biomaterial amendment application rmba and fmba treatments slightly increased soil temperatures compared with the rm and fm treatments during the growing season which could be related to increased soil organic matter decomposition soil organic matter decomposition produces co2 and heat due to microbial activities but further investigation is needed jílková et al 2020 in the present study the warming effect caused by ridge furrow mulching gradually decreased with plant growth fig 5 as the larger plant canopies prevented solar radiation from reaching the soil surface zhou et al 2009 and decreasing the warming effect of the mulch gan et al 2013 liu et al 2009 mo et al 2018a reported greater differences in soil temperatures between mulched and unmulched treatments with crop growth than the current study which could be due to different plant canopy structures and planting methods 4 3 crop growth plant height and ground diameter are important plant growth parameters affecting crop yields freeman et al 2007 wang et al 2020 as found in our study kiboi et al 2019 reported that organic biomaterial significantly increased leaf area index and plant height due to enhanced soil water status relative to traditional fertilization biomaterial amendments can accelerate plant growth and enhance dry matter accumulation thereby increasing crop yield and wue chen et al 2012 maddonni and otegui 1996 some studies have shown that ridge furrow mulching significantly increased topsoil water content improved soil thermal condition and increased crop biomass and grain yields liu et al 2010 steinmetz et al 2016 in our study the rm and fmba treatments increased plant height and ground diameter in the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons compared with the fm treatment with no significant differences during most of the growth stages fig 6 ridge furrow mulching treatments can increase crop growth and development due to improved soil water and temperature states relative to the fm treatment mo et al 2018a zhao et al 2012 a previous study reported that biomaterial amendment applications could increase plant height and leaf area by enhancing soil water content hu et al 2019 in most cases plant growth parameters did not significantly differ among the rm fmba and fm treatments likely due to the non significant soil water conditions among treatments compared with fm the rmba treatment significantly increased plant height and ground diameter due to the more favorable soil hydrothermal environment zhao et al 2014a plant height and ground diameter declined during the later growth period july august which could be due to variations in meteorological factors or crop physiology wang et al 2020 this phenomenon of estivation is consistent with the finding of su et al 2004 the distribution of crop root systems is important for building efficient and water saving agricultural management measures ali et al 2018 root length density can affect water and nutrient absorption by plants and indirectly determine canopy development and final yield jia et al 2018 yang et al 2004 biomaterial amendments can accelerate root growth and development by improving soil physical chemical and microbial properties zhao et al 2009 the ridge furrow mulching system can improve root parameters and distribution patterns relative to conventional flat planting xu et al 2016 in our study the rmba treatment significantly enhanced rld at the 0 40 cm soil depth compared to fm due to the more suitable soil environment i e higher swc and soil temperature which increased water and nutrient uptake by roots and promoted plant growth ali et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 there were no significant differences in rld at the 40 120 cm soil depth among the treatments fig 7 compared with the fm treatment the rm and fmba treatments also increased rld within the 0 120 cm soil layer due to increased soil water content in root zones but the differences were not significant the wolfberry root system was mainly concentrated in the 0 60 cm depth as reported by zhang et al 2016 roots tend to penetrate areas with better water and nutrient conditions and usually decrease with increasing soil depth song et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 rooting depth is also affected by local meteorological conditions soil texture and agricultural management practices clark et al 2003 4 4 wolfberry yield wue and quality for many agricultural researchers in arid and semi arid areas it is important to improve crop production and wue deng et al 2006 soil amendments can improve soil properties by increasing soil porosity and soil hydraulic conductivity and enhance soil water retention thus increasing aboveground biomass and grain yield laird et al 2010 zhao et al 2014b ridge furrow mulching increases rainwater conservation reduces soil evaporation and eventually improves final yield and wue mo et al 2018b zhou et al 2009 in the present study the biomaterial amendment significantly affected wue in 2018 and wolfberry diameter 100 berry weight yield and wue in 2019 table 4 ridge furrow planting significantly affected 100 berry weight yield and wue in 2018 and 2019 the effects of the biomaterial amendment varied between the two years which could be due to 1 the long lasting positive effects of soil amendments on soil environment and crop yields increasing gradually with increasing experimental year major et al 2010 wang et al 2017 thus the biomaterial amendment may have had more significant effects on yield components and wue in 2019 than that in 2018 due to the improved soil physical and hydraulic properties e g enhanced soil water retention capacity and decreased soil bulk density over time 2 the slow release rate of available nutrients from biomaterial amendments which may not significantly affect crop growth and yields in the first season but significantly improve root growth crop yields and resource use efficiency in the following season kiboi et al 2019 3 decompositions of biomaterial amendments are highly related to soil water condition turmel et al 2015 higher soil water content and storage in the 2019 growing season could have increased the biomaterial amendment decomposition rate and improved soil microbial activity thereby having greater effects on wolfberry characteristics yield and wue in 2019 than 2018 in contrast compared with flat planting ridge furrow mulching can effectively increase rainwater harvesting efficiency regulate soil hydrothermal status and improve plant growth in the first season thus significantly affecting wolfberry yield and wue in both growing seasons zhang et al 2019 the rmba rm and fmba treatments increased mean yield and wue by 23 0 and 28 6 17 1 and 18 9 and 13 5 and 14 9 respectively relative to the fm treatment yield characteristics such as wolfberry diameter wolfberry length and 100 berry weight also increased in these treatments compared to the fm treatment the rmba treatment produced the highest wolfberry yield yield components and wue in both years which was attributed to more optimal soil hydrothermal conditions than those in the fm treatment the improved soil environment enhanced plant growth and biomass accumulation thus increasing crop yield and wue gao et al 2014 mo et al 2018a biomaterial amendments can release nutrients slowly into soil and fully meet crop needs during critical growth periods adediran et al 2005 the improved water and heat status in the rmba treatment would increase soil nutrient especially nitrogen and fertilizer utilization efficiencies thereby promoting resource absorption capacity and crop yield gan et al 2013 zhang et al 2020b in our study all treatments in 2018 had lower wolfberry yields than 2019 table 4 despite similar rainfall plus irrigation amounts 313 8 mm in 2018 325 4 mm in 2019 this result could be due to the higher soil water content and storage during early growth in all treatments in 2019 than 2018 fig 4 zhang et al 2014 reported that high swc at sowing significantly improved grain yield and wue in northwest china similarly jiang et al 2018 reported that higher sws at early growth stages played an important role in crop production mitigating water stress during the maize growing season the reason for this result could be that crop yields were severely limited by irregular soil water availability and ineffective rainwater management rather than the amount of water supply during the whole growing season jiang et al 2018 zhu et al 2015 drought stress during early growth can affect plant dry matter accumulation and physiological characteristics thereby limiting crop production liu et al 2009 wolfberry growth and development were restricted by water stress at early growth stages in the qaidam basin of china reducing final crop yields and water use efficiency wang et al 2020 higher soil water content and storage during early growth in 2019 could help mitigate the negative effects during drought periods optimize crop growth and thus increase wolfberry production compared with 2018 the higher wue in the rmba treatment was directly related to the increased crop yield and lower et compared with the fm treatment table 4 the mechanisms responsible for increasing wue were mainly the improved plant transpiration and reduced non productive soil evaporation which promoted plant growth and yield li et al 2018b 2015 geographical location soil texture weather conditions and management practices have significant effects on berry quality orhan et al 2006 application of soil amendments can increase fruit quality and nutrient elements compared to chemical fertilizer carey et al 2009 stojanov et al 2019 biomaterial amendments can significantly improve soil physio chemical properties and microbial activity and increase soil humic substances and various nutrients which are beneficial for fruit quality nardi et al 2002 zhang et al 2020a in addition the ridge furrow mulching system can improve grain yield and quality by increasing n mineralization and nitrification rate and enhancing enzyme activity due to the improved soil environment li et al 2017a in the current study the biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow planting treatments had significant positive effects on berry quality especially in the rmba treatment which significantly increased ts vitamin c and protein and reduced ta contents relative to the fm treatment table 5 the rmba treatment also increased ts vitamin c and protein and reduced ta compared with the rm and fmba treatments indicating its superior ability to improve berry quality the ssc did not differ between treatments which may be because the taste compound was largely affected by growing season rather than fertilizer applications alleyne and clark 1997 economic profitability is an important driving factor for local farmers to accept innovative farming practices li et al 2019 in our study the input values mainly included the costs of labor 1666 7 rmb yuan ha 1 ridge furrow construction 666 7 rmb yuan ha 1 chemical fertilizer 2085 1 rmb yuan ha 1 biomaterial amendment 4666 7 rmb yuan ha 1 irrigation water 222 6 rmb yuan ha 1 and plastic film 500 0 rmb yuan ha 1 the output value in this study was wolfberry yield value and the price per unit was 50 rmb yuan per kg dry weight according to the cost benefit analysis the ridge furrow mulching treatments improved the economic benefit of crop production compared with the fm treatment the net income in each treatment was ranked rmba rm fmba fm across two growing seasons compared with the fm treatment the rmba rm and fmba treatments increased net income by 24 1 20 6 and 0 7 respectively in our two year study however net income in the fmba treatment decreased by 11 6 relative to the fm treatment in 2018 mainly due to the high cost in the biomaterial amendment and no significant yield difference despite the increased inputs the rmba treatment had the highest net economic profit due to its higher crop yield than the other treatments therefore we recommend the rmba treatment for improving crop yields and income of farmers in the dry and cold regions of the tibetan plateau 5 conclusion in the qaidam basin of china the biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow mulching treatments significantly increased soil water content topsoil temperature 0 10 cm and plant growth in both growing seasons plant height and ground diameter increased significantly in the ridge furrow mulching treatments relative to the fm treatment especially in the rmba treatment the rmba treatment also significantly increased rld in the 0 40 cm soil layer enhancing crop water and nutrient absorption ability both the biomaterial amendment and ridge furrow mulching significantly affected wolfberry yield wue and berry quality with the rmba treatment performing the best due to its superior soil hydrothermal conditions and various soil nutrients the rmba treatment also had the highest economic benefit and could be widely accepted and adopted by local farmers in this region we recommend the rmba treatment as an effective and promising planting pattern for improving crop growth and yields in dry and cold agricultural areas however further research is needed to evaluate whether the soil surface does not need to be mulched with plastic film after the biomaterial amendment application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
