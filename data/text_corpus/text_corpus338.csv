1690,the use of ethanol in alternative fuels has led to contamination of groundwater with high concentrations of this easily biodegradable organic compound previous laboratory and field studies have shown vigorous biodegradation of ethanol plumes with prevalence of reducing conditions and methanogenesis the objective of this study was to further our understanding of the dynamic biogeochemistry processes especially dissolved gas production that may occur in developing and aging plume cores at sites with ethanol or other organic contamination of groundwater the experiment performed involved highly detailed spatial and temporal monitoring of ethanol biodegradation in a 2 dimensional 175cm high 525cm long sand aquifer tank for 330days with a vertical shift in plume position and increased nutrient inputs occurring at day 100 rapid onset of fermentation denitrification sulphate reduction and iron iii reduction occurred following dissolved ethanol addition with the eventual widespread development of methanogenesis the detailed observations also demonstrate a redox zonation that supports the plume fringe concept secondary reactions resulting from a changing moving plume and time lags for the various biodegradation processes additional highlights include i the highest dissolved h2 concentrations yet reported for groundwater possibly linked to vigorous fermentation in the absence of common terminal electron acceptors i e dissolved oxygen nitrate and sulphate and iron iii minerals and methanogenesis ii evidence of phosphorus nutrient limitation which stalled ethanol biodegradation and perhaps delayed the onset of methanogenesis and iii the occurrence of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium which has not been reported for ethanol biodegradation to date keywords groundwater natural attenuation dissolved gases gasohol organic contaminants 1 introduction petroleum fuel spills represent a long term supply of toxic organic contaminants to groundwater resources wiedemeier et al 1999 raising public concerns over drinking water supplies and the aquatic ecosystem health of receiving surface waters the addition of ethanol to gasoline to serve as a fuel oxygenate typical blends 10 ethanol to gasoline by volume has become common practice in north and south america powers et al 2001 in part because ethanol is a non toxic renewable biomass based resource unfortunately with the widespread adoption of these alternative fuels numerous inadvertent releases of both denatured ethanol 95 ethanol by volume e g spalding et al 2011 and blended fuels as noted by corseuil et al 1998 have occurred during their production handling and storage the concern for ethanol contamination of groundwater from such releases stems primarily from secondary impacts related to its biodegradation in the subsurface for instance preferential biodegradation of ethanol may limit the degradation of more toxic petroleum compounds such as benzene while also boosting their solubility in groundwater via cosolvency e g corseuil et al 1998 mackay et al 2006 groundwater geochemistry changes associated with ethanol biodegradation may also cause the release of sediment associated compounds such as arsenic and various metals e g ziegler et al 2015 that may then impair groundwater quality finally explosion hazards from methane produced by the intensive biodegradation of ethanol are also a public safety concern e g spalding et al 2011 ma et al 2012 natural attenuation including biodegradation of organic contaminant plumes in groundwater has been abundantly studied over the past several decades from landfill leachate plumes e g baedecker and back 1979 cherry et al 1979 lyngkilde and christensen 1992 van breukelen and griffioen 2004 to petroleum hydrocarbons e g baedecker et al 1993 cozzarelli et al 1999 anneser et al 2008 and chlorinated solvents e g lendvay et al 1998 chapelle and bradley 1998 this has contributed to the development of the redox zonation concept as described by christensen et al 2000 and more recently the plume fringe concept as described by meckenstock et al 2015 and brought about recognition of the complexity of mass transfer and microbial consortia relationships occurring at the sub plume scale especially in mixing zones meckenstock et al 2015 however there still remains a generally poor understanding of the internal functioning of anaerobic plume cores as well as the dynamics in attenuation processes caused by changing flow and groundwater chemistry conditions meckenstock et al 2015 ethanol as a readily biodegradable compound available at high dissolved concentrations in affected groundwater powers et al 2001 may result in more vigorous natural attenuation this may lead to substantially more biogenic gas production in the plume core and the possibility of differences in the spatial temporal biogeochemistry redox patterns than occurs for plumes of petroleum hydrocarbons or other organic compounds indeed numerous studies have shown the prevalence of reducing conditions and methanogenesis with accumulations of acetate and other volatile fatty acids vfa driven by high ethanol content from groundwater contaminated by denatured ethanol or blended fuels in lab columns e g corseuil et al 1998 nelson et al 2010 and pilot scale laboratory tank experiments capiro et al 2007 ma et al 2011 and at spill sites spalding et al 2011 and experimental release field sites mackay et al 2006 corseuil et al 2011 freitas and barker 2013 methane transfer to the vadose zone above a plume has also been reported e g rasa et al 2013 ma et al 2012 sihota et al 2013 however the associated dissolved and trapped gas behavior within the plume has not received much attention thus far in this study the biodegradation processes that may develop in an anaerobic unconfined sand aquifer following groundwater contamination with dissolved ethanol were simulated at a field representative scale the experiment was implemented in a highly instrumented two dimensional 175cm high 525cm long pilot scale laboratory tank filled with uniform sand dissolved ethanol along with low concentrations of two petroleum compounds methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and toluene was continuously injected into the synthetic aquifer for 330days temporal and spatial monitoring within the tank comprised aqueous geochemistry including dissolved gases and trapped gas contents and was more detailed than previously performed to date and as called for by meckenstock et al 2015 the resulting conditions were representative of a developing and aging plume core with substantial bioavailable ethanol mass in addition several changes occurred in the midst of the experiment first the nutrient load to the groundwater affecting inflowing nitrate and phosphate concentrations was increased on day 93 and second an unintentional occurrence between days 126 and 147 was a shift in the vertical positioning of the ethanol input thus this study may also provide broader insights into the dynamics of natural attenuation mechanisms subject to changes in groundwater flow and background biogeochemistry which will be relevant to plumes of other organic contaminants in this manuscript the focus is on the spatial and temporal patterns in redox geochemistry that developed from the ethanol biodegradation processes the fate of the two petroleum compounds will not be discussed in detail here continual monitoring of dissolved gas pressure changes during this experiment have been reported already roy et al 2017 while the resultant biogenic gas production and trapped gas dynamics will be addressed in a subsequent manuscript 2 methods the pilot scale synthetic aquifer consisted of 36 5metrictonnes of m49 medium silica sand opta minerals in a stainless steel tank 600cm long 240cm wide 180cm deep fig 1 and fig s1 located at the canada centre for inland waters in burlington on canada the sand was packed damp in 5 cm lifts achieving an overall average porosity of 38 the tank was divided lengthwise into three separate lanes each 80cm wide with an open reservoir or head tank ht 80cm wide 75cm long located at one end and separated from the sand packed aquifer by a steel perforated plate affixed with geotextile nilex only one lane was used in this study lane 3 fig s1a which was packed to be homogeneous instrumentation and wells installed during packing are described below the tank was wetted using de chlorinated tap water inoculated with a microbial community from a field site with previous ethanol contamination this entrapped a residual gas phase which was partly dissolved in the experiment of mcleod et al 2015 final position of the water table was established 5cm below the sand surface with the capillary fringe extending to the sand surface further details on sand properties and packing and inoculation procedures are provided in supporting information simulated groundwater for this experiment was composed of de chlorinated tap water amended with nh4no3 and k2hpo4 for nutrient supply at 310μm and 70μm respectively up to day 93 after which these concentrations were doubled it was gravity fed into the ht which was equipped with a brass float valve to maintain the up gradient constant head boundary condition groundwater was removed at the end of the lane 520cm from the ht fig 1 and fig s1 from one fully screened 4 inch pvc withdrawal well ww a constant withdrawal pump rate was applied to maintain an average linear groundwater velocity of 21cm day which corresponds to a pore volume pv sand filled section 2770l passed every 25 4days approximately an ethanol mixture stock solution was prepared in 23 0l glass bottles every second day using the simulated groundwater and high purity 99 chemical grades of ethanol commercial alcohols methyl tert butyl ether mtbe sigma aldrich and toluene fisher chemical at concentrations of 89 900 2350 and 2250μm respectively ethanol was added as the primary organic substrate whereas mtbe and toluene were added at significantly lower concentrations the dissolved plume was created by adding the ethanol mixture to three fully screened 4 inch diameter pvc injection wells iws installed as a fence across the lane 30cm down gradient of the ht fig 1 and fig s1 to start the experiment each iw was spiked with a single concentrated dose of the ethanol mixture and an inorganic tracer kbr to produce a step wise rather than gradual increase in concentrations subsequently the ethanol mixture was added to each iw at a rate of 2 3 0 3ml min and was thoroughly mixed within the well via continuous and rapid internal circulation note that the ethanol concentration in the iw was always 0 6 by volume 4730mg l thus avoiding any drastic changes in the viscosity density or interfacial tension of the aqueous phase antonella and leij 2012 the ethanol mixture was added to the tank from august 17 2012 day 0 pv 0 0 to july 12 2013 day 330 pv 13 0 there was a small accidental spill of the ethanol mixture into the ht on day 103 an experiment timeline is shown in fig 2 thirty in situ groundwater samplers each consisting of a 3 inch stainless steel 40 μm porous cup chand eisenmann metallurgical were embedded horizontally in the sand within the middle of the lane during packing each was connected to stainless steel tubing that extended to surface along the tank wall and had a dedicated 30 ml hdpe syringe for purging and sampling these samplers were distributed at six vertical depths 15 45 75 105 135 and 165cm below the sand surface and along five sampling arrays located 70 155 205 320 and 445cm from the ht 0cm fig 1 groundwater samples were collected on july 11 2012 day 37 pv 1 5 to characterize the initial background conditions prior to ethanol addition and then monthly to bimonthly throughout the experiment these were analyzed for dissolved ethanol ammonium anions including nitrate and phosphate major cations including iron and manganese and volatile fatty acids vfas semi quantitative results only at the canada centre for inland waters details regarding sample preservation storage and analytical methods including detection limits are provided in the supporting information table s2 spatial interpolations of geochemical data between sampling locations was performed by a linear triangulation grid method which honors the data exactly using surfer software golden software inc three 4 inch diameter pvc monitoring wells mws screened over two depth intervals were located along the flow path in the middle of the lane at 115 250 and 375cm from the ht fig 1 and fig s1 these wells hosted two sets of luminescent dissolved oxygen do probes hach company total dissolved gas pressure p tdg probes point four systems and duplicate passive gas samplers pgs custom made at two depths approximately 60cm upper and 130cm lower below the sand surface fig 1 the same configuration of equipment was also placed in the ht upper and lower halves of the mws were isolated by thin custom rubber baffles the pgs were assembled using gas tight glass syringes 500μl vici valco instruments and 8 5cm sections of gas permeable silicone tubing id 1 8 as described by spalding and watson 2006 they were used to collect gas in equilibrium with the groundwater passing the

results and discussion 3 1 input conditions composition of the simulated groundwater mimicked that of a shallow sandy aquifer under predominantly anaerobic conditions and with nutrient impacts the microbial oxidation of supplied nh4 to no3 eq 1 in table 1 established and maintained low do to anaerobic groundwater conditions in the ht and aquifer throughout the majority of the experiment especially following the nutrient increase refer to supporting information for further details with measured do largely 60μm 2 0mg l fig s2 the average concentrations in the ht of prime electron acceptors nitrate no3 and sulphate so4 2 were approximately 530 and 275μm 32 9 and 26 5mg l respectively the nitrate concentrations increased to 740μm on day 93 with the increased nutrient dosing dissolved phosphate po4 3 concentrations in the ht averaged 50 4 8mg l and 125μm 11 8mg l before and after day 93 respectively note that these dissolved no3 and po4 3 concentrations exceed common background levels of un impacted e g by agricultural or wastewater inputs groundwater systems 4 0 and 0 03mg l respectively dubrovsky et al 2010 temporal changes in the influx of groundwater nutrients and or electron acceptors at a contaminated site may result from variation in their supply from anthropogenic sources or their addition for remediation purposes as well as changes in groundwater flow conditions the measured concentrations of ethanol mtbe and toluene within the iws were 1 8 to 3 3 times higher than anticipated and were variable in time fig 2 similar concentrations and temporal trends between the three iws as apparent in low standard deviations in fig 2 indicate that all iws were similarly affected the build up of ethanol mass within the iws must have resulted from lower flows through the iws which indicates reduced well efficiency characteristic of clogging of the well screens and or the surrounding sand due to biofilm growth and or microbial gas production see baveye et al 1998 and references therein this clogging was apparently rapid i e within the first 10days given that the measured concentrations deviated from those expected immediately after the introductory ethanol spike in addition it appears that substantial spatial vertical and temporal variation in the clogging occurred which led to a dramatic change in the spatial distribution of ethanol input to the aquifer during early times stage 1 up to day 126 the dissolved ethanol source was dominantly shallow with concentrations gradually decreasing with depth whereas at later times stage 2 days 147 the source was predominantly deep fig 3a the vertical location of the plume shifted between these two stages which will be called the transition period days 126 147 this pattern is corroborated by several inorganic tracer tests explained in supporting information fig s3 we can only speculate as to the cause s of the change in clogging see supporting information however while not originally planned the resultant spatially and temporally variable contaminant plume configurations observed here do occur at real contaminated sites due to heterogeneous source zone morphologies water table fluctuations changes in groundwater flow directions and remediation activities wilson et al 2004 and references therein here they provided an opportunity to investigate how they might affect the geochemical patterns of an ethanol plume undergoing biodegradation despite the influence of clogging the average iw ethanol concentration of 55 600μm 2560mg l is consistent with measurements of groundwater impacted by accidental releases of high ethanol blended fuels and denatured ethanol capiro et al 2007 corseuil et al 2011 spalding et al 2011 freitas and barker 2013 also the maximum concentration was substantially lower than reported toxicity levels for microbes i e concentrations 5 1 12 7 by volume or 40 000 100 000mg l ingram and buttke 1984 nelson et al 2010 note that transverse mixing across the lane width i e between and beyond the widths of the three iw with an iw fence width lane width ratio 0 35 fig s4 was expected to reduce these concentrations slightly with transport along the aquifer discussed further in supporting information 3 2 overview of ethanol biodegradation there are several lines of evidence indicating that ethanol was being degraded within the synthetic aquifer throughout the experiment first ethanol concentrations consistently declined more than an order of magnitude along the length of the tank fig 3a to levels well below that predicted to occur from lateral dispersion from the iws to the full width of the aquifer fig s4 secondly degradation products e g volatile fatty acids vfas were produced and related changes in biogeochemistry were observed fig 3 figs s5 and s6 at all sampling dates these will be discussed in detail below and finally there were associated increases in trapped gas contents within the aquifer for the majority of the experiment not shown the focus of a subsequent manuscript indicating the production of biogenic gases the onset of ethanol degradation was rapid with the above noted changes occurring by the first groundwater sampling date day 42 fig s5 and suggested within the first week by dissolved gas pressure measurements refer to fig 2 in roy et al 2017 within both stages 1 and 2 the distribution of ethanol concentrations remained fairly similar over time suggesting a plume in near steady state with such steady state conditions established within several weeks after initial ethanol injection and following the transition period throughout both stages of the experiment the rate of ethanol degradation was high enough limit the plume largely to 5m length of the tank such vigorous ethanol degradation is consistent with many previous observations e g mackay et al 2006 zhang et al 2006 corseuil et al 2011 a series of microbially mediated reactions contributed to ethanol degradation in this experiment prior to when the nutrient concentrations were doubled on day 93 input do concentrations were low but non negligible fig s2 thus any remaining o2 that reached the iws would have been quickly utilized for ethanol oxidation do concentrations were negligible at mw1 fig s2 however this would account for only 55μm of ethanol based on the maximum do concentrations measured in the ht eq 2 in table 1 suggesting the vast majority of ethanol was degraded under anaerobic conditions the spatial distribution of the redox indicators documenting the remaining anaerobic reactions are shown for 6 select dates in fig 3 with the complete data set 13 dates provided in figs s5 and s6 first the fermentative degradation of ethanol e g eq 8 in table 1 is indicated by increases in dissolved h2 levels fig 3h especially day 67 and in concentrations of vfas fig 3b from initial i e day 37 and input i e ht conditions descriptions of propionate and butyrate formation from ethanol fermentation with balanced chemical reactions are provided by alvarez and hunt 1999 it is possible that some of the vfa production observed here was derived from mtbe and or toluene degradation though these were at much lower concentrations than ethanol upon injection maximum concentrations of vfas acetate propionate and butyrate were 3140μm 185 6mg l 650μm 47 3mg l and 1340μm 122 9mg l respectively which are consistent with values previously reported in dissolved ethanol plumes for both laboratory e g nelson et al 2010 ma et al 2011 and field conditions e g mackay et al 2006 corseuil et al 2011 the production of vfas across the full depth of the tank during stage 1 indicates that some ethanol or petroleum compound not shown was entering the deeper portion of the aquifer despite their low concentrations measured at depth at the first sampling array an observed initial lag in butyrate production fig s6e is not unexpected because acetate is a required precursor for butyrate formation alvarez and hunt 1999 ma et al 2011 the vfas were less abundant at shallow depths during stage 2 suggesting much reduced ethanol and hydrocarbon input there the fact that h2 gas was never detected in the ht above trace levels except for day 109 following a small accidental spill of ethanol into the ht suggests there were no major additional sources of h2 gas beyond fermentation such as from corrosion of the stainless steel tank bjerg et al 1997 the main terminal electron accepting processes coupled to ethanol oxidation taking place during this experiment included denitrification sulphate reduction and likely iron iii reduction with trace iron oxide minerals in the aquifer sand 1 0μmol g table s1 the no3 added to and produced in via nh4 oxidation recall input conditions the source water or ht was rapidly consumed within the aquifer fig 3c mostly utilized by the first sampling array 70cm distant except in a few areas with low ethanol inputs i e top of aquifer in stage 2 nitrate attenuation along with the production of intermediate reaction product nitrite no2 fig 3d suggests that ethanol was degraded via heterotrophic denitrification eq 4 in table 1 resulting in n2 gas production this was not apparent in the pgs data fig 3h because n2 was already abundant in the source water likewise sulphate reduction e g eq 7 in table 1 was also assumed given the decreases in so4 2 relative to its concentration in the source water fig 3g with production of h2s noted by its characteristic smell but not measured the distribution of so4 2 concentration was broadly similar to that of no3 throughout the experiment with substantial losses generally by the first sampling array except where ethanol inputs were low concentrations of dissolved fe 2 were below the detection limit in the source water and ht during the experiment except for a short period following the ethanol spill in the ht day 103 as well as throughout the aquifer prior to the experiment following ethanol contamination fe 2 concentrations increased within the aquifer fig 3f reaching a maximum concentration of 730μm 40 6mg l the resultant fe 2 plume shallow during stage 1 and then at greater depths in stage 2 propagated down gradient over time leaving behind an ever increasing fe 2 free 50μm zone this encompassed the entire tank by the end of the experiment i e after 13 pvs this likely reflects the exhaustion of biologically available including surface exposed mineral phase iron of the sand which would be expected to be less than the total iron mineral phase an fe mass balance suggests 30 of the total mineral phase iron was removed in the dissolved phase this pattern of fe 2 production is suggestive of iron iii reduction of ethanol eq 6a in table 1 though the iron iii reduction of h2s eq 6b in table 1 hunter et al 1998 is likely contributing especially in areas above or below the ethanol plume although these two reactions cannot be readily distinguished here the data show some areas of coincident decreasing ethanol and increasing fe 2 concentrations e g day 109 top of 3rd sampling array or day 187 bottom of 3rd sampling array fig 3 which provides evidence of the former reaction finally the detection of dissolved methane throughout the aquifer fig 3h though delayed through the first part of stage 1 indicates that methanogenesis associated with ethanol degradation was also occurring eq 9 in table 1 following its first detection ch4 levels steadily increased with maximum concentrations reaching 850μm 13 6mg l on day 300 concentrations of ch4 of this same order of magnitude have been reported for ethanol impacted sites e g spalding et al 2011 elevated methane at shallow depths during stage 2 when the ethanol plume was predominantly deep may reflect upward gas phase mobilization evidence for this is presented in a subsequent manuscript moreover these results suggest an increasingly methanogenic dominated microbial community within the synthetic aquifer at later times as observed in numerous studies monitoring microbial population shifts in response to ethanol contamination e g capiro et al 2008 nelson et al 2010 ma et al 2013 2015 the observed sequence of redox biogeochemistry along the groundwater flow path fig 3 and fig s5 fits well the plume fringe concept meckenstock et al 2015 the up gradient fringe close to the source zone experienced rapid removal of no3 by denitrification and so4 2 by sulphate reduction in areas where ethanol inputs were high down gradient within the plume core iron iii reduction early on and methanogenesis later then dominated no fringe existed at the down gradient edge of the plume where ethanol concentrations declined below 1000μm stage 2 and methanogenic conditions were maintained given the closed system plume removal by the ww with no chance for longitudinal dispersion with un impacted groundwater at the lateral edge of the ethanol plume i e top of aquifer in stage 2 no3 and so4 2 persisted further along the flow path with so4 2 concentrations extending to greater depth toward the plume core this general description of the ethanol biodegradation processes observed in this experiment fits well with previous observations from both large scale lab experiments and field sites in the following sections we take a more detailed look at different parts of the experimental observations with the goal of producing new or improved insight into the complexity of the biogeochemical processes associated with biodegradation of groundwater plumes of ethanol or organic contaminants in general 3 3 alternate ethanol biodegradation reaction ammonium concentrations increased in the aquifer fig 3e following the increase in nutrient loading day 93 indicating the incomplete transformation of added nh4 to no3 in the ht eq 1 in table 1 whereas prior to this nh4 was nearly completely transformed in the ht with concentrations 10μm later in stage 2 e g day 187 ammonium concentrations fig 3e became strongly elevated in the core of the ethanol plume fig 3a to values up to 4 times its concentration in the ht 140μm stage 2 given the concurrent decreases in ethanol no3 and no2 concentrations fig 3a c and d it is probable that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra eq 5 in table 1 was occurring tiedje et al 1982 dnra is performed by fermentative bacteria rivett et al 2008 and tends to be significant where the organic carbon to electron acceptor ratio is high i e c n ratios 3 5 tiedje et al 1982 yoon et al 2014 hardison et al 2015 in this experiment the initial c n ratios were 50 70 dnra has been reported at sites contaminated with organic rich wastewater e g bulger et al 1989 and sewage effluent e g smith et al 1991 and to a lesser extent for petroleum impacted aquifers e g cozzarelli et al 1999 schurmann et al 2003 considering these laboratory results and the highly labile nature of dissolved ethanol in groundwater dnra is likely to be a relevant degradation mechanism at denatured ethanol and blended fuel spill sites at which substantial ethanol reaches the water table e g spalding et al 2011 as well as a result this competitive reaction for oxidation of ethanol with dissolved nitrate has the potential to lower the heterotrophic denitrification of ethanol eq 4 in table 1 meaning less biogenic gas n2 production 3 4 delays in degradation ethanol degradation was well underway and apparently at a near steady state by the first sampling date day 42 fig s5 with evidence of fermentation denitrification sulphate reduction and likely iron iii reduction this indicates that the aquifer inoculation provided a diverse microbial consortium capable of degrading ethanol or able to quickly adapt and suggests that microbial numbers in general had reached a steady level the shift in vertical position of the ethanol plume occurred during the transition period between sampling days 126 and 147 i e shift occurred over 21days or less with no substantial expansion in the ethanol plume length fig 3a and fig s5 likewise there was no apparent lapse in the rapid depletion of no3 and so4 2 i e majority removed by the first sampling array fig 3c and g both observations suggest that the denitrifying and sulphate reducing members of the community were able to respond quickly to increases in ethanol concentration acetate concentrations fig s6c were higher on the first sampling date following the initial ethanol release i e day 42 than on subsequent sampling dates they also showed a slight rebound in concentrations during the transition period days 126 147 when deeper depths of the aquifer experienced an increase in ethanol concentrations acetate concentration reflects both production from ethanol degradation and subsequent syntrophic metabolite uptake nelson et al 2010 the rapid increase in acetate concentrations is consistent with reports of very minor acclimation periods associated with fermentative bacteria which are ubiquitous in groundwater systems wiedemeier et al 1999 rivett et al 2008 and references therein the subsequent decline then suggests a succeeding expansion and or adaptation of microbial organisms that can utilize the acetate including those that transform it into propionate and butyrate as concentrations of these compounds show a marked increase from day 42 to 67 figs s6d and s6e unlike the biodegradation processes described above methanogenesis showed a substantial lag phase with the first detections in a pgs on day 109 fig 3h acclimation periods for methanogens are not uncommon in laboratory experiments and or field studies including petroleum and ethanol fuel contaminated sites but are highly variable and site specific ranging from several days up to 5years e g baedecker et al 1993 nelson et al 2010 corseuil et al 2011 ma et al 2011 spalding et al 2011 these have been attributed in large part to slow growth from low initial numbers of methanogens which is likely in this experiment given their introduction via inoculation another possible contributing factor to the lag observed in this experiment is phosphorus limitation which will be discussed in a subsequent section finally there was apparently no dnra during stage 1 as there was no apparent increase in nh4 concentrations along the tank length or above that of the ht fig 3e and this despite having similar plume core conditions i e high ethanol concentrations fermentation producing vfa and h2 available no3 fig 3 as for its occurrence in stage 2 the reason for this is not clear but it may reflect a lag time for the microbial community to develop sufficient dnra capacity indeed after a 2 year continuous ethanol blend release in a laboratory tank the gene microarray results of ma et al 2015 showed a significant increase in the abundance of drna genes indicating that the metabolic potential for dnra activity may be enhanced following prolonged exposure to ethanol contamination which corroborates the findings of this study 3 5 extreme levels of dissolved hydrogen gas trace amounts of dissolved h2 commonly accumulate in biogeochemically active groundwater as its redox state becomes progressively more reducing wiedemeier et al 1999 and references therein during stage 1 of this experiment h2 concentrations determined from pgs composition fig 3h and measured p tdg not shown ranged from 2900 to 60 900nm with the highest values associated with mw1 these values are near or above the reported inhibitory limit 8000nm for fermentation based on laboratory experiments wiedemeier et al 1999 they are also to the best of our knowledge the highest yet reported in the scientific literature for biodegradation in groundwater although the measurement of h2 is not regularly performed at contaminated sites for comparison h2 concentrations measured at a denatured ethanol spill site didn t exceed 100nm spalding et al 2011 in that case though h2 monitoring did not begin until 5years after the spill long after methanogenesis was established as the predominant degradation pathway also the use of p tdg sensors and pgs in a controlled lab setting here may have provided a more accurate measure of dissolved gas concentrations than commonly measured in the field ryan et al 2015 to explain these extreme h2 concentrations we hypothesize that vigorous fermentation of high concentrations of ethanol sustained in the absence of on going terminal electron accepting processes i e denitrification sulphate reduction iron iii reduction and methanogenesis allowed for sustained h2 production and accumulation at early times as evidence the high dissolved ethanol loading led to the complete utilization of the entire electron acceptor pool no3 so4 2 fe 3 and presumably mn 4 in the area just down gradient of the first sampling array and the first traces of methane were only found there at the day 109 sampling fig 3 whereas the h2 concentrations were much lower in stage 2 after methanogenesis was established ranging from 800 to 10 300nm it is possible that h2 concentrations may have declined further to field reported values had the experimental duration been extended these results suggest there should be further investigation of the potential explosion hazards posed from h2 gas at ethanol spill sites especially where methanogenesis has not become established of concern is that h2 is nearly 2 times less soluble kh moll 1 kpa 1 at 25 c of 7 70 10 6 for h2 vs 1 37 10 5 for ch4 and has a broader explosion limit 4 75 for h2 vs 5 15 for ch4 by volume than ch4 3 6 phosphorus nutrient limitation the concentrations of po4 3 decreased with distance along the tank throughout the experiment likely due to microbial uptake during ethanol biodegradation mineral precipitation reactions with dissolved fe 2 and or sorption onto minerals e g iron sulphide during stage 1 before nutrient inputs were doubled the po4 3 concentrations declined with flow distance to negligible levels by 300cm down gradient of ht e g day 67 in fig 4 some evidence suggests that these areas experienced phosphorus p limitation effects on ethanol biodegradation reactions during stage 1 given that p is an inorganic macronutrient critical for biomass production during this early time ethanol concentrations were largely constant at flow distances 200cm down gradient of ht fig 3a suggesting a stalling of ethanol biodegradation concurrently the concentrations of total vfas dic and dissolved iron fig 3b s6f and 3f respectively did not change notably through this area of the tank iron oxide minerals were assuredly still present there given that their initial distribution within the synthetic aquifer was rather homogeneous meaning iron iii reduction should otherwise proceed further indeed this area produced fe 2 at later times e g day 109 fig 3f h2 production also appeared to stagnate as concentrations declined from mw1 with distance down gradient fig 3h these spatial geochemical trends suggest that both fermentation and iron iii reduction associated with the ethanol plume were inhibited in conjunction with p limitation following the increase in nutrient additions day 93 po4 3 concentrations became notably higher and remained non negligible in the tank through the transition period into stage 2 i e fig 4 day 109 onwards during these times ethanol concentrations tended to decline to a greater extent along the tank length with much lower concentrations than in stage 1 e g 20 000 to 5000μm on day 67 and 300 respectively in fig 3a the vfas particularly acetate see fig s6c dic and dissolved iron were also being produced further down gradient up to the last sampling array 445cm down gradient of ht at these times figs 3b s6f and 3f respectively this suggests that iron iii reduction and fermentation were no longer limited following the increase in po4 3 lastly it s interesting to note that the boost in po4 3 inputs also coincided with the sudden proliferation of methanogenic activity at the beginning of the transition period i e ch4 was first measured in pgs on day 109 fig 3h this may just be coincidental timing with the lag time for methanogenesis discussed previously but perhaps the elimination of p limitation on the methanogens also played a role these observations are suggestive of an important and dynamic impact of phosphorus nutrient limitation on the biodegradation of ethanol groundwater plumes this limitation may be enhanced for ethanol contamination compared to other organic plumes due to the high concentrations of labile carbon and resultant vigorous biodegradation 3 7 secondary redox reactions within a shifting plume during stage 2 when the ethanol plume was at greater depths in the aquifer fig 3a the concentration of so4 2 at shallow depths 75cm increased with flow distance especially in the latter half of the aquifer 150cm from ht to values above its source water concentration 280μm in ht fig 3g concurrent decreases in no3 and no2 concentrations were also observed fig 3c and d these changes are illustrated more clearly in fig 5 using data from the shallowest sampling locations 15cm depth and two sampling dates these observations are indicative of autotrophic denitrification in which denitrifying bacteria alternatively consume inorganic electron donors such as h2s fe 2 iron sulphide minerals and silicates to reduce no3 to n2 gas in the absence of significant labile organic contamination e g eqs 3a and 3b in table 1 refer to critical review by rivett et al 2008 in this case the reduced sulphur component is believed to have been created during stage 1 when sulphate driven reduction of ethanol was occurring in the upper portion of the aquifer tank the gaseous end product of sulphate reduction h2s dominant species at ph 6 5 though not directly monitored was clearly noted via its characteristic odour during sampling events and would have become a component in the residual gas phase mcleod 2015 alternately amorphous sulphur minerals may have been generated by the oxidation of h2s by iron hydroxide minerals of the sand it is also possible that fe 2 generated by iron iii reduction of ethanol reacted with h2s to precipitate iron sulphide minerals as previously observed at several petroleum contaminated sites e g baedecker et al 1993 cozzarelli et al 1999 vencelides et al 2007 the absence of a matching dissolved fe 2 plume here does not ensure the dominant electron donor was in fact h2s or amorphous sulphur minerals as fe 2 may have been subsequently oxidized by any remaining nitrate fig 5b rivett et al 2008 or mineralized with available po4 3 fig 4 robertson et al 1998 in either case the gaseous h2s and or sulphur minerals would have provided a pool of reduced sulphur for subsequent oxidation by nitrate and nitrite vencelides et al 2007 following the downward shift in the ethanol plume i e during stage 2 further evidence of this reaction is provided by the trends of peak so4 2 concentrations in this area declining over time during stage 2 while also slowly propagating down gradient with time fig 5 day 165 vs 229 presumably this was due to the ongoing depletion of the finite pool of reduced sulphur autotrophic denitrification has been extensively studied in groundwater systems un impacted by petroleum products where the alternative electron donors utilized were derived from naturally occurring minerals in the aquifer sediments e g jorgensen et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 and references therein here it represents a secondary redox process i e oxidation of reduced redox species formed by the primary redox reactions that arose at the plume fringe due to a shift in the location of the plume this shift exposed reduced species created in the plume core to oxidizing species in the background groundwater other applicable secondary redox processes for organic plumes may involve reoxidation of fe 2 mn 2 nh4 or ch4 e g hunter et al 1998 van breukelen and griffioen 2004 vencelides et al 2007 such secondary redox processes have largely been investigated at a single point in time at locations where primary reaction s have already diminished for example vencelides et al 2007 conducted forward and inverse geochemical modeling based on one set of aqueous and solid phase samples collected after 24years of napl source zone recession in order to evaluate the impact of secondary redox processes on the flux of dissolved electron acceptors into the current plume at a hydrocarbon contaminated site here however the full temporal evolution of the process from primary organic degradation and production of reduced redox species to consumption and subsequent depletion during secondary reactions is demonstrated overall these results demonstrate how reduced species in immobile phases such as biogenic gases e g h2s here within trapped gas and or minerals e g iron sulphides deposited on the aquifer solids that are produced via ethanol biodegradation in the core of the plume can subsequently fuel secondary redox processes e g autotrophic denitrification in this study when the plume shifts its location this process should be as applicable to lateral shifts in a plume e g schirmer et al 2001 as for the vertical shift shown here as well as in the recovery period following ethanol source exhaustion these secondary redox reactions may also apply to small fluctuations in location of the plume fringe derived from variations in the site groundwater flow field van breukelen and griffioen 2004 which could be further enhanced by permeability changes associated with gas production and mineral precipitation in the ethanol plume 4 conclusions this study focused on temporally and spatially detailed monitoring of groundwater biogeochemistry including dissolved gas composition of a 330 day pilot scale simulation of an ethanol plume undergoing biodegradation in a synthetic sand aquifer it demonstrated the rapid development of fermentation denitrification sulphate reduction and iron iii reduction following the introduction of dissolved ethanol with the eventual widespread development of methanogenesis a vertical shift in the core of the ethanol plume occurred after 100days and is attributed to bio and gas clogging immobile mineral and gas phase species produced within the plume core initially then supported secondary reactions outside of the new ethanol plume position these observations corroborate the general understanding of major processes driving biodegradation of ethanol and other organic contaminants in groundwater systems that has been derived from past large scale lab and field studies they also provide additional and detailed data spatial and temporal on redox zonation i e supporting the plume fringe concept secondary reactions with a changing shifting plume and time lags for the various biodegradation processes under field representative conditions this experiment also captured some potential additional complexity in the evolution of biogeochemistry associated with biodegradation of a substantial mass of highly labile organic compounds such as for an ethanol plume note that following an unblended petroleum spill groundwater hydrocarbon concentrations may reach 100mg l meckenstock et al 2015 though much of this may not be readily biodegradable in contrast ethanol concentrations reached at least 10 times that concentration in this study while still being within the range reported for ethanol contaminated groundwater of other studies capiro et al 2007 corseuil et al 2011 spalding et al 2011 freitas and barker 2013 during this experiment the highest dissolved h2 concentrations yet reported for groundwater were observed we hypothesize that this resulted from vigorous fermentation in an area where common terminal electron accepting processes i e aerobic oxidation denitrification sulphate reduction iron iii reduction were absent because dissolved oxygen nitrate and sulphate and iron iii minerals were exhausted by up gradient reactions with ethanol and methanogenesis had not yet started such conditions might be met in the field for the core of an ethanol plume at early times before methanogens have established themselves such high h2 production even if for limited duration may be a safety concern given explosion hazards and vapour intrusion risks this may necessitate new or modified approaches to ethanol site remediation further investigation of this h2 production is warranted also evidence of phosphorus p nutrient limitation was found which stalled ethanol biodegradation via fermentation and iron iii reduction in this case and perhaps even delayed the onset of methanogenesis despite a substantial phosphate loading to the simulated groundwater phosphate concentrations dropped to negligible levels likely as a result of microbial uptake and or mineral precipitation sorption reactions finally the onset of dnra eq 5 in table 1 which has not been reported for ethanol biodegradation to date was observed partway through this experiment because this is a competitive reaction to heterotrophic denitrification of ethanol eq 4 in table 1 which oxidizes ethanol using dissolved nitrate to ammonium it has the potential to reduce biogenic gas i e n2 production meanwhile the resulting ammonium may contribute to euthrophication and fish toxicity issues where such groundwater discharges to surface waters it is anticipated that this set of observations may provide some improved and or new insights into the

1690,the use of ethanol in alternative fuels has led to contamination of groundwater with high concentrations of this easily biodegradable organic compound previous laboratory and field studies have shown vigorous biodegradation of ethanol plumes with prevalence of reducing conditions and methanogenesis the objective of this study was to further our understanding of the dynamic biogeochemistry processes especially dissolved gas production that may occur in developing and aging plume cores at sites with ethanol or other organic contamination of groundwater the experiment performed involved highly detailed spatial and temporal monitoring of ethanol biodegradation in a 2 dimensional 175cm high 525cm long sand aquifer tank for 330days with a vertical shift in plume position and increased nutrient inputs occurring at day 100 rapid onset of fermentation denitrification sulphate reduction and iron iii reduction occurred following dissolved ethanol addition with the eventual widespread development of methanogenesis the detailed observations also demonstrate a redox zonation that supports the plume fringe concept secondary reactions resulting from a changing moving plume and time lags for the various biodegradation processes additional highlights include i the highest dissolved h2 concentrations yet reported for groundwater possibly linked to vigorous fermentation in the absence of common terminal electron acceptors i e dissolved oxygen nitrate and sulphate and iron iii minerals and methanogenesis ii evidence of phosphorus nutrient limitation which stalled ethanol biodegradation and perhaps delayed the onset of methanogenesis and iii the occurrence of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium which has not been reported for ethanol biodegradation to date keywords groundwater natural attenuation dissolved gases gasohol organic contaminants 1 introduction petroleum fuel spills represent a long term supply of toxic organic contaminants to groundwater resources wiedemeier et al 1999 raising public concerns over drinking water supplies and the aquatic ecosystem health of receiving surface waters the addition of ethanol to gasoline to serve as a fuel oxygenate typical blends 10 ethanol to gasoline by volume has become common practice in north and south america powers et al 2001 in part because ethanol is a non toxic renewable biomass based resource unfortunately with the widespread adoption of these alternative fuels numerous inadvertent releases of both denatured ethanol 95 ethanol by volume e g spalding et al 2011 and blended fuels as noted by corseuil et al 1998 have occurred during their production handling and storage the concern for ethanol contamination of groundwater from such releases stems primarily from secondary impacts related to its biodegradation in the subsurface for instance preferential biodegradation of ethanol may limit the degradation of more toxic petroleum compounds such as benzene while also boosting their solubility in groundwater via cosolvency e g corseuil et al 1998 mackay et al 2006 groundwater geochemistry changes associated with ethanol biodegradation may also cause the release of sediment associated compounds such as arsenic and various metals e g ziegler et al 2015 that may then impair groundwater quality finally explosion hazards from methane produced by the intensive biodegradation of ethanol are also a public safety concern e g spalding et al 2011 ma et al 2012 natural attenuation including biodegradation of organic contaminant plumes in groundwater has been abundantly studied over the past several decades from landfill leachate plumes e g baedecker and back 1979 cherry et al 1979 lyngkilde and christensen 1992 van breukelen and griffioen 2004 to petroleum hydrocarbons e g baedecker et al 1993 cozzarelli et al 1999 anneser et al 2008 and chlorinated solvents e g lendvay et al 1998 chapelle and bradley 1998 this has contributed to the development of the redox zonation concept as described by christensen et al 2000 and more recently the plume fringe concept as described by meckenstock et al 2015 and brought about recognition of the complexity of mass transfer and microbial consortia relationships occurring at the sub plume scale especially in mixing zones meckenstock et al 2015 however there still remains a generally poor understanding of the internal functioning of anaerobic plume cores as well as the dynamics in attenuation processes caused by changing flow and groundwater chemistry conditions meckenstock et al 2015 ethanol as a readily biodegradable compound available at high dissolved concentrations in affected groundwater powers et al 2001 may result in more vigorous natural attenuation this may lead to substantially more biogenic gas production in the plume core and the possibility of differences in the spatial temporal biogeochemistry redox patterns than occurs for plumes of petroleum hydrocarbons or other organic compounds indeed numerous studies have shown the prevalence of reducing conditions and methanogenesis with accumulations of acetate and other volatile fatty acids vfa driven by high ethanol content from groundwater contaminated by denatured ethanol or blended fuels in lab columns e g corseuil et al 1998 nelson et al 2010 and pilot scale laboratory tank experiments capiro et al 2007 ma et al 2011 and at spill sites spalding et al 2011 and experimental release field sites mackay et al 2006 corseuil et al 2011 freitas and barker 2013 methane transfer to the vadose zone above a plume has also been reported e g rasa et al 2013 ma et al 2012 sihota et al 2013 however the associated dissolved and trapped gas behavior within the plume has not received much attention thus far in this study the biodegradation processes that may develop in an anaerobic unconfined sand aquifer following groundwater contamination with dissolved ethanol were simulated at a field representative scale the experiment was implemented in a highly instrumented two dimensional 175cm high 525cm long pilot scale laboratory tank filled with uniform sand dissolved ethanol along with low concentrations of two petroleum compounds methyl tert butyl ether mtbe and toluene was continuously injected into the synthetic aquifer for 330days temporal and spatial monitoring within the tank comprised aqueous geochemistry including dissolved gases and trapped gas contents and was more detailed than previously performed to date and as called for by meckenstock et al 2015 the resulting conditions were representative of a developing and aging plume core with substantial bioavailable ethanol mass in addition several changes occurred in the midst of the experiment first the nutrient load to the groundwater affecting inflowing nitrate and phosphate concentrations was increased on day 93 and second an unintentional occurrence between days 126 and 147 was a shift in the vertical positioning of the ethanol input thus this study may also provide broader insights into the dynamics of natural attenuation mechanisms subject to changes in groundwater flow and background biogeochemistry which will be relevant to plumes of other organic contaminants in this manuscript the focus is on the spatial and temporal patterns in redox geochemistry that developed from the ethanol biodegradation processes the fate of the two petroleum compounds will not be discussed in detail here continual monitoring of dissolved gas pressure changes during this experiment have been reported already roy et al 2017 while the resultant biogenic gas production and trapped gas dynamics will be addressed in a subsequent manuscript 2 methods the pilot scale synthetic aquifer consisted of 36 5metrictonnes of m49 medium silica sand opta minerals in a stainless steel tank 600cm long 240cm wide 180cm deep fig 1 and fig s1 located at the canada centre for inland waters in burlington on canada the sand was packed damp in 5 cm lifts achieving an overall average porosity of 38 the tank was divided lengthwise into three separate lanes each 80cm wide with an open reservoir or head tank ht 80cm wide 75cm long located at one end and separated from the sand packed aquifer by a steel perforated plate affixed with geotextile nilex only one lane was used in this study lane 3 fig s1a which was packed to be homogeneous instrumentation and wells installed during packing are described below the tank was wetted using de chlorinated tap water inoculated with a microbial community from a field site with previous ethanol contamination this entrapped a residual gas phase which was partly dissolved in the experiment of mcleod et al 2015 final position of the water table was established 5cm below the sand surface with the capillary fringe extending to the sand surface further details on sand properties and packing and inoculation procedures are provided in supporting information simulated groundwater for this experiment was composed of de chlorinated tap water amended with nh4no3 and k2hpo4 for nutrient supply at 310μm and 70μm respectively up to day 93 after which these concentrations were doubled it was gravity fed into the ht which was equipped with a brass float valve to maintain the up gradient constant head boundary condition groundwater was removed at the end of the lane 520cm from the ht fig 1 and fig s1 from one fully screened 4 inch pvc withdrawal well ww a constant withdrawal pump rate was applied to maintain an average linear groundwater velocity of 21cm day which corresponds to a pore volume pv sand filled section 2770l passed every 25 4days approximately an ethanol mixture stock solution was prepared in 23 0l glass bottles every second day using the simulated groundwater and high purity 99 chemical grades of ethanol commercial alcohols methyl tert butyl ether mtbe sigma aldrich and toluene fisher chemical at concentrations of 89 900 2350 and 2250μm respectively ethanol was added as the primary organic substrate whereas mtbe and toluene were added at significantly lower concentrations the dissolved plume was created by adding the ethanol mixture to three fully screened 4 inch diameter pvc injection wells iws installed as a fence across the lane 30cm down gradient of the ht fig 1 and fig s1 to start the experiment each iw was spiked with a single concentrated dose of the ethanol mixture and an inorganic tracer kbr to produce a step wise rather than gradual increase in concentrations subsequently the ethanol mixture was added to each iw at a rate of 2 3 0 3ml min and was thoroughly mixed within the well via continuous and rapid internal circulation note that the ethanol concentration in the iw was always 0 6 by volume 4730mg

0 0 to july 12 2013 day 330 pv 13 0 there was a small accidental spill of the ethanol mixture into the ht on day 103 an experiment timeline is shown in fig 2 thirty in situ groundwater samplers each consisting of a 3 inch stainless steel 40 μm porous cup chand eisenmann metallurgical were embedded horizontally in the sand within the middle of the lane during packing each was connected to stainless steel tubing that extended to surface along the tank wall and had a dedicated 30 ml hdpe syringe for purging and sampling these samplers were distributed at six vertical depths 15 45 75 105 135 and 165cm below the sand surface and along five sampling arrays located 70 155 205 320 and 445cm from the ht 0cm fig 1 groundwater samples were collected on july 11 2012 day 37 pv 1 5 to characterize the initial background conditions prior to ethanol addition and then monthly to bimonthly throughout the experiment these were analyzed for dissolved ethanol ammonium anions including nitrate and phosphate major cations including iron and manganese and volatile fatty acids vfas semi quantitative results only at the canada centre for inland waters details regarding sample

performed by a linear triangulation grid method which honors the data exactly using surfer software golden software inc three 4 inch diameter pvc monitoring wells mws screened over two depth intervals

results and discussion 3 1 input conditions composition of the simulated groundwater mimicked that of a shallow sandy aquifer under predominantly anaerobic conditions and with nutrient impacts the microbial oxidation of supplied nh4 to no3 eq 1 in table 1 established and maintained low do to anaerobic groundwater conditions in the ht and aquifer throughout the majority of the experiment especially following the nutrient increase refer to supporting information for further details with measured do largely 60μm 2 0mg l fig s2 the average concentrations in the ht of prime electron acceptors nitrate no3 and sulphate so4 2 were approximately 530 and 275μm 32 9 and 26 5mg l respectively the nitrate concentrations increased to 740μm on day 93 with the increased nutrient dosing dissolved phosphate po4 3 concentrations in the ht averaged 50 4 8mg l and 125μm 11 8mg l before and after day 93 respectively note that these dissolved no3 and po4 3 concentrations exceed common background levels of un impacted e g by agricultural or wastewater inputs groundwater systems 4 0 and 0 03mg l respectively dubrovsky et al 2010 temporal changes in the influx of groundwater nutrients and or electron acceptors at a contaminated site may result from variation in their supply from anthropogenic sources or their addition for remediation purposes as well as changes in groundwater flow conditions the measured concentrations of ethanol mtbe and toluene within the iws were 1 8 to 3 3 times higher than anticipated and were variable in time fig 2 similar concentrations and temporal trends between the three iws as apparent in low standard deviations in fig 2 indicate that all iws were similarly affected the build up of ethanol mass within the iws must have resulted from lower flows through the iws which indicates reduced well efficiency characteristic of clogging of the well screens and or the surrounding sand due to biofilm growth and or microbial gas production see baveye et al 1998 and references therein this clogging was apparently rapid i e within the first 10days given that the measured concentrations deviated from those expected immediately after the introductory ethanol spike in addition it appears that substantial spatial vertical and temporal variation in the clogging occurred which led to a dramatic change in the spatial distribution of ethanol input to the aquifer during early times stage 1 up to day 126 the dissolved ethanol source was dominantly shallow with concentrations gradually decreasing with depth whereas at later times stage 2 days 147 the source was predominantly deep fig 3a the vertical location of the plume shifted between these two stages which will be called the transition period days 126 147 this pattern is corroborated by several inorganic tracer tests explained in supporting information fig s3 we can only speculate as to the cause s of the change in clogging see supporting information however while not originally planned the resultant spatially and temporally variable contaminant plume configurations observed here do occur at real contaminated sites due to heterogeneous source zone morphologies water table fluctuations changes in groundwater flow directions and remediation activities wilson et al 2004 and references therein here they provided an opportunity to investigate how they might affect the geochemical patterns of an ethanol plume undergoing biodegradation despite the influence of clogging the average iw ethanol concentration of 55 600μm 2560mg l is consistent with measurements of groundwater impacted by accidental releases of high ethanol blended fuels and denatured ethanol capiro et al 2007 corseuil et al 2011 spalding et al 2011 freitas and barker 2013 also the maximum concentration was substantially lower than reported toxicity levels for microbes i e concentrations 5 1 12 7 by volume or 40 000 100 000mg l ingram and buttke 1984 nelson et al 2010 note that transverse mixing across the lane width i e between and beyond the widths of the three iw with an iw fence width lane width ratio 0 35 fig s4 was expected to reduce these concentrations slightly with transport along the aquifer discussed further in supporting information 3 2 overview of ethanol biodegradation there are several lines of evidence indicating that ethanol was being degraded within the synthetic aquifer throughout the experiment first ethanol concentrations consistently declined more than an order of magnitude along the length of the tank fig 3a to levels well below that predicted to occur from lateral dispersion from the iws to the full width of the aquifer fig s4 secondly degradation products e g volatile fatty acids vfas were produced and related changes in biogeochemistry were observed fig 3 figs s5 and s6 at all sampling dates these will be discussed in detail below and finally there were associated increases in trapped gas contents within the aquifer for the majority of the experiment not shown the focus of a subsequent manuscript indicating the production of biogenic gases the onset of ethanol degradation was rapid with the above noted changes occurring by the first groundwater sampling date day 42 fig s5 and suggested within the first week by dissolved gas pressure measurements refer to fig 2 in roy et al 2017 within both stages 1 and 2 the distribution of ethanol concentrations remained fairly similar over time suggesting a plume in near steady state with such steady state conditions established within several weeks after initial ethanol injection and following the transition period throughout both stages of the experiment the rate of ethanol degradation was high enough limit the plume largely to 5m length of the tank such vigorous ethanol degradation is consistent with many previous observations e g mackay et al 2006 zhang et al 2006 corseuil et al 2011 a series of microbially mediated reactions contributed to ethanol degradation in this experiment prior to when the nutrient concentrations were doubled on day 93 input do concentrations were low but non negligible fig s2 thus any remaining o2 that reached the iws would have been quickly utilized for ethanol oxidation do concentrations were negligible at mw1 fig s2 however this would account for only 55μm of ethanol based on the maximum do concentrations measured in the ht eq 2 in table 1 suggesting the vast majority of ethanol was degraded under anaerobic conditions the spatial distribution of the redox indicators documenting the remaining anaerobic reactions are shown for 6 select dates in fig 3 with the complete data set 13 dates provided in figs s5 and s6 first the fermentative degradation of ethanol e g eq 8 in table 1 is indicated by increases in dissolved h2 levels fig 3h especially day 67 and in concentrations of vfas fig 3b from initial i e day 37 and input i e ht conditions descriptions of propionate and butyrate formation from ethanol fermentation with balanced chemical reactions are provided by alvarez and hunt 1999 it is possible that some of the vfa production observed here was derived from mtbe and or toluene degradation though these were at much lower concentrations than ethanol upon injection maximum concentrations of vfas acetate propionate and butyrate were 3140μm 185 6mg l 650μm 47 3mg l and 1340μm 122 9mg l respectively which are consistent with values previously reported in dissolved ethanol plumes for both laboratory e g nelson et al 2010 ma et al 2011 and field conditions e g mackay et al 2006 corseuil et al 2011 the production of vfas across the full depth of the tank during stage 1 indicates that some ethanol or petroleum compound not shown was entering the deeper portion of the aquifer despite their low concentrations measured at depth at the first sampling array an observed initial lag in butyrate production fig s6e is not unexpected because acetate is a required precursor for butyrate formation alvarez and hunt 1999 ma et al 2011 the vfas were less abundant at shallow depths during stage 2 suggesting much reduced ethanol and hydrocarbon input there the fact that h2 gas was never detected in the ht above trace levels except for day 109 following a small accidental spill of ethanol into the ht suggests there were no major additional sources of h2 gas beyond fermentation such as from corrosion of the stainless steel tank bjerg et al 1997 the main terminal electron accepting processes coupled to ethanol oxidation taking place during this experiment included denitrification sulphate reduction and likely iron iii reduction with trace iron oxide minerals in the aquifer sand 1 0μmol g table s1 the no3 added to and produced in via nh4 oxidation recall input conditions the source water or ht was rapidly consumed within the aquifer fig 3c mostly utilized by the first sampling array 70cm distant except in a few areas with low ethanol inputs i e top of aquifer in stage 2 nitrate attenuation along with the production of intermediate reaction product nitrite no2 fig 3d suggests that ethanol was degraded via heterotrophic denitrification eq 4 in table 1 resulting in n2 gas production this was not apparent in the pgs data fig 3h because n2 was already abundant in the source water likewise sulphate reduction e g eq 7 in table 1 was also assumed given the decreases in so4 2 relative to its concentration in the source water fig 3g with production of h2s noted by its characteristic smell but not measured the distribution of so4 2 concentration was broadly similar to that of no3 throughout the experiment with substantial losses generally by the first sampling array except where ethanol inputs were low concentrations of dissolved fe 2 were below the detection limit in the source water and ht during the experiment except for a short period following the ethanol spill in the ht day 103 as well as throughout the aquifer prior to the experiment following ethanol contamination fe 2 concentrations increased within the aquifer fig 3f reaching a maximum concentration of 730μm 40 6mg l the resultant fe 2 plume shallow during stage 1 and then at greater depths in stage 2 propagated down gradient over time leaving behind an ever increasing fe 2 free 50μm zone this encompassed the entire tank by the end of the experiment i e after 13 pvs this likely reflects the exhaustion of biologically available including surface exposed mineral phase iron of the sand which would be expected to be less than the total iron mineral phase an fe mass balance suggests 30 of the total mineral phase iron was removed in the dissolved phase this pattern of fe 2 production is suggestive of iron iii reduction of ethanol eq 6a in table 1 though the iron iii reduction of h2s eq 6b in table 1 hunter et al 1998 is likely contributing especially in areas above or below the ethanol plume although these two reactions cannot be readily distinguished here the data show some areas of coincident decreasing ethanol and increasing fe 2 concentrations e g day 109 top of 3rd sampling array or day 187 bottom of 3rd sampling array fig 3 which provides evidence of the former reaction finally the detection of dissolved methane throughout the aquifer fig 3h though delayed through the first part of stage 1 indicates that methanogenesis associated with ethanol degradation was also occurring eq 9 in table 1 following its first detection ch4 levels steadily increased with maximum concentrations reaching 850μm 13 6mg l on day 300 concentrations of ch4 of this same order of magnitude have been reported for ethanol impacted sites e g spalding et al 2011 elevated methane at shallow depths during stage 2 when the ethanol plume was predominantly deep may reflect upward gas phase mobilization evidence for this is presented in a subsequent manuscript moreover these results suggest an increasingly methanogenic dominated microbial community within the synthetic aquifer at later times as observed in numerous studies monitoring microbial population shifts in response to ethanol contamination e g capiro et al 2008 nelson et al 2010 ma et al 2013 2015 the observed sequence of redox biogeochemistry along the groundwater flow path fig 3 and fig s5 fits well the plume fringe concept meckenstock et al 2015 the up gradient fringe close to the source zone experienced rapid removal of no3 by denitrification and so4 2 by sulphate reduction in areas where ethanol inputs were high down gradient within the plume core iron iii reduction early on and methanogenesis later then dominated no fringe existed at the down gradient edge of the plume where ethanol concentrations declined below 1000μm stage 2 and methanogenic conditions were maintained given the closed system plume removal by the ww with no chance for longitudinal dispersion with un impacted groundwater at the lateral edge of the ethanol plume i e top of aquifer in stage 2 no3 and so4 2 persisted further along the flow path with so4 2 concentrations extending to greater depth toward the plume core this general description of the ethanol biodegradation processes observed in this experiment fits well with previous observations from both large scale lab experiments and field sites in the following sections we take a more detailed look at different parts of the experimental observations with the goal of producing new or improved insight into the complexity of the biogeochemical processes associated with biodegradation of groundwater plumes of ethanol or organic contaminants in general 3 3 alternate ethanol biodegradation reaction ammonium concentrations increased in the aquifer fig 3e following the increase in nutrient loading day 93 indicating the incomplete transformation of added nh4 to no3 in the ht eq 1 in table 1 whereas prior to this nh4 was nearly completely transformed in the ht with concentrations 10μm later in stage 2 e g day 187 ammonium concentrations fig 3e became strongly elevated in the core of the ethanol plume fig 3a to values up to 4 times its concentration in the ht 140μm stage 2 given the concurrent decreases in ethanol no3 and no2 concentrations fig 3a c and d it is probable that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra eq 5 in table 1 was occurring tiedje et al 1982 dnra is performed by fermentative bacteria rivett et al 2008 and tends to be significant where the organic carbon to electron acceptor ratio is high i e c n ratios 3 5 tiedje et al 1982 yoon et al 2014 hardison et al 2015 in this experiment the initial c n ratios were 50 70 dnra has been reported at sites contaminated with organic rich wastewater e g bulger et al 1989 and sewage effluent e g smith et al 1991 and to a lesser extent for petroleum impacted aquifers e g cozzarelli et al 1999 schurmann et al 2003 considering these laboratory results and the highly labile nature of dissolved ethanol in groundwater dnra is likely to be a relevant degradation mechanism at denatured ethanol and blended fuel spill sites at which substantial ethanol reaches the water table e g spalding et al 2011 as well as a result this competitive reaction for oxidation of ethanol with dissolved nitrate has the potential to lower the heterotrophic denitrification of ethanol eq 4 in table 1 meaning less biogenic gas n2 production 3 4 delays in degradation ethanol degradation was well underway and apparently at a near steady state by the first sampling date day 42 fig s5 with evidence of fermentation denitrification sulphate reduction and likely iron iii reduction this indicates that the aquifer inoculation provided a diverse microbial consortium capable of degrading ethanol or able to quickly adapt and suggests that microbial numbers in general had reached a steady level the shift in vertical position of the ethanol plume occurred during the transition period between sampling days 126 and 147 i e shift occurred over 21days or less with no substantial expansion in the ethanol plume length fig 3a and fig s5 likewise there was no apparent lapse in the rapid depletion of no3 and so4 2 i e majority removed by the first sampling array fig 3c and g both observations suggest that the denitrifying and sulphate reducing members of the community were able to respond quickly to increases in ethanol concentration acetate concentrations fig s6c were higher on the first sampling date following the initial ethanol release i e day 42 than on subsequent sampling dates they also showed a slight rebound in concentrations during the transition period days 126 147 when deeper depths of the aquifer experienced an increase in ethanol concentrations acetate concentration reflects both production from ethanol degradation and subsequent syntrophic metabolite uptake nelson et al 2010 the rapid increase in acetate concentrations is consistent with reports of very minor acclimation periods associated with fermentative bacteria which are ubiquitous in groundwater systems wiedemeier et al 1999 rivett et al 2008 and references therein the subsequent decline then suggests a succeeding expansion and or adaptation of microbial organisms that can utilize the acetate including those that transform it into propionate and butyrate as concentrations of these compounds show a marked increase from day 42 to 67 figs s6d and s6e unlike the biodegradation processes described above methanogenesis showed a substantial lag phase with the first detections in a pgs on day 109 fig 3h acclimation periods for methanogens are not uncommon in laboratory experiments and or field studies including petroleum and ethanol fuel contaminated sites but are highly variable and site specific ranging from several days up to 5years e g baedecker et al 1993 nelson et al 2010 corseuil et al 2011 ma et al 2011 spalding et al 2011 these have been attributed in large part to slow growth from low initial numbers of methanogens which is likely in this experiment given their introduction via inoculation another possible contributing factor to the lag observed in this experiment is phosphorus limitation which will be discussed in a subsequent section finally there was apparently no dnra during stage 1 as there was no apparent increase in nh4 concentrations along the tank length or above that of the ht fig 3e and this despite having similar plume core conditions i e high ethanol concentrations fermentation producing vfa and h2 available no3 fig 3 as for its occurrence in stage 2 the reason for this is not clear but it may reflect a lag time for the microbial community to develop sufficient dnra capacity indeed after a 2 year continuous ethanol blend release in a laboratory tank the gene microarray results of ma et al 2015 showed a significant increase in the abundance of drna genes indicating that the metabolic potential for dnra activity may be enhanced following prolonged exposure to ethanol contamination which corroborates the findings of this study 3 5 extreme levels of dissolved hydrogen gas trace amounts of dissolved h2 commonly accumulate in biogeochemically active groundwater as its redox state becomes progressively more reducing wiedemeier et al 1999 and references therein during stage 1 of this experiment h2 concentrations determined from pgs composition fig 3h and measured p tdg not shown ranged from 2900 to 60 900nm with the highest values associated with mw1 these values are near or above the reported inhibitory limit 8000nm for fermentation based on laboratory experiments wiedemeier et al 1999 they are also to the best of our knowledge the highest yet reported in the scientific literature for biodegradation in groundwater although the measurement of h2 is not regularly performed at contaminated sites for comparison h2 concentrations measured at a denatured ethanol spill site didn t exceed 100nm spalding et al 2011 in that case though h2 monitoring did not begin until 5years after the spill long after methanogenesis was established as the predominant degradation pathway also the use of p tdg sensors and pgs in a controlled lab setting here may have provided a more accurate measure of dissolved gas concentrations than commonly measured in the field ryan et al 2015 to explain these extreme h2 concentrations we hypothesize that vigorous fermentation of high concentrations of ethanol sustained in the absence of on going terminal electron accepting processes i e denitrification sulphate reduction iron iii reduction and methanogenesis allowed for sustained h2 production and accumulation at early times as evidence the high dissolved ethanol loading led to the complete utilization of the entire electron acceptor pool no3 so4 2 fe 3 and presumably mn 4 in the area just down gradient of the first sampling array and the first traces of methane were only found there at the day 109 sampling fig 3 whereas the h2 concentrations were much lower in stage 2 after methanogenesis was established ranging from 800 to 10 300nm it is possible that h2 concentrations may have declined further to field reported values had the experimental duration been extended these results suggest there should be further investigation of the potential explosion hazards posed from h2 gas at ethanol spill sites especially where methanogenesis has not become established of concern is that h2 is nearly 2 times less soluble kh moll 1 kpa 1 at 25 c of 7 70 10 6 for h2 vs 1 37 10 5 for ch4 and has a broader explosion limit 4 75 for h2 vs 5 15 for ch4 by volume than ch4 3 6 phosphorus nutrient limitation the concentrations of po4 3 decreased with distance along the tank throughout the experiment likely due to microbial uptake during ethanol biodegradation mineral precipitation reactions with dissolved fe 2 and or sorption onto minerals e g iron sulphide during stage 1 before nutrient inputs were doubled the po4 3 concentrations declined with flow distance to negligible levels by 300cm down gradient of ht e g day 67 in fig 4 some evidence suggests that these areas experienced phosphorus p limitation effects on ethanol biodegradation reactions during stage 1 given that p is an inorganic macronutrient critical for biomass production during this early time ethanol concentrations were largely constant at flow distances 200cm down gradient of ht fig 3a suggesting a stalling of ethanol biodegradation concurrently the concentrations of total vfas dic and dissolved iron fig 3b s6f and 3f respectively did not change notably through this area of the tank iron oxide minerals were assuredly still present there given that their initial distribution within the synthetic aquifer was rather homogeneous meaning iron iii reduction should otherwise proceed further indeed this area produced fe 2 at later times e g day 109 fig 3f h2 production also appeared to stagnate as concentrations declined from mw1 with distance down gradient fig 3h these spatial geochemical trends suggest that both fermentation and iron iii reduction associated with the ethanol plume were inhibited in conjunction with p limitation following the increase in nutrient additions day 93 po4 3 concentrations became notably higher and remained non negligible in the tank through the transition period into stage 2 i e fig 4 day 109 onwards during these times ethanol concentrations tended to decline to a greater extent along the tank length with much lower concentrations than in stage 1 e g 20 000 to 5000μm on day 67 and 300 respectively in fig 3a the vfas particularly acetate see fig s6c dic and dissolved iron were also being produced further down gradient up to the last sampling array 445cm down gradient of ht at these times figs 3b s6f and 3f respectively this suggests that iron iii reduction and fermentation were no longer limited following the increase in po4 3 lastly it s interesting to note that the boost in po4 3 inputs also coincided with the sudden proliferation of methanogenic activity at the beginning of the transition period i e ch4 was first measured in pgs on day 109 fig 3h this may just be coincidental timing with the lag time for methanogenesis discussed previously but perhaps the elimination of p limitation on the methanogens also played a role these observations are suggestive of an important and dynamic impact of phosphorus nutrient limitation on the biodegradation of ethanol groundwater plumes this limitation may be enhanced for ethanol contamination compared to other organic plumes due to the high concentrations of labile carbon and resultant vigorous biodegradation 3 7 secondary redox reactions within a shifting plume during stage 2 when the ethanol plume was at greater depths in the aquifer fig 3a the concentration of so4 2 at shallow depths 75cm increased with flow distance especially in the latter half of the aquifer 150cm from ht to values above its source water concentration 280μm in ht fig 3g concurrent decreases in no3 and no2 concentrations were also observed fig 3c and d these changes are illustrated more clearly in fig 5 using data from the shallowest sampling locations 15cm depth and two sampling dates these observations are indicative of autotrophic denitrification in which denitrifying bacteria alternatively consume inorganic electron donors such as h2s fe 2 iron sulphide minerals and silicates to reduce no3 to n2 gas in the absence of significant labile organic contamination e g eqs 3a and 3b in table 1 refer to critical review by rivett et al 2008 in this case the reduced sulphur component is believed to have been created during stage 1 when sulphate driven reduction of ethanol was occurring in the upper portion of the aquifer tank the gaseous end product of sulphate reduction h2s dominant species at ph 6 5 though not directly monitored was clearly noted via its characteristic odour during sampling events and would have become a component in the residual gas phase mcleod 2015 alternately amorphous sulphur minerals may have been generated by the oxidation of h2s by iron hydroxide minerals of the sand it is also possible that fe 2 generated by iron iii reduction of ethanol reacted with h2s to precipitate iron sulphide minerals as previously observed at several petroleum contaminated sites e g baedecker et al 1993 cozzarelli et al 1999 vencelides et al 2007 the absence of a matching dissolved fe 2 plume here does not ensure the dominant electron donor was in fact h2s or amorphous sulphur minerals as fe 2 may have been subsequently oxidized by any remaining nitrate fig 5b rivett et al 2008 or mineralized with available po4 3 fig 4 robertson et al 1998 in either case the gaseous h2s and or sulphur minerals would have provided a pool of reduced sulphur for subsequent oxidation by nitrate and nitrite vencelides et al 2007 following the downward shift in the ethanol plume i e during stage 2 further evidence of this reaction is provided by the trends of peak so4 2 concentrations in this area declining over time during stage 2 while also slowly propagating down gradient with time fig 5 day 165 vs 229 presumably this was due to the ongoing depletion of the finite pool of reduced sulphur autotrophic denitrification has been extensively studied in groundwater systems un impacted by petroleum products where the alternative electron donors utilized were derived from naturally occurring minerals in the aquifer sediments e g jorgensen et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 and references therein here it represents a secondary redox process i e oxidation of reduced redox species formed by the primary redox reactions that arose at the plume fringe due to a shift in the location of the plume this shift exposed reduced species created in the plume core to oxidizing species in the background groundwater other applicable secondary redox processes for organic plumes may involve reoxidation of fe 2 mn 2 nh4 or ch4 e g hunter et al 1998 van breukelen and griffioen 2004 vencelides et al 2007 such secondary redox processes have largely been investigated at a single point in time at locations where primary reaction s have already diminished for example vencelides et al 2007 conducted forward and inverse geochemical modeling based on one set of aqueous and solid phase samples collected after 24years of napl source zone recession in order to evaluate the impact of secondary redox processes on the flux of dissolved electron acceptors into the current plume at a hydrocarbon contaminated site here however the full temporal evolution of the process from primary organic degradation and production of reduced redox species to consumption and subsequent depletion during secondary reactions is demonstrated overall these results demonstrate how reduced species in immobile phases such as biogenic gases e g h2s here within trapped gas and or minerals e g iron sulphides deposited on the aquifer solids that are produced via ethanol biodegradation in the core of the plume can subsequently fuel secondary redox processes e g autotrophic denitrification in this study when the plume shifts its location this process should be as applicable to lateral shifts in a plume e g schirmer et al 2001 as for the vertical shift shown here as well as in the recovery period following ethanol source exhaustion these secondary redox reactions may also apply to small fluctuations in location of the plume fringe derived from variations in the site groundwater flow field van breukelen and griffioen 2004 which could be further enhanced by permeability changes associated with gas production and mineral precipitation in the ethanol plume 4 conclusions this study focused on temporally and spatially detailed monitoring of groundwater biogeochemistry including dissolved gas composition of a 330 day pilot scale simulation of an ethanol plume undergoing biodegradation in a synthetic sand aquifer it demonstrated the rapid development of fermentation denitrification sulphate reduction and iron iii reduction following the introduction of dissolved ethanol with the eventual widespread development of methanogenesis a vertical shift in the core of the ethanol plume occurred after 100days and is attributed to bio and gas clogging immobile mineral and gas phase species produced within the plume core initially then supported secondary reactions outside of the new ethanol plume position these observations corroborate the general understanding of major processes driving biodegradation of ethanol and other organic contaminants in groundwater systems that has been derived from past large scale lab and field studies they also provide additional and detailed data spatial and temporal on redox zonation i e supporting the plume fringe concept secondary reactions with a changing shifting plume and time lags for the various biodegradation processes under field representative conditions this experiment also captured some potential additional complexity in the evolution of biogeochemistry associated with biodegradation of a substantial mass of highly labile organic compounds such as for an ethanol plume note that following an unblended petroleum spill groundwater hydrocarbon concentrations may reach 100mg l meckenstock et al 2015 though much of this may not be readily biodegradable in contrast ethanol concentrations reached at least 10 times that concentration in this study while still being within the range reported for ethanol contaminated groundwater of other studies capiro et al 2007 corseuil et al 2011 spalding et al 2011 freitas and barker 2013 during this experiment the highest dissolved h2 concentrations yet reported for groundwater were observed we hypothesize that this resulted from vigorous fermentation in an area where common terminal electron accepting processes i e aerobic oxidation denitrification sulphate reduction iron iii reduction were absent because dissolved oxygen nitrate and sulphate and iron iii minerals were exhausted by up gradient reactions with ethanol and methanogenesis had not yet started such conditions might be met in the field for the core of an ethanol plume at early times before methanogens have established themselves such high h2 production even if for limited duration may be a safety concern given explosion hazards and vapour intrusion risks this may necessitate new or modified approaches to ethanol site remediation further investigation of this h2 production is warranted also evidence of phosphorus p nutrient limitation was found which stalled ethanol biodegradation via fermentation and iron iii reduction in this case and perhaps even delayed the onset of methanogenesis despite a substantial phosphate loading to the simulated groundwater phosphate concentrations dropped to negligible levels likely as a result of microbial uptake and or mineral precipitation sorption reactions finally the onset of dnra eq 5 in table 1 which has not been reported for ethanol biodegradation to date was observed partway through this experiment because this is a competitive reaction to heterotrophic denitrification of ethanol eq 4 in table 1 which oxidizes ethanol using dissolved nitrate to ammonium it has the potential to reduce biogenic gas i e n2 production meanwhile the resulting ammonium may contribute to euthrophication and fish toxicity issues where such groundwater discharges to surface waters it is anticipated that this set of observations may provide some improved and or new insights into the

1691,variations of gas phase density are responsible for advective and diffusive transports of organic vapors in unsaturated soils laboratory experiments were conducted to explore dense gas transport sulfur hexafluoride sf6 from different source densities through a nitrogen gas dry soil column gas pressures and sf6 densities at transient state were measured along the soil column for three transport configurations horizontal vertically upward and vertically downward transport these measurements and others reported in the literature were compared with simulation results obtained from two models based on different diffusion approaches the dusty gas model dgm equations and a fickian type molar fraction based diffusion expression the results show that the dgm and fickian based models predicted similar dense gas density profiles which matched the measured data well for horizontal transport of dense gas at low to high source densities despite the pressure variations predicted in the soil column were opposite to the measurements the pressure evolutions predicted by both models were in trend similar to the measured ones for vertical transport of dense gas however differences between the dense gas densities predicted by the dgm and fickian based models were discernible for vertically upward transport of dense gas even at low source densities as the dgm based predictions matched the measured data better than the fickian results did for vertically downward transport the dense gas densities predicted by both models were not greatly different from our experimental measurements but substantially greater than the observations obtained from the literature especially at high source densities further research will be necessary for exploring factors affecting downward transport of dense gas in soil columns use of the measured data to compute flux components of sf6 showed that the magnitudes of diffusive flux component based on the fickian type diffusion expressions in terms of molar concentration molar fraction and mass density fraction gradient were almost the same however they were greater than the result computed with the mass fraction gradient for 24 and the dgm based result for more than one time as a consequence the dgm based total flux of sf6 was in magnitude greatly less than the fickian result not only for horizontal transport diffusion dominating but also for vertical transport advection and diffusion of dense gas particularly the fickian based total flux was more than two times in magnitude as much as the dgm result for vertically upward transport of dense gas keywords gas phase transport gas diffusion advection dusty gas model equations fick s first law density driven transport gravitational effect 1 introduction soil and groundwater contamination by volatile organic compounds vocs is a great environmental risk due to high toxicity in particular voc vapors from nonaqueous phase liquid napl residing in soils or dissolved forms in soil moisture and groundwater migrate and spread more rapidly in unsaturated soils than dissolved forms of vocs in saturated zones since gas diffusion coefficients of organic vapors are several order of magnitude larger than aqueous diffusion coefficients bedient et al 1999 as the popularity of monitored natural attenuation as a subsurface remediation strategy increases a complete understanding and reliable prediction of gas phase transport of vocs under natural conditions are necessary rivett et al 2011 vapor transport in porous systems can be driven by concentration differences and total pressure variations denoted as diffusive dispersive and advective transport respectively these transport mechanisms are usually described with fick s law of diffusion and darcy s law respectively additionally the gravitational force may enhance or suppress the vertically advective transport of organic vapors sleep and sykes 1989 mendoza and frind 1990 lenhard et al 1995 jang and aral 2007 in the past dusty gas model dgm equations were also discussed and applied to relevant problems for the deficit of fick s law of diffusion in representing multicomponent gas transport in unsaturated soils see for example webb 1996 sleep 1998 fen and abriola 2004 and molins and mayer 2007 organic vapors mixed with soil air form a gas mixture with a total density different than the air density based on fick s law of diffusion gas diffusion is driven by gas density variations fen and abriola 2004 showed that mathematical models developed in the past for gas phase transport in unsaturated soils employed different forms of fick s law of diffusion the diffusive dispersive flux component based on fick s law of diffusion hereafter called fickian type diffusion is in a form either in terms of a molar or mass fraction or molar or mass concentration gradient for multicomponent gas transport in porous systems soils nonequimolar effects due to different molecular masses between the air gases and organic vapors are addressed in the dgm equations the fickian type diffusion may not be sufficient to describe diffusive transport of a gas mixture with very different molecular masses in porous systems altevogt et al 2003 presented an alternative way to address the nonequimolar effects they additionally include a slip velocity adopted from jackson 1977 in a standard mass based advective diffusive transport equation and solved the equation for chemical gas density the slip velocity caused by slip flow or called diffusive slip in kramers and kistemaker 1943 accounts for nonequimolar counter diffusion of gases of different molecular masses jackson 1977 showed that the flux component based on the slip velocity is included in the 2 component dgm equations under limited conditions including 1 gas diffusion in the molecular regime i e the mean free path of gas molecules in the order of mean pore size or larger 2 pressure diffusion i e diffusion due to total density variations in space is neglected further an additional diffusive flux component driven by gravitational force was first presented in thorstenson and pollock 1989 in which the dgm theory was also adopted the significance of this component has not yet been delineated in modeling or experimental work advection is mainly driven by total density gas pressure variation in space and gravitational force if gas transport is not horizontal advection driven by gas density is sometimes presumed to be negligibly small in some modeling and or experimental work in cases of no external pressure gradient for example corapcioglu and baehr 1987 jury et al 1990 lenhard et al 1995 hamamoto et al 2008 and cotel et al 2011 thus the modeling work may be only based on the gas phase transport equation for the solution of component molar or mass concentration however gas pressure variations may be induced during gas phase transport due to nonequimolar weights of gas molecules lenhard et al 1995 altevogt et al 2003 such modeling work needs to solve the gas transport equation coupled with flow equation for molar or mass concentration and total pressure or total density or equivalent pressure head as those presented in for example metcalfe and farquhar 1987 rathfelder et al 2000 sleep and sykes 1989 mendoza and frind 1990 and jang and aral 2007 for the solution of the equivalent pressure head it is presumed the dependence of total density of gas mixture on total gas pressure is negligibly small mendoza and frind 1990 pointed out the equivalent pressure head formulation may increase numerical accuracy for scaling the pressure potential to the same magnitude as the elevation potential fen and abriola 2004 found the mass based formulations of these modeling approaches may predict different gas pressure and chemical concentration variations for gas phase chemical transport in one dimensional 1 d porous systems thus it is necessary to investigate the gas pressure and chemical concentration variations in the laboratory to assess the validity of various modeling approaches on predicting gas phase chemical migration in unsaturated soils dense gas transport in porous systems has been investigated in the experimental work of many researchers including lenhard et al 1995 conant et al 1996 altevogt et al 2003 jellali et al 2003 hamamoto et al 2008 and cotel et al 2011 lenhard et al 1995 and jellali et al 2003 measured organic vapor concentration distributions in sand tanks and conant et al 1996 in field lenhard et al 1995 obtained small gas pressure variations in space in their sand tank experiment and did not consider advection in the analysis altevogt et al 2003 hamamoto et al 2008 and cotel et al 2011 carried out transport experiments in soil columns and observed the spatial and temporal variations of chemical vapor gas concentration along the columns altevogt et al 2003 and cotel et al 2011 also observed small gas pressure variations or 1pa in soil columns when chemical gas migrates from a voc source lenhard et al 1995 altevogt et al 2003 and cotel et al 2011 showed gravitational force plays an important role in vertical transport the modeling approaches for the interpretation of the experimental results in their work were all based on fickian type diffusion on a mass or molar basis altevogt et al 2003 also considered the slip component the dgm equations represent a framework for describing multicomponent gas transport processes in porous media and have not fully been verified experimentally in soil systems in addition to measuring gas phase chemical concentration and pressure variations for assessing the magnitudes of diffusive and advective flux components along a soil column the related transport parameters such as effective molecular knudsen diffusion coefficient and soil permeability should be determined independently relevant experiments have been conducted in altevogt et al 2003 and hamamoto et al 2008 for soil air permeability and effective gas diffusion coefficient and in cotel et al 2011 for soil permeability only cotel et al 2011 used the relationship of millington and quirk 1961 to estimate the effective gas diffusion coefficient and considered dispersion these studies estimated the effective gas diffusion coefficient with a fickian type diffusion expression rather than the dgm equations the objective of this study is to assess the dgm and fickian based modeling approaches on predicting dense gas transport a series of transport experiments were conducted to investigate the migration of chemical gas nitrogen mixture along a soil column placed either horizontally or vertically the results of other similar gas phase transport experiments presented in the literature were also compared with the model predictions we also used the measured chemical gas concentrations gas pressure and transport parameters to compute various flux components of dense gas to assess different diffusion approaches on determining the migration rate of gas phase chemical from a source zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical formulations of gas phase transport model for simulating gas phase transport in soil columns 1 d component molar or mass balance equation transport equation is generally utilized assuming a rigid porous matrix single gas flow and no reactions or external sources sinks the transport equation of a gas component i on different bases may be written as cunningham and williams 1980 1a θ a c i t n i t z 0 1b θ a ρ i t g i t z 0 where θ a is gas filled porosity c i and ρ i are the molar

respectively n i t is the sum of total diffusive n i d and viscous fluxes n i v of species i on a molar basis and g i t is the sum of g i d and g i v on a mass basis different theoretical bases for the total diffusive flux component were presented in past modeling work the first is dgm theory here we present the flux component based on the two component dgm equations as 2 n i d d ij e d i k c d

diffusive flux defined in the dgm equations includes three terms the molar fraction gradient total molar concentration gradient and gravity induced ones on the other hand the fickian type diffusion is generally applied to represent diffusive flux component for gas phase transport several different fickian type diffusion expressions have been found including the one in terms of molar concentration gradient molar fraction gradient mass concentration gradient and mass fraction gradient as follows 3a n i d d i c i z 3b or cd i x i z 3c g i d d i ρ i z 3d or ρ d i w i z where ρ ρ 1 ρ 2 is total

ij o a summary has been presented in table 3 of fen and abriola 2004 for different fickian type diffusion expressions used in the past modeling work the component viscous flux is based on darcy s law

5b θ a ρ t g t z 0 where n t and g t represent the total molar and mass flux respectively such that n t i n i t and g t i g i t g t in eq 5b is usually replaced with viscous flux as 5c θ a ρ t ρq z 0 where q is volumetric flux or darcy velocity in eq 5c darcy velocity is implicitly representative of the mass average velocity the dgm and fickian type diffusion approaches were assessed in this study two models were applied one is a multidimensional multicomponent dgm based gas phase transport model dgpt developed by fen 2014 another is michigan soil vapor extraction remediation miser a fickian

pressure and the molar fraction of chemical component as mentioned previously the nonequimolar components are not completely included in the governing equations of miser 2 2 transport experiments an experimental system referred to in altevogt et al 2003 and hamamoto et al 2008 for investigating dense gas transport in a porous medium was constructed the system consists of a soil column packed with dry sea sand and two large chambers at each end of the column the soil column is 40cm in length with an inner diameter of 8cm and made of acrylic material the chamber where a dense gas is injected is hereafter called the inlet chamber ic and the other is called the outlet chamber oc the ic and oc are respectively 30l in volume and made of stainless steel fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the system the dry sea sand imported from barcelona has a range of particle sizes between 0 25 and 0 3mm and is classified as medium sand the sand was packed into the column by adding measured amounts of sand about 0 5kg at a time and gently shaking the column and tapping the side of the column to settle the sand in the column until the sand was packed into the entire length of the column the sand packing follows the procedure presented in altevogt et al 2003 we did not add water into the sand column for the transport experiment dense gas transport in the column is under a dry soil condition thus there is no need to consider dissolution of the dense gas in soil moisture the adsorptive effect of the dense gas on the dry soil was however examined and discussed in the next section the dense gas we used in this study is sulfur hexafluoride sf6 sf6 has been known as an inorganic conservative and nonreactive tracer in subsurface studies for the perception that it does not significantly adsorb to solid substrates e g olschewski et al 1995 wilson and mackay 1993 1996 a gaseous voc may have many different features from the sf6 gas in subsurface however use of sf6 to represent a dense gas in the transport experiment may simplify the analysis for only considering transport mechanisms of the dense gas migrating through the soil column we used sf6 to mix with nitrogen gas to form a dense gaseous mixture in the ic nitrogen gas was firstly injected into the ic for several minutes from a nitrogen gas tank at that time one valve on the oc was opened to the air and a plunger in the ic pulled away from the ic face which connects to the column then the injection was gradually stopped and the opened valve on the oc was gradually closed to retain atmospheric pressure on the inside of the system the plunger in the ic was then moved slowly to cover the entrance to the soil column a transport experiment was carried out by initially injecting a volume amount of sf6 into the ic and a similar volume amount of nitrogen gas was withdrawn three gas samples each being 2ml were taken with a syringe from different ports at the ic for measuring the sf6 density which is referred to as the initial sf6 source density ρ c o in the ic low to high ρ c o ranging from 0 19 to 3 9kg m3 was made in the ic for each transport experiment as shown in table 1 the whole system was also maintained at atmospheric pressure by vent tubing on the ic and oc the sf6 density was measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector gc 2014 ecd 2014 shimadzu corp kyoto japan and a 30 long molecular sieve 5a gc plot capillary column catalog no 25463 supelco column and detector temperatures were held at 150 c and 250 c respectively nitrogen 99 999 was used as carrier gas and flow into the gc at a gas pressure of 130kpa with a linear velocity mode and split ratio of 30 set for the gc ecd the column and purge flow was 4 51 and 3ml min respectively a gas sample was injected into the gc ecd at a volume amount of 0 1ml the injection temperature was set at 220 c the next step was to pull away the plunger from the ic face to let the sf6 gas in the ic migrate into the column gas pressure differences were then recorded every half hour with three differential pressure transmitters p1 p2 and p3 as indicated in fig 1 at the ic oc and five ports along the soil column i e 0 5 15 25 35cm from the ic connection to the column see fig 1 the first transmitter p1 furness controls fco332 10 00mbar can only measure pressure variations of 0 01mbar 1pa however during a transport experiment pressure differences between the chamber and each location along the column and between the chamber and the outside of the system were mostly 1pa thus the second p2 furness controls fco332 25 00pa and third transmitters p3 omega px655 15 999pa were essential for measuring pressure differences p2 was fixed at the oc and used to measure the pressure differences between the oc and the ic and between the oc and each port along the column p3 is portable and used to measure the pressure difference between the outside of the system and each port along the column to verify the accuracy of the p2 measurements gas samples were taken every one hour from the ports at the ic and oc and four sampling ports along the soil column i e 5 15 25 35cm from the ic connection to the column see fig 1 the concentration of the sf6 gas at each port was then measured using the gc ecd the pressure recordings and samplings both lasted for 4 5 to 5 5h the samples were all diluted with a 250ml vial 2ml sampled gas plus 248ml nitrogen gas before being injected into the gc ecd for analysis three different transport configurations were considered for dense gas migration in the soil column horizontal transport vertical transport with the ic on the ground transport in the vertically upward direction and vertical transport with the oc on the ground transport in the vertically downward direction the last two were designed to investigate the gravitational effect on the migration of the dense gas mixture 2 3 transport parameters before the transport experiment a batch study was carried out to assess the sorptive effect of the sf6 gas onto dry sea sand for the concentrations of the sf6 gas ranging from 30 to 600 000ppm the study showed the amount of sf6 sorption onto sea sand was negligibly small agreeing with the findings of wilson and mackay 1996 further we conducted single gas flow and equimolar binary gas diffusion experiments to assess soil intrinsic permeability and the obstruction factor for the dgm respectively through a soil column packed with dry sea sand with a porosity of 0 367 0 001 the soil column for the transport experiment was also packed with the dry sea sand and had a porosity of about 0 367 see table 3 the experimental setting and methodology can be referred to in fen et al 2009 2011 the intrinsic permeability of the dry sea sand column was measured by flowing nitrogen gas through the column at eight different gas pressures ranging from 0 8 1 6atm each with flow rates ranging from 2 10 5 to 1 10 4 m3 s intrinsic permeability of the sand column in the single gas flow experiment was estimated to be of an order of 10 11 m2 which is in the permeability range of medium sand todd 1983 the knudsen diffusion coefficients of the gas component n2 and sf6 d n2 k and d sf6 k are both related to soil permeability and were assessed through the correlations provided in reinecke and sleep 2002 and bravo 2007 for air and the relationship of d i k d air k m air m i thorstenson and pollock 1989 for n2 and sf6 table 2 shows the results for the component knudsen diffusion coefficient are of an order of 10 3 m2 s the obstruction factor shown in table 2 was assessed through a binary equimolar gas diffusion experiment with gas pair n2 co and thereby multiplied by the air filled binary molecular diffusion coefficient of gas pair n2 and sf6 d sf6 n2 o to obtain the effective binary molecular diffusion coefficient d sf6 n2 e for the dgm equations the d sf6 n2 e value is of an order of 10 6 m2 s the effective diffusion coefficient of sf6 d sf6 for the fickian type diffusion may be defined to include both of d sf6 n2 e and the knudsen diffusion coefficients of sf6 d sf6 k for a binary equimolar gas transport system see fen and abriola 2004 because d sf6 k or d n2 k is three orders of magnitude greater than d sf6 n2 e in the transport experiment we assigned the d sf6 value as the same as the magnitude of d sf6 n2 e such that the tortuosity factor multiplied by the air filled porosity θ a τ is equivalent to the obstruction factor q m the experimentally determined q m value was also compared with other empirically based results for θ a τ such as those provided in millington and quirk 1961 and moldrup et al 2000 where the empirical equations both express τ as a function of the total and air filled porosities of porous media table 2 shows the experimentally determined q m value is about two times the empirical ones 2 4 model implementation variations in the chemical gas density with time at each sampling point were measured and also predicted with dgpt and miser soil and chemical properties are presented in table 3 and used for model simulation two other experimental results on gas transport studies in altevogt et al 2003 and hamamoto et al 2008 were also compared with the model predictions altevogt et al 2003 packed oso flaco sand in the column and used the chemical freon 113 for the transport experiment and hamamoto et al 2008 used isohexane and two soil media a loam and sand materials in table 1 for each transport experiment at an initial chemical source density ρ c o the indicated mole fraction of the chemical gas x c o is the upstream boundary condition used in the model simulation each x c o value is not necessarily equivalent to the molar fraction of the corresponding ρ c o and was determined according to the averaged measured results at the ic during the transport experiment gas transport in a two dimensional configuration of the soil column was simulated the length of the simulated domain is the column length 40cm in addition to 1cm extended from each end of the column for the boundary settings instead of the 1 cm extension the extension is 5cm from the chemical gas source to the entrance of the soil column for the transport system of hamamoto et al 2008 because isohexane was in liquid form in the container connecting to the soil column in the experiment of hamamoto et al 2008 and the dimension of the container was not clearly stated in the paper we determined the 5 cm extension by changing the length of the extension until a good fit between the predicted and observed chemical gas density profiles at each sampling point was attained for a horizontal transport case see next section for the comparison the lateral boundaries of the simulated domain were impermeable the upstream at the ic and downstream at the oc boundaries were both assigned atmospheric pressures for horizontal transport for vertically downward transport the downstream boundary was assigned a total gas pressure as p p atm ρgz1 where p atm is atmospheric pressure and z1 is the length of soil column to reflect static equilibrium of gas however for vertically upward transport the downstream boundary was assigned atmospheric pressure and the upstream boundary was assigned p p atm ρgz1 as a vertical transport experiment was conducted there was a gas pressure difference of 4 5pa between the two ends of the sand column if the soil column is 40cm in length andρis representative of the density of nitrogen gas the upstream and downstream boundaries were also assigned a fixed molar fraction of chemical gas i e a nonzero constant x c o at the ic and zero as the oc opened to the air time step size used for the transport simulation was adjusted automatically in dgpt and miser according to the convergent criteria set for solution thus the time step size used for the dgpt simulation was 30min and for the miser simulation ranged between 1 and 30min several grid sizes were tested to check numerical stability of model simulations the final choice was a 1 cm grid size for all the simulations retardation due to equilibrium interface mass transfer between the chemical gas and solid phases was considered in the transport experiment of altevogt et al 2003 for the gas mixture of freon 113 and air altevogt et al 2003 adopted a nonlinear isotherm for the gas solid sorption thus as the gas concentration of freon 113 varies spatially and temporally in the transport experiment the retardation factor values along the soil column were also changed the same isotherm was implemented in dgpt we found the magnitudes of the retardation factor were changed between 5 23 and 1 23 according to the simulation results for the transport experiment of altevogt et al 2003 with using dgpt miser however only considers linear isotherm of sorptive behavior for voc vapors we used a constant retardation factor value of 3 2 in miser for simulating the transport experiment of altevogt et al 2003 we further found the highest modeled pore velocity gravity induced estimated from the simulated cases is about 3 24 10 4 m s thus according to whitaker 1999 we may ignore dispersion 3 results and discussions 3 1 transport experiment in the transport experiment the pressure variations observed in the ic and at the 0 cm and 5 cm ports were substantial for three transport configurations especially at high chemical source densities thus the ranges of their magnitudes are summarized in fig 2 the measured results only reflect the pressure variations induced by the dense gas transport in the column the pressure difference presented in the figure is gas pressure relative to the outside pressure of the system i e atmospheric air pressure a negative pressure difference indicates the gas pressure in the system was lower than the outside one and vice versa the results showed the gas pressure responses for dense gas transport in the vertically upward direction were opposite to those for horizontal and vertically downward transports similar pressure responses were also presented in altevogt et al 2003 however the magnitudes of pressure variations observed in our experiments were greater than those in altevogt et al 2003 in which measured pressure differences were all 1pa for their high source density cases the gas pressure increased at the 0 cm and 5 cm points with increased pressure difference as the sf6 source density increased for horizontal and vertically downward transports the gas pressure however decreased at the 0 cm and 5 cm points for vertically upward transport the pressure differences were positive in the ic and increased as the source density increased for the vertically upward transport cases but close to zero for the horizontal and vertically downward transport cases fig 3 presents the pressure evolutions along the soil column at different times for gas transport at high source densities it showed the pressure variation in the soil column increased as the transport time increased during the 5 5 h transport period for each transport configuration relative chemical gas densities presented in figs 4 to 6 are the ratio of the measured chemical gas density and the chemical source density ρ c o at each sampling point and time from the experimental results of hamamoto et al 2008 and altevogt et al 2003 and our experiments in which we selected one set of transport results with low medium and high sf6 source density respectively in these figures the error bars represent the variability of the multiple measured results from a sampling point at a sampling time it showed the chemical gas density in the ic varied from ρ c o with time for our experiments and declined for altevogt et al 2003 during the 5 and 12 h transport period respectively moreover except for vertically downward transport at high sf6 source densities see fig 6 the measured sf6 densities at the 35cm port were all very close to zero 3 2 comparison of measured data and model predictions according to the experimental conditions shown in table 3 the simulation results of dgpt and miser were compared with the measurements of our study and the measured results presented in hamamoto et al 2008 and altevogt et al 2003 as mentioned previously the pressure variations observed at the 0 and 5 cm points were 1pa for each transport configuration at high chemical source densities these pressure variations may induce viscous flux components for dense gas transport as coupled transport and or flow equations were solved with fixed total gas pressures at the ends of the soil column dgpt and miser predicted different internal pressure variations as shown in fig 3 in which the increased pressures due to elevation difference set for the model simulation were deducted in order to compare the predicted pressure evolutions with the measured ones for horizontal transport dgpt predicted a decreased pressure along the column with the internal pressure variations decreased with time as shown in fig 3 a where the predicted pressure evolutions were significantly different from the measured results however miser predicted no internal pressure variation for the horizontal transport cases not shown for vertically upward and downward transport the predicted and measured pressure evolutions present the same trend but with different magnitudes of pressure variations particularly pressure differences of 2pa were observed at the ic and the 0 cm point for vertically upward and downward transport respectively however the greatest simulated pressure variations occurred about at the middle of the column due to fixed gas pressure at the end boundaries of the column further the internal pressure variations in the column predicted by miser were over the dgpt results at transient state for vertically downward transport as shown in fig 3 c except for the horizontal transport cases the predicted internal pressure variations kept increased as the measured results presented fig 4 a c indicated the predicted relative sf6 density profiles at the 5 15 and 25 cm points for horizontal transport were fairly consistent with our observations despite the observed and predicted pressure evolutions along the soil column were inconsistent fig 3 a these predictions as well as the results of other sf6 simulated cases were obtained by assigning a constant retardation factor value of 1 9 this setting made the shape of the predicted profiles in the first 3h transient period more consistent with the measured ones however no sorption of sf6 on the dry sea sand was observed in our sorption experiment we suspected the sorption arisen during the transport experiment was due to the acrylic material that the soil column was made of it seems both models still over predicted the sf6 density at the points near the ic in the first 3h this might be due to the nonuniform distribution of the chemical source in the ic as the chemical gas density observed in the ic varied with time the model prediction however was implemented with a fixed molar fraction of chemical gas at the upstream boundary as shown by the profiles indicated as ic at 35cm both models predicted similar density profiles for each of the horizontal transport cases as well as for the cases of other transport directions shown later however the sf6 density was not measurable for the sample taken from this port it is because that the sample was diluted before being analyzed and the diluted sample was not detectable for sf6 further the model predictions closely agreed with the observations for the isohexane and freon 113 transport cases at 15 25 35cm but were over the measurements for the 5 cm profiles in fig 4 d and f for the high source density cases differences between the model predictions are not readily discernible at the low sf6 density source i e fig 4 a however for the high chemical source density cases i e fig 4 b d the chemical density predicted by dgpt is less than the miser result for 10 this is due to different governing equations employed in dgpt and miser as a result that different internal pressure variations predicted in the column for fig 4 e and f the trend of the differences between the model predictions was not consistent with the other horizontal transport cases since different retardation constant values were employed in the dgpt and miser simulations at this stage it seems the chemical gas density profiles were adequately predicted by both models for the horizontal transport cases for vertically upward transport both models over predicted dense gas density at each point as shown in fig 5 except for the low source density case of altevogt et al 2003 i e fig 5 d it seems that the upward movement of dense gas during the experiment in each case was not as fast as the model prediction we suspected it is because of incomplete mixing of chemical gas in the ic and the size of the ic 30l in volume also prolonging the transport of dense gas to the soil column further miser over predicted the gas density more substantially than dgpt even though the predicted internal pressure variations were similar as shown in fig 3 b it showed that the difference between the density profiles predicted by these models for the vertically upward transport case was more discernible than that for the horizontal transport case especially at low source density as diffusion and advection both play important roles on dense gas transport in a soil column a diffusion approach and governing equations employed in a model did affect the dense gas density profile predicted for upward transport scenarios for vertically downward transport fig 6 b and c showed that the model predictions reasonably matched the measured data at the 25 cm point for sf6 transport at median and high source densities at the later time however the model predictions were consistent with the measured data at the early time for freon 113 transport at low chemical source density as shown in fig 6 e the miser results were not shown it seems that the differences between the dgpt and miser predictions were less than those presented for vertically upward transport of sf6 at low and median source densities however for the high source density case fig 6 d shows that miser over predicted the isohexane density profiles more significantly than the dgpt it shows that the downward movement of dense gas in the experiment due to gravitational force induced advection partially balanced by upward transport arisen by elevation difference was slower than the model prediction the differences between the predicted density profiles and between the prediction and measurement may be partially ascribed to different pressure evolutions in the soil column predicted and measured as shown in fig 3 c when soil permeability of the corresponding case was reduced by 50 for isohexane and freon 113 transports the density profiles predicted with dgpt matched the measured data very well as shown in fig 6 d f where the dashed lines present this modification did not make great differences on the profiles shown in fig 6 e for the low source density case as we didn t modify the soil permeability value for the sf6 transport cases this inconsistency may imply that the soil permeability provided in hamamoto et al 2008 and altevogt et al 2003 for the isohexane and freon 113 case respectively is questionable or the downward movement of dense gas was prevented by the column wall more substantially in these cases than that in the sf6 cases this requires investigation of factors affecting downward movement of dense gas in soil columns 3 3 magnitudes of various flux components according to the measured total gas pressures and sf6 densities various flux components of sf6 at low medium and high source densities for different transport configurations were assessed between the 5 and 15 cm ports 4 5h after the startup of the transport experiment the transport parameters are presented in tables 2 and 3 for the computation of the dgm and fickian based diffusive and viscous flux components of sf6 i e eqs 2 3a 3d and 4a the viscous flux component due to total pressure difference arisen from elevation difference for vertical transport was also accounted for in the first term of eq 4a for the two component dgm equations three terms are presented in the total diffusive flux component as shown in eq 2 they are mole fraction gradient total concentration gradient and gravity induced diffusion terms in which the first and second terms partially account for the gas slip the viscous flux component includes the total concentration pressure gradient and gravity terms as shown in eq 4a fig 7 presents the percentage of each term in total flux of sf6 for different ρ c o and transport configurations based on the dgm equations and eq 4a it seems the molar fraction gradient component the first term of eq 2 in the dgm based total diffusion of sf6 is always substantial in the total flux especially for horizontal transport the total concentration gradient component the second term of eq 2 however is negligibly small for each transport configuration gravity induced diffusion the third term of eq 2 is about 2 3 in the total flux of sf6 for vertical transport the gravity induced viscous component the second term of eq 4a is in magnitude about the same as the molar fraction gradient diffusive component for vertically upward transport i e 33 39 in the total flux and dominates over diffusion for vertically downward transport i e 41 72 in the total flux the total pressure gradient viscous component is also important and ranges from 10 to 30 19 to 26 and 18 to 30 in magnitude in the total flux for horizontal vertically upward and downward transport respectively the diffusive flux components of sf6 assessed with different fickian type diffusion expressions i e eqs 3a 3d were compared with the result based on the dgm equations as shown in fig 8 the magnitudes of the diffusive component of sf6 computed with fickian type diffusion expressed in terms of molar concentration mass density and molar fraction gradient are approximately the same but they are greater than the results computed with the mass fraction gradient for 27 99 24 68 and 34 147 for horizontal vertical upward and downward transport respectively and more than one time as much as the dgm results for each transport configuration the great difference between the dgm and fickian based results is caused by the knudsen diffusion coefficient nonequimolar weights and mole fractions of gas components accounted for in the first term of eq 2 of the dgm equations the dgm based diffusive component is mostly the least in magnitude among the results derived from different approaches fig 9 presents the magnitudes of the total fluxes of sf6 derived from different diffusion approaches since diffusion dominated for horizontal transport and the gravity induced viscous component was partially balanced by the total pressure gradient viscous component for vertical transport as shown in fig 7 the trend of the difference between the dgm and fickian based total fluxes of sf6 presented in fig 9 is similar to that shown in fig 8 the dgm based total flux is in magnitude mostly less than the fickian results as the chemical gas density predicted by dgpt is less than the miser result shown in figs 4 6 the fickian based total fluxes of sf6 based on eqs 3a 3c are in magnitude greater than the results based on eq 3d for 26 73 29 98 and 16 26 for horizontal vertically upward and downward transport respectively however they are more than one time one and a half to two times and 14 76 in magnitude as much as the dgm results for horizontal vertically upward and downward transport respectively whatever diffusion dominates horizontal transport or the viscous and diffusive flux components are both substantial vertical transport the dgm based total flux of sf6 is in magnitude greatly less than the fickian results based on eqs 3a 3c for more than one time except at high source densities the viscous component dominates over diffusion similarly a great difference between the dense gas densities predicted by dgpt and miser was presented in the previous section for the vertically upward transport cases 4 conclusions based on the experimental data and model predictions presented and discussed for dense gas transport in 30 to 40cm soil columns at a soil permeability ranging from 10 11 to 10 10 m2 the results indicated that dgpt and miser may obtain similar predictions and adequately predict the dense gas density profiles for the horizontal transport case at low to high source densities for vertically upward transport these models both over predicted the dense gas densities due to incompletely mixing of the dense gas mixture in the ic and the size of the ic prolonging the dense gas transport to the soil column in the transport experiment as the dgpt predictions matched the measured data better than the miser results did the dense gas densities predicted by these models are substantially different even at low source density x c o 0 1 implying that assessing upward transport of organic vapors in unsaturated zones based on different models can have substantial different results whatever the source density is low or high for the vertically downward transport cases the model predictions did not present great differences at low to median source density x c o 0 05 0 19 this indicates that assessment of downward transport of organic vapors in unsaturated zones may not be sensitive to model selection however dgpt and miser both over predicted the dense gas density for the vertically downward transport cases obtained from hamamoto et al 2008 and altevogt et al 2003 at high source density x c o 0 2 as miser predicted the dense gas density substantially different from the dgpt result it is not feasible to greatly adjust the soil permeability value of the corresponding case for a good fit between the model predictions and measurements since the soil permeabilities reported in the literature for these cases were determined independently thus further study will be required to investigate other factors affecting downward transport of dense gas in soil columns use of measured data to compute the magnitude of vapor flux out of a source zone or contaminant plume is necessary for assessing depletion and exposure of subsurface voc contaminants by utilizing the experimentally measured data we found the diffusive flux components of dense gas based on the fickian type diffusion expressions in terms of molar concentration molar fraction or mass density gradient were consistent in magnitude however these results were greater than the ones computed with the mass fraction gradient and the dgm equations for 24 and 100 respectively as such great differences were presented for the diffusive components assessing by different diffusion approaches the corresponding magnitudes of total flux of dense gas were also substantially different not only for the horizontal transport systems diffusion dominating but also for the vertical transport systems where advective and diffusive components were both significant particularly the dgm based total flux of dense gas was in magnitude less than the fickian based result for more than two times for vertically upward transport even at low source density x c o 0 1 as the difference was presented for the dense gas densities

1691,variations of gas phase density are responsible for advective and diffusive transports of organic vapors in unsaturated soils laboratory experiments were conducted to explore dense gas transport sulfur hexafluoride sf6 from different source densities through a nitrogen gas dry soil column gas pressures and sf6 densities at transient state were measured along the soil column for three transport configurations horizontal vertically upward and vertically downward transport these measurements and others reported in the literature were compared with simulation results obtained from two models based on different diffusion approaches the dusty gas model dgm equations and a fickian type molar fraction based diffusion expression the results show that the dgm and fickian based models predicted similar dense gas density profiles which matched the measured data well for horizontal transport of dense gas at low to high source densities despite the pressure variations predicted in the soil column were opposite to the measurements the pressure evolutions predicted by both models were in trend similar to the measured ones for vertical transport of dense gas however differences between the dense gas densities predicted by the dgm and fickian based models were discernible for vertically upward transport of dense gas even at low source densities as the dgm based predictions matched the measured data better than the fickian results did for vertically downward transport the dense gas densities predicted by both models were not greatly different from our experimental measurements but substantially greater than the observations obtained from the literature especially at high source densities further research will be necessary for exploring factors affecting downward transport of dense gas in soil columns use of the measured data to compute flux components of sf6 showed that the magnitudes of diffusive flux component based on the fickian type diffusion expressions in terms of molar concentration molar fraction and mass density fraction gradient were almost the same however they were greater than the result computed with the mass fraction gradient for 24 and the dgm based result for more than one time as a consequence the dgm based total flux of sf6 was in magnitude greatly less than the fickian result not only for horizontal transport diffusion dominating but also for vertical transport advection and diffusion of dense gas particularly the fickian based total flux was more than two times in magnitude as much as the dgm result for vertically upward transport of dense gas keywords gas phase transport gas diffusion advection dusty gas model equations fick s first law density driven transport gravitational effect 1 introduction soil and groundwater contamination by volatile organic compounds vocs is a great environmental risk due to high toxicity in particular voc vapors from nonaqueous phase liquid napl residing in soils or dissolved forms in soil moisture and groundwater migrate and spread more rapidly in unsaturated soils than dissolved forms of vocs in saturated zones since gas diffusion coefficients of organic vapors are several order of magnitude larger than aqueous diffusion coefficients bedient et al 1999 as the popularity of monitored natural attenuation as a subsurface remediation strategy increases a complete understanding and reliable prediction of gas phase transport of vocs under natural conditions are necessary rivett et al 2011 vapor transport in porous systems can be driven by concentration differences and total pressure variations denoted as diffusive dispersive and advective transport respectively these transport mechanisms are usually described with fick s law of diffusion and darcy s law respectively additionally the gravitational force may enhance or suppress the vertically advective transport of organic vapors sleep and sykes 1989 mendoza and frind 1990 lenhard et al 1995 jang and aral 2007 in the past dusty gas model dgm equations were also discussed and applied to relevant problems for the deficit of fick s law of diffusion in representing multicomponent gas transport in unsaturated soils see for example webb 1996 sleep 1998 fen and abriola 2004 and molins and mayer 2007 organic vapors mixed with soil air form a gas mixture with a total density different than the air density based on fick s law of diffusion gas diffusion is driven by gas density variations fen and abriola 2004 showed that mathematical models developed in the past for gas phase transport in unsaturated soils employed different forms of fick s law of diffusion the diffusive dispersive flux component based on fick s law of diffusion hereafter called fickian type diffusion is in a form either in terms of a molar or mass fraction or molar or mass concentration gradient for multicomponent gas transport in porous systems soils nonequimolar effects due to different molecular masses between the air gases and organic vapors are addressed in the dgm equations the fickian type diffusion may not be sufficient to describe diffusive transport of a gas mixture with very different molecular masses in porous systems altevogt et al 2003 presented an alternative way to address the nonequimolar effects they additionally include a slip velocity adopted from jackson 1977 in a standard mass based advective diffusive transport equation and solved the equation for chemical gas density the slip velocity caused by slip flow or called diffusive slip in kramers and kistemaker 1943 accounts for nonequimolar counter diffusion of gases of different molecular masses jackson 1977 showed that the flux component based on the slip velocity is included in the 2 component dgm equations under limited conditions including 1 gas diffusion in the molecular regime i e the mean free path of gas molecules in the order of mean pore size or larger 2 pressure diffusion i e diffusion due to total density variations in space is neglected further an additional diffusive flux component driven by gravitational force was first presented in thorstenson and pollock 1989 in which the dgm theory was also adopted the significance of this component has not yet been delineated in modeling or experimental work advection is mainly driven by total density gas pressure variation in space and gravitational force if gas transport is not horizontal advection driven by gas density is sometimes presumed to be negligibly small in some modeling and or experimental work in cases of no external pressure gradient for example corapcioglu and baehr 1987 jury et al 1990 lenhard et al 1995 hamamoto et al 2008 and cotel et al 2011 thus the modeling work may be only based on the gas phase transport equation for the solution of component molar or mass concentration however gas pressure variations may be induced during gas phase transport due to nonequimolar weights of gas molecules lenhard et al 1995 altevogt et al 2003 such modeling work needs to solve the gas transport equation coupled with flow equation for molar or mass concentration and total pressure or total density or equivalent pressure head as those presented in for example metcalfe and farquhar 1987 rathfelder et al 2000 sleep and sykes 1989 mendoza and frind 1990 and jang and aral 2007 for the solution of the equivalent pressure head it is presumed the dependence of total density of gas mixture on total gas pressure is negligibly small mendoza and frind 1990 pointed out the equivalent pressure head formulation may increase numerical accuracy for scaling the pressure potential to the same magnitude as the elevation potential fen and abriola 2004 found the mass based formulations of these modeling approaches may predict different gas pressure and chemical concentration variations for gas phase chemical transport in one dimensional 1 d porous systems thus it is necessary to investigate the gas pressure and chemical concentration variations in the laboratory to assess the validity of various modeling approaches on predicting gas phase chemical migration in unsaturated soils dense gas transport in porous systems has been investigated in the experimental work of many researchers including lenhard et al 1995 conant et al 1996 altevogt et al 2003 jellali et al 2003 hamamoto et al 2008 and cotel et al 2011 lenhard et al 1995 and jellali et al 2003 measured organic vapor concentration distributions in sand tanks and conant et al 1996 in field lenhard et al 1995 obtained small gas pressure variations in space in their sand tank experiment and did not consider advection in the analysis altevogt et al 2003 hamamoto et al 2008 and cotel et al 2011 carried out transport experiments in soil columns and observed the spatial and temporal variations of chemical vapor gas concentration along the columns altevogt et al 2003 and cotel et al 2011 also observed small gas pressure variations or 1pa in soil columns when chemical gas migrates from a voc source lenhard et al 1995 altevogt et al 2003 and cotel et al 2011 showed gravitational force plays an important role in vertical transport the modeling approaches for the interpretation of the experimental results in their work were all based on fickian type diffusion on a mass or molar basis altevogt et al 2003 also considered the slip component the dgm equations represent a framework for describing multicomponent gas transport processes in porous media and have not fully been verified experimentally in soil systems in addition to measuring gas phase chemical concentration and pressure variations for assessing the magnitudes of diffusive and advective flux components along a soil column the related transport parameters such as effective molecular knudsen diffusion coefficient and soil permeability should be determined independently relevant experiments have been conducted in altevogt et al 2003 and hamamoto et al 2008 for soil air permeability and effective gas diffusion coefficient and in cotel et al 2011 for soil permeability only cotel et al 2011 used the relationship of millington and quirk 1961 to estimate the effective gas diffusion coefficient and considered dispersion these studies estimated the effective gas diffusion coefficient with a fickian type diffusion expression rather than the dgm equations the objective of this study is to assess the dgm and fickian based modeling approaches on predicting dense gas transport a series of transport experiments were conducted to investigate the migration of chemical gas nitrogen mixture along a soil column placed either horizontally or vertically the results of other similar gas phase transport experiments presented in the literature were also compared with the model predictions we also used the measured chemical gas concentrations gas pressure and transport parameters to compute various flux components of dense gas to assess different diffusion approaches on determining the migration rate of gas phase chemical from a source zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical formulations of gas phase transport model for simulating gas phase transport in soil columns 1 d component molar or mass balance equation transport equation is generally utilized assuming a rigid porous matrix single gas flow and no reactions or external sources sinks the transport equation of a gas component i on different bases may be written as cunningham and williams 1980 1a θ a c i t n i t z 0 1b θ a ρ i t g i t z 0 where θ a is gas filled porosity c i and ρ i are the molar

respectively n i t is the sum of total diffusive n i d and viscous fluxes n i v of species i on a molar basis and g i t is the sum of g i d and g i v on a mass basis different theoretical bases for the total diffusive flux component were presented in past modeling work the first is dgm theory here we present the flux component based on the two component dgm equations as 2 n i d d ij e d i k c d

diffusive flux defined in the dgm equations includes three terms the molar fraction gradient total molar concentration gradient and gravity induced ones on the other hand the fickian type diffusion is generally applied to represent diffusive flux component for gas phase transport several different fickian type diffusion expressions have been found including the one in terms of molar concentration gradient molar fraction gradient mass concentration gradient and mass fraction gradient as follows 3a n i d d i c i z 3b or cd i x i z 3c g i d d i ρ i z 3d or ρ d i w i z where ρ ρ 1 ρ 2 is total

where q is volumetric flux or darcy velocity in eq 5c darcy velocity is implicitly representative of the mass average velocity the dgm and fickian type diffusion approaches were assessed in this study two models were applied one is a multidimensional multicomponent dgm based gas phase transport model dgpt developed by fen 2014 another is michigan soil vapor extraction remediation miser a fickian based model developed in abriola et al 1997 dgpt employs a set of coupled component molar balance equations eq 1a for the solution of the molar fraction of gas component i i 1 n 1 and total molar concentration with n is the number of gas components miser employs the coupled flow and transport equations eqs 5c and 1a with a fickian type diffusion expression of eq 3b for the solution of total pressure and the molar fraction of chemical component as mentioned previously the nonequimolar components are not completely included in the governing equations of miser 2 2 transport experiments an experimental system referred to in altevogt et al 2003 and hamamoto et al 2008 for investigating dense gas transport in a porous medium was constructed the system consists of a soil column packed with dry sea sand and two large chambers at each end of the column the soil column is 40cm in length with an inner diameter of 8cm and made of acrylic material the chamber where a dense gas is injected is hereafter called the inlet chamber ic and the other is called the outlet chamber oc the ic and oc are respectively 30l in volume and made of stainless steel fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the system the dry sea sand imported from barcelona has a range of particle sizes between 0 25 and 0 3mm and is classified as medium sand the sand was packed into the column by adding measured amounts of sand about 0 5kg at a time and gently shaking the column and tapping the side of the column to settle the sand in the column until the sand was packed into the entire length of the column the sand packing follows the procedure presented in altevogt et al 2003 we did not add water into the sand column for the transport experiment dense gas transport in the column is under a dry soil condition thus there is no need to consider dissolution of the dense gas in soil moisture the adsorptive effect of the dense gas on the dry soil was however examined and discussed in the next section the dense gas we used in this study is sulfur hexafluoride sf6 sf6 has been known as an inorganic conservative and nonreactive tracer in subsurface studies for the perception that it does not significantly adsorb to solid substrates e g olschewski et al 1995 wilson and mackay 1993 1996 a gaseous voc may have many different features from the sf6 gas in subsurface however use of sf6 to represent a dense gas in the transport experiment may simplify the analysis for only considering transport mechanisms of the dense gas migrating through the soil column we used sf6 to mix with nitrogen gas to form a dense gaseous mixture in the ic nitrogen gas was firstly injected into the ic for several minutes from a nitrogen gas tank at that time one valve on the oc was opened to the air and a plunger in the ic pulled away from the ic face which connects to the column then the injection was gradually stopped and the opened valve on the oc was gradually closed to retain atmospheric pressure on the inside of the system the plunger in the ic was then moved slowly to cover the entrance to the soil column a transport experiment was carried out by initially injecting a volume amount of sf6 into the ic and a similar volume amount of nitrogen gas was withdrawn three gas samples each being 2ml were taken with a syringe from different ports at the ic for measuring the sf6 density which is referred to as the initial sf6 source density ρ c o in the ic low to high ρ c o ranging from 0 19 to 3 9kg m3 was made in the ic for each transport experiment as shown in table 1 the whole system was also maintained at atmospheric pressure by vent tubing on the ic and oc the sf6 density was measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector gc 2014 ecd 2014 shimadzu corp kyoto japan and a 30 long molecular sieve 5a gc plot capillary column catalog no 25463 supelco column and detector temperatures were held at 150 c and 250 c respectively nitrogen 99 999 was used as carrier gas and flow into the gc at a gas pressure of 130kpa with a linear velocity mode and split ratio of 30 set for the gc ecd the column and purge flow was 4 51 and 3ml min respectively a gas sample was injected into the gc ecd at a volume amount of 0 1ml the injection temperature was set at 220 c the next step was to pull away the plunger from the ic face to let the sf6 gas in the ic migrate into the column gas pressure differences were then recorded every half hour with three differential pressure transmitters p1 p2 and p3 as indicated in fig 1 at the ic oc and five ports along the soil column i e 0 5 15 25 35cm from the ic connection to the column see fig 1 the first transmitter p1 furness controls fco332 10 00mbar can only measure pressure variations of 0 01mbar 1pa however during a transport experiment pressure differences between the chamber and each location along the column and between the chamber and the outside of the system were mostly 1pa thus the second p2 furness controls fco332 25 00pa and third transmitters p3 omega px655 15 999pa were essential for measuring pressure differences p2 was fixed at the oc and used to measure the pressure differences between the oc and the ic and between the oc and each port along the column p3 is portable and used to measure the pressure difference between the outside of the system and each port along the column to verify the accuracy of the p2 measurements gas samples were taken every one hour from the ports at the ic and oc and four sampling ports along the soil column i e 5 15 25 35cm from the ic connection to the column see fig 1 the concentration of the sf6 gas at each port was then measured using the gc ecd the pressure recordings and samplings both lasted for 4 5 to 5 5h the samples were all diluted with a 250ml vial 2ml sampled gas plus 248ml nitrogen gas before being injected into the gc ecd for analysis three different transport configurations were considered for dense gas migration in the soil column horizontal transport vertical transport with the ic on the ground transport in the vertically upward direction and vertical transport with the oc on the ground transport in the vertically downward direction the last two were designed to investigate the gravitational effect on the migration of the dense gas mixture 2 3 transport parameters before the transport experiment a batch study was carried out to assess the sorptive effect of the sf6 gas onto dry sea sand for the concentrations of the sf6 gas ranging from 30 to 600 000ppm the study showed the amount of sf6 sorption onto sea sand was negligibly small agreeing with the findings of wilson and mackay 1996 further we conducted single gas flow and equimolar binary gas diffusion experiments to assess soil intrinsic permeability and the obstruction factor for the dgm respectively through a soil column packed with dry sea sand with a porosity of 0 367 0 001 the soil column for the transport experiment was also packed with the dry sea sand and had a porosity of about 0 367 see table 3 the experimental setting and methodology can be referred to in fen et al 2009 2011 the intrinsic permeability of the dry sea sand column was measured by flowing nitrogen gas through the column at eight different gas pressures ranging from 0 8 1 6atm each with flow rates ranging from 2 10 5 to 1 10 4 m3 s intrinsic permeability of the sand column in the single gas flow experiment was estimated to be of an order of 10 11 m2 which is in the permeability range of medium sand todd 1983 the knudsen diffusion coefficients of the gas component n2 and sf6 d n2 k and d sf6 k are both related to soil permeability and were assessed through the correlations provided in reinecke and sleep 2002 and bravo 2007 for air and the relationship of d i k d air k m air m i thorstenson and pollock 1989 for n2 and sf6 table 2 shows the results for the component knudsen diffusion coefficient are of an order of 10 3 m2 s the obstruction factor shown in table 2 was assessed through a binary equimolar gas diffusion experiment with gas pair n2 co and thereby multiplied by the air filled binary molecular diffusion coefficient of gas pair n2 and sf6 d sf6 n2 o to obtain the effective binary molecular diffusion coefficient d sf6 n2 e for the dgm equations the d sf6 n2 e value is of an order of 10 6 m2 s the effective diffusion coefficient of sf6 d sf6 for the fickian type diffusion may be defined to include both of d sf6 n2 e and the knudsen diffusion coefficients of sf6 d sf6 k for a binary equimolar gas transport system see fen and abriola 2004 because d sf6 k or d n2 k is three orders of magnitude greater than d sf6 n2 e in the transport experiment we assigned the d sf6 value as the same as the magnitude of d sf6 n2 e such that the tortuosity factor multiplied by the air filled porosity θ a τ is equivalent to the obstruction factor q m the experimentally determined q m value was also compared with other empirically based results for θ a τ such as those provided in millington and quirk 1961 and moldrup et al 2000 where the empirical equations both express τ as a function of the total and air filled porosities of porous media table 2 shows the experimentally determined q m value is about two times the empirical ones 2 4 model implementation variations in the chemical gas density with time at each sampling point were measured and also predicted with dgpt and miser soil and chemical properties are presented in table 3 and used for model simulation two other experimental results on gas transport studies in altevogt et al 2003 and hamamoto et al 2008 were also compared with the model predictions altevogt et al 2003 packed oso flaco sand in the column and used the chemical freon 113 for the transport experiment and hamamoto et al 2008 used isohexane and two soil media a loam and sand materials in table 1 for each transport experiment at an initial chemical source density ρ c o the indicated mole fraction of the chemical gas x c o is the upstream boundary condition used in the model simulation each x c o value is not necessarily equivalent to the molar fraction of the corresponding ρ c o and was determined according to the averaged measured results at the ic during the transport experiment gas transport in a two dimensional configuration of the soil column was simulated the length of the simulated domain is the column length 40cm in addition to 1cm extended from each end of the column for the boundary settings instead of the 1 cm extension the extension is 5cm from the chemical gas source to the entrance of the soil column for the transport system of hamamoto et al 2008 because isohexane was in liquid form in the container connecting to the soil column in the experiment of hamamoto et al 2008 and the dimension of the container was not clearly stated in the paper we determined the 5 cm extension by changing the length of the extension until a good fit between the predicted and observed chemical gas density profiles at each sampling point was attained for a horizontal transport case see next section for the comparison the lateral boundaries of the simulated domain were impermeable the upstream at the ic and downstream at the oc boundaries were both assigned atmospheric pressures for horizontal transport for vertically downward transport the downstream boundary was assigned a total gas pressure as p p atm ρgz1 where p atm is atmospheric pressure and z1 is the length of soil column to reflect static equilibrium of gas however for vertically upward transport the downstream boundary was assigned atmospheric pressure and the upstream boundary was assigned p p atm ρgz1 as a vertical transport experiment was conducted there was a gas pressure difference of 4 5pa between the two ends of the sand column if the soil column is 40cm in length andρis representative of the density of nitrogen gas the upstream and downstream boundaries were also assigned a fixed molar fraction of chemical gas i e a nonzero constant x c o at the ic and zero as the oc opened to the air time step size used for the transport simulation was adjusted automatically in dgpt and miser according to the convergent criteria set for solution thus the time step size used for the dgpt simulation was 30min and for the miser simulation ranged between 1 and 30min several grid sizes were tested to check numerical stability of model simulations the final choice was a 1 cm grid size for all the simulations retardation due to equilibrium interface mass transfer between the chemical gas and solid phases was considered in the transport experiment of altevogt et al 2003 for the gas mixture of freon 113 and air altevogt et al 2003 adopted a nonlinear isotherm for the gas solid sorption thus as the gas concentration of freon 113 varies spatially and temporally in the transport experiment the retardation factor values along the soil column were also changed the same isotherm was implemented in dgpt we found the magnitudes of the retardation factor were changed between 5 23 and 1 23 according to the simulation results for the transport experiment of altevogt et al 2003 with using dgpt miser however only considers linear isotherm of sorptive behavior for voc vapors we used a constant retardation factor value of 3 2 in miser for simulating the transport experiment of altevogt et al 2003 we further found the highest modeled pore velocity gravity induced estimated from the simulated cases is about 3 24 10 4 m s thus according to whitaker 1999 we may ignore dispersion 3 results and discussions 3 1 transport experiment in the transport experiment the pressure variations observed in the ic and at the 0 cm and 5 cm ports were substantial for three transport configurations especially at high chemical source densities thus the ranges of their magnitudes are summarized in fig 2 the measured results only reflect the pressure variations induced by the dense gas transport in the column the pressure difference presented in the figure is gas pressure relative to the outside pressure of the system i e atmospheric air pressure a negative pressure difference indicates the gas pressure in the system was lower than the outside one and vice versa the results showed the gas pressure responses for dense gas transport in the vertically upward direction were opposite to those for horizontal and vertically downward transports similar pressure responses were also presented in altevogt et al 2003 however the magnitudes of pressure variations observed in our experiments were greater than those in altevogt et al 2003 in which measured pressure differences were all 1pa for their high source density cases the gas pressure increased at the 0 cm and 5 cm points with increased pressure difference as the sf6 source density increased for horizontal and vertically downward transports the gas pressure however decreased at the 0 cm and 5 cm points for vertically upward transport the pressure differences were positive in the ic and increased as the source density increased for the vertically upward transport cases but close to zero for the horizontal and vertically downward transport cases fig 3 presents the pressure evolutions along the soil column at different times for gas transport at high source densities it showed the pressure variation in the soil column increased as the transport time increased during the 5 5 h transport period for each transport configuration relative chemical gas densities presented in figs 4 to 6 are the ratio of the measured chemical gas density and the chemical source density ρ c o at each sampling point and time from the experimental results of hamamoto et al 2008 and altevogt et al 2003 and our experiments in which we selected one set of transport results with low medium and high sf6 source density respectively in these figures the error bars represent the variability of the multiple measured results from a sampling point at a sampling time it showed the chemical gas density in the ic varied from ρ c o with time for our experiments and declined for altevogt et al 2003 during the 5 and 12 h transport period respectively moreover except for vertically downward transport at high sf6 source densities see fig 6 the measured sf6 densities at the 35cm port were all very close to zero 3 2 comparison of measured data and model predictions according to the experimental conditions shown in table 3 the simulation results of dgpt and miser were compared with the measurements of our study and the measured results presented in hamamoto et al 2008 and altevogt et al 2003 as mentioned previously the pressure variations observed at the 0 and 5 cm points were 1pa for each transport configuration at high chemical source densities these pressure variations may induce viscous flux components for dense gas transport as coupled transport and or flow equations were solved with fixed total gas pressures at the ends of the soil column dgpt and miser predicted different internal pressure variations as shown in fig 3 in which the increased pressures due to elevation difference set for the model simulation were deducted in order to compare the predicted pressure evolutions with the measured ones for horizontal transport dgpt predicted a decreased pressure along the column with the internal pressure variations decreased with time as shown in fig 3 a where the predicted pressure evolutions were significantly different from the measured results however miser predicted no internal pressure variation for the horizontal transport cases not shown for vertically upward and downward transport the predicted and measured pressure evolutions present the same trend but with different magnitudes of pressure variations particularly pressure differences of 2pa were observed at the ic and the 0 cm point for vertically upward and downward transport respectively however the greatest simulated pressure variations occurred about at the middle of the column due to fixed gas pressure at the end boundaries of the column further the internal pressure variations in the column predicted by miser were over the dgpt results at transient state for vertically downward transport as shown in fig 3 c except for the horizontal transport cases the predicted internal pressure variations kept increased as the measured results presented fig 4 a c indicated the predicted relative sf6 density profiles at the 5 15 and 25 cm points for horizontal transport were fairly consistent with our observations despite the observed and predicted pressure evolutions along the soil column were inconsistent fig 3 a these predictions as well as the results of other sf6 simulated cases were obtained by assigning a constant retardation factor value of 1 9 this setting made the shape of the predicted profiles in the first 3h transient period more consistent with the measured ones however no sorption of sf6 on the dry sea sand was observed in our sorption experiment we suspected the sorption arisen during the transport experiment was due to the acrylic material that the soil column was made of it seems both models still over predicted the sf6 density at the points near the ic in the first 3h this might be due to the nonuniform distribution of the chemical source in the ic as the chemical gas density observed in the ic varied with time the model prediction however was implemented with a fixed molar fraction of chemical gas at the upstream boundary as shown by the profiles indicated as ic at 35cm both models predicted similar density profiles for each of the horizontal transport cases as well as for the cases of other transport directions shown later however the sf6 density was not measurable for the sample taken from this port it is because that the sample was diluted before being analyzed and the diluted sample was not detectable for sf6 further the model predictions closely agreed with the observations for the isohexane and freon 113 transport cases at 15 25 35cm but were over the measurements for the 5 cm profiles in fig 4 d and f for the high source density cases differences between the model predictions are not readily discernible at the low sf6 density source i e fig 4 a however for the high chemical source density cases i e fig 4 b d the chemical density predicted by dgpt is less than the miser result for 10 this is due to different governing equations employed in dgpt and miser as a result that different internal pressure variations predicted in the column for fig 4 e and f the trend of the differences between the model predictions was not consistent with the other horizontal transport cases since different retardation constant values were employed in the dgpt and miser simulations at this stage it seems the chemical gas density profiles were adequately predicted by both models for the horizontal transport cases for vertically upward transport both models over predicted dense gas density at each point as shown in fig 5 except for the low source density case of altevogt et al 2003 i e fig 5 d it seems that the upward movement of dense gas during the experiment in each case was not as fast as the model prediction we suspected it is because of incomplete mixing of chemical gas in the ic and the size of the ic 30l in volume also prolonging the transport of dense gas to the soil column further miser over predicted the gas density more substantially than dgpt even though the predicted internal pressure variations were similar as shown in fig 3 b it showed that the difference between the density profiles predicted by these models for the vertically upward transport case was more discernible than that for the horizontal transport case especially at low source density as diffusion and advection both play important roles on dense gas transport in a soil column a diffusion approach and governing equations employed in a model did affect the dense gas density profile predicted for upward transport scenarios for vertically downward transport fig 6 b and c showed that the model predictions reasonably matched the measured data at the 25 cm point for sf6 transport at median and high source densities at the later time however the model predictions were consistent with the measured data at the early time for freon 113 transport at low chemical source density as shown in fig 6 e the miser results were not shown it seems that the differences between the dgpt and miser predictions were less than those presented for vertically upward transport of sf6 at low and median source densities however for the high source density case fig 6 d shows that miser over predicted the isohexane density profiles more significantly than the dgpt it shows that the downward movement of dense gas in the experiment due to gravitational force induced advection partially balanced by upward transport arisen by elevation difference was slower than the model prediction the differences between the predicted density profiles and between the prediction and measurement may be partially ascribed to different pressure evolutions in the soil column predicted and measured as shown in fig 3 c when soil permeability of the corresponding case was reduced by 50 for isohexane and freon 113 transports the density profiles predicted with dgpt matched the measured data very well as shown in fig 6 d f where the dashed lines present this modification did not make great differences on the profiles shown in fig 6 e for the low source density case as we didn t modify the soil permeability value for the sf6 transport cases this inconsistency may imply that the soil permeability provided in hamamoto et al 2008 and altevogt et al 2003 for the isohexane and freon 113 case respectively is questionable or the downward movement of dense gas was prevented by the column wall more substantially in these cases than that in the sf6 cases this requires investigation of factors affecting downward movement of dense gas in soil columns 3 3 magnitudes of various flux components according to the measured total gas pressures and sf6 densities various flux components of sf6 at low medium and high source densities for different transport configurations were assessed between the 5 and 15 cm ports 4 5h after the startup of the transport experiment the transport parameters are presented in tables 2 and 3 for the computation of the dgm and fickian based diffusive and viscous flux components of sf6 i e eqs 2 3a 3d and 4a the viscous flux component due to total pressure difference arisen from elevation difference for vertical transport was also accounted for in the first term of eq 4a for the two component dgm equations three terms are presented in the total diffusive flux component as shown in eq 2 they are mole fraction gradient total concentration gradient and gravity induced diffusion terms in which the first and second terms partially account for the gas slip the viscous flux component includes the total concentration pressure gradient and gravity terms as shown in eq 4a fig 7 presents the percentage of each term in total flux of sf6 for different ρ c o and transport configurations based on the dgm equations and eq 4a it seems the molar fraction gradient component the first term of eq 2 in the dgm based total diffusion of sf6 is always substantial in the total flux especially for horizontal transport the total concentration gradient component the second term of eq 2 however is negligibly small for each transport configuration gravity induced diffusion the third term of eq 2 is about 2 3 in the total flux of sf6 for vertical transport the gravity induced viscous component the second term of eq 4a is in magnitude about the same as the molar fraction gradient diffusive component for vertically upward transport i e 33 39 in the total flux and dominates over diffusion for vertically downward transport i e 41 72 in the total flux the total pressure gradient viscous component is also important and ranges from 10 to 30 19 to 26 and 18 to 30 in magnitude in the total flux for horizontal vertically upward and downward transport respectively the diffusive flux components of sf6 assessed with different fickian type diffusion expressions i e eqs 3a 3d were compared with the result based on the dgm equations as shown in fig 8 the magnitudes of the diffusive component of sf6 computed with fickian type diffusion expressed in terms of molar concentration mass density and molar fraction gradient are approximately the same but they are greater than the results computed with the mass fraction gradient for 27 99 24 68 and 34 147 for horizontal vertical upward and downward transport respectively and more than one time as much as the dgm results for each transport configuration the great difference between the dgm and fickian based results is caused by the knudsen diffusion coefficient nonequimolar weights and mole fractions of gas components accounted for in the first term of eq 2 of the dgm equations the dgm based diffusive component is mostly the least in magnitude among the results derived from different approaches fig 9 presents the magnitudes of the total fluxes of sf6 derived from different diffusion approaches since diffusion dominated for horizontal transport and the gravity induced viscous component was partially balanced by the total pressure gradient viscous component for vertical transport as shown in fig 7 the trend of the difference between the dgm and fickian based total fluxes of sf6 presented in fig 9 is similar to that shown in fig 8 the dgm based total flux is in magnitude mostly less than the fickian results as the chemical gas density predicted by dgpt is less than the miser result shown in figs 4 6 the fickian based total fluxes of sf6 based on eqs 3a 3c are in magnitude greater than the results based on eq 3d for 26 73 29 98 and 16 26 for horizontal vertically upward and downward transport respectively however they are more than one time one and a half to two times and 14 76 in magnitude as much as the dgm results for horizontal vertically upward and downward transport respectively whatever diffusion dominates horizontal transport or the viscous and diffusive flux components are both substantial vertical transport the dgm based total flux of sf6 is in magnitude greatly less than the fickian results based on eqs 3a 3c for more than one time except at high source densities the viscous component dominates over diffusion similarly a great difference between the dense gas densities predicted by dgpt and miser was presented in the previous section for the vertically upward transport cases 4 conclusions based on the experimental data and model predictions presented and discussed for dense gas transport in 30 to 40cm soil columns at a soil permeability ranging from 10 11 to 10 10 m2 the results indicated that dgpt and miser may obtain similar predictions and adequately predict the dense gas density profiles for the horizontal transport case at low to high source densities for vertically upward transport these models both over predicted the dense gas densities due to incompletely mixing of the dense gas mixture in the ic and the size of the ic prolonging the dense gas transport to the soil column in the transport experiment as the dgpt predictions matched the measured data better than the miser results did the dense gas densities predicted by these models are substantially different even at low source density x c o 0 1 implying that assessing upward transport of organic vapors in unsaturated zones based on different models can have substantial different results whatever the source density is low or high for the vertically downward transport cases the model predictions did not present great differences at low to median source density x c o 0 05 0 19 this indicates that assessment of downward transport of organic vapors in unsaturated zones may not be sensitive to model selection however dgpt and miser both over predicted the dense gas density for the vertically downward transport cases obtained from hamamoto et al 2008 and altevogt et al 2003 at high source density x c o 0 2 as miser predicted the dense gas density substantially different from the dgpt result it is not feasible to greatly adjust the soil permeability value of the corresponding case for a good fit between the model predictions and measurements since the soil permeabilities reported in the literature for these cases were determined independently thus further study will be required to investigate other factors affecting downward transport of dense gas in soil columns use of measured data to compute the magnitude of vapor flux out of a source zone or contaminant plume is necessary for assessing depletion and exposure of subsurface voc contaminants by utilizing the experimentally measured data we found the diffusive flux components of dense gas based on the fickian type diffusion expressions in terms of molar concentration molar fraction or mass density gradient were consistent in magnitude however these results were greater than the ones computed with the mass fraction gradient and the dgm equations for 24 and 100 respectively as such great differences were presented for the diffusive components assessing by different diffusion approaches the corresponding magnitudes of total flux of dense gas were also substantially different not only for the horizontal transport systems diffusion dominating but also for the vertical transport systems where advective and diffusive components were both significant particularly the dgm based total flux of dense gas was

1692,an understanding of nano scale bubble nb transport in porous media is important for potential application of nbs in soil groundwater remediation it is expected that the solution chemistry of nb water highly influences the surface characteristics of nbs and porous media and the interaction between them thus affecting the stability and transport characteristics of nb in this study in addition to stability experiments one dimensional column transport experiments using glass beads were conducted to investigate the effects of ph on the nb transport behavior the results showed that the nbs were more stable under higher ph column transport experiments revealed that entrapment of nbs especially larger ones was enhanced in lower ph water likely suggesting ph dependent nb attachment and physical straining both of which are also probably influenced by bubble size although relatively smaller nbs were released after switching the eluting fluid to one with lower ionic strength most of the nbs in lower ph water were still retained in the porous media even altering the chemical condition keywords nano bubble nb solution chemistry transport porous media 1 introduction it is known that nano scale bubbles nbs which are typically negatively charged can exist in aqueous solutions for prolonged periods ushikubo et al 2010 nbs have shown potentials for use in water treatment by flotation burns et al 1997 khuntia et al 2012 in sterilization applying ozone gas li and tsuge 2006 as a contrast agent for ultrasonography blomley et al 2001 and for accelerating the metabolism in shellfishes and vegetables park and kurata 2009 there have considerable potentials of nbs for the soil remediation polluted by organic chemicals in combination with bioremediation choi et al 2008 jauregi and varley 1999 jenkins et al 1993 the nbs should be small to permit their transport through pore spaces and they should have a long lifetime and high resistance to coalescing wan et al 2001 the potential advantages of nb injection include promoting aerobic conditions for bioremediation and contaminant sorption onto the bubbles for subsequent removal with moving bubbles tsai et al 2007 the gaseous interior of microbubbles serves as a sink for vapor phase partitioning and removal of volatile organic contaminants an understanding of the nbs transport characteristics in soil is required for successful soil remediation using nbs however there are few fundamental studies on nb behavior in porous media using nano to micro scale bubbles 0 7 20μm stabilized by surfactants wan et al 2001 conducted column transport experiments using different size fractions of quartz sand larger effluent of fine bubbles was observed for coarser sand 415 500μm than for finer sand 53 106μm they also applied one dimensional convection dispersion equation with first order attachment against the measured effluent curves of bubble concentration as a function of time showing good agreements between the measured and predicted curves hamamoto et al 2017 investigated the effects of flow rate and gas species on nb transport where one dimensional column transport experiments using 0 1 mm glass beads were conducted the results revealed that marked entrapment of nbs inside the column and the entrapment was enhanced for air based nbs under lower flow rates those previous studies showed that nbs behave like colloidal particles in porous media it is well known that colloid transport is highly influenced by solution chemistry i e ph condition or ionic strength ryan et al 1999 tufenkji and elimelech 2004 zhou et al 2011 the ph of the solution strongly affects the surface charges of colloid particles and collectors i e grains resulting in significant effects on the colloid retention on the collectors increased retention at lower ph or higher ionic strength is expected which is attributed to decreasing repulsive surface interaction energies between colloids and between colloids and grain surfaces grolimund et al 1998 switching the eluting fluid to one with a lower ionic strength or higher ph enhances colloid release due to increased electrostatic repulsion and a corresponding increase in the double layer thickness ryan and elimelech 1996 based on the column transport experiments of water dispersible soil colloids using repacked quartz sand zhou et al 2011 concluded that the colloid collision efficiency i e colloid deposition decreased as the ph of the bulk solution increased and that a naoh solution at ph11 played a predominant role on the mobilization of retained colloids deposited in the quartz sand thus there have been studies on the effects of solution chemistry on the transport of colloidal particles in porous media but few on nb transport and nb stability although production techniques and measurements characterization techniques for nbs have been developed in recent years a theoretical understanding of nb stability is still under investigation alheshibri et al 2016 parmar and majumder 2013 in this study in addition to the nb stability experiment column transport experiments of nbs using glass beads as a model porous media were conducted nbs created by oxygen at different ph conditions were injected into the column the effects of the ph of the applied nb solution on nb stability and transport in the saturated porous media were investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials nbs were produced by a pressurized dissolution method fzin 10 i idec co ltd japan in this method gas o2 was allowed to dissolve in water by applying a pressure of approximately 300kpa and water was flushed through a nozzle inside the water pool the supersaturated condition was released due to the reduction in the pressure into the expelled water in the form of bubbles pure water was used for producing the nbs the nb generator was operated for 70min against 10l of water fig 1 shows the water and nb properties with running time of the production device the turbidity and dissolved oxygen do were measured by a turbidity meter hi 93414 hanna instruments inc and a portable fluorescence do meter ysi proodo ysi nanotech ltd respectively the zeta ζ potential of the nbs was measured by a zeta potential analyzer zeecom microtech co ltd the bubble size diameter distributions and the concentrations of nb water were measured using a resonant mass measurement archimedes malvern instruments ltd kobayashi et al 2014 the resonant mass measurement method detects and counts fine particles including bubbles in solution at the center of this measuring instrument is a microelectromechanical system mems sensor equipped with a resonant cantilever in which a microfluidic channel is embedded if any bubbles of lower density than the liquid pure water in this case pass through the channel to reach the tip of the cantilever the resonant frequency of the cantilever shifts toward the high frequency side due to the mass change by such bubbles thus the resonant mass measurement method can distinguish between fine particles and bubbles and directly measure bubble concentration i e the number of bubbles per milliliter the bubble size distributions were calculated based on the mass of each bubble and its density as shown in fig 1a with increasing running time the turbidity and do increased whereas the ph remained almost constant at approximately 6 the maximum do was 60mg l which is approximately 7 times higher than saturated do at 30 c the decrease in do after 45min is likely due to increased water temperature bubble concentration also increased with increasing running time whereas the ζ potential did not show any trends 29 5mv in this study nb water at 60min of running time was used for the stability and column transport experiments as the original nb water glass beads toshin riko co ltd japan composed of silicon dioxide 70 73 sodium oxide and potassium oxide 13 16 calcium oxide 7 12 magnesium oxide 1 4 aluminum oxide 0 5 1 5 ferric oxide 0 1 0 15 and residuals 1 0 with particle sizes of 0 1mm were used as the model porous media in the column transport experiments the particle density of the glass beads was 2 48gcm 3 as measured by a pycnometer the glass beads were soaked in 0 1n hno3 for 24h and thoroughly rinsed with pure water before conducting the column transport experiments the ζ potentials of the nbs and glass beads at different ph conditions were measured the ph and ionic strength of the nb water were adjusted either from 6 down to 3 using hcl or from 6 up to 11 using naoh and to 1mm adjusted by nacl respectively using the original nb water the ζ potential of the glass beads was measured in the laboratory using streaming potential measurements zetacad cad instruments france where electrolyte solutions with an ionic strength of 1mm adjusted by nacl at different ph ranging from 3 to 11 adjusted by hcl or naoh were used for the measurements 2 2 stability experiments the ph of the original nb water was adjusted to either 5 using hcl 1mm or 11 using naoh 1mm soon after the date when the nb water was generated using the nb water with ph5 and 11 stability experiments were conducted each nb water was stored in airtight 50ml polypropylene bottles without any headspace in a climate controlled room room temperature 25 c after 1 4 7 12 and 18days from the date when each nb water sample was prepared the chemical and bubble properties of the nb water i e turbidity ph do bubble concentration bubble size distribution and ζ potential were measured stored nb water bottles were opened and used for the measurements at each stored period duplicate measurements were performed 2 3 column transport experiments in the column transport experiments nb water with three different ph conditions ph 5 8 11 was prepared the ph of the nb water was adjusted by adding hcl ph5 nahco3 ph8 and naoh ph11 to the original nb water the ionic strength of each nb water was adjusted to 1mm by adding nacl these adjustments were performed soon after the date when the nb water generated and the nb water was kept one day in the climate controlled room for the stabilization before start of the column transport experiments in the same manner electrolyte solutions of ph5 8 and 11 with an ionic strength of 1mm were prepared each electrolyte solution was used as a reference solution against the nb water with the same ph fig 2 shows the bubble size distributions for the nb water at each ph condition the bubble concentrations were similar for nb water with different ph conditions around 2 5 105 particles ml bubble size distributions for all nb water ranged from 140nm to 400nm and showed a peak at approximately 180nm the column transport experiments were performed in the climate controlled room and the procedures were generally followed those of hamamoto et al 2017 the acrylic column internal diameters of 5 0cm and heights of 10 1cm was prepared by joining 5 acrylic cylindrical rings with heights of 2cm fig 3 nylon fibers with 70 μm mesh spacing were placed at the bottom and top of each column to prevent the loss of glass beads each column was repacked with glass beads under water saturation resulting in a dry bulk density of 1 57gcm 3 and a total porosity of 0 37cm3 cm 3 after packing the columns were flushed with a 1mm hcl solution ph of 3 applied permitting na2o and cao dissolution near the glass surface to take place without raising the solution ph to levels where the silica matrix would also dissolve litton and olson 1993 after the rinse an electrolyte solution reference solution was applied using a peristaltic pump until ph electric conductivity ec and turbidity of the effluent were steady after this equilibration nb water was applied for 5 pore volumes i e 5 times volume of the pore volume in the column after the nb water injection the reference solution for 5 5 pore volumes and finally pure water for 8 pore volumes were applied to the columns the transport experiments were performed under a constant darcy velocity of 5 9 10 3 cms 1 the effluents were collected at intervals of approximately 0 3 pore volumes throughout the transport experiments with the sampling started one pore volume before nb water injection the ph ec and turbidity for all samples and the bubble size distributions for some selected samples were measured fig 4 shows the relation between the turbidity of the nb water at ph8 and the bubble concentration obtained by resonant mass measurements a clear linear relation between the two parameters was obtained the similar linear relation was also obtained for the nb water at different ph conditions therefore the turbidity was considered to represent the bubble concentration in this study 2 4 transport model for nbs in porous media hamamoto et al 2017 applied a convection dispersion equation with attachment detachment and straining terms to the micro and nano bubble transport in the repacked glass beads they also suggested convection dispersion equation including only bubble attachment could well capture the obtained effluent curves for the bubble transport at high flow condition since the column transport experiments in this study were performed at the same experimental conditions with hamamoto et al 2017 in regard to the repacked material and flow condition i e high flow condition the one dimensional transport nb equation with only attachment term was applied to the measured effluent curves of nb given by 1 θc t z θd c z qc z θ k att c where c l 3 is the nb concentration in the aqueous phase at distance z l and time t t θ l3 l 3 is the volumetric water content d l2 t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient q l t 1 is the volumetric flux density of nb k att t 1 is the first order nb attachment coefficient the above model was solved to simulate nb water in the porous media the hydrus 1d computer code was used for the calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 ζ potentials of nbs and glass beads as shown in fig 5 with increasing ph the ζ potential of the glass beads decreased i e more negatively charged on the surface due to the dissociation of the silanol groups on the glass beads rodier and dodds 1995 in addition the nbs were negatively charged over all ph ranges and the ζ potential decreased with increasing ph the negative charge on the bubble surface is believed to be due to the preferential adsorption of oh ions calgaroto et al 2014 takahashi 2005 an isoelectric point was located at approximately ph3 similar charge characteristics of nbs were also reported in the previous studies calgaroto et al 2014 najafi et al 2007 the decrease of ζ potential with ph was more significant for the glass beads than for the nbs suggesting more repulsive interactions between the glass beads and nbs at higher ph conditions 3 2 stability of nb water fig 6a and b show the time series of ph do turbidity ζ potential and bubble concentration for the nb water at ph5 and ph11 respectively there were no significant changes of ph during the stored periods up to 18days but do decreased to approximately 8mg l suggesting o2 diffusion from the nb water through the polypropylene bottles turbidity for both nb water more significantly at ph5 decreased the ζ potentials for both nb water samples were variable ph5 21 2 5mv ph11 47 4 9mv but did not show any clear trend during the stored periods bubble concentrations for the nb water at ph5 decreased with increasing time whereas those at ph11 remained almost constant fig 6c and d show the time series of bubble size distributions for nbs at ph5 and ph8 respectively as shown in fig 6c after 7days most of smaller 200nm nbs at ph5 almost disappeared whereas bubble size distributions of ph11 on different days were similar and nbs existed in water even 18days later jin et al 2007 investigated how ph can influence the formation of stable nbs in aqueous solutions of r cyclodextrin r cd they revealed that for a given ionic strength the nbs were more stable in alkaline solution because the adsorption of more oh ions at the gas water interface enhanced the double layer repulsion resulting in a repulsive force to prevent bubble aggregation and coalescence thus nbs at ph11 are more stable than those at ph5 which is attributed to the greater negative charge on the bubble surface although the bubble concentration of the nb water at ph5 decreased with time we assumed this disappearance is negligible during the column transport experiments since applied nbs flow out of the column around 12 mins later after the injection based on the applied darcy velocity 3 3 transport characteristics of nbs at different ph conditions fig 7a illustrates the breakthrough and breakdown curves for nbs at different ph conditions relative turbidity measured turbidity in the effluent turbidity in the applied nb water as a function of pore volume after the start of effluent collection is shown for each experiment the initial breakthroughs and breakdowns for nbs occurred simultaneously the peak effluent concentrations for nbs at ph11 were close to 1 0 whereas those for nbs at ph8 and ph5 were approximately 0 75 and 0 2 respectively the results indicate the effects of ph on the transport characteristics for nbs i e extent of deposition of nbs to the glass bead surface the effluent relative turbidities were lower at lower ph as shown in fig 5 with decreasing ph the ζ potentials of both the nbs and the glass beads increased i e less negative charge on the surfaces this reduced the repulsive force between the nbs and the glass beads causing more attachment of nbs onto the surfaces of the glass beads on the other hand the results imply nbs at ph11 were not retained in the porous media similar results have been obtained for ph effects on colloid transport experiments in porous media e g zhou et al 2011 one dimensional convection dispersion equation with only attachment term eq 1 was applied to the obtained effluent curves where dispersion coefficient d in eq 1 was used as a value in hamamoto et al 2017 the equation could well capture the obtained effluent curves at each ph condition it indicates that detachment process was negligible during nb water and subsequent reference solution injections significantly higher attachment coefficient k att was obtained in the effluent curve at lower ph the value of k att 0 029min 1 at ph8 was higher than the one 0 020min 1 in hamamoto et al 2017 where relatively larger nbs on average around 300nm at ph8 were applied to the same repacked glass beads with the same manner in this study since zeta potential of nb 47mv used in hamamoto et al 2017 was lower than the one 34mv in fig 5 used in this study repulsive force between nb and glass beads might be larger in hamamoto et al 2017 resulting in lower k att fig 7b shows the relative effluent turbidity and ec after the pure water injection following the application of the nb water at ph5 and ph8 it is noted that in the pure water injection experiments increases of effluent turbidity were not observed for the nb water at ph11 the ec dramatically decreased after approximately one pore volume indicating that the fluid throughout the whole column was replaced by pure water from the reference solution a rapid increase of relative effluent turbidities was observed for the experiments nb water at ph5 and ph8 accompanied by the decrease of ec the turbidities decreased after the peak with increasing pore volumes thus the effluent concentrations of nbs after the injection of pure water confirmed that nbs were trapped inside the column during the injection of nb water at ph5 and 8 and that a decrease of ionic strength in the aqueous phase could enhance the detachment of nbs it is well known that ionic strength also has strong effects on the colloid transport in the porous media and that a decrease of ionic strength increases the repulsive electrostatic interactions between the colloid and the solid phase bradford and torkzaban 2008 as expected by fig 7a a greater number of nbs were released under ph5 conditions the cumulative relative turbidities representing the total amounts of nbs in the influent dotted line and effluent solid lines were calculated based on the turbidity of the applied nb water and the obtained effluent curves fig 7 for nbs at ph11 the cumulative relative turbidity at the effluent after 9 pore volumes was close to that at the influent fig 8 suggesting that the influent and effluent amounts of nbs were balanced assuming difference between the cumulative relative influent turbidity and the cumulative relative effluent turbidity represents nbs retained in the porous media approximately 32 and 85 of applied the nbs at ph8 and ph5 respectively were retained during nb water and subsequent reference solution injections fig 8 at approximately 9 pore volumes after the pure water injection the retention ratio decreased to 15 and 64 for ph8 and ph5 respectively these results may indicate that strong nb attachment to the glass beads occurred during nb water injection in the porous media at lower ph conditions bubble size distributions at the plateau in the obtained effluent curves at the 6 pore volume in fig 7a were compared with those of applied nb water fig 9a shows the relative bubble concentration as a function of bubble size where bubble size distributions at the plateau were normalized by the ones at the influent for nb water at ph11 on average the relative bubble concentration was almost 1 0 and the size of effluent nbs ranged from 150nm to 380nm although the line slightly declines likely due to the data variability again this result suggests that applied nbs traveled through the porous media without any significant retention on the other hand for nb water at ph5 and ph8 the relative bubble concentration decreased as expected by fig 7a and a greater decrease was observed for larger nbs for nb water at ph5 nbs larger than 250nm were not observed in the effluent these results indicate that nb attachments to the glass beads are dependent on the bubble size and larger nbs are more favorable for the attachment including a physical trapping especially at lower ph conditions one of the attractive forces between nbs and glass beads may occur because of ph dependent chemical heterogeneity on the glass bead surface positive charge caused by metal oxide song et al 1994 in a previous study on colloid transport it was found that the influence of chemical heterogeneity depends on the colloid size as well as on the solution ph bradford and torkzaban 2013 in addition previous studies have shown that even nano sized colloids are strained trapped in down gradient pore throats in porous media raychoudhury et al 2014 it is considered that the collector and colloid sizes i e the ratio of colloid diameter to collector diameter are dominant factors affecting the straining bradford et al 2006 also pointed out that solution chemistry plays an important role in straining because it influences the force balance associated with colloids in pores due to gravity buoyancy fluid drag double layer interaction and van der waals attraction thus physicochemical i e attachment driven by chemical heterogeneity on the glass beads and physical i e straining attachment mechanisms might enhance the retention of nbs with larger sizes at lower ph during nb water injection similar to fig 9a bubble size distributions at the peak turbidity after pure water injection were compared with those of applied nb water fig 9b shows the relative bubble concentration as a function of bubble size where bubble size distributions at the peak turbidity were normalized by those at the influent as shown in fig 9b the relative bubble concentration was higher for smaller nbs indicating smaller nbs were more easily released after pure water injection in addition for nb water at ph5 nbs ranging in size from 250nm to 300nm were released although nbs larger than 300nm were still retained in the media thus larger nbs retained during nb water injection were mobilized by decreasing ionic strength in the fluid whereas nbs larger than 300nm were still retained in the porous media and partially contributed the strong nb retention fig 8 4 conclusions the effects of the ph of nb water on the stability and transport characteristics of nbs in saturated porous media were investigated for nbs at higher ph significant changes in the bubble size distributions and concentrations were not observed even 18days from the production nbs in higher ph were more stable in water because the surface charge of the nbs became more negative column transport experiments for the nbs revealed that with decreasing ph the entrapment of nbs with especially larger sizes was enhanced likely suggesting ph and size dependent attachment caused by chemical heterogeneity on the glass beads and physical straining of nbs in addition to a reduction of the repulsive force between the glass beads and nbs at lower ph retained nbs were released by decreasing the ionic strength of the applied solution where relatively smaller nbs were released further investigations are required for understanding the retention mechanism of nbs including physiochemical attachment and physical straining using nbs and porous media with variable sizes and different treatments and the stability and transport characteristics of nbs under different solution chemistry

transport experiments with the sampling started one pore volume before nb water injection the ph ec and turbidity for all samples and the bubble size distributions for some selected samples were measured fig 4 shows the relation between the turbidity of the nb water at ph8 and the bubble concentration obtained by resonant mass measurements a clear linear relation between the two parameters was obtained the similar linear relation was also obtained for the nb water at different ph conditions therefore the turbidity was considered to represent the bubble concentration in this study 2 4 transport model for nbs in porous media hamamoto et al 2017 applied a convection dispersion equation with attachment detachment and straining terms to the micro and nano bubble transport in the repacked glass beads they also suggested convection dispersion equation including only bubble attachment could well capture the obtained effluent curves for the bubble transport at high flow condition since the column transport experiments in this study were performed at the same experimental conditions with hamamoto et al 2017 in regard to the repacked material and flow condition i e high flow condition the one dimensional transport nb equation with only attachment term was applied to the measured effluent curves of nb given by 1 θc t z θd c z qc z θ k att c where c l 3 is the nb concentration in the aqueous phase at distance z l and time t t θ l3 l 3 is the volumetric water content d l2 t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient q l t 1 is the volumetric flux density of nb k att t 1 is the first order nb attachment coefficient the above model was solved to simulate nb water in the porous media the hydrus 1d computer code was used for the calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 ζ potentials of nbs and glass beads as shown in fig 5 with increasing ph the ζ potential of the glass beads decreased i e more negatively charged on the surface due to the dissociation of the silanol groups on the glass beads rodier and dodds 1995 in addition the nbs were negatively charged over all ph ranges and the ζ potential decreased with increasing ph the negative charge on the bubble surface is believed to be due to the preferential adsorption of oh ions calgaroto et al 2014 takahashi 2005 an isoelectric point was located at approximately ph3 similar charge characteristics of nbs were also reported in the previous studies calgaroto et al 2014 najafi et al 2007 the decrease of ζ potential with ph was more significant for the glass beads than for the nbs suggesting more repulsive interactions between the glass beads and nbs at higher ph conditions 3 2 stability of nb water fig 6a and b show the time series of ph do turbidity ζ potential and bubble concentration for the nb water at ph5 and ph11 respectively there were no significant changes of ph during the stored periods up to 18days but do decreased to approximately 8mg l suggesting o2 diffusion from the nb water through the polypropylene bottles turbidity for both nb water more significantly at ph5 decreased the ζ potentials for both nb water samples were variable ph5 21 2 5mv ph11 47 4 9mv but did not show any clear trend during the stored periods bubble concentrations for the nb water at ph5 decreased with increasing time whereas those at ph11 remained almost constant fig 6c and d show the time series of bubble size distributions for nbs at ph5 and ph8 respectively as shown in fig 6c after 7days most of smaller 200nm nbs at ph5 almost disappeared whereas bubble size distributions of ph11 on different days were similar and nbs existed in water even 18days later jin et al 2007 investigated how ph can influence the formation of stable nbs in aqueous solutions of r cyclodextrin r cd they revealed that for a given ionic strength the nbs were more stable in alkaline solution because the adsorption of more oh ions at the gas water interface enhanced the double layer repulsion resulting in a repulsive force to prevent bubble aggregation and coalescence thus nbs at ph11 are more stable than those at ph5 which is attributed to the greater negative charge on the bubble surface although the bubble concentration of the nb water at ph5 decreased with time we assumed this disappearance is negligible during the column transport experiments since applied nbs flow out of the column around 12 mins later after the injection based on the applied darcy velocity 3 3 transport characteristics of nbs at different ph conditions fig 7a illustrates the breakthrough and breakdown curves for nbs at different ph conditions relative turbidity measured turbidity in the effluent turbidity in the applied nb water as a function of pore volume after the start of effluent collection is shown for each experiment the initial breakthroughs and breakdowns for nbs occurred simultaneously the peak effluent concentrations for nbs at ph11 were close to 1 0 whereas those for nbs at ph8 and ph5 were approximately 0 75 and 0 2 respectively the results indicate the effects of ph on the transport characteristics for nbs i e extent of deposition of nbs to the glass bead surface the effluent relative turbidities were lower at lower ph as shown in fig 5 with decreasing ph the ζ potentials of both the nbs and the glass beads increased i e less negative charge on the surfaces this reduced the repulsive force between the nbs and the glass beads causing more attachment of nbs onto the surfaces of the glass beads on the other hand the results imply nbs at ph11 were not retained in the porous media similar results have been obtained for ph effects on colloid transport experiments in porous media e g zhou et al 2011 one dimensional convection dispersion equation with only attachment term eq 1 was applied to the obtained effluent curves where dispersion coefficient d in eq 1 was used as a value in hamamoto et al 2017 the equation could well capture the obtained effluent curves at each ph condition it indicates that detachment process was negligible during nb water and subsequent reference solution injections significantly higher attachment coefficient k att was obtained in the effluent curve at lower ph the value of k att 0 029min 1 at ph8 was higher than the one 0 020min 1 in hamamoto et al 2017 where relatively larger nbs on average around 300nm at ph8 were applied to the same repacked glass beads with the same manner in this study since zeta potential of nb 47mv used in hamamoto et al 2017 was lower than the one 34mv in fig 5 used in this study repulsive force between nb and glass beads might be larger in hamamoto et al 2017 resulting in lower k att fig 7b shows the relative effluent turbidity and ec after the pure water injection following the application of the nb water at ph5 and ph8 it is noted that in the pure water injection experiments increases of effluent turbidity were not observed for the nb water at ph11 the ec dramatically decreased after approximately one pore volume indicating that the fluid throughout the whole column was replaced by pure water from the reference solution a rapid increase of relative effluent turbidities was observed for the experiments nb water at ph5 and ph8 accompanied by the decrease of ec the turbidities decreased after the peak with increasing pore volumes thus the effluent concentrations of nbs after the injection of pure water confirmed that nbs were trapped inside the column during the injection of nb water at ph5 and 8 and that a decrease of ionic strength in the aqueous phase could enhance the detachment of nbs it is well known that ionic strength also has strong effects on the colloid transport in the porous media and that a decrease of ionic strength increases the repulsive electrostatic interactions between the colloid and the solid phase bradford and torkzaban 2008 as expected by fig 7a a greater number of nbs were released under ph5 conditions the cumulative relative turbidities representing the total amounts of nbs in the influent dotted line and effluent solid lines were calculated based on the turbidity of the applied nb water and the obtained effluent curves fig 7 for nbs at ph11 the cumulative relative turbidity at the effluent after 9 pore volumes was close to that at the influent fig 8 suggesting that the influent and effluent amounts of nbs were balanced assuming difference between the cumulative relative influent turbidity and the cumulative relative effluent turbidity represents nbs retained in the porous media approximately 32 and 85 of applied the nbs at ph8 and ph5 respectively were retained during nb water and subsequent reference solution injections fig 8 at approximately 9 pore volumes after the pure water injection the retention ratio decreased to 15 and 64 for ph8 and ph5 respectively these results may indicate that strong nb attachment to the glass beads occurred during nb water injection in the porous media at lower ph conditions bubble size distributions at the plateau in the obtained effluent curves at the 6 pore volume in fig 7a were compared with those of applied nb water fig 9a shows the relative bubble concentration as a function of bubble size where bubble size distributions at the plateau were normalized by the ones at the influent for nb water at ph11 on average the relative bubble concentration was almost 1 0 and the size of effluent nbs ranged from 150nm to 380nm although the line slightly declines likely due to the data variability again this result suggests that applied nbs traveled through the porous media without any significant retention on the other hand for nb water at ph5 and ph8 the relative bubble concentration decreased as expected by fig 7a and a greater decrease was observed for larger nbs for nb water at ph5 nbs larger than 250nm were not observed in the effluent these results indicate that nb attachments to the glass beads are dependent on the bubble size and larger nbs are more favorable for the attachment including a physical trapping especially at lower ph conditions one of the attractive forces between nbs and glass beads may occur because of ph dependent chemical heterogeneity on the glass bead surface positive charge caused by metal oxide song et al 1994 in a previous study on colloid transport it was found that the influence of chemical heterogeneity depends on the colloid size as well as on the solution ph bradford and torkzaban 2013 in addition previous studies have shown that even nano sized colloids are strained trapped in down gradient pore throats in porous media raychoudhury et al 2014 it is considered that the collector and colloid sizes i e the ratio of colloid diameter to collector diameter are dominant factors affecting the straining bradford et al 2006 also pointed out that solution chemistry plays an important role in straining because it influences the force balance associated with colloids in pores due to gravity buoyancy fluid drag double layer interaction and van der waals attraction thus physicochemical i e attachment driven by chemical heterogeneity on the glass beads and physical i e straining attachment mechanisms might enhance the retention of nbs with larger sizes at lower ph during nb water injection similar to fig 9a bubble size distributions at the peak turbidity after pure water injection were compared with those of applied nb water fig 9b shows the relative bubble concentration as a function of bubble size where bubble size distributions at the peak turbidity were normalized by those at the influent as shown in fig 9b the relative bubble concentration was higher for smaller nbs indicating smaller nbs were more easily released after pure water injection in addition for nb water at ph5 nbs ranging in size from 250nm to 300nm were released although nbs larger than 300nm were still retained in the media thus larger nbs retained during nb water injection were mobilized by decreasing ionic strength in the fluid whereas nbs larger than 300nm were still retained in the porous media and partially contributed the strong nb retention fig 8 4 conclusions the effects of the ph of nb water on the stability and transport characteristics of nbs in saturated porous media were investigated for nbs at higher ph significant changes in the bubble size distributions and concentrations were not observed even 18days from the production nbs in higher ph were more stable in water because the surface charge of the nbs became more negative column transport experiments for the nbs revealed that with decreasing ph the entrapment of nbs with especially larger sizes was enhanced likely suggesting ph and size dependent attachment caused by chemical heterogeneity on the glass beads and physical straining of nbs in addition to a reduction of the repulsive force between the glass beads and nbs at lower ph retained nbs were released by decreasing the ionic strength of the applied solution where relatively smaller nbs were released further investigations are required for understanding the retention mechanism of nbs including physiochemical attachment and physical straining using nbs and porous media with variable sizes and different treatments and the stability and transport characteristics of nbs under different solution chemistry

1693,in a field study aqueous cyclodextrin cd was investigated for its ability to extract chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvoc such as trichloroethylene tce 1 1 1 trichloroethane tca and dichloroethene dce through in situ flushing of a sandy aquifer after cessation of aquifer flushing a plume of cd was left changes in cd cvoc and inorganic terminal electron acceptors teas do nitrate sulfate iron were monitored in four rounds of wellwater sampling 20 210 342 and 425days after cessation of active pumping post cd flushing voc levels rebounded 850 for tce 190 for tca and 53 for dce between the first two sampling rounds apparently due to rate limited desorption from aquifer media and dissolution from remaining napl however substantial reduction in the mass of tce 6 3 to 0 11mol 98 and tca 2 8 to 0 73mol 74 in groundwater was observed between 210 and 425days dce should primarily be produced from the degradation of tce and is expected to subsequently degrade to chloroethene since dce levels decreased only slightly 0 23 to 0 17mol 26 its degradation rate should be similar to that produced from the decaying tce cyclodextrin was monitored starting from day 210 the mass of residual cd as measured by total organic carbon decreased from 150mol day 210 to 66 day 425 56 decrease the naturally anaerobic zone within the aquifer where residual cd mass decreased coincided with a loss of other major potential teas nitrate 97 loss sulfate 31 and iron 31 in other studies tce and 1 1 1 tca have been found to be more energetically favorable teas than sulfate and iron and their degradation via reductive dechlorination has been found to be enhanced by the fermentation of carbohydrates such processes can explain these observations but more investigation is needed to evaluate whether residual levels of cd can facilitate the anaerobic degradation of chlorinated vocs 1 introduction 1 1 cyclodextrin properties cyclodextrins cd are cyclic oligosaccharides formed from the alteration of starches by the enzyme cd glycosyltransferase fenyvesi et al 2005 theses toroidal molecules have a truncated conical cavity which possesses a comparatively hydrophobic environment into which relatively low polarity compounds of appropriate size and shape can form guest host complexes szejtli 1998 conversely the exterior of the cd molecule is generally hydrophilic the three most common native cds are α β and γ cd composed of 6 7 and 8 glucopyranose units respectively their aqueous solubilities are 149 16 3 and 179mm french et al 1949 respectively aqueous solubility s w of native cds can be greatly enhanced with addition of functional groups e g hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin hp β cd has a s w 0 5m blanford et al 2001 their high solubility is exploited for example as agents for aquifer environmental remediation boving et al 1999 while the degree of substitution varies by derivative and within and among batches of derivatized cd commercially produced hp β cd commonly has an average degree of substitution of between four and six hydroxypropyl hp units per cd as determined by nmr loftsson et al 2004 malanga et al 2016 it should be noted that while each glucopyranose unit has three potential locations of substitution the 6 position is preferentially substituted which means that the hp units are located predominantly on the primary narrower side of the cd molecule this is important because it means that steric hindrances prevention of a chemical reaction due to molecular structure by the introduction of hp units to β cd minimally impact its propensity to form complexes in field applications technical grade hp β cd has been used which includes the non cyclodextrin substances above trace levels of glucose maltose maltohexaose platzer et al 1998 water wang et al 1998 glycol salt and unmodified cds gao et al 2009 and possibly ph adjustment agents harrison 2017 1 2 documented use of cyclodextrin in aquifer remediation cds have an extensive range of consumer laboratory and industrial applications e g stabilizers in pharmaceuticals air fresheners chromatography stationary phases etc landy et al 2012 they have also been investigated as agents for enhancing remediation of aquifers contaminated with toxic hydrophobic organic chemicals hocs mccray and brusseau 1998 blanford et al 1999 boving et al 1999 mccray and brusseau 1999 tick et al 2003 wang et al 2005 boving et al 2008 eberle et al 2016 in remediation the ability of cds to raise the apparent aqueous solubility of common hoc pollutants often by orders of magnitude wang and brusseau 1995 blanford et al 2001 mccray et al 2000 blanford et al 2014 has been utilized to enhance dissolution and desorption rates of these compounds when aquifers are flushed with solutions of the complexing sugar mccray and brusseau 1998 blanford et al 1999 mccray et al 2000 and tick et al 2003 boving et al 2008 separation and treatment of cd hoc solutions have been successfully demonstrated by air stripping blanford et al 1999 tick et al 2003 gao et al 2009 and through uptake by activated carbon granules gac boving et al 2008 blanford and gao 2012 gao et al 2013 in these field trials a significant amount of cd 12 by mass was left in the subsurface boving et al 2008 the fate of this residue on groundwater chemistry and more importantly on the phase distribution of hocs and the processes governing their fate and transport in the subsurface is presently poorly understood it is generally held that many hocs are more readily biodegraded when present in the aqueous solution rather than sorbed or part of a napl phase kashiyama and boving 2004 under static gao and blanford 2012 and dynamic conditions blanford and gao 2012 it has been shown that while cd enhances the relative amount of a common hoc pollutant e g trichloroethene in the aqueous phase the relative phase distribution between the water fraction of the liquid and granular activated carbon is unaltered in this case the gac properties modeled aquifer organic matter which is commonly the dominant driver of hoc sorption in soils weber and huang 1996 the presence of cd may increase the availability of hydrophobic compounds and thus the overall rate of biodegradation because 1 the mass transfer rates of hoc pollutants between water and cd complexed phases have been found to be far more rapid than those between advecting pore water and a stationary porous media such as gac blanford and gao 2012 and 2 biodegradation of hocs is most commonly thought to occur in the aqueous phase wang et al 2005 because cds can enhance the rates and levels of desorption from mineral surfaces and dissolution from napls boving et al 1999 landy et al 2012 cds have been investigated as proxy measurements of the relative bioavailability of hocs bardi et al 2000 reid et al 2000 mccray et al 2000 and cuypers et al 2002 the potential ability of cyclodextrins especially hp β cd to enhance the rates and degrees of biotic degradation of common hoc contaminants has been extensively investigated this includes common pollutants such as pahs bardi et al 2000 berselli et al 2004 wang et al 2005 allan et al 2007 hoffman et al 2010 btex compounds berselli et al 2004 straight chain alkanes bardi et al 2000 and berselli et al 2004 and chlorinated solvents kashiyama and boving 2004 in each of these laboratory studies the contaminant degradation occurred under aerobic conditions without nutrient limitations and in the presence of hp β cd in groundwater systems however anaerobic levels of dissolved oxygen generally 0 006mm and limited levels of essential nutrients are common christensen et al 2000 the applicability of these laboratory studies toward understanding the influence of cd on the remediation of hocs in groundwater systems is further reduced because they typically do not take into account related geochemical factors such as ph levels of terminal electron acceptors teas such as dissolved oxygen nitrate nitrite sulfate and iron and total dissolved organic carbon toc in addition while the rate of conversion of the hoc in the initial step of degradation was commonly monitored in these laboratory studies the degradation of the generated daughter products the cds themselves and the teas were not thus it is possible that the addition of cd has twofold benefits 1 acting as both solubility enhancers and primary substrate which 2 increases the growth and support of hydrocarbon degrading microbial populations however the degree by which cyclodextrin accelerates the degradation of the hoc under field conditions is unknown 1 3 documented cyclodextrin degradation evidence exists for the enzymatic degradation of the primary native cyclodextrins via cleaving of the cd ring into maltooligomers linear dextrins of progressively shorter lengths α and β cd antenucci and palmer 1984 γ cd jodal et al 1984 although these cd rings were apparently broken into maltooligomers komiyama et al 1986 showed that such linear dextrins can still enhance solubility of certain hocs 4 nitrophenolate and methyl orange but at levels 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than their cyclic analogues tuza et al 2014 more recently evaluated linear dextrins and found that their potential for enhanced solubility is guest and dextrin size dependent depending on size and derivation cyclodextrin will biodegrade at variable rates fenyvesi et al 2005 subjected eight cds to biodegradation tests under aerobic conditions to determine their half lives in four soils the results showed that randomly methylated β cd rameb did not measurably degrade in standard uncontaminated soil based on co2 production from a biodegradability test fenyvesi et al 2005 over the 280 day duration of that experiment rameb exhibited a negative percent degradation meaning more co2 was produced in the control group than with rameb of the remaining subject cds hp β cd had the longest measurable half life of 122days while fenyvesi et al 2005 did show that carbon dioxide was produced during apparent aerobic biodegradation of cds with the exception of rameb they and others again did not determine the degradation pathway the effects on hoc phase distribution nor the impact on levels of terminal electron acceptors or microbial populations the potential of solubility enhancement by linear and ringed dextrins of different classes of hocs needs to be further investigated to evaluate the chemistry of hoc cyclodextrin interactions and hence predict the potential impact that degradation of cds has on hoc phase distribution mobility and fate the impact cds may have on terminal electron acceptors and microbial populations needs to be studied to our knowledge the potential for residual cyclodextrins to improve the potential for and enhancement of biodegradation rate of chlorinated solvents has not been examined in the complex environments at the field scale the objective of this research therefore is to assess the potential for residual cd to function as an electron donor facilitating the degradation of hocs under field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description adjacent to the school of music at the little creek naval amphibious base lcnab in virginia beach virginia was a metal plating shop where chlorinated solvents were previously disposed in an underground storage tank after installation of seventeen monitoring wells contamination was observed in the vicinity of the former tank implying leakage of the denser than water liquids into the subsurface ch2mhill 2001 three compounds 1 1 dichloroethene 1 1 dce trichloroethene tce and 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca were found to be present in concentrations that exceeded drinking water standards in at least one well note details of analytical methods are unavailable the maximum observed concentration of these chlorinated solvents was 3 4mm vinyl chloride concentrations were not found above the reported detection levels of 0 032μm ch2m hill 2001 in addition to the preexisting monitoring wells eight wells were installed as part of a pilot scale field demonstration of remediation through aquifer flushing with aqueous hp β cd solutions fig 1 these wells were installed via rotary hollow stem augers with 1 5m long stainless steel screens positioned at the bottom the wells and connected to the surface with schedule 40 pvc this installation method and design was similar to previous monitoring wells at the site wells were positioned with terminating depths ranging from 6 4m to 7 0m below the level land surface soil cores were taken to delineate the lithology and contamination at the site below a thin layer of topsoil 0 15m thick sand sized media of average thickness 6 0 7 6m was found a scanning electron microscope analysis revealed that the aquifer sediment is well sorted and well rounded and energy dispersive spectrometer analysis determined that it is predominantly composed of quartz which is indicative of a near shore marine depositional environment based on similar materials ch2mhill 2001 the porosity was estimated to be 30 below that surficial unconfined aquifer locally known as the columbia aquifer estimated hydraulic conductivity of 8 3 10 4 cmsec 1 smith and harlow 2002 is found a gray marine clay confining unit of several meters thickness known as yorktown confining unit which has an estimated hydraulic conductivity of 3 10 8 cmsec 1 ch2mhill 2001 the boundary between the yorktown confining unit and the columbia aquifer above is sculptured i e a depression at least 0 3m deep was encountered in borehole e3 based on the other cores it appears the feature extends in an east west direction near wells i1 and e3 see fig 2 additionally a lens of clay was observed in this borehole which may further inhibit remediation of the sand sediments below elevated readings by a cvoc calibrated photoionization detector of the air directly above freshly collected soil samples from the depression level suggest that dense napls may have settled in this depression boving et al 2008 the initial maximum concentrations of dce 1 1 1 tca and tce measured were 0 11 0 40 and 2 97mm ch2mhill 2001 for reference the epa maximum contaminant levels for tce 1 1 1 tca and dce dissolved in potable water are 0 04 1 5 and 0 07μm epa 2017 the analysis method did not permit distinction of the various dce isomers for the treatment of the contaminated aquifer by soil flushing an aqueous hp β cd solution was injected via cross well and single well push pull tests boving et al 2008 over several rounds of injection a total mass of 530mol of hp β cd was added at concentrations ranging from 35 to 250mm based on mass balance calculations from measured toc levels in injected and extracted cd solutions approximately 630mol cd 12 was left in the aquifer boving et al 2008 in addition pre and post cd flushing partition inter well tracer tests pitt were performed divine and mccray 2004 to assess the levels of napl within the treatment zone before and after active cd flushing it was found that dnapl saturation on average was relatively low both before and after remediation and near the potential method detection limit 1 dugan et al 2003 3 theory calculation 3 1 observations of constituent levels after cessation of active aquifer flushing to ascertain the relative levels and changes in the target constituents after cessation of active flushing of the aquifer four rounds of groundwater samples were collected from the network of monitoring wells fig 1 at 20 210 342 and 425days samples were collected from eleven wells nine within the study area fig 1 and two located just outside for control and analyzed for concentrations of chloride total organic carbon toc volatile organic chemicals voc including tce tca and dce and terminal electron acceptors teas including dissolved oxygen do nitrate nitrite sulfate and iron two wells mw01t and mw03t are located 4 and 6m outside the cd treatment area fig 1 they were sampled as controls during days 210 342 and 425 while four rounds of sampling were performed toc and do were not measured on day 20 also the teas nitrate nitrite sulfate and iron were only measured on days 342 and 425 no replicate samples were analyzed all groundwater samples were collected in teflon weighted bailers voss technologies at screen depth the wells used for monitoring had an inside diameter of 10 2cm and a static water column of 4m equal to 32 8l water volume inside well water levels were determined by a solinst model 101 water level meter and varied from 2 1 to 2 4m below the ground surface boving et al 2008 using standard practices of extracting at least three well volumes and waiting until geochemistry parameters stabilized t do ph ec etc would have resulted in extraction of a significant amount of the cd plume resulting in compromising the natural evolution of the system through extracting significant amounts of water thus the accepted practice of micro purging kearl et al 1994 was used this specifically involved extraction of 15l of water from the top of the water column of each monitoring well which was rapidly replaced by groundwater from the highly permeable sandy aquifer entering the well through the screen located at its base samples for analysis were then taken by submersing a bailer to the screened interval dissolved oxygen was measured with a ysi 55 do meter fitted with an extended probe cord to take readings inside the wells at screen depth boving et al 2008 target voc concentrations were determined using shimadzu model gc17a gas chromatography and flame ionization and electron capture detectors by the method detailed in boving et al 2008 the column used was spb 624 supelco 30m length with a 0 53mm inner diameter the detection limits for tce and 1 1 1 tca ecd detector were 0 76 and 0 75nm and dce fid detector were 300nm cyclodextrin concentration was measured by a shimadzu model toc 5050 total organic carbon analyzer utilizing epa method 415 modified with the use of standards prepared with the same cd as applied at the site since this method was used and since 99 9 of toc found at the site is cd the reported concentration units for toc are provided in molar units the specific type of cd used was hp β cd degree of substitution 4 98 average mw 1424g mol by wacker chemie ag and has a purity wt wt moisture content 5 0 unmodified cd 0 1 propylene glycol 0 4 ash 2 0 hp β cd 92 6 dissolved concentrations of nitrate and total iron were determined by ion selective probes hanna at the site sulfate was measured by ion chromatography by janick artiola at the swapl lab at the university of arizona specifically nitrate nitrite sulfate and chloride water data was generated using ion chromatography ic following epa method 300 and total iron was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes following epa method 6010 no samples were collected for microbial communities analysis 3 2 groundwater well data analysis to evaluate the effects of residual cyclodextrin on groundwater chemistry and contaminant levels and their distribution statistical analysis were conducted based on measurements of target hocs tce 1 1 1 tca and dce and teas do nitrate sulfate iron from groundwater samples the data was also analyzed for potential correlations between multiple wells while the number of sampling locations was limited the effect of non uniform areal distribution is reduced through use of the kriging method krige 1951 the resulting contour maps were used to estimate the total dissolved mass of target constituents within the study area 3 2 1 statistical analysis of groundwater constituent levels from well samples the raw data consists of the concentrations of each constituent in each of the wells over the four sampling events days 20 210 342 and 425 while the levels of the target vocs were measured during each sampling round toc and dissolved oxygen do were measured in the final three events and nitrate iron sulfate and chloride were measured only during the last two events comparisons between the maximum minimum median and the arithmetic average concentrations over different events were statistically evaluated for several constituents a fraction of the data were near or below the method detection limit bdl following a common practice in risk assessment for bdl measurements concentrations were set to 50 of the corresponding detection limit epa 1990 for statistical analysis of the data set 3 2 2 contour plots of groundwater chemical constituent levels except for exceptionally well instrumented field sites such as the study herein must rely on relatively few data points this greatly reduces the spatial resolution and limits extrapolation of measured contaminant concentrations however valuable trends can be often identified even under those circumstances in this study the well data was extrapolated by contour plots created with surfer 9 golden software inc using a kriging algorithm without spatial bias spacing of the study area dimensions were kept at a minimum to reduce the amount of area for which poor well control exists by minimizing the area for which kriging was performed the results are more closely linked to field data rather than statistical projections in some instances the kriging resulted in projected values along the border of the study area that commonly exceeded levels within the study area and greatly exceeded wells outside of the study located 20 to 100m away to address this additional points outside the study area were added to smooth the contours and reduce unrealistic deviations from general trends that occurred along the edges of the study area due to lack of well data to constrain the kriging calculations the main advantage of using contour plots is that it allows qualitative comparison of spatial distributions quantitative analysis of calculated dissolved masses of different constituents between sampling rounds and more robust comparisons of total dissolved masses within the system geometric functions within surfer provided an estimate of the relative spatial fraction of the study area that falls within each contour interval each interval except the base line one represents an area 15 of the total area by taking the midpoint of a contour interval and multiplying by its relative spatial fraction a representative concentration is determined for example the contour spatially averaged concentration of tca was 72 2μm on day 210 the sum of all fractional concentrations equals the average concentration of the constituent over the study area the average mass of a constituent within a contour interval can be calculated from the concentration and aquifer volume represented by it for this the surface area of the treatment zone 11m 8m and the length of the screened interval from the bottom of the aquifer upwards 1 5m was converted to the volume of the treatment zone i e 132m3 the contaminant concentration per contour interval was then scaled to the estimated porosity of the aquifer 30 ch2mhill 2001 table 2 summarizes the average mass of all target constituents as determined from the kriging data in the case of tca 2 9mol were contained in the aqueous phase within the treatment area 3 2 3 bivariant analysis for potential relationships between groundwater constituents two dimensional scatter plots should show inverse correlations between cd and teas if cd functions as a substrate to support microbial populations that is areas of the aquifer with long term cd presence should show a reduction in tea levels associated with the microbial degradation pathways that is active in that area as such an inverse correlation between toc and tea should exist in aquifer areas where either has become depleted thus limiting the degradation reaction from proceeding for lack of one or more of the reactants a constituent can be considered as a likely tea if there is a strong hyperbolic relationship with toc if no correlation is observed then it can be ruled out as a tea two dimensional scatter plots for single wells are shown in fig 5 the advantage of the hyperbolic graph is that it clearly and concisely shows the likelihood of a tea being used to degrade toc the main drawback is that it does not provide any sort of spatial context for the points however the graphs can be examined in conjunction with the contour plots to show that tea was depleted below bdl in areas where toc is relatively high 4 results 4 1 volatile organic chemical results in all post aquifer flushing samples at least 82 of the combined voc molar average concentration was concentrated around well e3 and e6 dissolved tce and 1 1 1 tca were present at levels 11 and 8 times greater than their degradation product dce on average the average and variance in the fractional molar mass of the three observed vocs for water samples all wells are 0 34 0 038 0 56 0 017 and 0 10 0 006 respectively for tce tca and dce however the individual molar fractions of these three compounds varied substantially from one sampling round to the next for example the mole fraction of tce on day 210 was 0 61 whereas on day 425 it was 0 21 the most significant rebounds and subsequent declines between the sampling rounds were observed for tce elevated by 910 then reducing to 90 and 69 and to a lesser extent tca up 180 then decreasing 70 and 29 dce remained relatively stable especially between days 20 and 210 increasing 48 then decreasing 42 then rising again by 72 as summarized in table 2 and illustrated in contour plots fig 3 a particularly strong decrease can be observed in tce concentrations 92 and to somewhat lesser extent in 1 1 1 tca 69 and dce 48 both dissolved tce and 1 1 1 tca mass continued to decrease until the end of this study however dce mass fluctuated and was not significantly different at the end of the study compared to day 210 this is unusual because the aqueous solubility of dce is 25mm more than twice that of tce or tca each roughly the same 9 7mm lawrence 2006 modifications of raoult s law to accommodate for the effects of cyclodextrin on phase distribution for systems including water napl stationary organic sorbent and cd phases have been made mccray and brusseau 1999 blanford 2014 employing these the groundwater levels of dce should have been even higher than tce or tca if dce were it significantly present in the napl or soil sorbed phases due to its greater preference for that phase compared with tce and tca if such an increase was not observed then there must not have been much dce sorbed on the aquifer material or present in the napl importantly it appears that the amount of degraded tce 6 19mol and 1 1 1 tca 2 18mol did not cause a proportional increase in dce mass therefore it can be inferred that most of the dce mass can be accounted as a degradation product of tce and 1 1 1 tca rather than a portion of the original sorbed and napl mass a possible explanation for the relatively minimal change in observed dce concentration over time is drawn from the rates of dce production from the parent compounds primarily tce and its subsequent degradation while dce is most readily degraded aerobically as a carbon source for microbes cox 2012 it can also undergo anaerobic reductive dechlorination provided the redox conditions are at least nitrate reducing sulfate reducing or methanogenic systems bouwer and mccarty 1984 lawrence 2006 henry 2010 as illustrated in fig 5 by the disappearance of both sulfate and nitrate the conditions favorable for anaerobic dce degradation appear to have existed in the groundwater system at the site accounting for dce production primarily from tce and to a lesser extent 1 1 1 tca degradation during the observation period 97 of that dce mass may have been degraded subsequently the day 20 voc concentrations were markedly lower than those measured on day 210 indicating that the vocs levels rebounded between these sampling rounds the decrease in voc concentrations correlates with an increase in chloride ion cl concentrations especially within wells e3 and e6 as illustrated in fig 4 this data set suggests that reductive dechlorination of chlorinated voc proceeded over time however it must be noted that for reasons unknown no vinyl chloride was detected quantifiable detection level 0 03μm ch2mhill 2001 in the aqueous samples even though production would be expected via hydrolysis vogel et al 1987 due to these samples being taken only 20days after active flushing of the site with potable water divine and mccray 2004 the groundwater around the wells may have still been diluted resulting in the lower concentrations of vocs in that monitoring round than in the 210day observations fig 3 however as been seen in many studies mccray et al 2000 brusseau et al 1994 the measured aqueous levels of organic contaminants in solutions added polluted aquifers will commonly witness a rise in levels if flow is interrupted that interruption permits greater time to achieve equilibrium between the mobile fluid phase in the high permeability zones and the other phases of the system e g napl sorbed to soil presence hocs in low permeability zones 4 2 total organic carbon results raw well data analysis of toc showed that maximum cd concentrations were localized in the vicinity of around wells e3 and e6 the lowest average cd concentration 1 55mm was observed during the day 342 sampling event toc levels decreased by 65 from day 210 to 342 but apparently increased by 26 between day 342 and 425 if cd is co metabolized with the chlorinated solvents similar changes should be observed between these constituents however toc measures the total organic content of the groundwater which does not exclusively include cd although background level of organic matter in the aquifer is negligible i e toc response over 8 times lower than the day 342 median compared to cd the degradation of cd will produce some biomass such as cellulose and other maltooligomers antenucci and palmer 1984 jodal et al 1984 this biomass production may contribute to toc increases on day 425 alternatively this increase could be an artifact of poor resolution of the plume with the existing network of observation wells together with a lack of discernable cd degradation linked to the depletion of the most energetically favorable teas within the treatment zone unfortunately there is not enough data to confirm such a hypothesis if the redox reactions outlined in this paper appropriately describe our field conditions and if the level of toc is an apt measurement of the level of cd at the site then the combined amount of various electron acceptors is far exceeded by the amount of cd the potential for diminished levels of teas to inhibit the degradation of an added carbon source pollutant to an aquifer is commonly reported henry 2010 the observed apparent rise in toc from the 342 to 425 sample round has many potential cause s first the limited spatial and temporal resolution of sampling constrains knowledge of the magnitude and change in the toc plume next toc analysis methods require large degrees of dilution e g up to 1000 fold for this study thereby decreasing the confidence in calculated cd values finally rather than a direct measurement we have to rely on measured toc as a surrogate for hpcd its degradation products or other short lived biomass possibly interfering with the measurement beyond identifying the nature of toc the ability to function as electron donors is unknown 4 3 non chlorinated solvent terminal electron acceptor tea results the relative concentration of the non chlorinated solvent tea can constrain which potential biodegradation reactions may be occurring at a site also the biotic degradation of significant amounts of a substrate cyclodextrin in the aquifer should result in consumption of the teas which may correlate with an appreciable depletion in these particular constituents accordingly existence of samples with relatively high levels of both the electron donor and receiver reactants i e cd and the teas then has potential to proceed the absence of either should inhibit the reaction and in scatter diagrams of toc versus tea these points should asymptotically approach the x axis the stoichiometric reactions for complete mineralization of hp β cd with 4 hp units per molecule are aerobic respiration do reduction 1 c 42 h 66 o 35 4 c 3 h 7 o 58 o 2 54 co 2 47 h 2 o

reduced and carbon oxidized as a result 216 electrons are being transferred for each mole of hpcd mineralized the recipient of these electrons could also be the chlorinated solvent under anaerobic conditions tce might degrade via under biotic and abiotic pathways under biotic anaerobic conditions a reductive dechlorination pathway primarily results in the formation of 1 2 cis dce with 1 2 trans dce and especially 1 1 dce being less commonly produced the abiotic anaerobic pathway via dichloroelimination produces chloroethyne lawrence 2006 the biotic pathway dominates when an electron donor is

conditions scheutz et al 2011 documented three common degradation pathways the first is biotic degradation by reductive dechlorination to 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca then chloro ethane ca the other two pathways are abiotic i e 1 hydrolysis to 1 1 dichloro 1 ethanol then to acetic acid and 2 dehydrohalogenation or elimination to produce 1 1 dce if an electron donor such as molasses or perhaps cyclodextrin is present the biotic reductive dechlorination to 1 1 dca dominates lacking an appropriate electron donor hydrolysis abiotic pathway has been found to be 4 to 5 times more common than the dehydrohalogenation pathway scheutz et al 2011 since there was an excess of cyclodextrin at this site and given the propensity for hydrolysis to dominate abiotic pathways it is expected that minimal amounts of 1 1 dce were being produced via 1 1 1 tca degradation together if tce is more common at a site such as the one studied herein it is then likely that 1 2 cis isomer dce is most common and arises from tce degradation rather than tca trichloroethane reduction 6 c 42 h 66 o 35 4 c 3 h 7 o 69 h 2 o 216 c 2 cl 3 h 168 e 54 co 2 32 h 200 c 2 cl 2 h 2 200 cl eqs 5 and 6 describe the complete mineralization of cd into carbon dioxide and production of hydrogen ions which are also a necessary reactant for reductive dechlorination of highly chlorinated solvents in relatively unbuffered or alkaline systems lack of hydrogen may inhibit rates of metabolic degradation of highly chlorinated solvents such as tce in some cases biotic reductive dechlorination of tce in the presence of dissolved hydrogen gas may be a source of acid robinson et al 2009 however changes in the ph at the site were not monitored and therefore there is no data to support this potential pathway at the current time potential final products of cd degradation such as methane through methanogenetic pathways under field conditions have not been studied 4 3 1 dissolved oxygen do levels were relatively low throughout the study area over the monitoring period and no discernable spatial trends were observed with the exception of one outlier 0 03mm at well i1 at day 210 table 1 the maximum measured do concentration was 0 015mm or less indicating anaerobic conditions dinicola 2006 throughout the study domain over the sampling period fig 5 do was not sampled during active flushing of the aquifer because of injection of solutions that were in equilibrium with the atmosphere during that time levels of oxygen sufficient for aerobic degradation may have existed in the treatment zone using the kriging method krige 1951 average do concentration decreased by 25 from day 210 to 342 and then increased 47 by day 425 resulting in an overall rise in do by 10 while this trend somewhat mirrors toc activity there is no correlation between do and toc in different monitoring wells if aerobic degradation had played a meaningful role then it may have been observed in day 20 sampling due to fact that water was injected during the post cd flushing tracer test but unfortunately it was not measured based on fig 5 do does not directly or inversely coincide with toc levels and further underscores that aerobic degradation was unlikely to contribute to meaningfully to the trends in cd in the final three sampling rounds 4 3 2 nitrate nitrate as nitrate nitrite was only measured in the final two sample events day 342 and 425 table 2 out of all teas evaluated nitrate exhibited the greatest decrease 90 however of 18 measurements taken only six contained nitrate nitrite above the detection limit 1 6μm the median of these six measurements was four times the detection level the nitrate contour plot fig 7 shows that much of it was concentrated around wells i1 and e5 versus toc which was centered on e3 and e6 the scatter plot fig 5 demonstrates fairly strong inverse correlation with toc which suggest that anaerobic nitrate reducing conditions were present in the aquifer during monitoring 4 3 3 sulfate as with nitrate sulfate was measured during the last two sampling events the average sulfate concentration in the study area was 0 017mm on day 342 whereas the average concentration from the monitoring wells was 0 270mm tables 2 and 3 of the 18 samples analyzed three e3 e5 e6 all on day 425 were bdl 1 0μm where detectable sulfate s median concentration decreased by 64 from days 342 to 425 table 1 the sulfate contour maps fig 7 indicates that its concentration decreased to bdl from day 342 to 425 in the same vicinity as elevated levels of toc were found to persist wells e3 and e6 this correlation suggests consumption of this tea to the point that it may have been locally limiting the sulfate based reaction s the observed dissolved sulfate levels generally fell and saw a net 31 reduction within the confines of the study area table 2 the distribution of sulfate appears to be inversely correlated with the relatively high levels of vocs and toc found in the vicinity of wells e3 and e6 fig 6 indicating that the chlorinated solvents may have been depleted during the degradation of cd in a sulfate mediated reducing reaction another area of relatively low sulfate can be observed outside the cd plume near well e5 direct comparisons of toc and sulfate levels of individual samples fig 6c shows a relatively strong asymptotic correlation this implies a causal relationship where cd and sulfate might be involved in an oxidation reduction reaction based on the site s background sulfate concentration 0 270mm the amount of sulfate at the end of the monitoring period was reduced by 9 6mol according to eq 4 that 9 6mol of sulfate could have mineralized up to 0 24mol cd which is only 0 3 of the amount of cd observed to have disappeared table 4 4 3 4 iron in iron mediated biodegradation eq 3 ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron total dissolved iron concentrations were measured for the last two rounds of sampling all the measured iron concentrations were at least 500 times the method detection level 1 8nm while the median concentrations from the raw data showed a decrease in the amount of iron by 71 from day 342 to 425 table 1 the calculated distribution of iron during these two sample events lack correlation between themselves fig 7e and f and with the corresponding toc contour plots fig 3 closer examination shows that on day 342 well e7 and to a lesser extent i1 had relatively high levels of dissolved iron respectively 0 16 and 0 07mm which were 3 3 and 1 5 times higher than the next highest well e6 on day 425 e2 and e3 measured 0 08 and 0 09mm which were 6 3 and 7 3 times higher than the next highest well mw02 showing a shift in the distribution of dissolved iron the scatter plot of iron versus toc fig 5d shows a weak inverse correlation a stronger inverse correlation is observed when compared to highly chlorinated vocs fig 6b and d which is predicted for these systems robinson et al 2009 the preferential use of sulfate compared to iron indicates that this aquifer system may have exhibited strongly reducing conditions which are ideal for the biodegradation of highly chlorinated chloroethenes dinicola 2006 prior to the introduction of cyclodextrin do levels in the wider study area were all at anaerobic levels 12 5μm n 4 these wells were screened at the base of the aquifer which was the same level at which this study was conducted introduction of an additional potential electron donor cd further encouraged reducing conditions eh and ph were not measured in this study but it is unlikely that they were in the range where ferric ions fe 3 would be the dominant iron species eh 0 77v ph 4 since the introduction of a significant amount of organic matter i e cd and level of non iron tea provides evidence that the system was reducing and because reductive dechlorination of that organic matter would result in consumption of acid it is likely that the ferrous valence state fe 2 was more common than the ferric therefore dissolved iron is likely to be dominated by ferrous valence states in a metastable condition and as a result iron is unlikely to serve as a terminal electron acceptor in this system 5 discussion in the absence of pumping or significant natural groundwater advection biotic or abiotic degradation are the dominant processes converting and eventually mineralizing chlorinated solvents from an aquifer lawrence 2006 the addition of cd a carbohydrate and therefore a potentially microbial community sustaining substrate to the system may accelerate the biodegradation process of these contaminants allan et al 2007 the potential efficacy of residual levels of cd as a means to enhance biodegradation rates and levels can be potentially monitored through tracking the concentration of the cd contaminants and associated inorganic constituents in this field study cd was flushed through the groundwater in single and cross well push pull tests in an effort to remove the contaminants from the groundwater following this active remediation the residual cd was left in the aquifer and voc tea and cd levels all were monitored through well samples over four sampling rounds for a period of 425days to thoroughly assess the outcome of leaving the cd in the aquifer several analytical techniques were applied statistical analysis of the raw well data provided unbiased correlations creation of contour plots of concentration change of the aquifer constituents added spatial context to the singular points and scatter plots between the teas and toc illustrated which teas most likely degraded the cd based on these methods it was inferred that the addition of cd initially caused a spike in voc concentrations as they underwent desorption and dissolution afterwards the peak mass of tce decreased substantially by 98 along with notable losses of tca 75 and dce 26 dce was produced from the degradation of tce and tca but was itself being degraded faster that its rate of production the presence of highly chlorinated solvents such as tce or tca present at the site have been shown to be more resistant to degradation than naturally occurring low molecular weight hydrocarbons such as pahs and alkanes lawrence 2006 under aerobic conditions degradation may occur through co metabolism where a second substrate assists the breakdown of the organochlorides hubert et al 2005 in anaerobic conditions fermenters are required to break down the electron donors into smaller molecules which provide the electrons needed to fuel reductive dechlorination given the anaerobic site conditions and the 98 decrease in tce and 75 decrease in tca from day 210 to 425 fermentation of the cd likely occurred potentially promoting the dechlorination of these vocs however no direct evidence for such processes was collected highly chlorinated chemicals also are more prone to be biodegraded under anaerobic conditions lawrence 2006 which is unfortunate because in general hydrocarbons that can be readily degraded by both aerobic and anaerobic pathways commonly are slower via anaerobic means erses et al 2008 at sites where there is sufficient dissolved oxygen christensen et al 2000 to be functionally considered aerobic 0 03mm pce tce and 1 1 1 tca can persist because the anaerobic bacteria are unable to effectively degrade them dinicola 2006 in this field study do levels never exceeded 0 03mm under these anaerobic circumstances residual cd can serve as an electron donor in addition to complexing with the pollutants cds have been found to be biodegraded aerobically fenyvesi et al 2005 our data indicates that at least from day 210 to 425 low do correlates with decreasing cd concentrations which suggest that cd degradation under anaerobic conditions is occurring our data however does not permit judgement if the cd degradation was a driving factor in converting the initially aerobic aquifer into an anaerobic system the residual cd left in the subsurface after active flushing of the contaminated aquifer solutions did correlate with a zone of depleted teas nitrate and sulfate it also correlated with the area where enhanced conversion of highly chlorinated solvents was observed these findings imply that the presence of cd 1 enhanced the bioavailability of vocs as previously described in the literature reid et al 2000 cuypers et al 2002 liu et al 2002 yang et al 2016 and 2 possibly provided a significant carbon source to instigate the formation of microbial populations as shown by fenyvesi et al 2009 that in turn can facilitate the degradation of hocs however the degradation pathway of cd in an anaerobic system needs to be better established as well as the nature and dynamics of the microbial communities involved herein once a better understanding of these systems is established more thorough and appropriate sampling and analysis methods including isotopic co2 and n2 gas sampling total organic nitrogen analysis ton and direct measurement of cd rather than approximated by toc can be employed as a result the potential utility of cd application to promote reductive dechlorination and function as an efficacious remedial technology can be more fully assessed 6 conclusion our data suggests that under reducing conditions when teas do nitrate sulfate etc are essentially depleted but both cd and chlorinated solvents are still present the cd appears to facilitate dechlorination by functioning as an electron donor cd was monitored as toc and decreased by 56 over 410days of monitoring indicating that it too was degraded along with the cvoc based on the contour maps areas of relatively high toc coincided with those apparently depleted of certain teas the redox environment was ideal for reductive dechlorination of vocs the loss of toc in the same location of voc loss indicates cyclodextrin was at least aiding in the reductive dechlorination of tce tca and dce while this work shows that cyclodextrin has great potential for facilitating degradation of chlorinated solvents more work is needed particularly determination of cd and pollutant degradation pathways under field conditions is warranted in combination with sampling for soil gases such as nitrogen hydrogen sulfide or methane and a characterization of the microbial communities in the treatment zone 
1693,in a field study aqueous cyclodextrin cd was investigated for its ability to extract chlorinated volatile organic compounds cvoc such as trichloroethylene tce 1 1 1 trichloroethane tca and dichloroethene dce through in situ flushing of a sandy aquifer after cessation of aquifer flushing a plume of cd was left changes in cd cvoc and inorganic terminal electron acceptors teas do nitrate sulfate iron were monitored in four rounds of wellwater sampling 20 210 342 and 425days after cessation of active pumping post cd flushing voc levels rebounded 850 for tce 190 for tca and 53 for dce between the first two sampling rounds apparently due to rate limited desorption from aquifer media and dissolution from remaining napl however substantial reduction in the mass of tce 6 3 to 0 11mol 98 and tca 2 8 to 0 73mol 74 in groundwater was observed between 210 and 425days dce should primarily be produced from the degradation of tce and is expected to subsequently degrade to chloroethene since dce levels decreased only slightly 0 23 to 0 17mol 26 its degradation rate should be similar to that produced from the decaying tce cyclodextrin was monitored starting from day 210 the mass of residual cd as measured by total organic carbon decreased from 150mol day 210 to 66 day 425 56 decrease the naturally anaerobic zone within the aquifer where residual cd mass decreased coincided with a loss of other major potential teas nitrate 97 loss sulfate 31 and iron 31 in other studies tce and 1 1 1 tca have been found to be more energetically favorable teas than sulfate and iron and their degradation via reductive dechlorination has been found to be enhanced by the fermentation of carbohydrates such processes can explain these observations but more investigation is needed to evaluate whether residual levels of cd can facilitate the anaerobic degradation of chlorinated vocs 1 introduction 1 1 cyclodextrin properties cyclodextrins cd are cyclic oligosaccharides formed from the alteration of starches by the enzyme cd glycosyltransferase fenyvesi et al 2005 theses toroidal molecules have a truncated conical cavity which possesses a comparatively hydrophobic environment into which relatively low polarity compounds of appropriate size and shape can form guest host complexes szejtli 1998 conversely the exterior of the cd molecule is generally hydrophilic the three most common native cds are α β and γ cd composed of 6 7 and 8 glucopyranose units respectively their aqueous solubilities are 149 16 3 and 179mm french et al 1949 respectively aqueous solubility s w of native cds can be greatly enhanced with addition of functional groups e g hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin hp β cd has a s w 0 5m blanford et al 2001 their high solubility is exploited for example as agents for aquifer environmental remediation boving et al 1999 while the degree of substitution varies by derivative and within and among batches of derivatized cd commercially produced hp β cd commonly has an average degree of substitution of between four and six hydroxypropyl hp units per cd as determined by nmr loftsson et al 2004 malanga et al 2016 it should be noted that while each glucopyranose unit has three potential locations of substitution the 6 position is preferentially substituted which means that the hp units are located predominantly on the primary narrower side of the cd molecule this is important because it means that steric hindrances prevention of a chemical reaction due to molecular structure by the introduction of hp units to β cd minimally impact its propensity to form complexes in field applications technical grade hp β cd has been used which includes the non cyclodextrin substances above trace levels of glucose maltose maltohexaose platzer et al 1998 water wang et al 1998 glycol salt and unmodified cds gao et al 2009 and possibly ph adjustment agents harrison 2017 1 2 documented use of cyclodextrin in aquifer remediation cds have an extensive range of consumer laboratory and industrial applications e g stabilizers in pharmaceuticals air fresheners chromatography stationary phases etc landy et al 2012 they have also been investigated as agents for enhancing remediation of aquifers contaminated with toxic hydrophobic organic chemicals hocs mccray and brusseau 1998 blanford et al 1999 boving et al 1999 mccray and brusseau 1999 tick et al 2003 wang et al 2005 boving et al 2008 eberle et al 2016 in remediation the ability of cds to raise the apparent aqueous solubility of common hoc pollutants often by orders of magnitude wang and brusseau 1995 blanford et al 2001 mccray et al 2000 blanford et al 2014 has been utilized to enhance dissolution and desorption rates of these compounds when aquifers are flushed with solutions of the complexing sugar mccray and brusseau 1998 blanford et al 1999 mccray et al 2000 and tick et al 2003 boving et al 2008 separation and treatment of cd hoc solutions have been successfully demonstrated by air stripping blanford et al 1999 tick et al 2003 gao et al 2009 and through uptake by activated carbon granules gac boving et al 2008 blanford and gao 2012 gao et al 2013 in these field trials a significant amount of cd 12 by mass was left in the subsurface boving et al 2008 the fate of this residue on groundwater chemistry and more importantly on the phase distribution of hocs and the processes governing their fate and transport in the subsurface is presently poorly understood it is generally held that many hocs are more readily biodegraded when present in the aqueous solution rather than sorbed or part of a napl phase kashiyama and boving 2004 under static gao and blanford 2012 and dynamic conditions blanford and gao 2012 it has been shown that while cd enhances the relative amount of a common hoc pollutant e g trichloroethene in the aqueous phase the relative phase distribution between the water fraction of the liquid and granular activated carbon is unaltered in this case the gac properties modeled aquifer organic matter which is commonly the dominant driver of hoc sorption in soils weber and huang 1996 the presence of cd may increase the availability of hydrophobic compounds and thus the overall rate of biodegradation because 1 the mass transfer rates of hoc pollutants between water and cd complexed phases have been found to be far more rapid than those between advecting pore water and a stationary porous media such as gac blanford and gao 2012 and 2 biodegradation of hocs is most commonly thought to occur in the aqueous phase wang et al 2005 because cds can enhance the rates and levels of desorption from mineral surfaces and dissolution from napls boving et al 1999 landy et al 2012 cds have been investigated as proxy measurements of the relative bioavailability of hocs bardi et al 2000 reid et al 2000 mccray et al 2000 and cuypers et al 2002 the potential ability of cyclodextrins especially hp β cd to enhance the rates and degrees of biotic degradation of common hoc contaminants has been extensively investigated this includes common pollutants such as pahs bardi et al 2000 berselli et al 2004 wang et al 2005 allan et al 2007 hoffman et al 2010 btex compounds berselli et al 2004 straight chain alkanes bardi et al 2000 and berselli et al 2004 and chlorinated solvents kashiyama and boving 2004 in each of these laboratory studies the contaminant degradation occurred under aerobic conditions without nutrient limitations and in the presence of hp β cd in groundwater systems however anaerobic levels of dissolved oxygen generally 0 006mm and limited levels of essential nutrients are common christensen et al 2000 the applicability of these laboratory studies toward understanding the influence of cd on the remediation of hocs in groundwater systems is further reduced because they typically do not take into account related geochemical factors such as ph levels of terminal electron acceptors teas such as dissolved oxygen nitrate nitrite sulfate and iron and total dissolved organic carbon toc in addition while the rate of conversion of the hoc in the initial step of degradation was commonly monitored in these laboratory studies the degradation of the generated daughter products the cds themselves and the teas were not thus it is possible that the addition of cd has twofold benefits 1 acting as both solubility enhancers and primary substrate which 2 increases the growth and support of hydrocarbon degrading microbial populations however the degree by which cyclodextrin accelerates the degradation of the hoc under field conditions is unknown 1 3 documented cyclodextrin degradation evidence exists for the enzymatic degradation of the primary native cyclodextrins via cleaving of the cd ring into maltooligomers linear dextrins of progressively shorter lengths α and β cd antenucci and palmer 1984 γ cd jodal et al 1984 although these cd rings were apparently broken into maltooligomers komiyama et al 1986 showed that such linear dextrins can still enhance solubility of certain hocs 4 nitrophenolate and methyl orange but at levels 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than their cyclic analogues tuza et al 2014 more recently evaluated linear dextrins and found that their potential for enhanced solubility is guest and dextrin size dependent depending on size and derivation cyclodextrin will biodegrade at variable rates fenyvesi et al 2005 subjected eight cds to biodegradation tests under aerobic conditions to determine their half lives in four soils the results showed that randomly methylated β cd rameb did not measurably degrade in standard uncontaminated soil based on co2 production from a biodegradability test fenyvesi et al 2005 over the 280 day duration of that experiment rameb exhibited a negative percent degradation meaning more co2 was produced in the control group than with rameb of the remaining subject cds hp β cd had the longest measurable half life of 122days while fenyvesi et al 2005 did show that carbon dioxide was produced during apparent aerobic biodegradation of cds with the exception of rameb they and others again did not determine the degradation pathway the effects on hoc phase distribution nor the impact on levels of terminal electron acceptors or microbial populations the potential of solubility enhancement by linear and ringed dextrins of different classes of hocs needs to be further investigated to evaluate the chemistry of hoc cyclodextrin interactions and hence predict the potential impact that degradation of cds has on hoc phase distribution mobility and fate the impact cds may have on terminal electron acceptors and microbial populations needs to be studied to our knowledge the potential for residual cyclodextrins to improve the potential for and enhancement of biodegradation rate of chlorinated solvents has not been examined in the complex environments at the field scale the objective of this research therefore is to assess the potential for residual cd to function as an electron donor facilitating the degradation of hocs under field conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description adjacent to the school of music at the little creek naval amphibious base lcnab in virginia beach virginia was a metal plating shop where chlorinated solvents were previously disposed in an underground storage tank after installation of seventeen monitoring wells contamination was observed in the vicinity of the former tank implying leakage of the denser than water liquids into the subsurface ch2mhill 2001 three compounds 1 1 dichloroethene 1 1 dce trichloroethene tce and 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca were found to be present in concentrations that exceeded drinking water standards in at least one well note details of analytical methods are unavailable the maximum observed concentration of these chlorinated solvents was 3 4mm vinyl chloride concentrations were not found above the reported detection levels of 0 032μm ch2m hill 2001 in addition to the preexisting monitoring wells eight wells were installed as part of a pilot scale field demonstration of remediation through aquifer flushing with aqueous hp β cd solutions fig 1 these wells were installed via rotary hollow stem augers with 1 5m long stainless steel screens positioned at the bottom the wells and connected to the surface with schedule 40 pvc this installation method and design was similar to previous monitoring wells at the site wells were positioned with terminating depths ranging from 6 4m to 7 0m below the level land surface soil cores were taken to delineate the lithology and contamination at the site below a thin layer of topsoil 0 15m thick sand sized media of average thickness 6 0 7 6m was found a scanning electron microscope analysis revealed that the aquifer sediment is well sorted and well rounded and energy dispersive spectrometer analysis determined that it is predominantly composed of quartz which is indicative of a near shore marine depositional environment based on similar materials ch2mhill 2001 the porosity was estimated to be 30 below that surficial unconfined aquifer locally known as the columbia aquifer estimated hydraulic conductivity of 8 3 10 4 cmsec 1 smith and harlow 2002 is found a gray marine clay confining unit of several meters thickness known as yorktown confining unit which has an estimated hydraulic conductivity of 3 10 8 cmsec 1 ch2mhill 2001 the boundary between the yorktown confining unit and the columbia aquifer above is sculptured i e a depression at least 0 3m deep was encountered in borehole e3 based on the other cores it appears the feature extends in an east west direction near wells i1 and e3 see fig 2 additionally a lens of clay was observed in this borehole which may further inhibit remediation of the sand sediments below elevated readings by a cvoc calibrated photoionization detector of the air directly above freshly collected soil samples from the depression level suggest that dense napls may have settled in this depression boving et al 2008 the initial maximum concentrations of dce 1 1 1 tca and tce measured were 0 11 0 40 and 2 97mm ch2mhill 2001 for reference the epa maximum contaminant levels for tce 1 1 1 tca and dce dissolved in potable water are 0 04 1 5 and 0 07μm epa 2017 the analysis method did not permit distinction of the various dce isomers for the treatment of the contaminated aquifer by soil flushing an aqueous hp β cd solution was injected via cross well and single well push pull tests boving et al 2008 over several rounds of injection a total mass of 530mol of hp β cd was added at concentrations ranging from 35 to 250mm based on mass balance calculations from measured toc levels in injected and extracted cd solutions approximately 630mol cd 12 was left in the aquifer boving et al 2008 in addition pre and post cd flushing partition inter well tracer tests pitt were performed divine and mccray 2004 to assess the levels of napl within the treatment zone before and after active cd flushing it was found that dnapl saturation on average was relatively low both before and after remediation and near the potential method detection limit 1 dugan et al 2003 3 theory calculation 3 1 observations of constituent levels after cessation of active aquifer flushing to ascertain the relative levels and changes in the target constituents after cessation of active flushing of the aquifer four rounds of groundwater samples were collected from the network of monitoring wells fig 1 at 20 210 342 and 425days samples were collected from eleven wells nine within the study area fig 1 and two located just outside for control and analyzed for concentrations of chloride total organic carbon toc volatile organic chemicals voc including tce tca and dce and terminal electron acceptors teas including dissolved oxygen do nitrate nitrite sulfate and iron two wells mw01t and mw03t are located 4 and 6m outside the cd treatment area fig 1 they were sampled as controls during days 210 342 and 425 while four rounds of sampling were performed toc and do were not measured on day 20 also the teas nitrate nitrite sulfate and iron were only measured on days 342 and 425 no replicate samples were analyzed all groundwater samples were collected in teflon weighted bailers voss technologies at screen depth the wells used for monitoring had an inside diameter of 10 2cm and a static water column of 4m equal to 32 8l water volume inside well water levels were determined by a solinst model 101 water level meter and varied from 2 1 to 2 4m below the ground surface boving et al 2008 using standard practices of extracting at least three well volumes and waiting until geochemistry parameters stabilized t do ph ec etc would have resulted in extraction of a significant amount of the cd plume resulting in compromising the natural evolution of the system through extracting significant amounts of water thus the accepted practice of micro purging kearl et al 1994 was used this specifically involved extraction of 15l of water from the top of the water column of each monitoring well which was rapidly replaced by groundwater from the highly permeable sandy aquifer entering the well through the screen located at its base samples for analysis were then taken by submersing a bailer to the screened interval dissolved oxygen was measured with a ysi 55 do meter fitted with an extended probe cord to take readings inside the wells at screen depth boving et al 2008 target voc concentrations were determined using shimadzu model gc17a gas chromatography and flame ionization and electron capture detectors by the method detailed in boving et al 2008 the column used was spb 624 supelco 30m length with a 0 53mm inner diameter the detection limits for tce and 1 1 1 tca ecd detector were 0 76 and 0 75nm and dce fid detector were 300nm cyclodextrin concentration was measured by a shimadzu model toc 5050 total organic carbon analyzer utilizing epa method 415 modified with the use of standards prepared with the same cd as applied at the site since this method was used and since 99 9 of toc found at the site is cd the reported concentration units for toc are provided in molar units the specific type of cd used was hp β cd degree of substitution 4 98 average mw 1424g mol by wacker chemie ag and has a purity wt wt moisture content 5 0 unmodified cd 0 1 propylene glycol 0 4 ash 2 0 hp β cd 92 6 dissolved concentrations of nitrate and total iron were determined by ion selective probes hanna at the site sulfate was measured by ion chromatography by janick artiola at the swapl lab at the university of arizona specifically nitrate nitrite sulfate and chloride water data was generated using ion chromatography ic following epa method 300 and total iron was measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes following epa method 6010 no samples were collected for microbial communities analysis 3 2 groundwater well data analysis to evaluate the effects of residual cyclodextrin on groundwater chemistry and contaminant levels and their distribution statistical analysis were conducted based on measurements of target hocs tce 1 1 1 tca and dce and teas do nitrate sulfate iron from groundwater samples the data was also analyzed for potential correlations between multiple wells while the number of sampling locations was limited the effect of non uniform areal distribution is reduced through use of the kriging method krige 1951 the resulting contour maps were used to estimate the total dissolved mass of target constituents within the study area 3 2 1 statistical analysis of groundwater constituent levels from well samples the raw data consists of the concentrations of each constituent in each of the wells over the four sampling events days 20 210 342 and 425 while the levels of the target vocs were measured during each sampling round toc and dissolved oxygen do were measured in the final three events and nitrate iron sulfate and chloride were measured only during the last two events comparisons between the maximum minimum median and the arithmetic average concentrations over different events were statistically evaluated for several constituents a fraction of the data were near or below the method detection limit bdl following a common practice in risk assessment for bdl measurements concentrations were set to 50 of the corresponding detection limit epa 1990 for statistical analysis of the data set 3 2 2 contour plots of groundwater chemical constituent levels except for exceptionally well instrumented field sites such as the study herein must rely on relatively few data points this greatly reduces the spatial resolution and limits extrapolation of measured contaminant concentrations however valuable trends can be often identified even under those circumstances in this study the well data was extrapolated by contour plots created with surfer 9 golden software inc using a kriging algorithm without spatial bias spacing of the study area dimensions were kept at a minimum to reduce the amount of area for which poor well control exists by minimizing the area for which kriging was performed the results are more closely linked to field data rather than statistical projections in some instances the kriging resulted in projected values along the border of the study area that commonly exceeded levels within the study area and greatly exceeded wells outside of the study located 20 to 100m away to address this additional points outside the study area were added to smooth the contours and reduce unrealistic deviations from general trends that occurred along the edges of the study area due to lack of well data to constrain the kriging calculations the main advantage of using contour plots is that it allows qualitative comparison of spatial distributions quantitative analysis of calculated dissolved masses of different constituents between sampling rounds and more robust comparisons of total dissolved masses within the system geometric functions within surfer provided an estimate of the relative spatial fraction of the study area that falls within each contour interval each interval except the base line one represents an area 15 of the total area by taking the midpoint of a contour interval and multiplying by its relative spatial fraction a representative concentration is determined for example the contour spatially averaged concentration of tca was 72 2μm on day 210 the sum of all fractional concentrations equals the average concentration of the constituent over the study area the average mass of a constituent within a contour interval can be calculated from the concentration and aquifer volume represented by it for this the surface area of the treatment zone 11m 8m and the length of the screened interval from the bottom of the aquifer upwards 1 5m was converted to the volume of the treatment zone i e 132m3 the contaminant concentration per contour interval was then scaled to the estimated porosity of the aquifer 30 ch2mhill 2001 table 2 summarizes the average mass of all target constituents as determined from the kriging data in the case of tca 2 9mol were contained in the aqueous phase within the treatment area 3 2 3 bivariant analysis for potential relationships between groundwater constituents two dimensional scatter plots should show inverse correlations between cd and teas if cd functions as a substrate to support microbial populations that is areas of the aquifer with long term cd presence should show a reduction in tea levels associated with the microbial degradation pathways that is active in that area as such an inverse correlation between toc and tea should exist in aquifer areas where either has become depleted thus limiting the degradation reaction from proceeding for lack of one or more of the reactants a constituent can be considered as a likely tea if there is a strong hyperbolic relationship with toc if no correlation is observed then it can be ruled out as a tea two dimensional scatter plots for single wells are shown in fig 5 the advantage of the hyperbolic graph is that it clearly and concisely shows the likelihood of a tea being used to degrade toc the main drawback is that it does not provide any sort of spatial context for the points however the graphs can be examined in conjunction with the contour plots to show that tea was depleted below bdl in areas where toc is relatively high 4 results 4 1 volatile organic chemical results in all post aquifer flushing samples at least 82 of the combined voc molar average concentration was concentrated around well e3 and e6 dissolved tce and 1 1 1 tca were present at levels 11 and 8 times greater than their degradation product dce on average the average and variance in the fractional molar mass of the three observed vocs for water samples all wells are 0 34 0 038 0 56 0 017 and 0 10 0 006 respectively for tce tca and dce however the individual molar fractions of these three compounds varied substantially from one sampling round to the next for example the mole fraction of tce on day 210 was 0 61 whereas on day 425 it was 0 21 the most significant rebounds and subsequent declines between the sampling rounds were observed for tce elevated by 910 then reducing to 90 and 69 and to a lesser extent tca up 180 then decreasing 70 and 29 dce remained relatively stable especially between days 20 and 210 increasing 48 then decreasing 42 then rising again by 72 as summarized in table 2 and illustrated in contour plots fig 3 a particularly strong decrease can be observed in tce concentrations 92 and to somewhat lesser extent in 1 1 1 tca 69 and dce 48 both dissolved tce and 1 1 1 tca mass continued to decrease until the end of this study however dce mass fluctuated and was not significantly different at the end of the study compared to day 210 this is unusual because the aqueous solubility of dce is 25mm more than twice that of tce or tca each roughly the same 9 7mm lawrence 2006 modifications of raoult s law to accommodate for the effects of cyclodextrin on phase distribution for systems including water napl stationary organic sorbent and cd phases have been made mccray and brusseau 1999 blanford 2014 employing these the groundwater levels of dce should have been even higher than tce or tca if dce were it significantly present in the napl or soil sorbed phases due to its greater preference for that phase compared with tce and tca if such an increase was not observed then there must not have been much dce sorbed on the aquifer material or present in the napl importantly it appears that the amount of degraded tce 6 19mol and 1 1 1 tca 2 18mol did not cause a proportional increase in dce mass therefore it can be inferred that most of the dce mass can be accounted as a degradation product of tce and 1 1 1 tca rather than a portion of the original sorbed and napl mass a possible explanation for the relatively minimal change in observed dce concentration over time is drawn from the rates of dce production from the parent compounds primarily tce and its subsequent degradation while dce is most readily degraded aerobically as a carbon source for microbes cox 2012 it can also undergo anaerobic reductive dechlorination provided the redox conditions are at least nitrate reducing sulfate reducing or methanogenic systems bouwer and mccarty 1984 lawrence 2006 henry 2010 as illustrated in fig 5 by the disappearance of both sulfate and nitrate the conditions favorable for anaerobic dce degradation appear to have existed in the groundwater system at the site accounting for dce production primarily from tce and to a lesser extent 1 1 1 tca degradation during the observation period 97 of that dce mass may have been degraded subsequently the day 20 voc concentrations were markedly lower than those measured on day 210 indicating that the vocs levels rebounded between these sampling rounds the decrease in voc concentrations correlates with an increase in chloride ion cl concentrations especially within wells e3 and e6 as illustrated in fig 4 this data set suggests that reductive dechlorination of chlorinated voc proceeded over time however it must be noted that for reasons unknown no vinyl chloride was detected quantifiable detection level 0 03μm ch2mhill 2001 in the aqueous samples even though production would be expected via hydrolysis vogel et al 1987 due to these samples being taken only 20days after active flushing of the site with potable water divine and mccray 2004 the groundwater around the wells may have still been diluted resulting in the lower concentrations of vocs in that monitoring round than in the 210day observations fig 3 however as been seen in many studies mccray et al 2000 brusseau et al 1994 the measured aqueous levels of organic contaminants in solutions added polluted aquifers will commonly witness a rise in levels if flow is interrupted that interruption permits greater time to achieve equilibrium between the mobile fluid phase in the high permeability zones and the other phases of the system e g napl sorbed to soil presence hocs in low permeability zones 4 2 total organic carbon results raw well data analysis of toc showed that maximum cd concentrations were localized in the vicinity of around wells e3 and e6 the lowest average cd concentration 1 55mm was observed during the day 342 sampling event toc levels decreased by 65 from day 210 to 342 but apparently increased by 26 between day 342 and 425 if cd is co metabolized with the chlorinated solvents similar changes should be observed between these constituents however toc measures the total organic content of the groundwater which does not exclusively include cd although background level of organic matter in the aquifer is negligible i e toc response over 8 times lower than the day 342 median compared to cd the degradation of cd will produce some biomass such as cellulose and other maltooligomers antenucci and palmer 1984 jodal et al 1984 this biomass production may contribute to toc increases on day 425 alternatively this increase could be an artifact of poor resolution of the plume with the existing network of observation wells together with a lack of discernable cd degradation linked to the depletion of the most energetically favorable teas within the treatment zone unfortunately there is not enough data to confirm such a hypothesis if the redox reactions outlined in this paper appropriately describe our field conditions and if the level of toc is an apt measurement of the level of cd at the site then the combined amount of various electron acceptors is far exceeded by the amount of cd the potential for diminished levels of teas to inhibit the degradation of an added carbon source pollutant to an aquifer is commonly reported henry 2010 the observed apparent rise in toc from the 342 to 425 sample round has many potential cause s first the limited spatial and temporal resolution of sampling constrains knowledge of the magnitude and change in the toc plume next toc analysis methods require large degrees of dilution e g up to 1000 fold for this study thereby decreasing the confidence in calculated cd values finally rather than a direct measurement we have to rely on measured toc as a surrogate for hpcd its degradation products or other short lived biomass possibly interfering with the measurement beyond identifying the nature of toc the ability to function as electron donors is unknown 4 3 non chlorinated solvent terminal electron acceptor tea results the relative concentration of the non chlorinated solvent tea can constrain which potential biodegradation reactions may be occurring at a site also the biotic degradation of significant amounts of a substrate cyclodextrin in the aquifer should result in consumption of the teas which may correlate with an appreciable depletion in these particular constituents accordingly existence of samples with relatively high levels of both the electron donor and receiver reactants i e cd and the teas then has potential to proceed the absence of either should inhibit the reaction and in scatter diagrams of toc versus tea these points should asymptotically approach the x axis the stoichiometric reactions for complete mineralization of hp β cd with 4 hp units per molecule are aerobic respiration do reduction 1 c 42 h 66 o 35 4 c 3 h 7 o 58 o 2 54 co 2 47 h 2 o

reduced and carbon oxidized as a result 216 electrons are being transferred for each mole of hpcd mineralized the recipient of these electrons could also be the chlorinated solvent under anaerobic conditions tce might degrade via under biotic and abiotic pathways under biotic anaerobic conditions a reductive dechlorination pathway primarily results in the formation of 1 2 cis dce with 1 2 trans dce and especially 1 1 dce being less commonly produced the abiotic anaerobic pathway via dichloroelimination produces chloroethyne lawrence 2006 the biotic pathway dominates when an electron donor is

conditions scheutz et al 2011 documented three common degradation pathways the first is biotic degradation by reductive dechlorination to 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca then chloro ethane ca the other two pathways are abiotic i e 1 hydrolysis to 1 1 dichloro 1 ethanol then to acetic acid and 2 dehydrohalogenation or elimination to produce 1 1 dce if an electron donor such as molasses or perhaps cyclodextrin is present the biotic reductive dechlorination to 1 1 dca dominates lacking an appropriate electron donor hydrolysis abiotic pathway has been found to be 4 to 5 times more common than the dehydrohalogenation pathway scheutz et al 2011 since there was an excess of cyclodextrin at this site and given the propensity for hydrolysis to dominate abiotic pathways it is expected that minimal amounts of 1 1 dce were being produced via 1 1 1 tca degradation together if tce is more common at a site such as the one studied herein it is then likely that 1 2 cis isomer dce is most common and arises from tce degradation rather than tca trichloroethane reduction 6 c 42 h 66 o 35 4 c 3 h 7 o 69 h 2 o 216 c 2 cl 3 h 168 e 54 co 2 32 h 200 c 2 cl 2 h 2 200 cl eqs 5 and 6 describe the complete mineralization of cd into carbon dioxide and production of hydrogen ions which are also a necessary reactant for reductive dechlorination of highly chlorinated solvents in relatively unbuffered or alkaline systems lack of hydrogen may inhibit rates of metabolic degradation of highly chlorinated solvents such as tce in some cases biotic reductive dechlorination of tce in the presence of dissolved hydrogen gas may be a source of acid robinson et al 2009 however changes in the ph at the site were not monitored and therefore there is no data to support this potential pathway at the current time potential final products of cd degradation such as methane through methanogenetic pathways under field conditions have not been studied 4 3 1 dissolved oxygen do levels were relatively low throughout the study area over the monitoring period and no discernable spatial trends were observed with the exception of one outlier 0 03mm at well i1 at day 210 table 1 the maximum measured do concentration was 0 015mm or less indicating anaerobic conditions dinicola 2006 throughout the study domain over the sampling period fig 5 do was not sampled during active flushing of the aquifer because of injection of solutions that were in equilibrium with the atmosphere during that time levels of oxygen sufficient for aerobic degradation may have existed in the treatment zone using the kriging method krige 1951 average do concentration decreased by 25 from day 210 to 342 and then increased 47 by day 425 resulting in an overall rise in do by 10 while this trend somewhat mirrors toc activity there is no correlation between do and toc in different monitoring wells if aerobic degradation had played a meaningful role then it may have been observed in day 20 sampling due to fact that water was injected during the post cd flushing tracer test but unfortunately it was not measured based on fig 5 do does not directly or inversely coincide with toc levels and further underscores that aerobic degradation was unlikely to contribute to meaningfully to the trends in cd in the final three sampling rounds 4 3 2 nitrate nitrate as nitrate nitrite was only measured in the final two sample events day 342 and 425 table 2 out of all teas evaluated nitrate exhibited the greatest decrease 90 however of 18 measurements taken only six contained nitrate nitrite above the detection limit 1 6μm the median of these six measurements was four times the detection level the nitrate contour plot fig 7 shows that much of it was concentrated around wells i1 and e5 versus toc which was centered on e3 and e6 the scatter plot fig 5 demonstrates fairly strong inverse correlation with toc which suggest that anaerobic nitrate reducing conditions were present in the aquifer during monitoring 4 3 3 sulfate as with nitrate sulfate was measured during the last two sampling events the average sulfate concentration in the study area was 0 017mm on day 342 whereas the average concentration from the monitoring wells was 0 270mm tables 2 and 3 of the 18 samples analyzed three e3 e5 e6 all on day 425 were bdl 1 0μm where detectable sulfate s median concentration decreased by 64 from days 342 to 425 table 1 the sulfate contour maps fig 7 indicates that its concentration decreased to bdl from day 342 to 425 in the same vicinity as elevated levels of toc were found to persist wells e3 and e6 this correlation suggests consumption of this tea to the point that it may have been locally limiting the sulfate based reaction s the observed dissolved sulfate levels generally fell and saw a net 31 reduction within the confines of the study area table 2 the distribution of sulfate appears to be inversely correlated with the relatively high levels of vocs and toc found in the vicinity of wells e3 and e6 fig 6 indicating that the chlorinated solvents may have been depleted during the degradation of cd in a sulfate mediated reducing reaction another area of relatively low sulfate can be observed outside the cd plume near well e5 direct comparisons of toc and sulfate levels of individual samples fig 6c shows a relatively strong asymptotic correlation this implies a causal relationship where cd and sulfate might be involved in an oxidation reduction reaction based on the site s background sulfate concentration 0 270mm the amount of sulfate at the end of the monitoring period was reduced by 9 6mol according to eq 4 that 9 6mol of sulfate could have mineralized up to 0 24mol cd which is only 0 3 of the amount of cd observed to have disappeared table 4 4 3 4 iron in iron mediated biodegradation eq 3 ferric iron is reduced to ferrous iron total dissolved iron concentrations were measured for the last two rounds of sampling all the measured iron concentrations were at least 500 times the method detection level 1 8nm while the median concentrations from the raw data showed a decrease in the amount of iron by 71 from day 342 to 425 table 1 the calculated distribution of iron during these two sample events lack correlation between themselves fig 7e and f and with the corresponding toc contour plots fig 3 closer examination shows that on day 342 well e7 and to a lesser extent i1 had relatively high levels of dissolved iron respectively 0 16 and 0 07mm which were 3 3 and 1 5 times higher than the next highest well e6 on day 425 e2 and e3 measured 0 08 and 0 09mm which were 6 3 and 7 3 times higher than the next highest well mw02 showing a shift in the distribution of dissolved iron the scatter plot of iron versus toc fig 5d shows a weak inverse correlation a stronger inverse correlation is observed when compared to highly chlorinated vocs fig 6b and d which is predicted for these systems robinson et al 2009 the preferential use of sulfate compared to iron indicates that this aquifer system may have exhibited strongly reducing conditions which are ideal for the biodegradation of highly chlorinated chloroethenes dinicola 2006 prior to the introduction of cyclodextrin do levels in the wider study area were all at anaerobic levels 12 5μm n 4 these wells were screened at the base of the aquifer which was the same level at which this study was conducted introduction of an additional potential electron donor cd further encouraged reducing conditions eh and ph were not measured in this study but it is unlikely that they were in the range where ferric ions fe 3 would be the dominant iron species eh 0 77v ph 4 since the introduction of a significant amount of organic matter i e cd and level of non iron tea provides evidence that the system was reducing and because reductive dechlorination of that organic matter would result in consumption of acid it is likely that the ferrous valence state fe 2 was more common than the ferric therefore dissolved iron is likely to be dominated by ferrous valence states in a metastable condition and as a result iron is unlikely to serve as a terminal electron acceptor in this system 5 discussion in the absence of pumping or significant natural groundwater advection biotic or abiotic degradation are the dominant processes converting and eventually mineralizing chlorinated solvents from an aquifer lawrence 2006 the addition of cd a carbohydrate and therefore a potentially microbial community sustaining substrate to the system may accelerate the biodegradation process of these contaminants allan et al 2007 the potential efficacy of residual levels of cd as a means to enhance biodegradation rates and levels can be potentially monitored through tracking the concentration of the cd contaminants and associated inorganic constituents in this field study cd was flushed through the groundwater in single and cross well push pull tests in an effort to remove the contaminants from the groundwater following this active remediation the residual cd was left in the aquifer and voc tea and cd levels all were monitored through well samples over four sampling rounds for a period of 425days to thoroughly assess the outcome of leaving the cd in the aquifer several analytical techniques were applied statistical analysis of the raw well data provided unbiased correlations creation of contour plots of concentration change of the aquifer constituents added spatial context to the singular points and scatter plots between the teas and toc illustrated which teas most likely degraded the cd based on these methods it was inferred that the addition of cd initially caused a spike in voc concentrations as they underwent desorption and dissolution afterwards the peak mass of tce decreased substantially by 98 along with notable losses of tca 75 and dce 26 dce was produced from the degradation of tce and tca but was itself being degraded faster that its rate of production the presence of highly chlorinated solvents such as tce or tca present at the site have been shown to be more resistant to degradation than naturally occurring low molecular weight hydrocarbons such as pahs and alkanes lawrence 2006 under aerobic conditions degradation may occur through co metabolism where a second substrate assists the breakdown of the organochlorides hubert et al 2005 in anaerobic conditions fermenters are required to break down the electron donors into smaller molecules which provide the electrons needed to fuel reductive dechlorination given the anaerobic site conditions and the 98 decrease in tce and 75 decrease in tca from day 210 to 425 fermentation of the cd likely occurred potentially promoting the dechlorination of these vocs however no direct evidence for such processes was collected highly chlorinated chemicals also are more prone to be biodegraded under anaerobic conditions lawrence 2006 which is unfortunate because in general hydrocarbons that can be readily degraded by both aerobic and anaerobic pathways commonly are slower via anaerobic means erses et al 2008 at sites where there is sufficient dissolved oxygen christensen et al 2000 to be functionally considered aerobic 0 03mm pce tce and 1 1 1 tca can persist because the anaerobic bacteria are unable to effectively degrade them dinicola 2006 in this field study do levels never exceeded 0 03mm under these anaerobic circumstances residual cd can serve as an electron donor in addition to complexing with the pollutants cds have been found to be biodegraded aerobically fenyvesi et al 2005 our data indicates that at least from day 210 to 425 low do correlates with decreasing cd concentrations which suggest that cd degradation under anaerobic conditions is occurring our data however does not permit judgement if the cd degradation was a driving factor in converting the initially aerobic aquifer into an anaerobic system the residual cd left in the subsurface after active flushing of the contaminated aquifer solutions did correlate with a zone of depleted teas nitrate and sulfate it also correlated with the area where enhanced conversion of highly chlorinated solvents was observed these findings imply that the presence of cd 1 enhanced the bioavailability of vocs as previously described in the literature reid et al 2000 cuypers et al 2002 liu et al 2002 yang et al 2016 and 2 possibly provided a significant carbon source to instigate the formation of microbial populations as shown by fenyvesi et al 2009 that in turn can facilitate the degradation of hocs however the degradation pathway of cd in an anaerobic system needs to be better established as well as the nature and dynamics of the microbial communities involved herein once a better understanding of these systems is established more thorough and appropriate sampling and analysis methods including isotopic co2 and n2 gas sampling total organic nitrogen analysis ton and direct measurement of cd rather than approximated by toc can be employed as a result the potential utility of cd application to promote reductive dechlorination and function as an efficacious remedial technology can be more fully assessed 6 conclusion our data suggests that under reducing conditions when teas do nitrate sulfate etc are essentially depleted but both cd and chlorinated solvents are still present the cd appears to facilitate dechlorination by functioning as an electron donor cd was monitored as toc and decreased by 56 over 410days of monitoring indicating that it too was degraded along with the cvoc based on the contour maps areas of relatively high toc coincided with those apparently depleted of certain teas the redox environment was ideal for reductive dechlorination of vocs the loss of toc in the same location of voc loss indicates cyclodextrin was at least aiding in the reductive dechlorination of tce tca and dce while this work shows that cyclodextrin has great potential for facilitating degradation of chlorinated solvents more work is needed particularly determination of cd and pollutant degradation pathways under field conditions is warranted in combination with sampling for soil gases such as nitrogen hydrogen sulfide or methane and a characterization of the microbial communities in the treatment zone

applied to lid simulation the objective of this study was to propose the new approach for modeling the effectiveness of lid practices using hspf s surface ftable and to evaluate the impacts of lid application on hydrological components and water balance also the difference in hydrological components according to the three scenarios based on the lid application area was analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study watershed and input data preparation the lid practices were applied to an urbanized area namely the gulpo stream watershed located in south korea fig 1 a the gulpo watershed exhibits an area of 110 9 km2 compared to that in 1975 fig 1 b the urbanized area had increased by 39 8 in 2013 fig 1 c in 2013 53 6 of land use was urbanized accounting for 24 6 km2 22 2 of the total residential area urban a and 34 9 km2 31 5 of the total commercial area urban b a 10 m digital elevation map was generated using a topographic map provided by the korea national spatial data infrastructure portal it was used to delineate the watershed and subwatershed boundaries land use data were obtained from the korean ministry of environment daily weather and hourly rainfall observations were compiled from weather stations in incheon operated by the korea meteorological administration urbanized areas were classified into two groups urban a and urban b based on st johns river water management district 2012 the imperviousness of urban a and urban b was kept at 80 and 90 respectively further lid was only implemented in urban b 2 2 bioretention design bioretention one of the most frequently used lid practices davis et al 2009 was applied in this study a bioretention is a landscaped depression that receives runoff from upper impervious surfaces and consists of several layers of filter media vegetation an overflow weir and an optional underdrain liu et al 2014 bioretention mimics the natural hydrologic cycle by retaining runoff to decrease flow rates and volumes dietz 2007 liu et al 2014 bioretention can manage stormwater with high efficiency at a low cost it can be applied to various locations such as residential complexes industrial complexes parks roads parking lots and other locations it is easy to secure a site because existing green areas can be used additionally it has a high landscape and aesthetic effect in fig 2 the upper ponding depth of the bioretention d1 should be 15 30 cm and the depth of the soil layer d2 should be between 30 and 60 cm the soil layer in the bioretention should exhibit a porosity of at least 0 35 n1 for water retention and infiltration it must also be designed to exclude all water quality volume wqv within a maximum of 3 days after a storm to prepare for the next rainfall event the size of the bioretention is designed based on the water quality volume for the bioretention design the sum of the capacity v1 of the upper ponding depth capacity v2 stored in the soil layer and capacity v3 that infiltrated underlying soils should be greater than wqv eq 4 the v1 v2 and v3 are calculated from eq 1 3 1 v 1 a d 1 2 v 2 n 1 a d 2 3 v 3 k 1 a t where v1 m3 is the capacity of the upper ponding depth v2 m3 is the capacity stored in the soil layer v3 m3 is the capacity that infiltrated the underlying soils a m2 is the surface area of bioretention d1 m is the upper ponding depth n1 is the porosity of soil layer d2 m is the depth of the soil layer k1 mm h is the infiltration rate of the soil layer and t hr is the inflow time the capacity of the bioretention sum of v1 v2 v3 was calculated by eq 4 4 v 1 v 2 v 3 a d 1 n 1 a d 2 k 1 a t a d 1 n 1 d 2 k 1 t w q v the wqv could be expressed as the product of the drainage area ad and the design rainfall rd the surface area of bioretention a is summarized in eq 5 5 a d 1 n 1 d 2 k 1 t w q v a d r d in this study rd was assumed to be 25 4 mm 1 0 in d1 and d2 were set to 0 3 m 30 cm and k1 was 6 0 mm hr consequently the ratio of a ad was approximately 1 16 as shown in eq 6 6 a a d r d d 1 n 1 d 2 k 1 t 0 0254 0 3 0 35 0 3 6 0 10 3 2 1 16 4173 therefore in this study a was set to 1 16 of the ad 2 3 hydrological simulation program fortran hspf the hspf model is a process based continuous spatially lumped parameter model that can describe the movement of water while elucidating a variety of water quality constituents on pervious and impervious surfaces in soil profiles and within a stream and well mixed reservoirs bicknell et al 2001 kim et al 2007 seong et al 2015 hspf has been applied and tested in many countries mostly for evaluations of bmp effectiveness borah et al 2019 hydrologic simulation in the model consists of three modules impervious land segment implnd pervious land segment perlnd and free flowing reach or mixed reservoir rchres the implnd module represents impervious surface areas and simulates only surface water components the perlnd simulates hydrologic processes that occur on pervious surface areas including infiltration evapotranspiration surface detention interflow groundwater discharge to stream and percolation to a deep aquifer the rchres module simulates the hydraulic behavior of channel flow using the kinematic wave assumption details regarding the simulation mechanisms of the model can be found in bicknell et al 2001 in this research only the hydrologic processes were simulated sediment and water quality were not considered before the application of the lid facility the model was calibrated and validated the performance of the hspf model was evaluated using three statistical methods the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias in this study the criteria of r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 and pbias 15 as suggested by moriasi et al 2015 were considered to be the basis for daily streamflow calibration streamflow data for the calibration and validation of the hspf model were collected from the korean me gauge station gulpo a in fig 1 a within the watershed the four hydrological hspf parameters table 1 were selected and adjusted 2 4 low impact development lid application using hspf lid controls tool the hspf lid controls tool can simulate infiltration bmps by creating ftables further by using this tool the bmp type channel shape dimensions of the bmp facility flow control devices and infiltration method could be selected based on the selection the program generates an hspf formatted ftable the ftable is applied to rchres rch for representing infiltration based bmps bmp types include dry well infiltration basin infiltration trench rain barrel rain garden bioretention roof garden sand filter storage tank vegetated swale and wetland in this study bioretention was selected and applied among the bmp types for the analysis of hydrologic components when lid was applied the hspf lid controls tool creates ftables according to the area of the lid facility and the infiltration rate it allows the model to calculate infiltration and runoff accordingly without lid fig 3 a the outflows of both implnd and perlnd which are land segments in urban b flow directly into the rchres module when applying 60 of the lid facility using the lid controls tool fig 3 b the outflow from 60 of the area of implnd flows into rch9x rch91 rch92 rch93 which serves as the lid facility subsequently infiltration and outflow are calculated at the rchres module here the ftable of the rchres module is used in the hspf lid controls tool the infiltration of the lid facility is simulated in the rchres module accordingly it would be difficult to transport the water infiltrated from the lid facility to other land segments therefore it was usually eliminated without further simulation accordingly when the water budget was analyzed the water balance does not sustain 2 5 low impact development application using surface ftable the surface ftable is a method used for computing surface runoff from a perlnd which defines the fraction of the surface storage that runs off in a given interval as per the storage depth surface ftable was previously applied to the model for wetland simulation the model has recently been modified to ensure that the surface ftable can be used without using the high groundwater level option in the hspf model cera 2012 jobes 2012 surface ftable sets the fraction of the water quantity on the surface that flows to the surface runoff it is similar to the ftable of the rchres module however it provides a fractional value without lid fig 4 a the perlnd and implnd were routed directly to their rchres modules when applying 60 of the lid facility using the surface ftable fig 4 b the outflow from 60 of the area of implnd flows into each perlndx92 perlnd192 perlnd292 perlnd392 which serves as the lid facility subsequently infiltration and outflow are calculated at the perlnd module here the surface ftable module is used which shows the potential for more evapotranspiration and attenuated surface runoff in the lid facility the surface ftable must be developed to set the quantity of the surface outflow of the perlndx92 as the lid facility area since the ponding depth of the lid structure is assumed to be 30 cm fig 5 a the runoff ratio can be assumed to be 0 up to the depth of 30 cm if the depth of surface storage is d m the following eq 7 can express the runoff ratio x 7 x 0 d 30 c m x d 0 3 d d 30 c m fig 5 b displays the surface ftable curve applied in this study the applicability of the model was evaluated by comparing the results obtained using the lid controls tool in the hspf model which in turn was employed to simulate the infiltration and outflow in the lid facility using surface ftable 2 6 analysis of changes in hydrologic components changes in the hydrological components were analyzed using the lid facility for long term analysis data from the last 30 years 1986 2015 among modeling results were used for long term analysis the analyzed hydrological components were precipitation surface outflow interflow outflow baseflow outflow total flow actual evapotranspiration aet and infiltration here infiltration was calculated by subtracting surface outflow the evaporation in the interception storage and surface storage from the total precipitation flow duration curve analysis was performed to examine the difference in flow duration curves due to the changes in hydrological components when the lid was applied and to link with tmdl in korea in the future the flow duration curve was analyzed using the 10 year data period of the tmdl reference flow calculation method 2 7 water balance analysis a water balance analysis was also performed here precipitation was set to enter the basin the actual evapotranspiration surface outflow interflow outflow baseflow outflow and inflow to active groundwater were set to exit the basin as shown in fig 6 in general the quantity of water remaining in the basin can vibrate but it should not be released 2 8 low impact development scenarios in this study a total of three scenarios were analyzed by using the surface ftable according to the area of the lid facility that was utilized table 2 describes the lid scenario the indices of area managed by lid and area to apply lid in table 2 correspond to ad and a in eq 6 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of hydrological simulation program fortran model to calibrate and validate the streamflow for the study watershed the observed and simulated streamflows at gulpo a were compared daily model performances were determined to be acceptable as the r2 and nse values were both 0 6 during the calibration 2008 2010 and validation 2011 2014 periods fig 7 the model tended to underestimate streamflow during the calibration pbias 8 23 and overestimate during validation pbias 9 09 these statistical results and graphical comparisons indicate that the model performed satisfactorily for the studied watershed during the calibration and validation periods 3 2 application of low impact development the lid facility was simulated using the surface ftable and the applicability was evaluated by comparing the results associated with the simulation of the lid facility which were obtained by using the lid controls tool with the surface outflow the values of stream outflow ovol1 of lid rchs rch91 rch92 rch93 in fig 3 b and the values of surface outflow suro of lid perlnds perlnd192 perlnd292 perlnd392 in fig 4 b were compared using a 1 1 scatter plot fig 8 since the r2 values obtained in this comparison were 0 998 or higher for all the three subwatershed results it is judged that the lid implementation method using the surface ftable is reasonable 3 3 analysis of the changes in hydrological components changes in hydrological components were analyzed for three cases when the lid facility was not utilized without lid the lid facility using the lid controls tool was utilized hspf lid controls tool and the lid facility using the surface ftable was utilized hspf lid using the surface ftable fig 9 changes in hydrological components were analyzed by comparing the simulation results from 1986 to 2015 with the 30 year average values in the surface outflow results the results of the lid controls tool and the lid using the surface ftable were similar when lid was applied using surface ftable the interflow outflow increased significantly because water stored in the lid facility infiltrated and contributed to the interflow additionally the baseflow outflow was increased as compared to that observed when the lid was not applied for actual evapotranspiration when the lid facility was simulated using the surface ftable an increase of 2 5 mm was observed this is because the lid facility stores water that would flow out when there are no lid facilities thus increasing the probability of evaporation for the total outflow a similar value of less than about 3 5 mm difference was observed between the case where lid was not applied and the case where lid was applied using surface ftable this is because the evapotranspiration and infiltration increased when the lid was applied conversely interflow outflow baseflow outflow and total outflow were significantly reduced when using the lid controls tool because the infiltration quantity was calculated and then deleted in the rch module in fig 10 to analyze the temporal change of the total outflow according to the application of the lid the discharge curve for the total outflow per hour is displayed in 2015 when lid was applied the peak value of outflow was lower than that observed when lid was not applied and after rainfall the flow decreased similar to that obtained when the lid was not applied when using the lid controls tool the total outflow was lower than that observed when the lid facility was not applied because the infiltration quantity through the lid facility was completely eliminated conversely when using lid with surface ftable the peak value of outflow was lower than that observed when lid was not applied after the rainfall was over water infiltrated in lid facility has contributed to the interflow and baseflow which continuously flowed out resulting in a continuous total outflow as shown in fig 11 if the hydrographs for each storm event are drawn the characteristics of each case could be noticed in more detail in fig 11 a it can be seen that from the start of the first rainfall to before april 15 2015 the peak discharge of lid applied cases is lower than that of non lid applied cases from noon on the 15th the bioretention applied in hspf lid using surface ftable was full and the storage function was lost so the peak discharge was similar to that in which lid was not applied from fig 11 b it can be seen that the peak discharge when the lid was applied occurred later than when the lid was not applied and the value also decreased from the hydrograph of both events it can be seen that the water stored in the bioretention in hspf lid using surface ftable infiltrates and flows out into the interflow and the baseflow so that the total flow continues even after the event is over when the surface ftable lid was applied it was thought that the corresponding difference would also be observed in the flow duration curve due to the increased interflow and baseflow therefore the flow duration curve analysis was performed fig 12 table 3 an analysis of the flow duration curve was performed based on the excess probability interval proposed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2007 the usepa divided the duration curve into five zones high flows 0 10 moist conditions 10 40 mid range flows 40 60 dry conditions 60 90 low flows 90 100 when applying the surface ftable lid the average value of duration decreased in the high flow section in other sections the value increased due to the influence of interflow and baseflow however when the lid technique was applied using the lid controls tool the infiltration process in the lid facility was eliminated without affecting the outflow therefore the average value of the duration decreased in all the sections 3 4 water balance analysis a water balance analysis was performed using the simulation results of the hspf model data from the last 30 years 1986 2015 were used for the water balance analysis the analysis results are presented in table 4 below the water balance value was close to 0 when the lid was not applied and when the lid was applied using the surface ftable however when the lid was applied using the lid controls tool the water balance value was significantly different from 0 this result is observed probably because the infiltration process through the lid facility was no longer simulated in the hspf model inconsistent water balance is a phenomenon that cannot occur in reality in the long term analysis so using the hspf lid controls tool is not suitable for long term hydrological analysis conversely in the case of using surface ftable the retention effect of lid appears the same as the behavior of the existing lid model and water balance is maintained this simulates reality well and is shown to be suitable for long term hydrological analysis in relation to the recent issue of the hydrological cycle based on the results of the water balance analysis it can be confirmed that the precipitation was different only when the lid was used using the lid controls tool this is because prsupy the precipitation value on the rch module is limited to the value contributing to the water surface when the water surface is not formed because of the absence of water in the rch precipitation is not recognized 3 5 low impact development scenarios scenario analysis was performed according to the lid application rate this was achieved using the simulation results obtained with surface ftable for the last 30 years and an analysis was performed for each hydrological component according to the lid application rate using the surface ftable results of hydrological components analysis according to scenario according to lid application rate using surface ftable are presented in table 5 as a result of the analysis the interflow outflow baseflow outflow actual evapotranspiration and infiltration values increased as the lid application rate increased as the lid application rate increased the surface outflow and total outflow values decreased most of the water infiltrated through the lid facility flows out through interflow and baseflow however the total outflow decreased as more evaporation were generated through the lid facility 4 conclusions in this study the changes in hydrological elements with the application of lid were simulated using the lid controls tool in the existing hspf model as well as the surface ftable module used in wetland simulation before applying the lid facility to the hspf model the model was calibrated and verified through statistical results and graphical comparisons to ensure that it operated satisfactorily the surface outflow results of the simulation performed with lid using the surface ftable were similar to those obtained with the lid controls tool therefore it is thought that the surface ftable can be used for the lid application analysis as a result of the hydrological element analysis surface outflow can be reduced when using the lid controls tool however the quantity of infiltration through the lid facility did not contribute to other hydrological elements conversely in the simulation of the lid facility through surface ftable the surface outflow reduction is similar to that obtained with the lid controls tool at the same time the quantity of infiltration through the lid facility contributes to other hydrological factors accordingly when using surface ftable lid interflow and baseflow increased further evapotranspiration and infiltration increased due to the lid facility as a result of the flow duration curve analysis when the lid was simulated using the surface ftable the average value decreased only in the high flow section the value increased in the other sections due to the influence of interflow and baseflow the lid controls tool demonstrates a smaller value than that observed when the lid is not applied in all sections this is because the infiltration process in the lid facility disappeared from the simulation similar results were observed in the water balance analysis for surface ftable lid the water balance was maintained and the water balance value was similar to that observed when the lid was not applied for the lid controls tool it was found that the water balance could not be balanced due to the problem of penetration when lid is applied using the lid controls tool it is possible to simulate the delay of peak discharge occurrence time and the reduction of its value due to the lid function still it is not suitable for long term hydrological analysis such as long term water balance is not correct on the other hand in case of using surface ftable it is possible to simulate the delay of peak discharge occurrence time and the decrease in its value by the lid function and since the water balance of analysis processes is correct long term hydrologic analysis can be performed for long term hydrological planning of watersheds lid analysis using surface ftable is necessary as a result of the lid scenario analysis a larger lid effect was observed for a higher lid application rate based on this result it can be suggested that the surface ftable method should be used rather than the lid controls tool when performing the lid application analysis through the hspf model in this study only the hydrological processes were analyzed but additional water quality analyses will be needed in the future according to the application of lid facilities declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

an area of 110 9 km2 compared to that in 1975 fig 1 b the urbanized area had increased by 39 8 in 2013 fig 1 c in 2013 53 6 of land use was urbanized accounting for 24 6 km2 22 2 of the total residential area urban a and 34 9 km2 31 5 of the total commercial area urban b a 10 m digital elevation map was generated using a topographic map provided by the korea national spatial data infrastructure portal it was used to delineate the watershed and subwatershed boundaries land use data were obtained from the korean ministry of environment daily weather and hourly rainfall observations were compiled from weather stations in incheon operated by the korea meteorological administration urbanized areas were classified into two groups urban a and urban b based on st johns river water management district 2012 the imperviousness of urban a and urban b was kept at 80 and 90 respectively further lid was only implemented in urban b 2 2 bioretention design bioretention one of the most frequently used lid practices davis et al 2009 was applied in this study a bioretention is a landscaped depression that receives runoff from upper impervious surfaces and consists of several layers of filter media vegetation an overflow weir and an optional underdrain liu et al 2014 bioretention mimics the natural hydrologic cycle by retaining runoff to decrease flow rates and volumes dietz 2007 liu et al 2014 bioretention can manage stormwater with high efficiency at a low cost it can be applied to various locations such as residential complexes industrial complexes parks roads parking lots and other locations it is easy to secure a site because existing green areas can be used additionally it has a high landscape and aesthetic effect in fig 2 the upper ponding depth of the bioretention d1 should be 15 30 cm and the depth of the soil layer d2 should be between 30 and 60 cm the soil layer in the bioretention should exhibit a porosity of at least 0 35 n1 for water retention and infiltration it must also be designed to exclude all water quality volume wqv within a maximum of 3 days after a storm to prepare for the next rainfall event the size of the bioretention is designed based on the water quality volume for the bioretention design the sum of the capacity v1 of the upper ponding depth capacity v2 stored in the soil layer and capacity v3 that infiltrated underlying soils should be greater than wqv eq 4 the v1 v2 and v3 are calculated from eq 1 3 1 v 1 a d 1 2 v 2 n 1 a d 2 3 v 3 k 1 a t where v1 m3 is the capacity of the upper ponding depth v2 m3 is the capacity stored in the soil layer v3 m3 is the capacity that infiltrated the underlying soils a m2 is the surface area of bioretention d1 m is the upper ponding depth n1 is the porosity of soil layer d2 m is the depth of the soil layer k1 mm h is the infiltration rate of the soil layer and t hr is the inflow time the capacity of the bioretention sum of v1 v2 v3 was calculated by eq 4 4 v 1 v 2 v 3 a d 1 n 1 a d 2 k 1 a t a d 1 n 1 d 2 k 1 t w q v the wqv could be expressed as the product of the drainage area ad and the design rainfall rd the surface area of bioretention a is summarized in eq 5 5 a d 1 n 1 d 2 k 1 t w q v a d r d in this study rd was assumed to be 25 4 mm 1 0 in d1 and d2 were set to 0 3 m 30 cm and k1 was 6 0 mm hr consequently the ratio of a ad was approximately 1 16 as shown in eq 6 6 a a d r d d 1 n 1 d 2 k 1 t 0 0254 0 3 0 35 0 3 6 0 10 3 2 1 16 4173 therefore in this study a was set to 1 16 of the ad 2 3 hydrological simulation program fortran hspf the hspf model is a process based continuous spatially lumped parameter model that can describe the movement of water while elucidating a variety of water quality constituents on pervious and impervious surfaces in soil profiles and within a stream and well mixed reservoirs bicknell et al 2001 kim et al 2007 seong et al 2015 hspf has been applied and tested in many countries mostly for evaluations of bmp effectiveness borah et al 2019 hydrologic simulation in the model consists of three modules impervious land segment implnd pervious land segment perlnd and free flowing reach or mixed reservoir rchres the implnd module represents impervious surface areas and simulates only surface water components the perlnd simulates hydrologic processes that occur on pervious surface areas including infiltration evapotranspiration surface detention interflow groundwater discharge to stream and percolation to a deep aquifer the rchres module simulates the hydraulic behavior of channel flow using the kinematic wave assumption details regarding the simulation mechanisms of the model can be found in bicknell et al 2001 in this research only the hydrologic processes were simulated sediment and water quality were not considered before the application of the lid facility the model was calibrated and validated the performance of the hspf model was evaluated using three statistical methods the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias in this study the criteria of r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 and pbias 15 as suggested by moriasi et al 2015 were considered to be the basis for daily streamflow calibration streamflow data for the calibration and validation of the hspf model were collected from the korean me gauge station gulpo a in fig 1 a within the watershed the four hydrological hspf parameters table 1 were selected and adjusted 2 4 low impact development lid application using hspf lid controls tool the hspf lid controls tool can simulate infiltration bmps by creating ftables further by using this tool the bmp type channel shape dimensions of the bmp facility flow control devices and infiltration method could be selected based on the selection the program generates an hspf formatted ftable the ftable is applied to rchres rch for representing infiltration based bmps bmp types include dry well infiltration basin infiltration trench rain barrel rain garden bioretention roof garden sand filter storage tank vegetated swale and wetland in this study bioretention was selected and applied among the bmp types for the analysis of hydrologic components when lid was applied the hspf lid controls tool creates ftables according to the area of the lid facility and the infiltration rate it allows the model to calculate infiltration and runoff accordingly without lid fig 3 a the outflows of both implnd and perlnd which are land segments in urban b flow directly into the rchres module when applying 60 of the lid facility using the lid controls tool fig 3 b the outflow from 60 of the area of implnd flows into rch9x rch91 rch92 rch93 which serves as the lid facility subsequently infiltration and outflow are calculated at the rchres module here the ftable of the rchres module is used in the hspf lid controls tool the infiltration of the lid facility is simulated in the rchres module accordingly it would be difficult to transport the water infiltrated from the lid facility to other land segments therefore it was usually eliminated without further simulation accordingly when the water budget was analyzed the water balance does not sustain 2 5 low impact development application using surface ftable the surface ftable is a method used for computing surface runoff from a perlnd which defines the fraction of the surface storage that runs off in a given interval as per the storage depth surface ftable was previously applied to the model for wetland simulation the model has recently been modified to ensure that the surface ftable can be used without using the high groundwater level option in the hspf model cera 2012 jobes 2012 surface ftable sets the fraction of the water quantity on the surface that flows to the surface runoff it is similar to the ftable of the rchres module however it provides a fractional value without lid fig 4 a the perlnd and implnd were routed directly to their rchres modules when applying 60 of the lid facility using the surface ftable fig 4 b the outflow from 60 of the area of implnd flows into each perlndx92 perlnd192 perlnd292 perlnd392 which serves as the lid facility subsequently infiltration and outflow are calculated at the perlnd module here the surface ftable module is used which shows the potential for more evapotranspiration and attenuated surface runoff in the lid facility the surface ftable must be developed to set the quantity of the surface outflow of the perlndx92 as the lid facility area since the ponding depth of the lid structure is assumed to be 30 cm fig 5 a the runoff ratio can be assumed to be 0 up to the depth of 30 cm if the depth of surface storage is d m the following eq 7 can express the runoff ratio x 7 x 0 d 30 c m x d 0 3 d d 30 c m fig 5 b displays the surface ftable curve applied in this study the applicability of the model was evaluated by comparing the results obtained using the lid controls tool in the hspf model which in turn was employed to simulate the infiltration and outflow in the lid facility using surface ftable 2 6 analysis of changes in hydrologic components changes in the hydrological components were analyzed using the lid facility for long term analysis data from the last 30 years 1986 2015 among modeling results were used for long term analysis the analyzed hydrological components were precipitation surface outflow interflow outflow baseflow outflow total flow actual evapotranspiration aet and infiltration here infiltration was calculated by subtracting surface outflow the evaporation in the interception storage and surface storage from the total precipitation flow duration curve analysis was performed to examine the difference in flow duration curves due to the changes in hydrological components when the lid was applied and to link with tmdl in korea in the future the flow duration curve was analyzed using the 10 year data period of the tmdl reference flow calculation method 2 7 water balance analysis a water balance analysis was also performed here precipitation was set to enter the basin the actual evapotranspiration surface outflow interflow outflow baseflow outflow and inflow to active groundwater were set to exit the basin as shown in fig 6 in general the quantity of water remaining in the basin can vibrate but it should not be released 2 8 low impact development scenarios in this study a total of three scenarios were analyzed by using the surface ftable according to the area of the lid facility that was utilized table 2 describes the lid scenario the indices of area managed by lid and area to apply lid in table 2 correspond to ad and a in eq 6 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 calibration and validation of hydrological simulation program fortran model to calibrate and validate the streamflow for the study watershed the observed and simulated streamflows at gulpo a were compared daily model performances were determined to be acceptable as the r2 and nse values were both 0 6 during the calibration 2008 2010 and validation 2011 2014 periods fig 7 the model tended to underestimate streamflow during the calibration pbias 8 23 and overestimate during validation pbias 9 09 these statistical results and graphical comparisons indicate that the model performed satisfactorily for the studied watershed during the calibration and validation periods 3 2 application of low impact development the lid facility was simulated using the surface ftable and the applicability was evaluated by comparing the results associated with the simulation of the lid facility which were obtained by using the lid controls tool with the surface outflow the values of stream outflow ovol1 of lid rchs rch91 rch92 rch93 in fig 3 b and the values of surface outflow suro of lid perlnds perlnd192 perlnd292 perlnd392 in fig 4 b were compared using a 1 1 scatter plot fig 8 since the r2 values obtained in this comparison were 0 998 or higher for all the three subwatershed results it is judged that the lid implementation method using the surface ftable is reasonable 3 3 analysis of the changes in hydrological components changes in hydrological components were analyzed for three cases when the lid facility was not utilized without lid the lid facility using the lid controls tool was utilized hspf lid controls tool and the lid facility using the surface ftable was utilized hspf lid using the surface ftable fig 9 changes in hydrological components were analyzed by comparing the simulation results from 1986 to 2015 with the 30 year average values in the surface outflow results the results of the lid controls tool and the lid using the surface ftable were similar when lid was applied using surface ftable the interflow outflow increased significantly because water stored in the lid facility infiltrated and contributed to the interflow additionally the baseflow outflow was increased as compared to that observed when the lid was not applied for actual evapotranspiration when the lid facility was simulated using the surface ftable an increase of 2 5 mm was observed this is because the lid facility stores water that would flow out when there are no lid facilities thus increasing the probability of evaporation for the total outflow a similar value of less than about 3 5 mm difference was observed between the case where lid was not applied and the case where lid was applied using surface ftable this is because the evapotranspiration and infiltration increased when the lid was applied conversely interflow outflow baseflow outflow and total outflow were significantly reduced when using the lid controls tool because the infiltration quantity was calculated and then deleted in the rch module in fig 10 to analyze the temporal change of the total outflow according to the application of the lid the discharge curve for the total outflow per hour is displayed in 2015 when lid was applied the peak value of outflow was lower than that observed when lid was not applied and after rainfall the flow decreased similar to that obtained when the lid was not applied when using the lid controls tool the total outflow was lower than that observed when the lid facility was not applied because the infiltration quantity through the lid facility was completely eliminated conversely when using lid with surface ftable the peak value of outflow was lower than that observed when lid was not applied after the rainfall was over water infiltrated in lid facility has contributed to the interflow and baseflow which continuously flowed out resulting in a continuous total outflow as shown in fig 11 if the hydrographs for each storm event are drawn the characteristics of each case could be noticed in more detail in fig 11 a it can be seen that from the start of the first rainfall to before april 15 2015 the peak discharge of lid applied cases is lower than that of non lid applied cases from noon on the 15th the bioretention applied in hspf lid using surface ftable was full and the storage function was lost so the peak discharge was similar to that in which lid was not applied from fig 11 b it can be seen that the peak discharge when the lid was applied occurred later than when the lid was not applied and the value also decreased from the hydrograph of both events it can be seen that the water stored in the bioretention in hspf lid using surface ftable infiltrates and flows out into the interflow and the baseflow so that the total flow continues even after the event is over when the surface ftable lid was applied it was thought that the corresponding difference would also be observed in the flow duration curve due to the increased interflow and baseflow therefore the flow duration curve analysis was performed fig 12 table 3 an analysis of the flow duration curve was performed based on the excess probability interval proposed by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2007 the usepa divided the duration curve into five zones high flows 0 10 moist conditions 10 40 mid range flows 40 60 dry conditions 60 90 low flows 90 100 when applying the surface ftable lid the average value of duration decreased in the high flow section in other sections the value increased due to the influence of interflow and baseflow however when the lid technique was applied using the lid controls tool the infiltration process in the lid facility was eliminated without affecting the outflow therefore the average value of the duration decreased in all the sections 3 4 water balance analysis a water balance analysis was performed using the simulation results of the hspf model data from the last 30 years 1986 2015 were used for the water balance analysis the analysis results are presented in table 4 below the water balance value was close to 0 when the lid was not applied and when the lid was applied using the surface ftable however when the lid was applied using the lid controls tool the water balance value was significantly different from 0 this result is observed probably because the infiltration process through the lid facility was no longer simulated in the hspf model inconsistent water balance is a phenomenon that cannot occur in reality in the long term analysis so using the hspf lid controls tool is not suitable for long term hydrological analysis conversely in the case of using surface ftable the retention effect of lid appears the same as the behavior of the existing lid model and water balance is maintained this simulates reality well and is shown to be suitable for long term hydrological analysis in relation to the recent issue of the hydrological cycle based on the results of the water balance analysis it can be confirmed that the precipitation was different only when the lid was used using the lid controls tool this is because prsupy the precipitation value on the rch module is limited to the value contributing to the water surface when the water surface is not formed because of the absence of water in the rch precipitation is not recognized 3 5 low impact development scenarios scenario analysis was performed according to the lid application rate this was achieved using the simulation results obtained with surface ftable for the last 30 years and an analysis was performed for each hydrological component according to the lid application rate using the surface ftable results of hydrological components analysis according to scenario according to lid application rate using surface ftable are presented in table 5 as a result of the analysis the interflow outflow baseflow outflow actual evapotranspiration and infiltration values increased as the lid application rate increased as the lid application rate increased the surface outflow and total outflow values decreased most of the water infiltrated through the lid facility flows out through interflow and baseflow however the total outflow decreased as more evaporation were generated through the lid facility 4 conclusions in this study the changes in hydrological elements with the application of lid were simulated using the lid controls tool in the existing hspf model as well as the surface ftable module used in wetland simulation before applying the lid facility to the hspf model the model was calibrated and verified through statistical results and graphical comparisons to ensure that it operated satisfactorily the surface outflow results of the simulation performed with lid using the surface ftable were similar to those obtained with the lid controls tool therefore it is thought that the surface ftable can be used for the lid application analysis as a result of the hydrological element analysis surface outflow can be reduced when using the lid controls tool however the quantity of infiltration through the lid facility did not contribute to other hydrological elements conversely in the simulation of the lid facility through surface ftable the surface outflow reduction is similar to that obtained with the lid controls tool at the same time the quantity of infiltration through the lid facility contributes to other hydrological factors accordingly when using surface ftable lid interflow and baseflow increased further evapotranspiration and infiltration increased due to the lid facility as a result of the flow duration curve analysis when the lid was simulated using the surface ftable the average value decreased only in the high flow section the value increased in the other sections due to the influence of interflow and baseflow the lid controls tool demonstrates a smaller value than that observed when the lid is not applied in all sections this is because the infiltration process in the lid facility disappeared from the simulation similar results were observed in the water balance analysis for surface ftable lid the water balance was maintained and the water balance value was similar to that observed when the lid was not applied for the lid controls tool it was found that the water balance could not be balanced due to the problem of penetration when lid is applied using the lid controls tool it is possible to simulate the delay of peak discharge occurrence time and the reduction of its value due to the lid function still it is not suitable for long term hydrological analysis such as long term water balance is not correct on the other hand in case of using surface ftable it is possible to simulate the delay of peak discharge occurrence time and the decrease in its value by the lid function and since the water balance of analysis processes is correct long term hydrologic analysis can be performed for long term hydrological planning of watersheds lid analysis using surface ftable is necessary as a result of the lid scenario analysis a larger lid effect was observed for a higher lid application rate based on this result it can be suggested that the surface ftable method should be used rather than the lid controls tool when performing the lid application analysis through the hspf model in this study only the hydrological processes were analyzed but additional water quality analyses will be needed in the future according to the application of lid facilities declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
