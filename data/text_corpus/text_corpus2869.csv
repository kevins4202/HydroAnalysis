14345,domestic wastewater excluding toilet streams is called greywater when it is collected only from wash basin and bathroom it is named as light greywater because of embodying a small fraction of contaminants light greywater makes up of more than 50 of the domestic wastewater with a great reusability potential when properly treated henceforth greywater treatment can be a part of preservation of fresh water resources nowadays advanced treatment methods requiring high investment and operating costs are used for greywater treatment however bioremediation of greywater can be an economic alternative as a result of low energy requirement of microalgal remediation systems moreover microalgae can be harvested to refine its oil for further processes in this study treatment of light greywater with chlorella variabilis is investigated wash basin and bathroom light greywater samples were collected and treated separately after the initial chemical and microbiological analyses the suspended solids were removed via centrifugation then microalgae cultivated in raw greywater and 30 diluted with tap water samples after 19 days of cultivation chlorella variabilis was removed from the media by another centrifuge final analyses were done and removal efficiencies of cod bod5 tp and tn were calculated in addition to total coliform escherichia coli enterococcus total bacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa analyses the results show up to 92 3 cod 91 9 bod5 85 6 tn and 97 tp remediation additionally microbiological analysis results show this water can be reused for toilet flushing keywords greywater microalgae wastewater wastewater reuse 1 introduction water is the most important and the indivisible part of life considering its vitality and irreplaceableness for the existence therefore water resources must be used wisely and sustainably however the growing world population and limited fresh water reservoirs are causing water stress the countries under water stress have started to promote conscious use of water resources and recovery of wastewaters in appropriate ways 1 according to melbourne sustainability report dating back to 2009 it was strictly restricted in that australian state to use tap water on garden watering or recreational areas because of the drought conditions 2 on account of the increasing demand for clean water resources the scientists are willing to develop innovative wastewater treatment technologies so that it will be possible to reuse the treated wastewater as potable water in the future on the verge of the water shortage revaluing wastewaters by convenient and sustainable treatment methodologies is gaining importance 3 it can be distinguished from the literature that domestic wastewater can be classified under three i black water ii greywater and iii light greywater 1 4 7 black water is defined as toilet wastewaters and can include or exclude effluents of kitchen sinks and dishwashers 1 7 8 the definition of greywater is given in literature as the residual water from houses excluding toilet streams 4 6 the classification of the wastewaters from kitchen sinks and dishwashers is vague therefore the one which is composed of only hand washing and showering is called light greywater to avoid the ambiguity this specified light greywater is the best candidate to convert to potable water 4 5 9 and hence light greywater was selected for treatment and reuse purposes in this study even though it is light greywater it still embodies significant amount of pollutants that needs remediation these pollutants are monitored via chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod5 total suspended solids tss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp 1 5 5 6 7 greywater constitutes more than 50 of the municipal or domestic wastewater 10 11 and researchers revealed that reuse of greywater after an appropriate treatment can halve the consumption of potable water 12 current treatment technologies are given in literature as such filtration membrane systems coagulation flocculation and ion exchange resins wetlands and rotating sequencing or membrane bioreactors 13 each method has its own pros and cons so that new techniques are studied to overcome existing obstacles bioremediation which means removing contaminants from polluted environment using organisms 14 is highly studied topic for this purpose bioremediation offers a green and low cost process alternative to chemical treatment as concluded by el sheekh and mahmoud bacteria fungi and microalgae are widely investigated in terms of their bioremediation potentiality amongst the three microalgae have high capacity of nutrient removal while capturing carbon dioxide 15 and accumulating algal biomass the algal biomass then can be converted to biofuel feed chemicals and similar value added products 16 20 and this improves the costs of microalgal bioremediation researches on algal remediation start as early as 1960s with individual studies on water carbon dioxide and algae without linking them 21 judd et al 2015 draw attention to the fact that algal remediation of wastewater and simultaneous carbon dioxide capture is receiving more attention due to global warming water stress and depleting fossil fuels in 2000s 21 also biotechnological advances in treating wastewater with microalgae in the 21st century have improved costs and effectivity 22 researches also focus on prevention of nutrient discharge to environment via untreated greywater since nutrient discharge causes eutrophication the increase and shift from the regular nutrient proportions as a result of nitrogen and phosphorus discharge to the environment 23 26 eutrophication can be observed via algal bloom or massive reproduction of algae species at contaminated or polluted waters 27 28 it can generate ammonia accumulation groundwater pollution and greenhouse gas emissions 24 29 30 these are other motives behind greywater treatment cultivating a microalgae culture into nutrient rich light greywater for treatment is the main idea behind this study the sunlight captured carbon dioxide co2 and the nutritious aquatic greywater medium are the only needs of microalgae culture to grow 31 in addition to the greywater treatment cultivating microalgae in residual waters will positively contribute to reduction of greenhouse gases by means of capturing co2 from the air 32 furthermore grown microalgae are contemporary biofuel resource and renewable alternative to agricultural biomass and feedstocks 17 33 35 besides ziemba et al 2018 stated that the biological treatment of greywater with no extra supplements had been competent many simultaneous environmental benefits of employing microalgae for wastewater treatment can be named in the light of all the information given above greywater treatment prevention of eutrophication and algal bloom recovery of nutrients water recycle and reuse economical microalgae culturing medium co2 capture biofuel production and generating renewable biomass the objective of this study is to investigate the bioremediation capability of chlorella variabilis for greywater recovery on the contrary of diversified studies of many other chlorella strains there exist limited studies on the treatment potentiality of chlorella variabilis as stated in the book chlorella by shihira and krauss 1965 this strain shows great variability with respect to its environment this can be advantageous when the changing composition of greywater is considered to monitor the nutrient uptake potential of chlorella variabilis the following parameters were measured prior to any physical or biological activity and at the very end of the experiments cod bod5 tp and tn initial and final concentrations of total coliform escherichia coli enterococcus total bacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa were measured to assess the reusability of the light greywater after treated with chlorella variabilis 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae strain chlorophytes are the family of diverse green algae species that can be found in different locations and survive at a wide range of conditions with a potential of nutrient removal 20 chlorella is the member of this family and because it has high nutrient removal capacity its water treatment potential has been widely studied 20 28 31 37 also it is well known that chlorella strains are resistant to extreme and various circumstances 38 39 as being a resistant type this microalgae family is widely applied to different types of wastewater such as livestock 30 piggery 40 baker s yeast 41 textile 42 and food industry 43 chlorella variabilis was chosen because of its high growth rate endurance and adaptive capability of changing environment 36 41 and it was obtained from kocaeli university biotechnology laboratory of chemical engineering department the microalgae culture was preserved in bg 11 medium 44 similar to other studies that can be found in literature 45 48 the composition of bg 11 medium is as follows nano3 1 5 g l kh2po4 0 04 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 075 g l cacl2 2h2o 0 036 g l h3bo3 0 0029 g l na2co3 0 02 g l ferric citrate 0 006 g l citric acid 0 006 g l vitamin mixture 0 02 g l tap water 1 l agar 15 g 2 2 greywater sampling the light greywater samples contained residues and chemicals from one person activity of bathroom or wash basin they were separately collected from a villa located at basiskele kocaeli three samples of wash basin greywater were picked up one day apart brought to laboratory and homogeneously mixed in a 5 liter plastic container then this mixture was divided into three one of the samples was used for cod bod5 tp and tn analysis to characterise the greywater one another was poured into 500 ml sterile sampling cap to bring to microbiological analysis the remaining one was used for microalgae cultivation exactly same steps were repeated for bathroom samples 2 3 cultivation bathroom samples and wash basin samples were homogenously prepared as described in sampling it should be underlined that they were separately studied after the cultivation samples were prepared as described earlier suspended solids ss were removed via centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 20 min next the samples were divided into two for comparative study of raw greywater vs diluted greywater even though the sole microalgae treatment had been the target i e raw greywater treatment one of the samples was diluted to 30 ratio with tap water to ensure growth of chlorella variabilis then 20 ml of liquid microalgae grown in bg 11 medium were cultivated to undiluted 0 and diluted 30 greywater in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks the cultivation was conducted at 27 c for 19 days microalgae can be grown photo autotrophically heterotrophically or mixotrophically perez garcia and bashan 2015 stated that cultivating microalgae under heterotrophic or mixotrophic conditions is more beneficial than photo autotrophic growth conditions regarding nutrient uptake from light greywater 49 therefore we designed the set up for heterotrophic conditions to obtain high nutrient removal efficiency as shown in fig 1 additionally we haven t used supplementary nutrients study in order not to increase the cost of the system heterotrophic growth conditions were sustained in the laboratory by continuous use of 7 w 2700 k led lamps when the greywater treatment was finalised the samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min to separate algal biomass the liquid samples were analysed in terms of cod bod5 tp tn and bacteriological content the cultivation was carried on in a shaking incubator set at 200 rpm for homogenous distribution and well mixing 2 4 analytical methods the samples were analysed for ph cod bod5 tn and tp amounts at kocaeli university water and wastewater laboratory of environmental engineering department to picture the nutrient removal and bioremediation efficacy mettler toledo seven compact ph meter was used to measure the ph of the samples hach lange kits were used to measure cod lck 114 bod5 lck 555 tp lck 349 and tn lck 338 microalgae were cultivated and studied at kocaeli university biotechnology laboratory of chemical engineering department by using inova 40 shaking incubator the growth of microalgae was observed by optical density measurement at 680 nm using the jenway 6800 uv vis spectrophotometer as stated in literature 40 50 54 then all of the measured data were plotted to obtain a growth curve the microbiological analyses which are namely total coliform escherichia coli enterococcus total bacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa were performed at kocaeli provincial public health laboratory the number of bacteria were determined under the guidance of iso 9308 1 2014 55 and iso 16266 2 2018 56 the method starts with membrane filtration of the samples using 0 45 μm pore size membranes under vacuum which then followed by culturing in chromogenic coliform agar cca agar or cn agar medium and finally selected microorganisms are calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 microalgal growth optical density od measurement of microalgae gives a correlative data for cell growth as explained by widdel 57 here it is crucial to keep the selected equipment and wavelength constant 680 nm for this case throughout the experiment therefore od values were measured constantly at 680 nm throughout the whole experiment for each culture media and obtained od data was plotted against time as given in figs 1 and 2 for wash basin and bathroom samples respectively then od values were converted to the growth rates gr according to the following formula in day 1 53 1 g r l n o d t l n o d i t i m e where gr stands for growth rate od stands for optical density measurement at 680 nm and time in days according to the calculations the maximum growth rate was obtained at 5th day for raw wash basin greywater cultivation medium and it was calculated as 0 064 day 1 similarly the maximum microalgal growth rate among 30 diluted wash basin greywater study group was obtained at 5th day and it was calculated as 0 220 day 1 in addition to this the maximum growth rate of chlorella variabilis was found to be equal to 0 125 day 1 for undiluted bathroom greywater at 5th day and lastly the maximum microalgal growth rate was equal to 0 197 day 1 for 30 diluted bathroom greywater at 5th day microalgae growth in wash basin light greywater was monitored by plotting od measurements against the day of cultivation and given in fig 1 the line graph demonstrates that chlorella variabilis rapidly grew in wash basin greywater without any lag phase which means that this type of microalgae quickly adapted to this specific greywater environment when the raw undiluted greywater line is investigated it is seen that an exponential growth phase occurred in the first 5 days then a stationary phase is observed between 5th and 7th days which is followed by another exponential growth phase between 7th and 12th days finally the microalgae show another stationary phase between 12th and 19th days for undiluted sample medium it is believed chlorella variabilis had undergone adaptive changes during first stationary phase and that explains its following exponential growth the growth phases of microalgae strain in 30 diluted wash basin greywater however differs from raw sample except initial rapid growth between 0 5 days this exponential growth phase in first 5 days is followed by a stationary phase between 5th and 12th days for this sample but after the stationary phase a die off phase or cell lysis is deduced from the graph as a result of sudden decrease in od readings in the light of the information provided by widdel 2010 and richmond 2004 the od readings for bathroom greywater are plotted in fig 2 this line graph clearly demonstrates that no lag phase has occurred after the cultivation chlorella variabilis to both raw undiluted greywater and 30 diluted greywater when the raw bathroom greywater is further analysed a rapid growth is observed in the first 5 days and a continuous growth is observed between 5 14 days between the days 14 and 19 the growth rates show a decrease which can be interpreted as a changeover to stationary phase according to literature knowledge 57 58 similar to raw bathroom greywater sample the 30 diluted bathroom greywater sample shows an exponential growth phase for the first 5 days but it transits to stationary phase between 5th and 7th days then the decline in od records show a decrease in growth rates starting from 7th day and continued till the termination of cultivation the acidity or basicity of the cultivation medium tells about the probability of survival of microalgae therefore the ph of the culture medium was measured at the very beginning and during the daily measurements which are given in table 1 initial measurements were read at or close to 8 and slight increases observed in literature it is pointed out that microalgae favour ph 7 9 range even though it is not an independent variable for the growth conditions 54 59 3 2 nutrient removal greywater characterisation is important to monitor nutrient removal and to calculate the efficiency therefore raw wash basin and raw bathroom greywater were analysed in terms of cod bod5 tp and tn contents prior to removal of suspended solids the greywater characterisation is given in table 2 as raw greywater contents the greywater characterisation analyses were repeated after the termination of cultivation and microalgae harvest via centrifuge the analysis results and calculated efficiencies are given in table 3 in terms of cod bod5 tp and tn the amount of tp of 30 diluted bathroom greywater was below the minimum measurable limit of the test kit which equals to 0 05 mg l and hence could not be recorded therefore the minimum measurable limit of the test kit was used for further removal efficiency computations which are calculated by using the following formula 2 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c 1 c 0 x 100 where c0 stands for the initial concentration and c1 stands for the final concentration of the measured variable it is given in literature that optimum n p ratio should range between 6 8 10 for microalgae growth 51 53 60 the initial n p ratio of our studied samples that can be seen from table 2 are 6 35 for both wash basin and bathroom greywater which are quite close to the optimum interval the final n p ratios show a consistency for undiluted and diluted wash basin greywater 4 87 and 4 5 respectively yet the bathroom greywater treatment results diverge from those data with n p ratio equals to 21 67 and even greater than 42 6 altin et al 2018 stated that growth of chlorella variabilis slows down when n p ratio is higher than optimum numbers 61 n rich medium i e higher n p ratios is a p limited medium at exponential growth phase which in turn results in low growth rates according to richmond 2004 and it is also stated that slow yet still growth was observed for chlorella family of microalgae even if the n p ratio was as high as 45 1 this literature information explains the low growth rates observed at bathroom greywater to conclude even though there is a favoured n p ratio interval for chlorella variabilis growth not only solely is n p ratio effective on growth but nominal values or existing amount of nutrients play significant role on growth rates 53 this study reveals the fact that chlorella variabilis has successfully remediated nutrients from light greywater in literature there exist limited studies on the microalgal remediation of greywater and neither of them employs chlorella variabilis the outcomes of this study in terms of cod bod5 tn and tp removal efficiencies are given in table 4 with literature data it can be seen that the outcomes show similarity with literature findings 3 3 microbiological evaluation the reuse of the greywater is dependent to the results of microbiological analyses therefore total coliform escherichia coli enterococcus total bacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa were measured both before and after the treatment after the microalgae harvest with centrifugation the remaining treated greywater was used for both nutrient removal analyses and microbiological evaluation since the treated greywater sample volume was not enough to conduct each analysis separately treated raw and 30 diluted wash basin greywater were combined and analysed as one sample also same was applied to raw and 30 diluted bathroom greywater samples both analyses results are given in table 5 in comparison with initial microbiological contents the purpose of this study is to reveal the potential of light greywater reuse therefore standards and limits were used to compare the obtained results in turkish legislation the limits for irrigation water is given in atıksu arıtma tesisleri teknik usuller tebliği aattut the technical procedure communication of wastewater treatment facilities 63 also limits for drinking domestic and fresh water are given in i̇nsani tüketim amaçlı sular yönetmeliği i̇tasy regulation concerning water intended for human consumption 64 however there exists no specification about utilisation of greywaters for toilet reservoir water garden watering and such thus the findings were compared with the standards given in the work of li et al 2009 when the results of this study are compared with given standards in table 5 it is seen that this treated light greywater is suitable for reuse in toilet reservoirs moreover this water can be furtherly used irrigation car washing laundry and such if it undergoes uv disinfection 4 conclusion this study demonstrates chlorella variabilis can grow in wash basin and bathroom light greywater therefore this microalgae strand has a potential to be used for treatment of light greywater one another beneficial outcome is this technique will contribute to conservation of fresh water resources by separately collecting light greywater from domestic wastewater then microalgal treatment of light greywater will yield in the decrease in the volume of wastewater to be treated in plants which will decline the energy consumption of them lastly the rapid growth characteristics of chlorella variabilis can make it a great alternative for biomass and biofuel production future studies should focus on to biomass characterization of this microalgae and economical harvesting methods to avail the industrial uses acknowledgements the authors would like to thank to bulgamaa orkhonchimeg for providing greywater samples and laboratory assistance to res asst togayhan kutluk for his support at laboratory work to kocaeli university biotechnology laboratory of chemical engineering department and to mr yunus tuncer from kocaeli provincial public health biologist who helped with the bacteriological analyses

they were separately collected from a villa located at basiskele kocaeli three samples of wash basin greywater were picked up one day apart brought to laboratory and homogeneously mixed in a 5 liter plastic container then this mixture was divided into three one of the samples was used for cod bod5 tp and tn analysis to characterise the greywater one another was poured into 500 ml sterile sampling

maximum microalgal growth rate among 30 diluted wash basin greywater study group was obtained at 5th day and it was calculated as 0 220 day 1 in addition to this the maximum growth rate of chlorella variabilis was found to be equal to 0 125 day 1 for undiluted bathroom greywater at 5th day and lastly the maximum microalgal growth rate was equal to 0 197 day 1 for 30 diluted bathroom greywater at

sample except initial rapid growth between 0 5 days this exponential growth phase in first 5 days is followed by a stationary phase between 5th and 12th days for this sample but after the stationary phase a die off phase or cell lysis is deduced from the graph as a result of sudden decrease in od readings in the light of the information provided by widdel 2010 and richmond 2004 the od readings for bathroom greywater are plotted in fig 2 this line graph clearly demonstrates that no lag phase has occurred after the cultivation chlorella variabilis to both raw undiluted greywater and 30 diluted greywater when the raw bathroom greywater is further analysed a rapid growth is observed in the first 5 days and a continuous growth is observed between 5 14 days between the days 14 and 19 the growth rates show a decrease which can be interpreted as a changeover to stationary phase according to literature knowledge 57 58 similar to raw bathroom greywater sample the 30 diluted bathroom greywater sample shows an exponential growth phase for the first 5 days but it transits to stationary phase between 5th and 7th days then the decline in od records show a decrease in growth rates starting from 7th day and continued till the termination of cultivation the acidity or basicity of the cultivation medium tells about the probability of survival of microalgae therefore the ph of the culture medium was measured at the very beginning and during the daily measurements which are given in table 1 initial measurements were read at or close to 8 and slight increases observed in literature it is pointed out that microalgae favour ph 7 9 range even though it is not an independent variable for the growth conditions 54 59 3 2 nutrient removal greywater characterisation is important to monitor nutrient removal and to calculate the efficiency therefore raw wash basin and raw bathroom greywater were analysed in terms of cod bod5 tp and tn contents prior to removal of suspended solids the greywater characterisation is given in table 2 as raw greywater contents the greywater characterisation analyses were repeated after the termination of cultivation and microalgae harvest via centrifuge the analysis results and calculated efficiencies are given in table 3 in terms of cod bod5 tp and tn the amount of tp of 30 diluted bathroom greywater was below the minimum measurable limit of the test kit which equals to 0 05 mg l and hence could not be recorded therefore the minimum measurable limit of the test kit was used for further removal efficiency computations which are calculated by using the following formula 2 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y c 0 c 1 c 0 x 100 where c0 stands for the initial concentration and c1 stands for the final concentration of the measured variable it is given in literature that optimum n p ratio should range between 6 8 10 for microalgae growth 51 53 60 the initial n p ratio of our studied samples that can be seen from table 2 are 6 35 for both wash basin and bathroom greywater which are quite close to the optimum interval the final n p ratios show a consistency for undiluted and diluted wash basin greywater 4 87 and 4 5 respectively yet the bathroom greywater treatment results diverge from those data with n p ratio equals to 21 67 and even greater than 42 6 altin et al 2018 stated that growth of chlorella variabilis slows down when n p ratio is higher than optimum numbers 61 n rich medium i e higher n p ratios is a p limited medium at exponential growth phase which in turn results in low growth rates according to richmond 2004 and it is also stated that slow yet still growth was observed for chlorella family of microalgae even if the n p ratio was as high as 45 1 this literature information explains the low growth rates observed at bathroom greywater to conclude even though there is a favoured n p ratio interval for chlorella variabilis growth not only solely is n p ratio effective on growth but nominal values or existing amount of nutrients play significant role on growth rates 53 this study reveals the fact that chlorella variabilis has successfully remediated nutrients from light greywater in literature there exist limited studies on the microalgal remediation of greywater and neither of them employs chlorella variabilis the outcomes of this study in terms of cod bod5 tn and tp removal efficiencies are given in table 4 with literature data it can be seen that the outcomes show similarity with literature findings 3 3 microbiological evaluation the reuse of the greywater is dependent to the results of microbiological analyses therefore total coliform escherichia coli enterococcus total bacteria and pseudomonas aeruginosa were measured both before and after the treatment after the microalgae harvest with centrifugation the remaining treated greywater was used for both nutrient removal analyses and microbiological evaluation since the treated greywater sample volume was not enough to conduct each analysis separately treated raw and 30 diluted wash basin greywater were combined and analysed as one sample also same was applied to raw and 30 diluted bathroom greywater samples both analyses results are given in table 5 in comparison with initial microbiological contents the purpose of this study is to reveal the potential of light greywater reuse therefore standards and limits were used to compare the obtained results in turkish legislation the limits for irrigation water is given in atıksu arıtma tesisleri teknik usuller tebliği aattut the technical procedure communication of wastewater treatment facilities 63 also limits for drinking domestic and fresh water are given in i̇nsani tüketim amaçlı sular yönetmeliği i̇tasy regulation concerning water intended for human consumption 64 however there exists no specification about utilisation of greywaters for toilet reservoir water garden watering and such thus the findings were compared with the standards given in the work of li et al 2009 when the results of this study are compared with given standards in table 5 it is seen that this treated light greywater is suitable for reuse in toilet reservoirs moreover this water can be furtherly used irrigation car washing laundry and such if it undergoes uv disinfection 4 conclusion this study demonstrates chlorella variabilis can grow in wash basin and bathroom light greywater therefore this microalgae strand has a potential to be used for treatment of light greywater one another beneficial outcome is this technique will contribute to conservation of fresh water resources by separately collecting light greywater from domestic wastewater then microalgal treatment of light greywater will yield in the decrease in the volume of wastewater to be treated in plants which will decline the energy consumption of them lastly the rapid growth characteristics of chlorella variabilis can make it a great alternative for biomass and biofuel production future studies should focus on to biomass characterization of this microalgae and economical harvesting methods to avail the industrial uses acknowledgements the authors would like to thank to

14346,in this study the effect of wastewater artificial recharge on the nitrate pollution was experimentally investigated for this purpose gavkhaneh district located in arak city iran was selected as the case study in order to simulate the water movement until the groundwater level the soil layers were simulated in pvc cylindrical columns to simulate three soil layers with thicknesses of 20 m 20 m and 10 m three columns with the heights of 2 m 2 m and 1 m were respectively considered in addition in order to evaluate the effect of natural zeolite filter the first soil column in two types with and without zeolite was considered to simulate the wastewater movement two management strategies were adopted one strategy is the permanent submersion in water for twenty days and the other one is dryness submersion for forty days submersion in water for 24 h and in dryness 24 h the results indicated that the reduction of nitrate content is more efficiently obtained up to 54 5 in the second layer having a heavier soil furthermore the use of zeolite had no effect on the reduction in the nitrate concentration finally the results showed that the dryness submersion strategy was a more effective method to reduce nitrate content than the permanent submersion in the water therefore the absorption in the permanent submersion increases up to 57 84 and 122 respectively in the first second and third layers as compared with the permanent submersion strategy and in the final absorption stage keywords wastewater artificial recharge nitrate aquifer 1 introduction wastewater is a dilute solution containing organic matters either in suspended or soluble forms wastewater also contains inorganic matters and microorganisms the amount of mineral salt in the wastewater is considerably less than that found in other aquatic systems such as lakes seas and oceans therefore using the wastewater as an uncommon water can be investigated rice and bouwer 1 found that the transmission of treated wastewater from unsaturated region of the soil caused a reduction up to 40 to 80 percent of nitrogen and phosphate 2 3 studied the removal of doc ammonia and nitrates from secondary effluents using poorly graded sands they found maximum removals of 60 76 and 7 respectively for doc ammonia and nitrates voudouris 4 showed artificial recharge using tertiary treated wastewater via boreholes as one of the alternatives available for increasing the groundwater reserves of aquifer el arabi and dawuod 5 concluded when using the pretreated wastewater the removal efficiency of pollutants from the soil decreases over the time due to the changes in its chemical balance and physical properties of the soil abel et al 6 observed high removal of bulk organic matter nutrients and microorganisms at higher temperatures using the primary effluent in a simulated soil aquifer treatment 7 expressed the sorption capacity increases from 0 056 to 0 22 mg n g 1with the increase of ph from 2 to 7 the sorption capacity was also found to increase with the increase in the concentration and temperature golie and upadhyayula 8 studied the removal of nitrate from water using chitosan alumina composite the results revealed that the nitrate removal efficiency decreased with the increase in influent nitrate concentration and flow rate the result also showed that chitosan alumina composite can be used in fixed bed column for the removal of nitrate from the water he et al 9 investigated simultaneous removal of phosphate and ammonium using salt thermal activated and lanthanum doped zeolite their results indicated that the adsorption capacity increased with the increase in the inflow concentration and the decrease of the effluent rate for both phosphate and ammonium you et al 10 evaluated a zeolitie material synthesized from coal fly ash ze na in sodium form as well as its modification to potassium form ze k as sorbent materials for the recovery of ammonium from wastewater effluents the results indicated that the sorption capacity decreased significantly after every working cycle using ze na however ze k followed an opposite behavior despite its initial lower sorption capacity tamer et al 11 investigated the risk of nitrate transport from the unlined landfill to subsurface layers and groundwater using experimental results and the sesoil model the model predicted that the level of nitrate will be increased up from 75 mg l to 325 mg l within 30 years mahmoudi et al 12 investigated an arid region soil capacity on natural attenuation of municipal treated wastewater they concluded that the soil could attenuate nitrate and phosphate with the percentage of 18 4 and 83 6 but there is a potential risk of groundwater contamination in long term recharge the above studies indicate that the soil layers are somewhat capable of removing wastewater contaminants considering the groundwater level drop in arak aquifer and shortage of water for artificial recharge the use of wastewater is one of the appropriate solutions the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the use of wastewater on artificial recharge of arak aquifer and its effect on the increase of nitrate pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 the case study area the gavkhaneh village is located in a distance of 5 km from arak city fig 1 at geographical coordinates 34 0954 n and 49 7013 e based on piezometric measurements in may 2017 the groundwater depth in the study area was about 50 m the soil from ground level to groundwater level contains three layers with the thicknesses of 20 20 and 10 m respectively in addition the soil texture are sandy clay clay loam and sandy clay respectively the medium diameters of soil layers for the first to third layers are equal to 0 25 0 01and 0 2 mm 2 2 experimental method in order to perform the experiment about 4600 liters of wastewater from the outlet of the urban treatment plant were transmitted to the location of the experiment the amount of nitrate in the wastewater varied in the range of 15 to 40 mg lit to conduct this investigation pvc cylindrical columns were used for simulating the movement of water in the soil layers considering the fact that the depths of soil layers were 20 20 and 10 m the size of three layers in the laboratory were considered to be 2 2 and 1 m respectively also in order to investigate the effect of zeolite on the removal of the nitrate parameter about 20 cm of zeolite was placed at the top of the first column fig 2 other characteristics of the soil and wastewater used in the laboratory are similar to the field characteristics and only the thicknesses of the soil layers have changed so the wastewater is brought from the treatment plant and the soil is simulated with the same gradation to fill the columns no compacting treatment was done on the soils and the soil layers were only washed with drinking water to prevent a preferential flow and moving water between soil and column wall the soil was stuck in the column walls for this aim some soil was mixed with a kind of glue and it was glued to the inner wall of the columns the experiments were conducted in two ways 1 permanent submersion in the water for 20 days and 2 dryness submersion for 40 days for the permanent submersion there were always 20 cm of water above the soil layers for the dryness submersion the soil layers were in submersion condition for 24 h and in dryness condition for another 24 h the sampling was done twice a day in the first week after the first week the samples were collected only once a day the method of measuring the nitrate concentration was spectrophotometry spectrophotometer measured the intensity of the attracted light by the solution in order to verify the accuracy of the experiments the titration method was also used in the titration method a sample container was filled after a few minutes the created color was compared with the available kit and the nitrate concentration in mg per lit was displayed 2 3 the numbers of treatments and statistical designs these experiments included four treatments in pvc columns and were repeated two times the treatments were as follows fig 2 treatment 1 the first soil layer sandy clay texture with 2 m thickness treatment 2 the first soil layer sandy clay texture with 2 m thickness and with 20 cm zeolite on top of it treatment 3 the second soil layer clay loam texture with 2 m thickness treatment 4 the third soil layer sandy clay texture with 1 m thickness the design was completely randomized in which two factors of dryness submersion and complete submersion in water were considered to analyze the obtained data three statistical tests were used which are defined as follows 1 the percentage of the pollutant removal for determining the efficiency of pollutant omission the following equation was used 1 e ci cf ci 100 where e is the percentage of parameter omission ci is the inflow wastewater concentration and cf is the outflow wastewater concentration 2 t test was done using spss software for determining the superior strategy permanent submersion or dryness submersion in order to remove wastewater pollutants 3 the correlation test was done using spss software in order to determine the significance or insignificance of the results of transmitting the wastewater from the soil columns 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations of nitrate concentration in permanent submersion strategy the first layer of the soil sandy clay in the study area had a thickness of 20 m and a density of about 1 35 g cm3 the layer thickness in the model was considered to be 2 m which is one tenth the layer thickness in the study area fig 3 shows the variations of nitrate concentration of wastewater after transmission from this layer in submersion strategy water transmission from the first soil layer within 20 days took place consciously and sampling was done in the first week twice a day and then once a day the results of the measurement of the nitrate in five steps are shown in fig 3 each step represents the average nitrate value within 4 days so the measurements have been taken at 5 steps within 20 days the reduction of nitrate concentration in five steps is 35 51 22 77 22 66 10 71 and 6 81 respectively it was found that the nitrate concentration decreased over time at final steps the rate of reduction is less for determining the effect of zeolite on the reduction of nitrate content in the wastewater 20 cm of zeolite was put on the first column fig 4 shows the rate of nitrate reduction in this column in a period of 20 days according to fig 4 zeolite does not have any effect on the improvement of nitrate removal in the first step the reduction in the nitrate content in the first layer of the soil with zeolite was 6 94 the reduction of nitrate concentration in other steps is 5 89 4 75 2 42 and 0 51 respectively as shown in fig 4 the zeolite does not improve the nitrate removal operation and in some cases it may slightly increase due to the presence of impurities in the used zeolite the second layer of the soil had a thickness of 20 m and the soil type was clay loam the layer thickness in physical model was 2 m with a density of about 1 47 g cm3 fig 5 shows the variations of nitrate concentration in the wastewater after transmission from this layer according to this figure the amount of nitrate reduction in the second layer of the soil is 54 32 39 52 35 74 15 92 and 14 55 percent respectively as shown in fig 5 the amount of reduction in nitrate concentration in the final steps has decreased however it seems this layer has operated better than the first layer the third layer of the soil was obtained from the region with a thickness of 10 m and the soil type was sandy clay the layer thickness in physical model was 1 m and has a density of about 1 36 g cm3 the thickness of the third layer was half of the other two layers the reason for this selection was the accurate simulation of the study area fig 6 shows the variation of nitrate in the wastewater after transmitting from this layer in the first step the reduction in nitrate concentration was 48 54 percent which has reduced in next steps the reduction of nitrate concentration in other steps is 13 95 13 32 11 39 and 9 81 respectively the final reduction in the nitrate concentration in this layer has been better than the first layer however with respect to the second layer it showed a lower percentage of reduction fig 7 shows the comparison of the nitrate removal in four experimental treatments in this study the first column of the soil without zeolite the first column of the soil with zeolite the second column of the soil and the third column of the soil in the permanent submersion strategy as shown in the fig 7 the percentage of nitrate removal in the second column of the soil is the largest and it has the best strategy then the third column of the soil has had the best result for nitrate removal the first column of the soil without zeolite is ranked the third in the nitrate omission in addition the first column of the soil with zeolite had much lower removal of nitrate concentration the nitrate removal decreased until in the final steps it reached to an approximately constant amount it seems that lower amount of nitrate omission in the first column with zeolite is due to the existence of impurity in the zeolite 3 2 variations of nitrate concentration in dryness submersion strategy in order to investigate the nitrate removal dryness submersion strategy was implemented as 24 h of dryness and 24 h of submersion fig 8 shows the variations of available nitrate affected by transmission from the first layer the transmission of the water from the first layer of the soil was executed within 40 days as 24 h of dryness and 24 h of submersion the results of the measurement of the nitrate in five steps are shown in fig 8 each step represents the average nitrate value within 8 days so the measurements have been taken at 5 steps within 40 days in the first stage the amount of nitrate reduction in the wastewater resulting from the transmission from the first layer of soil was 29 28 percent the reduction of nitrate concentration in other steps is 13 84 12 84 16 11 and 10 68 respectively the percentage of nitrate removal in this layer and in this strategy was better than that of the submersion strategy in order to investigate the effect of zeolite on the reduction of nitrate in the wastewater similar to the permanent submersion strategy a thickness of 20 cm zeolite was put on the surface of the first layer fig 9 shows the variations of nitrate in this experimental design in the first stage the nitrate reduction of wastewater was 3 67 percent the reduction of nitrate concentration in other steps is 15 14 22 77 17 37 and 17 42 respectively therefore the existence of unmodified zeolite had no significant effect on nitrate removal in some steps probably due to the existence of impurity in the used zeolite the amount of the measured nitrate was a little more fig 10 shows the variations of nitrate in the wastewater affected by transmission from the second layer in the first step the reduction in the wastewater nitrate affected by the transmission from the second layer of the soil was 54 52 percent which decreased in the next steps the reduction of nitrate concentration in other steps is 50 24 40 6 34 87 and 26 76 respectively the comparison of the nitrate reduction in this layer in comparison with the first layer showed that the second layer had greater ability to remove nitrate in addition the comparison of the second layer in dryness submersion strategy with the submersion strategy indicated that the performance in dryness submersion strategy is improved fig 11 shows the variations of nitrate in the third layer in the first step it was 42 77 percent the reduction of nitrate concentration in other steps is 37 99 22 77 22 7 and 21 85 respectively nitrate reduction in this strategy for the third layer was better than that for the first layer the nitrate variations in this layer was less than the second layer however the percentages of final variations between this layer and the second layer were close to each other fig 12 compares the percentages of nitrate removal in four experimental designs investigated in dryness submersion strategy according to this figure the percentage of nitrate reduction in this strategy in the second column of the soil was the greatest and was selected as the best condition afterwards the third column of the soil had the best condition for nitrate adsorption the first column of the soil was in the third rank with respect to nitrate adsorption the treatment for the first column of the soil with zeolite at the beginning of wastewater transmission also had very little amount of nitrate absorption however the nitrate absorption in next stages increased gradually in final steps it reached an approximately stable amount by comparing figs 12 and 7 it can be seen that dryness submersion strategy was a more effective method in reduction of nitrate than the permanent submersion in water therefore the absorption increases up to 57 84 and 122 respectively in the first second and third layers as compared with the permanent submersion strategy and in the final absorption stage 3 3 comparison of studied strategies in order to compare the effect of dryness submersion with the permanent submersion the t test was performed using spss software to do the test two assumptions of h0 dryness submersion strategy and h1 permanent submersion strategy were made if p value is larger than α 0 05 the h0 assumption is accepted and otherwise it will be rejected four variables were considered 1 the first layer without zeolite 2 the first layer with zeolite 3 the second layer and 4 the third layer the p value obtained from the test for these variables was 0 53 0 83 0 46 and 0 62 respectively which are greater than α 0 05 and h0 is accepted therefore the dryness submersion strategy is more effective than the submersion strategy the results also indicated that in all strategies dryness submersion method was more effective additionally in order to determine the significance of the results obtained from all of the experimental designs the correlation test was done using spss software the results showed that in experimental designs including zeolite especially for measuring the nitrate parameter there was a slight correlation between the data it is not significant from a statistical point of view this problem may result due to the existence of impurities in the used zeolite however in other columns the results showed a correlation coefficient more than 0 8 which was an acceptable coefficient in addition the co variance decomposition for variations of nitrate concentration in simulated columns in sampling stages are shown in table 1 the obtained results showed that there is a significant difference between various experimental designs regarding the reduction of nitrate level which had a probability level of about 0 01 4 conclusion the present study was conducted to investigate the effects of the application of refined domestic wastewater obtained from treatment plants in arak city to be used as an artificial recharge for this purpose soil layers of the region up to the groundwater surface were simulated in the laboratory wastewater was collected from the exiting treatment plant and was transmitted to the laboratory in this study the elimination of nitrate parameters was carried out by the transmission of soil layers up to the groundwater level in two strategies of dry submersion and permanent submersion the obtained results showed that the nitrate removal is effective among three experimental layers the second layer having clay loam soil texture showed a better result for nitrate removal the second layer had a heavier texture as compared with other two layers in addition the application of the zeolite layer which was not improved on the first layer had no significant effect on the reduction of nitrate the result also showed that the dryness submersion strategy was a more effective method to reduce the nitrate than the permanent submersion in water by passing wastewater in a longer distance of unsaturated layers of the soil a much higher efficiency to reduce will be achieved finally if a strategy is effective in less thickness in the lab it will surely be more effective at greater thickness in the field

clay loam the layer thickness in physical model was 2 m with a density of about 1 47 g cm3 fig 5 shows the variations of nitrate concentration in the wastewater after transmission from this layer according to this figure the amount of nitrate reduction in the second layer of the soil is 54 32 39 52 35 74 15 92 and 14 55 percent respectively as shown in fig 5 the amount of reduction in nitrate concentration in the final steps has decreased however it seems this layer has operated better than the first layer the third layer of the soil was obtained from the region with a thickness of 10 m and the soil type was sandy clay the layer thickness in physical model was 1 m and has a density of about 1 36 g cm3 the thickness of the third layer was half of the other two layers the reason for this selection was the accurate simulation of the study area fig 6 shows the variation of nitrate in the wastewater after transmitting from this layer in the first step the reduction in nitrate concentration was 48 54 percent which has reduced in next steps the reduction of nitrate concentration in other steps is 13 95 13 32 11 39 and 9 81 respectively the final reduction in the nitrate concentration in this layer has been better than the first layer however with respect to the second layer it showed a lower percentage of reduction fig 7 shows the comparison of the nitrate removal in four experimental treatments in this study the first column of the soil without zeolite the first column of the soil with zeolite the second column of the soil and the third column of the soil in the permanent submersion strategy as shown in the fig 7 the percentage of nitrate removal in the second column of the soil is the largest and it has the best strategy then the third column of the soil has had the best result for nitrate removal the first column of the soil without zeolite is ranked the third in the nitrate omission in addition the first column of the soil with zeolite had much lower removal of nitrate concentration the nitrate removal decreased until in the final steps it reached to an approximately constant amount it seems that lower amount of nitrate omission in the first column with zeolite is due to the existence of impurity in the zeolite 3 2 variations of nitrate concentration in dryness submersion strategy in order to investigate the nitrate removal dryness submersion strategy was implemented as 24 h of dryness and 24 h of submersion fig 8 shows the variations of available nitrate affected by transmission from the first layer the transmission of the water from the first layer of the soil was executed within 40 days as 24 h of dryness and 24 h of submersion the results of the measurement of the nitrate in five steps are shown in fig 8 each step represents the average nitrate value within 8 days so the measurements have been taken at 5 steps within 40 days in the first stage the amount of nitrate reduction in the wastewater resulting from the transmission from the first layer of soil was 29 28 percent the reduction of nitrate concentration in other steps is 13 84 12 84 16 11 and 10 68 respectively the percentage of nitrate removal in this layer and in this strategy was better than that of the submersion strategy in order to investigate the effect of zeolite on the reduction of nitrate in the wastewater similar to the permanent submersion strategy a thickness of 20 cm zeolite was put on the surface of the first layer fig 9 shows the variations of nitrate in this experimental design in the first stage the nitrate reduction of wastewater was 3 67 percent the reduction of nitrate concentration in other steps is 15 14 22 77 17 37 and 17 42 respectively therefore the existence of unmodified zeolite had no significant effect on nitrate removal in some steps probably due to the existence of impurity in the used zeolite the amount of the measured nitrate was a little more fig 10 shows the variations of nitrate in the wastewater affected by transmission from the second layer in the first step the reduction in the wastewater nitrate affected by the transmission from the second layer of the soil was 54 52 percent which decreased in the next steps the reduction of nitrate concentration in other steps is 50 24 40 6 34 87 and 26 76 respectively the comparison of the nitrate reduction in this layer in comparison with the first layer showed that the second layer had greater ability to remove nitrate in addition the comparison of the second layer in dryness submersion strategy with the submersion strategy indicated that the performance in dryness submersion strategy is improved fig 11 shows the variations of nitrate in the third layer in the first step it was 42 77 percent the reduction of nitrate concentration in other steps is 37 99 22 77 22 7 and 21 85 respectively nitrate reduction in this strategy for the third layer was better than that for the first layer the nitrate variations in this layer was less than the second layer however the percentages of final variations between this layer and the second layer were close to each other fig 12 compares the percentages of nitrate removal in four experimental designs investigated in dryness submersion strategy according to this figure the percentage of nitrate reduction in this strategy in the second column of the soil was the greatest and was selected as the best condition afterwards the third column of the soil had the best condition for nitrate adsorption the first column of the soil was in the third rank with respect to nitrate adsorption the treatment for the first column of the soil with zeolite at the beginning of wastewater transmission also had very little amount of nitrate absorption however the nitrate absorption in next stages increased gradually in final steps it reached an approximately stable amount by comparing figs 12 and 7 it can be seen that dryness submersion strategy was a more effective method in reduction of nitrate than the permanent submersion in water therefore the absorption increases up to 57 84 and 122 respectively in the first second and third layers as compared with the permanent submersion strategy and in the final absorption stage 3 3 comparison of studied strategies in order to compare the effect of dryness submersion with the permanent submersion the t test was performed using spss software to do the test two assumptions of h0 dryness submersion strategy and h1 permanent submersion strategy were made if p value is larger than α 0 05 the h0 assumption is accepted and otherwise it will be rejected four variables were considered 1 the first layer without zeolite 2 the first layer with zeolite 3 the second layer and 4 the third layer the p value obtained from the test for these variables was 0 53 0 83 0 46 and 0 62 respectively which are greater than α 0 05 and h0 is accepted therefore the dryness submersion strategy is more effective than the submersion strategy the results also indicated that in all strategies dryness submersion method was more effective additionally in order to determine the significance of the results obtained from all of the experimental designs the correlation test was done using spss software the results showed that in experimental designs including zeolite especially for measuring the nitrate parameter there was a slight correlation between the data it is not significant from a statistical point of view this problem may result due to the existence of impurities in the used zeolite however in other columns the results showed a correlation coefficient more than 0 8 which was an acceptable coefficient in addition the co variance decomposition for variations of nitrate concentration in simulated columns in sampling stages are shown in table 1 the obtained results showed that there is a significant difference between various experimental designs regarding the reduction of nitrate level which had a probability level of about 0 01 4 conclusion the present study was conducted to investigate the effects of the application of refined domestic wastewater obtained from treatment plants in arak city to be used as an artificial recharge for this purpose soil layers of the region up to the groundwater surface were simulated in the laboratory wastewater was collected from the exiting treatment plant and was transmitted to the laboratory in this study the elimination of nitrate parameters was carried out by the transmission of soil layers up to the groundwater level in two strategies of dry submersion and permanent submersion the obtained results showed that the nitrate removal is effective among three experimental layers the second layer having clay loam soil texture showed a better result for nitrate removal the second layer had a heavier texture as compared with other two layers in addition the application of the zeolite layer which was not improved on the first layer had no significant effect on the reduction of nitrate the result also showed that the dryness submersion strategy was a more effective method to reduce the nitrate than the permanent submersion in water by passing wastewater in a longer distance of unsaturated layers of the soil a much higher efficiency to reduce will be achieved finally if a strategy is effective in less thickness in the lab it will surely be more effective at greater thickness in the field 
14347,in the present work experimental study for leachate nanofiltration concentrate treatment by electrocoagulation and electro fenton processes using iron electrodes was carried out in a batch electrolytic reactor removal efficiencies of 60 2 for total organic carbon toc 69 4 for chemical oxygen demand cod and 87 6 for color from the electro fenton process at the optimum operating conditions and 45 for toc 57 4 for cod and 77 1 for color from the electrocoagulation process at the optimum operating conditions respectively were obtained additionally the fraction of biodegradable cod increased from 6 37 to 17 04 and 30 08 after electrocoagulation and electro fenton processes respectively about 39 soluble cod and 82 particulate cod removal efficiencies were obtained by electrocoagulation whereas 57 soluble cod and 81 particulate cod removal efficiencies were obtained by electro fenton process electro fenton process was found to be more effective than the electrocoagulation process with respect to the removal efficiencies of cod and toc however both processes could be efficient methods for converting nonsoluble cod to soluble cod and removal of nonbiodegradable cod as a result both of the processes could be used as a post treatment method for leachate and an effective method inert cod removal from leachate nanofiltration concentrate keywords leachate nanofiltration concentrate electrocoagulation electro fenton cod fractions 1 introduction pressure driven membrane processes microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration reverse osmosis separate a feed stream into a purified permeate fraction and a concentrated retentate fraction 1 2 ultrafiltration uf membranes remove macromolecules with a molecular weight above 5000 100 000 whereas nanofiltration nf membranes remove organic compounds with a molecular weight above 200 500 depending on the pore size 3 4 the volume and composition of the waste stream from pressure driven membrane processes depends on the operation mode of the process 5 nf and ro are usually operated in cross flow mode the concentrate and the rinsing water used for intermediate forward flushing are the main waste streams the characteristics of the concentrate depend on the feedwater characteristics the pretreatment the membrane process used the recovery and the additional chemicals used 6 the concentrate to feed volume ratio is 1 10 for mf and uf 15 30 for nf and 15 60 for ro the concentrate composition is largely determined by the pore size of the membrane mf or uf membrane concentrates contain suspended solids and colloidal particles whereas nf or ro concentrates contain high concentrations of ions and small organic compounds because of the increased concentrations of salts and small organic compounds treatment of nf or ro concentrates are more difficult than mf or uf concentrates 6 the percolation of rainfall in combination with the decomposition of landfilled solid waste generates highly contaminated liquid called leachate 7 leachate contains complex pollutants including dissolved organic matter inorganic ions heavy metals inorganic salts etc and requires an efficient treatment to minimize the high level of pollutants prior to final discharge 7 9 conventional biological treatment methods is an economical way to remove the biodegradable organic compounds in the leachate and nitrification denitrification processes are used for ammonia removal after anaerobic treatment however refractory organic compounds such as humic acid ha fulvic acid fa and hydrophilic fractions can not be effectively removed by conventional biological treatment 10 12 membrane separation processes such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are increasingly being used as a polishing step following biological treatment to remove these refractory pollutants 13 14 nevertheless membrane separation processes do not really destruct the pollutants but merely concentrate them into smaller volumes of wastewater called membrane concentrates chaplin et al 15 have found that electrochemical oxidation using bdd electrodes has an advantage over other advanced oxidation processes as organics were readily oxidized in the presence of high hco3 concentrations as a result the membrane concentrates contain high levels of refractory organic pollutants and inorganic salts the main treatment methods of concentrated leachate can be classified into four categories 1 recirculation to landfills 16 2 solidification stabilization 17 3 evaporation distillation 18 4 advanced oxidation processes 19 the recirculation of concentrated leachate to landfills may inhibit the microbial activity 20 whereas evaporation distillation method require high land utilization high operating costs 14 moreover the corrosion and fouling are the two main problems in evaporation distillation method due to the high concentration of salts and inorganic matters 21 solidification and stabilization of the leachate nf concentrate seems to be an acceptable solution except for the disposal of derived solidified products 17 among the four categories aops is an attractive method to remove recalcitrant organic compounds and to increase the biodegradability of concentrated leachate by aops bio refractory organic matters could be destroyed via the oxidation by generation of radicals such as non selective hydroxyl radicals 22 fenton electrochemical oxidation uv photocatalyst and ozone based processses have been investigated intensively 11 18 23 high sludge generation rate in fenton process low energy efficiency of uv photocatalyst high cost of ozonation processes are the big barriers for the application electrochemical oxidation has been considered as an attractive technology to treat membrane concentrates containing mainly non biodegradable organics and having high salinity and electric conductivity 12 14 electro fenton process can be defined as the combination of fenton and electro coagulation processes to increase the degradability of organic compounds present in high strength wastewaters a substantial increase in the oxidizing power of h2o2 occurs in the presence of electrically assisted fenton process generation of hydroxyl radicals is enhanced by electricity ensuring considerable improvement of removal of refractory organic pollutants 24 electro fenton process has two different configurations in the first one fenton reagents are added to the reactor from outside and inert electrodes with high catalytic activity are used as anode material while in the second configuration only hydrogen peroxide is added from outside and fe2 is provided from sacrificial cast iron anodes the ef process based on the employment of a sacrificial iron anode delivers fe2 ions into the solution eq 1 whilst simultaneously occurs the reduction of water at the cathode eq 4 then the hydrogen peroxide is added in order to provide conditions for the fenton reactions eqs 2 and 3 moreover fe2 according to eq 4 may be continuously regenerated at the cathode depending on the electrolytic cell setup 25 26 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h i n b u l k s o l u t i o n 2 f e 2 o h f e 3

organic substances removal is ec process in ec processes the coagulating ions are produced in situ the process involves three stages i formation of the coagulants by electrolytic oxidation of the sacrificial electrode ii destabilization of the contaminants particulate suspension and breaking of emulsions and iii aggregation of the destabilized phases forming flocs in the first stage of ec process applied current intensity ph and the conductivity of the wastewater effect the generation of metallic ions and accordingly effect the performance of the process the main processes occuring in the electrolytic system when iron anodes are used can be described by the reactions given in eqs 5 8 at the anode the fe2 is formed due to the fe oxidation eq 5 at the cathode h2 gas is formed from the reduction of the protons in the acidic medium eq 6 or from water reduction in the alkaline medium eq 7 in both cases ph of the wastewater increases during electrolysis and monomeric and polymeric hydroxyl complexes form eq 8 the complexes have a pronounced tendency to polymerize at ph 3 5 7 0 fe oh n remains in the aqueous stream as a gelatinous suspension and may be removed from the wastewater by coagulation adsorption co precipitation and sweep flocculation 27 28 5 f e s f e 2 a q 2 e 6 2 h a q 2 e h 2 g 7 2 h 2 o l 2 e 2 o h a q h 2 g 8 f e 2 a q 2 o h a q f e o h 2 s leachate membrane concentrate pollutant concentration especially refractory pollutants is much higher than raw leachate although e fenton and ec technologies have been widely used for leachate treatment 29 34 there is deficiency in evaluating the performance of e fenton and ec processes in high strength leachate membrane concentrates treatment zhou et al 35 noted that 87 5 cod and 74 06 nh3 n were removed from leachate membrane concentrate by electrochemical oxidation using the high quality boron doped diamond electrodes huang et al 36 reported that 79 2 cod was removed from nanofiltration nf concentrate from mature landfill leachate by a coupled process of coagulation and aerated internal micro electrolysis ime with the in situ addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 due to the limited number of studies in the literature this study focused on the applicability of the electrofenton and electrocoagulation processes for the treatment of the leachate nanofiltration membrane concentrate our work aims i to compare the performance of e fenton and ec processes for cod toc and color removal from biologically treated nf concentrate ii to optimize the factors effecting the processes for obtaining maximum removal efficiencies iii to evaluate the effect of ef and ec processes on cod fractions of the effluent 2 material methods 2 1 leachate sampling and characteristics the leachate used in this study was first treated in a two stage nitrification denitrification process following anaerobic biological trenatment and then by ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf membrane processes were applied to the biologically treated leachate leachate samples were collected transferred and preserved according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 37 leachate nf concentrate characterization is given in table 1 2 2 experimental procedure the plexiglas ec and ef reactors fig 1 height of 130 mm and diameter of 90 mm and four plate electrodes comprising of two anodes and two cathodes 120 mm x 60 mm x 3 mm were used in the present study the total effective electrode area was 46 cm2 whereas the distance between electrodes was 10 mm the electrodes were connected in monopolar mode to a digital dc power supply the chemicals h2o2 h2so4 naoh were obtained from merck company in each experiment 500 ml of leachate nf concentrate was placed in the electrolytic reactor ph of the solution was adjusted prior to the experiments and the solution was agitated with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm in ef process a desired amount of h2o2 ml was added to the electrolytic reactor before the electrical current was turned on a batch study was conducted to optimize parameters ph current density and reaction time for ec and ph current density reaction time and peroxide dosage for ef processes before each run organic impurities and oxide layer on electrode surfaces were removed by dipping for 2 min in a solution prepared by mixing hcl solution 35 and hexamethylenetetramine aqueous solution 2 8 the electrodes were then dried weighed and placed into the reactor experiments were conducted at room temperature the samples were filtered using a 45 μm millipore membrane paper before analysis 2 3 analytical method the cod was determined using closed reflux titrimetric method and color was measured according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 37 toc concentrations were measured using a shimadzu toc vcpn analyzer total cod is divided into two main fractions biodegradable and non biodegradable cod which are further subdivided into particulate and soluble fractions 38 39 the fractions of biodegradable and non biodegradable cod were determined through the aeration of 1000 ml leachate nf concentrate sample before and after oxidation processes the method used is 40 mechanical mixer using magnetic stirrer was supplied to provide sufficient mixing an air pump was used for aeration and the sample size was maintained at 1 l by distilled water addition to prevent water loss during aeration cod was gradually measured until obtaining a constant value the biodegradable cod fraction was calculated using the following eq 9 9 c o d b i c o d i c o d f where cod bi is the biodegradable cod fraction codi is the initial total cod and codf represents the final cod value after aeration codf will be considered as the non biodegradable cod fraction soluble cod s fraction was determined using the znso4 coagulant method 39 41 one ml of znso4 0 6 m reagent was added to 100 ml of the sample and ph of sample was adjusted at 10 5 the sample was stirred rapidly 350 rpm for one minute then slowly 30 rpm for 5 min using a magnetic stirrer the sample was then left for settling for an hour and 30 ml of the supernatant was extracted from the surface cod of the filtered supernatant was measured as soluble cod s the difference between cod s and cod i was determined to be particulate cod pcod fractions of soluble and particulate cod were calculated by using eqs 3 and 4 10 c o d s c o d s c o d 100 11 p c o d c o d c o d s c o d 100 where cod is the total cod mg l pcod is particulate cod mg l and cod s is the total soluble cod mg l the total soluble cod s determined by using eq 10 contains biodegradable soluble codsbi and non biodegradable soluble cod subi sub fractions the value of soluble biodegradable cod sbi is reported as cod bi as given by eq 12 41 whereas the soluble non biodegradable cod subi was determined by the difference between cod sbi and cod s the fractions of cod sbi and cod subi were determined using eqs 12 and 13 12 c o d s b i c o d b i c o d s 100 13 c o d s u b i c o d s c o d b i c o d s 100 where cod sbi is the biodegradable soluble cod mg l cod subi is the non biodegradable soluble cod mg l cod bi is the biodegradable cod mg l in batch aeration system and cod s mg l represents the total soluble cod mg l 3 results and discusson 3 1 effect of ph the ph is one of the most important factors for e fenton process it is reported by many researchers that the optimum ph of fenton process is around 3 42 43 generally the ef reaction is performed in acidic conditions ph ranging between 2 0 and 4 0 44 the optimum ph value was 2 8 for hydroxyl radical production 45 fenton process is less effective at ph 3 due to the regeneration of fe2 through reaction between fe3 and h2o2 additionally hydrogen peroxide would remain steady according to the formation of oxonium ion at ph below 3 46 the efficiency of e fenton process decreases rapidly at higher ph values especially ph 5 this can be explained by the fact that h2o2 is unstable in basic solution and rapidly decomposes to oxygen and water at neutral to high ph values 46 the increase in ph during e fenton process leads to electrocoagulation whereby pollutants are removed by electrostatic attraction and or complexation of reactions due to the conversion of fe2 and fe3 to fe oh n type structures 46 47 in ec process ferrous ions are only oxidized to ferric ions if the ph is above 5 even though complete oxidation only occurs at ph of around 8 9 47 51 as known ferrous ions are highly soluble poor coagulants with no adsorption capacity of pollutants it can be concluded that the optimum operating ph range of iron ec is 5 9 and operation at an initial ph of 8 9 is favorable to ensure complete oxidation of ferrous ions ph is a key factor influencing the ec process performance governing the hydrolyzed metal species effluent ph after ec process increases for acidic influent but decreases for alkaline influent due to the buffering effect of ec 52 the ph increase in acidic medium can be attributed to hydrogen evolution at the cathode while the ph decrease in alkaline medium can be explained by the formation of hydroxide precipitates that release h cations at the anode and the secondary reactions as water oxidation chlorine production and its hydrolysis the ph of the effluent changes only slightly when the initial ph value is in the neutral range around 6 8 moreover hydrogen bubbles produced at the cathode are smallest and finest at neutral ph providing sufficient surface area for gas liquid solid interfaces and mixing efficiency to favour the aggregation of tiny destabilized particles and colloids 52 53 effect of ph on ec and ef treatment of leachate nf concemtrate is given in figs 2 and 3 respectively experimental study was conducted at ph values in the range of 2 4 5 for ef process and 6 11 for ec process in ef treatment cod removal efficiency increased as ph value increased from 2 to 3 5 maximum cod removal 61 3 was obtained at ph value of 3 5 0 1 in ec process cod removal efficiiency increased as ph value increased from 6 to 8 no significat change was observed at ph values around 8 9 then removal efficiency decreased optimum ph value for ec process was determined to be 8 0 05 with the maximum cod removal efficiency of 49 1 effluent ph values increased in ef process whereas effluent ph value increased at acidic conditions decreased at alkaline conditions in ec process no significant change between influent and effluent ph values was observed at neutral values in ec process these results were found to be consistent with literature 54 56 3 2 effect of applied current in electrochemical processes the applied current is the driving force for the discharge of oxygen at anode and the evolution of hydrogen at cathode leading to the generation of hydrogen peroxide thereby higher applied current increases the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced thus increasing the number of hydroxyl radicals in the electrolyte medium which are highly reactive 46 57 higher applied current also means higher electro regeneration of ferrous ion from ferric ion however the efficiency of e fenton process will decrease after a limit value of the current applied because of the competitive electrode reactions which inhibit main reactions in the electrolytic cell 46 58 in the ec and ef processes reaction rate is controlled by current 59 60 by controlling hydroxide flocs formation mohajeri et al 61 reported that they used the electrical current as 0 3 a from the experimental conditions for leachate treatment by electro fenton oxidation similar to the stduy of mohajeri et al 61 effect of the current in the ec and ef processes were studied in the range of 0 75 4 25 at operating time of 0 30 min figs 4 and 5 the removal efficiencies increased with the increasing current as current values increased the amount of hydroxide flocs formation increased the density and size of the bubbles increased resulting in a faster removal of pollutants 60 62 63 maximum pollutant removal was obtained at 3 5 0 25 a in ec process and 2 75 0 1 a in ef process no significant change was observed at higher current values but very high current values negatively affect the ec efficiency reversing the charge of the colloids and redispersing them 3 3 effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration removal efficiencies of pollutants increase with increase in h2o2 concentration leading to the increase in hydroxyl radical concentration at h2o2 concentration over optimum values efficiency of organic material removal decreases because of the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect of h2o2 and the recombination of the hydroxyl radicals 46 58 guvenc et al 64 noted that they applied h2o2 cod ratio range of 0 4 2 in electro fenton oxidation similarly the effect of h2o2 cod ratio on removal efficiencies of cod toc and color was studied in the range of 0 5 2 under optimum conditions 2 75 a and ph 3 5 fig 6 the removal efficiencies of cod toc and color increased as h2o2 cod ratio increased from 0 5 to 1 25 then began to decrease cod removal efficiency increased from 53 6 to 68 9 when h2o2 cod ratio increased from 0 5 0 08 to 1 25 0 18 thereafter cod removal rate decreased to 61 6 at h2o2 cod ratio of 2 due to the undesired oh scavenging reactions effect 3 4 effect of reaction time tak et al 65 carried out experimental studies at 10 30 min in electrocoagulation process and optimum condition was determined to 30 min similarly reaction time range of 5 30 min in this study was applied at ec and ef processes figs 7 and 8 present the effect of reaction time 5 30 min on the removal efficiencies of cod toc and color in ec and ef processes the obtained results showed that removal efficiencies increased by time the cod removal could be attributed to the precipitation of dissolved organics the cod removal efficiency is dependent on the quantity of hydroxide flocs that increase with the increase in current density and time of electrocoagulation cod concentration decreased rapidly in the first 10 min of the electrocoagulation process higher removal efficiencies of cod were observed at longer time periods and higher cell current values 66 at shorter time periods since the amount of precipitate formed was not high and important part of cod is soluble lower removal efficiencies are observed 67 cod removal efficiency was determined to be 43 and 69 4 after 10 0 2 min and 30 1 1 min operation time respectively in ef process in ec process cod removal efficiency was found to be 43 5 and 53 6 after 10 0 28 min and 30 1 32 min operation time respectively 3 5 effect of water conductivity the amount of the current density applied depends strongly on conductivity and ionic strength of the wastewater the current density efficiency increases and the treatment time required to reach a given removal yield decreases with increasing electrolytic conductivity consequently the energy consumption is reduced 68 electrical conductivity of leachate nf concentrate is high with the value around 20 ms cm effluent conductivity of ec and ef processes were found to be higher than influent conductivity values this can be explained by the current applied by electricity to the wastewater 3 6 effect of ef and ec processes on cod fractions of nf concentrate the fractionation of cod is the most important parameter for evaluating leachate quality and deciding the treatment method the total cod is divided into two main fractions biodegradable and unbiodegradable cod inert cod the unbiodegradable cod fraction is divided into soluble and particulate fractions whereas the biodegradable cod fraction is subdivided into soluble readily biodegradable and particulate slowly biodegradable fractions 69 the effect of oxidation processes on biodegradable and non biodegradable cod fractions was given in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that biodegradable cod fraction increased from 6 37 to 17 04 and 30 08 after ec and ef processes respectively whereas the non biodegradable cod fractions decreased from 93 63 to 82 96 and 69 92 after ec and ef processes respectively in previous studies improvement for biodegradable cod fraction in stabilized landfill leachate by advanced oxidation process was reported 41 70 determination of soluble cod is important in identifying other cod fractions fig 9 presents the soluble and particulate cod fractions of leachate nf concentrate before and after ec and ef processes the results of the previous studies related with effect of advanced oxidation processes on biodegradable and soluble characteristics of stabilized leachate revealed that insoluble organics can be converted to soluble ones 39 70 soluble and particulate cod fractions of leachate nf concentrate were determined as 71 14 28 86 respectively cod s fraction increased to 89 and 90 3 after 60 min ec and ef processes respectively soluble cod removal rate was determined to be 39 and 57 by ec and ef processes whereas particulate cod removal rate was found to be 82 and 81 by ec and ef processes respectively the results are consistent with the ones concluded by abu amr et al 39 and hilles 70 the total soluble cod s fraction in leachate is divided into two sub fractions biodegradable soluble cod sbi and non biodegradable soluble cod subi 41 cod sbi and cod subi fractions of nf concentrate were determined to be 8 95 and 91 05 cod sbi fraction increased to 19 1 and 35 5 and cod subi fractions decreased to 80 9 and 64 5 after ec and ef treatment respectively 3 7 operational cost operational cost greatly determines the feasibility of any wastewater treatment process the operating cost was calculated using the following equation 71 72 14 o p e r a t i o n a l c o s t a c e n e r g y b c e l e c t r o d e c c c h e m i c a l s where cenergy is the energy consumption kwh m3 celectrode is the electrode consumption kg m3 and cchemicals is the chemical consumption kg m3 of wastewater treated the chemical cost is negligible because it is less than 0 001 per m3 the operational cost includes also labor maintenance and other fixed costs the latter costs items are largely independent of the type of the electrode material 73 in this study energy and electrode material costs are taken into account as major cost items in the calculation of the operating cost as kwh per kg of cod removed the major operating cost component in electrocoagulation process is electrical energy consumption cenergy the electrical energy consumption was calculated using the following equation 74 15 c e n e r g y u i t e c v where celectrode is the energy consumption kwh m3 u is the applied voltage v i is the current a t is the electrocoagulation time h and v is the volume of the wastewater m3 the amount of electrode dissolved was calculated theoretically by using faraday s law 16 c e l e c t r o d e i t e c m w z f v where c g l is the iron or aluminum concentration in the electrolytic cell i is the current a t is the electrocoagulation time s mw is the molecular weight of the anode g mole z is the chemical equivalence f is the faraday constant 96 500 c mole and v is the volume of the wastewater m3 operational cost was calculated to be 1 94 per m3 and 1 82 per m3 for ec and ef processes respectively values of energy and electrode consumptions in the ef process were found to be quite lower than that in the ec process however the operational cost of ef process under optimum conditions was determined to be higher than that of ec process since the cost increased considerably with h2o2 4 conclusion in this study effect of the operational parameters on the ec and ef treatment of leachate nf concentrate was evaluated based on cod toc and color removal efficiencies operating cost and sludge amount the optimum operating conditions for ef process were determined as ph 3 5 current 2 75 a h2o2 cod ratio 1 25 and reaction time 30 min whereas they were found to be ph 7 current 3 5 a and reaction time 20 min for ec process cod toc and color removal efficiencies at optimum conditions were determined to be 69 4 60 2 and 87 6 in ef process while cod toc and color removal efficiencies at optimum conditions were determined to be 57 4 45 and 77 1 in ec process under optimum conditions amount of the sludge generated in ec process is much higher than the amount of sludge produced in ef process higher increase in biodegradable cod fraction and higher decrease in unbiodegradable cod fraction was obtained by ef process also higher insoluble cod fraction was converted to soluble cod by ef process although they don t reach to discaharge standards according to the environmental regulations they are applicable for reducing inert cod load the obtained results indicated both ec and ef processes were very effective for the leachate nf concentrate treatment especially in inert cod removal moreover the results show that both processes can be used as post treatment unit for biologically treatead laechate consequently it can be concluded that ef process can be prefered for leachate nf concentrate due to high removal rates and low sludge amount acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the istac istanbul environmental management industry and trade inc management office of komurcuoda landfill site for providing the leachate nf concentrate samples 
14347,in the present work experimental study for leachate nanofiltration concentrate treatment by electrocoagulation and electro fenton processes using iron electrodes was carried out in a batch electrolytic reactor removal efficiencies of 60 2 for total organic carbon toc 69 4 for chemical oxygen demand cod and 87 6 for color from the electro fenton process at the optimum operating conditions and 45 for toc 57 4 for cod and 77 1 for color from the electrocoagulation process at the optimum operating conditions respectively were obtained additionally the fraction of biodegradable cod increased from 6 37 to 17 04 and 30 08 after electrocoagulation and electro fenton processes respectively about 39 soluble cod and 82 particulate cod removal efficiencies were obtained by electrocoagulation whereas 57 soluble cod and 81 particulate cod removal efficiencies were obtained by electro fenton process electro fenton process was found to be more effective than the electrocoagulation process with respect to the removal efficiencies of cod and toc however both processes could be efficient methods for converting nonsoluble cod to soluble cod and removal of nonbiodegradable cod as a result both of the processes could be used as a post treatment method for leachate and an effective method inert cod removal from leachate nanofiltration concentrate keywords leachate nanofiltration concentrate electrocoagulation electro fenton cod fractions 1 introduction pressure driven membrane processes microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration reverse osmosis separate a feed stream into a purified permeate fraction and a concentrated retentate fraction 1 2 ultrafiltration uf membranes remove macromolecules with a molecular weight above 5000 100 000 whereas nanofiltration nf membranes remove organic compounds with a molecular weight above 200 500 depending on the pore size 3 4 the volume and composition of the waste stream from pressure driven membrane processes depends on the operation mode of the process 5 nf and ro are usually operated in cross flow mode the concentrate and the rinsing water used for intermediate forward flushing are the main waste streams the characteristics of the concentrate depend on the feedwater characteristics the pretreatment the membrane process used the recovery and the additional chemicals used 6 the concentrate to feed volume ratio is 1 10 for mf and uf 15 30 for nf and 15 60 for ro the concentrate composition is largely determined by the pore size of the membrane mf or uf membrane concentrates contain suspended solids and colloidal particles whereas nf or ro concentrates contain high concentrations of ions and small organic compounds because of the increased concentrations of salts and small organic compounds treatment of nf or ro concentrates are more difficult than mf or uf concentrates 6 the percolation of rainfall in combination with the decomposition of landfilled solid waste generates highly contaminated liquid called leachate 7 leachate contains complex pollutants including dissolved organic matter inorganic ions heavy metals inorganic salts etc and requires an efficient treatment to minimize the high level of pollutants prior to final discharge 7 9 conventional biological treatment methods is an economical way to remove the biodegradable organic compounds in the leachate and nitrification denitrification processes are used for ammonia removal after anaerobic treatment however refractory organic compounds such as humic acid ha fulvic acid fa and hydrophilic fractions can not be effectively removed by conventional biological treatment 10 12 membrane separation processes such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are increasingly being used as a polishing step following biological treatment to remove these refractory pollutants 13 14 nevertheless membrane separation processes do not really destruct the pollutants but merely concentrate them into smaller volumes of wastewater called membrane concentrates chaplin et al 15 have found that electrochemical oxidation using bdd electrodes has an advantage over other advanced oxidation processes as organics were readily oxidized in the presence of high hco3 concentrations as a result the membrane concentrates contain high levels of refractory organic pollutants and inorganic salts the main treatment methods of concentrated leachate can be classified into four categories 1 recirculation to landfills 16 2 solidification stabilization 17 3 evaporation distillation 18 4 advanced oxidation processes 19 the recirculation of concentrated leachate to landfills may inhibit the microbial activity 20 whereas evaporation distillation method require high land utilization high operating costs 14 moreover the corrosion and fouling are the two main problems in evaporation distillation method due to the high concentration of salts and inorganic matters 21 solidification and stabilization of the leachate nf concentrate seems to be an acceptable solution except for the disposal of derived solidified products 17 among the four categories aops is an attractive method to remove recalcitrant organic compounds and to increase the biodegradability of concentrated leachate by aops bio refractory organic matters could be destroyed via the oxidation by generation of radicals such as non selective hydroxyl radicals 22 fenton electrochemical oxidation uv photocatalyst and ozone based processses have been investigated intensively 11 18 23 high sludge generation rate in fenton process low energy efficiency of uv photocatalyst high cost of ozonation processes are the big barriers for the application electrochemical oxidation has been considered as an attractive technology to treat membrane concentrates containing mainly non biodegradable organics and having high salinity and electric conductivity 12 14 electro fenton process can be defined as the combination of fenton and electro coagulation processes to increase the degradability of organic compounds present in high strength wastewaters a substantial increase in the oxidizing power of h2o2 occurs in the presence of electrically assisted fenton process generation of hydroxyl radicals is enhanced by electricity ensuring considerable improvement of removal of refractory organic pollutants 24 electro fenton process has two different configurations in the first one fenton reagents are added to the reactor from outside and inert electrodes with high catalytic activity are used as anode material while in the second configuration only hydrogen peroxide is added from outside and fe2 is provided from sacrificial cast iron anodes the ef process based on the employment of a sacrificial iron anode delivers fe2 ions into the solution eq 1 whilst simultaneously occurs the reduction of water at the cathode eq 4 then the hydrogen peroxide is added in order to provide conditions for the fenton reactions eqs 2 and 3 moreover fe2 according to eq 4 may be continuously regenerated at the cathode depending on the electrolytic cell setup 25 26 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h o h i n b u l k s o l u t i o n 2 f e 2 o h f e 3

organic substances removal is ec process in ec processes the coagulating ions are produced in situ the process involves three stages i formation of the coagulants by electrolytic oxidation of the sacrificial electrode ii destabilization of the contaminants particulate suspension and breaking of emulsions and iii aggregation of the destabilized phases forming flocs in the first stage of ec process applied current intensity ph and the conductivity of the wastewater effect the generation of metallic ions and accordingly effect the performance of the process the main processes occuring in the electrolytic system when iron anodes are used can be described by the reactions given in eqs 5 8 at the anode the fe2 is formed due to the fe oxidation eq 5 at the cathode h2 gas is formed from the reduction of the protons in the acidic medium eq 6 or from water reduction in the alkaline medium eq 7 in both cases ph of the wastewater increases during electrolysis and monomeric and polymeric hydroxyl complexes form eq 8 the complexes have a pronounced tendency to polymerize at ph 3 5 7 0 fe oh n remains in the aqueous stream as a gelatinous suspension and may be removed from the

membrane concentrate pollutant concentration especially refractory pollutants is much higher than raw leachate although e fenton and ec technologies have been widely used for leachate treatment 29 34 there is deficiency in evaluating the performance of e fenton and ec processes in high strength leachate membrane concentrates treatment zhou et al 35 noted that 87 5 cod and 74 06 nh3 n were removed from leachate membrane concentrate by electrochemical oxidation using the high quality boron doped diamond electrodes huang et al 36 reported that 79 2 cod was removed from nanofiltration nf concentrate from mature landfill leachate by a coupled process of coagulation and aerated internal micro electrolysis ime with the in situ addition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 due to the limited number of studies in the literature this study focused on the applicability of the electrofenton and electrocoagulation processes for the treatment of the leachate nanofiltration membrane concentrate our work aims i to compare the performance of e fenton and ec processes for cod toc and color removal from biologically treated nf concentrate ii to optimize the factors effecting the processes for obtaining maximum removal efficiencies iii to evaluate the effect of ef and ec processes on cod fractions of the effluent 2 material methods 2 1 leachate sampling and characteristics the leachate used in this study was first treated in a two stage nitrification denitrification process following anaerobic biological trenatment and then by ultrafiltration uf and nanofiltration nf membrane processes were applied to the biologically treated leachate leachate samples were collected transferred and preserved according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 37 leachate nf concentrate characterization is given in table 1 2 2 experimental procedure the plexiglas ec and ef reactors fig 1 height of 130 mm and diameter of 90 mm and four plate electrodes comprising of two anodes and two cathodes 120 mm x 60 mm x 3 mm were used in the present study the total effective electrode area was 46 cm2 whereas the distance between electrodes was 10 mm the electrodes were connected in monopolar mode to a digital dc power supply the chemicals h2o2 h2so4 naoh were obtained from merck company in each experiment 500 ml of leachate nf concentrate was placed in the electrolytic reactor ph of the solution was adjusted prior to the experiments and the solution was agitated with a magnetic stirrer at 200 rpm in ef process a desired amount of h2o2 ml was added to the electrolytic reactor before the electrical current was turned on a batch study was conducted to optimize parameters ph current density and reaction time for ec and ph current density reaction time and peroxide dosage for ef processes before each run organic impurities and oxide layer on electrode surfaces were removed by dipping for 2 min in a solution prepared by mixing hcl solution 35 and hexamethylenetetramine aqueous solution 2 8 the electrodes were then dried weighed and placed into the reactor experiments were conducted at room temperature the samples were filtered using a 45 μm millipore membrane paper before analysis 2 3 analytical method the cod was determined using closed reflux titrimetric method and color was measured according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 37 toc concentrations were measured using a shimadzu toc vcpn analyzer total cod is divided into two main fractions biodegradable and non biodegradable cod which are further subdivided into particulate and soluble fractions 38 39 the fractions of biodegradable and non biodegradable cod were determined through the aeration of 1000 ml leachate nf concentrate sample before and after oxidation processes the method used is 40 mechanical mixer using magnetic stirrer was supplied to provide sufficient mixing an air pump was used for aeration and the sample size was maintained at 1 l by distilled water addition to prevent water loss during aeration cod was gradually measured until obtaining a constant value the biodegradable cod fraction was calculated using the following eq 9 9 c o d b i c o d i c o d f where cod bi is the biodegradable cod fraction codi is the initial total cod and codf represents the final cod value after aeration codf will be considered as the non biodegradable cod fraction soluble cod s fraction was determined using the znso4 coagulant method 39 41 one ml of znso4 0 6 m reagent was added to 100 ml of the sample and ph of sample was adjusted at 10 5 the sample was stirred rapidly 350 rpm for one minute then slowly 30 rpm for 5 min using a magnetic stirrer the sample was then left for settling for an hour and 30 ml of the supernatant was extracted from the surface cod of the filtered supernatant was measured as soluble cod s the difference between cod s and cod i was determined to be particulate cod pcod fractions of soluble and particulate cod were calculated by using eqs 3 and 4 10 c o d s c o d s c o d 100 11 p c o d c o d c o d s c o d 100 where cod is the total cod mg l pcod is particulate cod mg l and cod s is the total soluble cod mg l the total soluble cod s determined by using eq 10 contains biodegradable soluble codsbi and non biodegradable soluble cod subi sub fractions the value of soluble biodegradable cod sbi is reported as cod bi as given by eq 12 41 whereas the soluble non biodegradable cod subi was determined by the difference between cod sbi and cod s the fractions of cod sbi and cod subi were determined using eqs 12 and 13 12 c o d s b i c o d b i c o d s 100 13 c o d s u b i c o d s c o d b i c o d s 100 where cod sbi is the biodegradable soluble cod mg l cod subi is the non biodegradable soluble cod mg l cod bi is the biodegradable cod mg l in batch aeration system and cod s mg l represents the total soluble cod mg l 3 results and discusson 3 1 effect of ph the ph is one of the most important factors for e fenton process it is reported by many researchers that the optimum ph of fenton process is around 3 42 43 generally the ef reaction is performed in acidic conditions ph ranging between 2 0 and 4 0 44 the optimum ph value was 2 8 for hydroxyl radical production 45 fenton process is less effective at ph 3 due to the regeneration of fe2 through reaction between fe3 and h2o2 additionally hydrogen peroxide would remain steady according to the formation of oxonium ion at ph below 3 46 the efficiency of e fenton process decreases rapidly at higher ph values especially ph 5 this can be explained by the fact that h2o2 is unstable in basic solution and rapidly decomposes to oxygen and water at neutral to high ph values 46 the increase in ph during e fenton process leads to electrocoagulation whereby pollutants are removed by electrostatic attraction and or complexation of reactions due to the conversion of fe2 and fe3 to fe oh n type structures 46 47 in ec process ferrous ions are only oxidized to ferric ions if the ph is above 5 even though complete oxidation only occurs at ph of around 8 9 47 51 as known ferrous ions are highly soluble poor coagulants with no adsorption capacity of pollutants it can be concluded that the optimum operating ph range of iron ec is 5 9 and operation at an initial ph of 8 9 is favorable to ensure complete oxidation of ferrous ions ph is a key factor influencing the ec process performance governing the hydrolyzed metal species effluent ph after ec process increases for acidic influent but decreases for alkaline influent due to the buffering effect of ec 52 the ph increase in acidic medium can be attributed to hydrogen evolution at the cathode while the ph decrease in alkaline medium can be explained by the formation of hydroxide precipitates that release h cations at the anode and the secondary reactions as water oxidation chlorine production and its hydrolysis the ph of the effluent changes only slightly when the initial ph value is in the neutral range around 6 8 moreover hydrogen bubbles produced at the cathode are smallest and finest at neutral ph providing sufficient surface area for gas liquid solid interfaces and mixing efficiency to favour the aggregation of tiny destabilized particles and colloids 52 53 effect of ph on ec and ef treatment of leachate nf concemtrate is given in figs 2 and 3 respectively experimental study was conducted at ph values in the range of 2 4 5 for ef process and 6 11 for ec process in ef treatment cod removal efficiency increased as ph value increased from 2 to 3 5 maximum cod removal 61 3 was obtained at ph value of 3 5 0 1 in ec process cod removal efficiiency increased as ph value increased from 6 to 8 no significat change was observed at ph values around 8 9 then removal efficiency decreased optimum ph value for ec process was determined to be 8 0 05 with the maximum cod removal efficiency of 49 1 effluent ph values increased in ef process whereas effluent ph value increased at acidic conditions decreased at alkaline conditions in ec process no significant change between influent and effluent ph values was observed at neutral values in ec process these results were found to be consistent with literature 54 56 3 2 effect of applied current in electrochemical processes the applied current is the driving force for the discharge of oxygen at anode and the evolution of hydrogen at cathode leading to the generation of hydrogen peroxide thereby higher applied current increases the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced thus increasing the number of hydroxyl radicals in the electrolyte medium which are highly reactive 46 57 higher applied current also means higher electro regeneration of ferrous ion from ferric ion however the efficiency of e fenton process will decrease after a limit value of the current applied because of the competitive electrode reactions which inhibit main reactions in the electrolytic cell 46 58 in the ec and ef processes reaction rate is controlled by current 59 60 by controlling hydroxide flocs formation mohajeri et al 61 reported that they used the electrical current as 0 3 a from the experimental conditions for leachate treatment by electro fenton oxidation similar to the stduy of mohajeri et al 61 effect of the current in the ec and ef processes were studied in the range of 0 75 4 25 at operating time of 0 30 min figs 4 and 5 the removal efficiencies increased with the increasing current as current values increased the amount of hydroxide flocs formation increased the density and size of the bubbles increased resulting in a faster removal of pollutants 60 62 63 maximum pollutant removal was obtained at 3 5 0 25 a in ec process and 2 75 0 1 a in ef process no significant change was observed at higher current values but very high current values negatively affect the ec efficiency reversing the charge of the colloids and redispersing them 3 3 effect of hydrogen peroxide concentration removal efficiencies of pollutants increase with increase in h2o2 concentration leading to the increase in hydroxyl radical concentration at h2o2 concentration over optimum values efficiency of organic material removal decreases because of the hydroxyl radical scavenging effect of h2o2 and the recombination of the hydroxyl radicals 46 58 guvenc et al 64 noted that they applied h2o2 cod ratio range of 0 4 2 in electro fenton oxidation similarly the effect of h2o2 cod ratio on removal efficiencies of cod toc and color was studied in the range of 0 5 2 under optimum conditions 2 75 a and ph 3 5 fig 6 the removal efficiencies of cod toc and color increased as h2o2 cod ratio increased from 0 5 to 1 25 then began to decrease cod removal efficiency increased from 53 6 to 68 9 when h2o2 cod ratio increased from 0 5 0 08 to 1 25 0 18 thereafter cod removal rate decreased to 61 6 at h2o2 cod ratio of 2 due to the undesired oh scavenging reactions effect 3 4 effect of reaction time tak et al 65 carried out experimental studies at 10 30 min in electrocoagulation process and optimum condition was determined to 30 min similarly reaction time range of 5 30 min in this study was applied at ec and ef processes figs 7 and 8 present the effect of reaction time 5 30 min on the removal efficiencies of cod toc and color in ec and ef processes the obtained results showed that removal efficiencies increased by time the cod removal could be attributed to the precipitation of dissolved organics the cod removal efficiency is dependent on the quantity of hydroxide flocs that increase with the increase in current density and time of electrocoagulation cod concentration decreased rapidly in the first 10 min of the electrocoagulation process higher removal efficiencies of cod were observed at longer time periods and higher cell current values 66 at shorter time periods since the amount of precipitate formed was not high and important part of cod is soluble lower removal efficiencies are observed 67 cod removal efficiency was determined to be 43 and 69 4 after 10 0 2 min and 30 1 1 min operation time respectively in ef process in ec process cod removal efficiency was found to be 43 5 and 53 6 after 10 0 28 min and 30 1 32 min operation time respectively 3 5 effect of water conductivity the amount of the current density applied depends strongly on conductivity and ionic strength of the wastewater the current density efficiency increases and the treatment time required to reach a given removal yield decreases with increasing electrolytic conductivity consequently the energy consumption is reduced 68 electrical conductivity of leachate nf concentrate is high with the value around 20 ms cm effluent conductivity of ec and ef processes were found to be higher than influent conductivity values this can be explained by the current applied by electricity to the wastewater 3 6 effect of ef and ec processes on cod fractions of nf concentrate the fractionation of cod is the most important parameter for evaluating leachate quality and deciding the treatment method the total cod is divided into two main fractions biodegradable and unbiodegradable cod inert cod the unbiodegradable cod fraction is divided into soluble and particulate fractions whereas the biodegradable cod fraction is subdivided into soluble readily biodegradable and particulate slowly biodegradable fractions 69 the effect of oxidation processes on biodegradable and non biodegradable cod fractions was given in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that biodegradable cod fraction increased from 6 37 to 17 04 and 30 08 after ec and ef processes respectively whereas the non biodegradable cod fractions decreased from 93 63 to 82 96 and 69 92 after ec and ef processes respectively in previous studies improvement for biodegradable cod fraction in stabilized landfill leachate by advanced oxidation process was reported 41 70 determination of soluble cod is important in identifying other cod fractions fig 9 presents the soluble and particulate cod fractions of leachate nf concentrate before and after ec and ef processes the results of the previous studies related with effect of advanced oxidation processes on biodegradable and soluble characteristics of stabilized leachate revealed that insoluble organics can be converted to soluble ones 39 70 soluble and particulate cod fractions of leachate nf concentrate were determined as 71 14 28 86 respectively cod s fraction increased to 89 and 90 3 after 60 min ec and ef processes respectively soluble cod removal rate was determined to be 39 and 57 by ec and ef processes whereas particulate cod removal rate was found to be 82 and 81 by ec and ef processes respectively the results are consistent with the ones concluded by abu amr et al 39 and hilles 70 the total soluble cod s fraction in leachate is divided into two sub fractions biodegradable soluble cod sbi and non biodegradable soluble cod subi 41 cod sbi and cod subi fractions of nf concentrate were determined to be 8 95 and 91 05 cod sbi fraction increased to 19 1 and 35 5 and cod subi fractions decreased to 80 9 and 64 5 after ec and ef treatment respectively 3 7 operational cost operational cost greatly determines the feasibility of any wastewater treatment process the operating cost was calculated using the following equation 71 72 14 o p e r a t i o n a l c o s t a c e n e r g y b c e l e c t r o d e c c c h e m i c a l s where cenergy is the energy consumption kwh m3 celectrode is the electrode consumption kg m3 and cchemicals is the chemical consumption kg m3 of wastewater treated the chemical cost is negligible because it is less than 0 001 per m3 the operational cost includes also labor maintenance and other fixed costs the latter costs items are largely independent of the type of the electrode material 73 in this study energy and electrode material costs are taken into account as major cost items in the calculation of the operating cost as kwh per kg of cod removed the major operating cost component in electrocoagulation process is electrical energy consumption cenergy the electrical energy consumption was calculated using the following equation 74 15 c e n e r g y u i t e c v where celectrode is the energy consumption kwh m3 u is the applied voltage v i is the current a t is the electrocoagulation time h and v is the volume of the wastewater m3 the amount of electrode dissolved was calculated theoretically by using faraday s law 16 c e l e c t r o d e i t e c m w z f v where c g l is the iron or aluminum concentration in the electrolytic cell i is the current a t is the electrocoagulation time s mw is the molecular weight of the anode g mole z is the chemical equivalence f is the faraday constant 96 500 c mole and v is the volume of the wastewater m3 operational cost was calculated to be 1 94 per m3 and 1 82 per m3 for ec and ef processes respectively values of energy and electrode consumptions in the ef process were found to be quite lower than that in the ec process however the operational cost of ef process under optimum conditions was determined to be higher than that of ec process since the cost increased considerably with h2o2 4 conclusion in this study effect of the operational parameters on the ec and ef treatment of leachate nf concentrate was evaluated based on cod toc and color removal efficiencies operating cost and sludge amount the optimum operating conditions for ef process were determined as ph 3 5 current 2 75 a h2o2 cod ratio 1 25 and reaction time 30 min whereas they were found to be ph 7 current 3 5 a and reaction time 20 min for ec process cod toc and color removal efficiencies at optimum conditions were determined to be 69 4 60 2 and 87 6 in ef process while cod toc and color removal efficiencies at optimum conditions were determined to be 57 4 45 and 77 1 in ec process under optimum conditions amount of the sludge generated in ec process is much higher than the amount of sludge produced in ef process higher increase in biodegradable cod fraction and higher decrease in unbiodegradable cod fraction was obtained by ef process also higher insoluble cod fraction was converted to soluble cod by ef process although they don t reach to discaharge standards according to the environmental regulations they are applicable for reducing inert cod load the obtained results indicated both ec and ef processes were very effective for the leachate nf concentrate treatment especially in inert cod removal moreover the results show that both processes can be used as post treatment unit for biologically treatead laechate consequently it can be concluded that ef process can be prefered for leachate nf concentrate due to high removal rates and low sludge amount acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the istac istanbul environmental management industry and trade inc management office of komurcuoda landfill site for providing the leachate nf concentrate samples 
14348,the mechanistic of photocatalytic decolorization and mineralization of methyl orange mo dye have been successfully studied using immobilized titanium dioxide chitosan montmorillonite tio2 cs mt a combination of tio2 as the top layer and cs mt as the sub layer on a glass plate the immobilized cs mt film was selected over the cs film since the former adhered stronger and swelled less than the latter which showed its favorability in the aqueous medium this bilayer photocatalyst operated via a simultaneous occurrence of adsorption of mo dye from the cs mt layer and photocatalytic degradation by tio2 layer the bilayer photocatalyst could remove the mo dye from the solution 3 times faster than the single tio2 within 90 min of irradiation under a uv vis lamp due to strong adsorption of mo by the cs mt sub layer the mechanistic study revealed that the degradation occurred via the e o2 route while the lc ms analysis suggested the possible degradation pathway of mo dye it was found that the eluent used for separation of compounds in the lc ms analysis influenced the intermediates detected for which two degradation mechanisms were proposed keywords chitosan montmorillonite degradation mechanism mineralization pathway methyl orange titanium dioxide 1 introduction the synthetic dyes that are largely consumed by the industries can be classified to acid basic direct disperse mordant reactive sulfur azo and vat dyes whereby azo dyes are the major units and account for 70 of all the dyestuffs produced 1 the raw materials that are commonly used are hydrocarbons benzene toluene naphthalene and anthracene 2 one of the synthetic dyes is methyl orange mo 4 dimethylamino phenyl azo benzenesulfonic acid mo is produced from diazotization of the sulfanilic acid sodium nitrite and dimethylaniline and used for dyeing in textile printing pharmaceutical paper manufacturing food industries leather industries and research laboratories 3 4 it has a very short excited state life and is stable in visible and near uv light as one of the azo dye family mo is carcinogenic due to its decomposition to aromatic amines which are hazardous to the aquatic organisms and the food web 5 in addition the dye can be transported easily in water due to its solubility and oxidized to form the highly toxic mutagenic and hazard compounds until now many adsorbents have been used to remove the dyes from wastewater namely silica oxide sio2 6 polyaniline pani 7 montmorillonite mt 8 activated carbon ac 9 and chitosan cs 10 more advanced works have been done by coupling of two or more adsorbent materials so that these composite type adsorbents exhibit enhanced properties in selectivity regeneration surface area mechanical strength and surface chemistry 11 in this regard the combination of cs and mt in various cs mt composite forms has been proven to improve the pore size mechanical strength chemical stability hydrophilicity and biocompatibility of cs 12 as generally known the removal of the dyes by sole adsorption process cannot destroy the dye completely as the process is only a liquid solid phase transfer process 13 14 moreover some of the adsorbents are not reusable and even saturated after the dye adsorption which make them costly ineffective since some dyes are very stable in the environment non biodegradable and carcinogenic 15 the cs mt adsorbent should be combined with a photocatalyst such as tio2 so that the dyes can be converted into harmless products the combination can also overcome the tio2 drawback due to its poor adsorption capacity of some pollutants which influences its degradation performance 16 this synergistic photocatalysis adsorption process has shown enhanced photocatalytic performance than the bare tio2 in the removal of various organic contaminants 9 17 19 in general the fundamental of tio2 mediated photocatalysis is based on the electron excitation from the photocatalyst valence band to its conduction band producing the electron hole pairs 20 the electron and hole of tio2 react with o2 and h2o respectively to form the oxidative radicals for degrading the organic compounds at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure 21 however the band gap energy of tio2 lies in the uv region making them inactive under visible light irradiation 22 23 many efforts have been manifested to enable and enlarge the tio2 applications under visible light such as doping with metals nonmetals semiconductors and adsorbents 24 the visible light activity is supported by the enhancement in electrochemical and electronic properties as well as adsorption process throughout the entire photocatalytic oxidation process 25 26 enhanced separation of the charge carriers of tio2 will eventually produce more oxidative radicals to oxidize the organic contaminants moreover some dyes can be self sensitized under visible light irradiation making the dye treatment by tio2 becomes more favorable 27 28 this study combined the tio2 and cs mt composite as an immobilized bilayer photocatalyst to solve the conventional post treatment problem of filtration this type of immobilization assemblage could also overcome the reduction in the exposed surface area after immobilization which frequently slows down the photocatalytic activity the tio2 properties would not be discussed in the present study since the details have been extensively reported by nawi and zain 29 only the physicochemical properties of cs mt sub layer were investigated through several selected tests and analyses the present work hopefully can give an insight into the mechanistic of photocatalytic decolorization by tio2 combined adsorbent as the adsorption of the dye specifically onto the adsorbent is involved as well as predicting the dye mineralization

solutions were cast directly on the glass plates with 4 7 cm 7 0 cm 0 2 cm of dimensions the wet plates were dried in open air and an oven at 100 c for overnight and 2 nights respectively before the dried weight was measured the preparation of the tio2 on the top layer of cs mt has been explained previously by nawi and zain 29 where the tio2 formulation was prepared based on the reported method briefly 6 g of tio2 powder in 100 ml of enr c7h8 and pvc ch2cl2 adhesive blend mixture was sonicated until a homogeneous formulation was obtained the amount of tio2 loading was determined by weighing the plate before and after dip coating where for this study the optimum loading of 2 5 mg cm 2 was coated on the dried cs mt plates 2 3 characterizations the adherence test to determine the strength of the cs and cs mt plates was performed following the reported method 30 the initial weight of the cast plates were measured and they were immersed in a beaker containing water respectively and sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 5 s dried in the oven and weighed the steps were repeated until 30 s meanwhile the swelling study was performed by peeling off the adsorbent film from the glass plate using a razor blade and the film was soaked in 10 ml of water in a vial for 24 h after taken out the wet film was patted slightly with a paper tissue before weighing the adhesiveness and swelling ratio of the polymer adsorbents are calculated using the following equations 1 a d h e s i v e n e s s w 1 w 2 m x 100 2 s w e l l i n g r a t i o w s w d w d x 100 here w 1 is the initial weight of the plate w 2 is the weight of the remaining adsorbent on the plate after 30 s m is the initial weight of the immobilized adsorbent on the plate w s is the weight of swollen sample g and w d is the weight of dried sample the determination of textural properties of the cs and cs mt samples were carried out at 77 k under n2 gas flow using a physisorption analyzer model asap 2010 micrometrics the functional groups of cs and cs mt composites were identified using a fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy model series 2000 perkin elmer at 650 4000 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 while the surface morphology composition and crystallography observations of the samples were done on a high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem jem 2100 f jeol 2 4 photocatalytic reactor set up the photocatalytic reactor in fig 1 was equipped with a 45 watt home fluorescent lamp philips an aquarium pump a pasteur pipette and a pvc tubing the uv leakage of the lamp was measured by a radiometer equipped with uv a and uv b broadband detectors from solar light co pma 2100 the glass cell used in this experiment was 5 cm 8 cm 1 cm of dimensions where the prepared plates were put vertically and the coated area of the plates faced the lamp the directly measured uv leakage of the lamp was 2 78 wm 2 and 1 78 wm 2 with glass cell a total visible light irradiation was conditioned by placing a uv cut off filter in front of the lamp meanwhile the adsorption study was performed using the similar set up in which the glass cell was put into a sealed box and the lamp was taken out the photocatalytic decolorization and adsorption experiments were conducted using 20 ml of 20 mg l 1 of mo solution ambient ph of 6 5 at room temperature 30 c and contact time of 60 min with 15 min of time interval the absorbance of mo solution between each interval was measured using a direct reading spectrophotometer hach dr 2000 at 464 nm the mo removal r and the apparent pseudo first order rate constant k from the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model were calculated using the following equations respectively 3 r c e c o x 100 4 ln c o c t k t here co ce and ct is the concentration of mo dye mg l 1 at initial equilibrium and time t respectively the k values min 1 can be obtained from the slope of the ln c o c t versus t plot 2 5 mechanism analyses the role of oxygen in the photocatalytic degradation by tio2 cs mt was carried out in the absence of o2 by supplying the n2 gas from the gas tank via a pvc tubing which was connected to the pasteur pipette of the photocatalytic reactor set up the top of the glass cell was covered tightly with a parafilm wrapped around the entrance of the cell to prevent the entry of o2 from the air meanwhile the tio2 mo saturated plate was used for the detection of radical quenchers where the mo was adsorbed onto the cs mt plate until fully saturated before coating with tio2 then about 0 001 m of edta and 1 4 bq solutions were spiked into a 20 ml of 20 mg l 1 mo solution respectively for the intermediates detection the plate of tio2 cs mt was firstly photo etched for 10 h to eliminate any interferences especially from the degradation of polymer binder within tio2 the samples for lc ms analysis were collected after 1 h of irradiation of the mo solution the analysis was done on a lc ms instrument from agilent technologies under the flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 using 0 025 m phosphate buffer ph 6 9 methanol 40 60 v v 31 and ultra pure water acetonitrile 50 50 v v as the eluents respectively using a reversed phase column lc 18 supelcosil with dimensions 25 cm 4 6 cm 5 μm from supelco the obtained chromatograms and mass values were evaluated using the mass hunter qualitative analysis b 04 00 software 3 results and discussions 3 1 optimization of cs loading for the fabrication of cs mt sub layer the effect of the amount of cs loading within the cs mt plate is significant since cs can function as bioadhesive and biosorbent 32 in this study the cs mt plates were prepared from the casting solutions consisting of a series of cs flakes amount from 0 25 g to 1 25 g with a fixed mt loading of 0 09 g respectively the purpose of adding mt clay to the cs matrix is to enhance the physicochemical properties of the composite film for extended usage in aqueous environment 33 however only a little amount of mt was added into the casting solution as an excessive amount of the clay would result in the brittleness of the composite film the suitability of this polymer composite adsorbent for an aqueous application was analyzed using the adherence and swelling tests from the test s result in table 1 an increase in the cs amount from 0 25 to 1 25 g within the cs mt plates has significantly increased the mechanical strength of the plates from 94 5 to 97 8 that was likely due to the increasing amount of the positively charged amino groups of cs which facilitated the electrostatic attraction with the negatively charged silicate of the glass plates and subsequently increased the adhesion of cs mt on the plates meanwhile the plate coated with 100 of cs exhibited a mechanical strength of 83 1 after the 30 sec adherence test which shows that 16 9 of cs was lost from the adsorbent initial weight here it was proven that the cs could function as an adhesive and bind very well to the glass plate whereby the strength of the immobilized adsorbent was much better in the presence of mt clay the data for the swelling test of the similar cs mt composition series are tabulated in table 1 the swelling test indicates that for a lower degree of swelling the corresponding plates are more hydrophobic and less hydrophilic and vice versa in this case the increment of the cs amount from 0 25 to 1 25 g within the composite has decreased the swelling ratio of the plates from 77 2 to 33 6 due to the increased hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and amino groups of cs with the silicate groups of mt clay this will reduce the cs mt composite contact with water molecules to become more hydrophobic 34 35 apparently the presence of mt has resulted in a stronger cs composite on the solid support as compared to cs film since the mt clay hardened when it is in contact with water besides the clay also expands the volume and lengthens the distance of water molecules causing the hydrophobicity of the composite 36 as for cs content the plates with higher cs induce stronger cs mt plates as more of the positively charged amino groups can bind to the negatively charged glass plate higher cs can also form less hydrogen bonding with the adsorbed water decreases the swelling properties of the adsorbent thus it is more suitable for longer usage since some of the amino groups of cs are used for the cs mt clay bonding as well as binding with the glass plate an optimum amount of cs flakes is required to obtain the best cs mt plate in term of adherence swelling properties and mo removal efficiency it can be observed that increasing the amount of cs flakes from 0 25 to 0 75 g in the cs mt casting solution has also increased the mo removal by the corresponding cs mt plates from 47 7 to 91 8 the increasing cs loading provides more positively amino groups for the negatively charged mo to bind onto the cs mt composite thus improves its removal ability however increasing the amount of cs over 1 g within the cs mt casting solution decreased the removal efficiency of mo to 44 7 this drastic change is related to the sudden reduction of surface area of the composite adsorbent with higher cs content corresponding to the availability of adsorption sites to adequately bind all the mo molecules herein the best amount of cs flakes at the fixed mt loading in the cs mt casting solution was 0 75 g which is equivalent to 89 of cs within the composite showing the best removal efficiency with comparable mechanical strength and swelling ratio properties as a reference the cs film that was prepared from the 0 75 g cs casting solution only removed 80 2 of mo from the aqueous solution from the surface area perspective the incorporation of mt within the cs matrix has increased the bet surface area from 3 82 to 4 38 m2 g 1 but reduced the pore volume and pore diameter from 8 1 to 7 6 10 2 cm3 g 1 and 8 39 to 6 96 nm respectively however increasing the cs content at fixed mt loading has essentially reduced the surface area of the cs mt composite as well as the pore volume and pore diameter to 2 27 m2 g 1 2 7 10 2 cm3 g 1 and 4 74 nm respectively similar trend can be observed for particle size where the size decreased when the clay was present and then increased with high cs content within the composite from these data it can be deduced that mt clay is a surface modifier which can affect the characteristics of pores while an excessive cs content exhibits inhibitory effect on the properties of the composite s pores nonetheless all the pores either with and without mt samples are categorized as mesopores 2 50 nm according to iupac classification 37 3 2 physical characterizations fig 2 shows the ft ir spectra for the detection of any changes in the functional groups of cs after the mt addition the peaks of the main functional groups of cs are 3447 cm 1 1641 cm 1 and 1559 cm 1 which correspond to the overlapping of the nh and oh stretching vibrations amide i and amide ii respectively 38 after becoming the composite a broad peak at around 3410 3480 cm 1 is observed that relates to the overlapping of nh and oh stretching vibrations of cs and oh groups of silanol of mt 11 39 the appearance of a new peak at 1559 cm 1 of cs mt composite is detected due to the bending vibration of nh2 of amide ii within the cs structure the morphology of cs and cs mt surface were then taken under a high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem and the corresponding micrographs are shown in fig 2 the cs flakes were well dissolved in the acid solution as the cs distribution is homogeneous and no significant particulate can be seen in the micrograph for the cs mt micrograph it can be seen that the mt clay was well distributed throughout the polymer matrix where no agglomeration and aggregation of cs and mt is observed the composite surface seems heterogeneous as the clay particles had occupied the cs matrix 3 3 photocatalysis adsorption processes 3 3 1 uv vis spectral changes the optimized cs mt sub layer was coated with tio2 on the top layer to produce the tio2 cs mt bilayer photocatalyst the photocatalyst was used to treat the mo dye solution under the uv vis light irradiation and was compared with the single tio2 layer the disappearance of mo dye as detected via uv vis spectrophotometer during the photocatalytic decolorization by tio2 cs mt and tio2 photocatalysts are shown in fig 3 a and b respectively the main absorbance peak of mo is at 464 nm in the visible region corresponding to the azo bond of mo which is responsible for the disappearance of its original color while the peak at 268 nm is related to the benzene ring of the dye chromophore 40 it can be observed that the reduction in absorbance at 268 and 464 nm peaks with increasing treatment time corresponds to the breaking of aromatic ring and azo bond of mo respectively that means more mo molecules were being degraded by tio2 cs mt at the same time as by tio2 showing enhanced decolorization of the dye by the former photocatalyst due to the contribution of adsorption process by cs mt sub layer as compared to tio2 3 3 2 reusability the reusability of tio2 cs mt and its counterpart tio2 for the removal of mo under uv vis light irradiation was compared by means of percentage of mo removed as shown in fig 4 high percentage of mo removed means more mo molecules were being degraded by tio2 cs mt leaving less mo remained in the solution in this case the dye treatment by tio2 cs mt in the presence of light showed the best removal followed by the reaction in the dark adsorption and irradiated tio2 the tio2 cs mt under light irradiation removed almost 95 98 of mo throughout the 10 cycles the bilayer photocatalyst could maintain its removal throughout the cycles due to the influence of adsorption of mo by the cs mt sub layer and photocatalytic reaction by the tio2 top layer the adsorbed mo within the adsorption sites of bilayer photocatalyst was removed by the oh radicals continuously at each cycle and therefore similar sites could be provided for the reaction at the next cycle during the treatment in the dark adsorption a good removal of mo was achieved where about 90 of mo were removed at the first three cycles however after the 4th cycle the removal declined continuously from 88 77 until the 10th cycle the reason was due to the saturation of adsorption sites within the tio2 cs mt after the repetitive cycles as the adsorption process did not degrade mo to smaller products as compared to the photocatalytic oxidation 41 therefore the mo molecules continuously filled up remained within and saturated the adsorption sites this event eventually decreased the removal efficiency significantly meanwhile the single tio2 operated under the light irradiation could only remove an average of 30 of mo throughout the ten cycles mainly due to the poor adsorption of mo on the photocatalyst surface 18 3 4 identification of the main species in the photocatalysis adsorption processes a mechanistic study was performed to identify the main active species that are responsible in the photocatalytic adsorption processes of the tio2 cs mt photocatalyst the study used n2 gas for providing an anaerobic condition a uv filter for a total visible light condition and chemical solutions 1 4 benzoquinone 1 4 bq as the superoxide o2 quenchers and edta as the positive holes h quenchers 42 and compared with the normal conditions the mechanism of photocatalysis is well established whereby the production of o2 and h which are responsible for the oh radicals formation are depicted in equation 5 12 31 33 on the tio2 surface the photocatalytic oxidation is initialized when sufficient or greater energy of light than the band gap energy of tio2 eg 3 2 ev is applied whereby the electron in the valence band of tio2 is excited to the conduction band cb and leaving the hole h at the valence band equation 5 at the cb the excited electrons react with the o2 to produce the o2 ho2 and h2o2 radical ions equation 6 10 which then are converted to the oh radicals the photo generated h at the vb will oxidize the h2o molecules eq 11 and oh ions eq 12 at the surface or in the tio2 bulk to produce the oh radicals 5 tio2 hv h e 6 e o2 o2 7 o2 h ho2 hydroperoxyl 8 ho2 ho2 h2o2 o2 9 h2o2 o2 oh oh o2 10 h2o2 e oh oh 11 h h2o oh h 12 h oh oh the efficiency and rate constant of mo removal by the tio2 cs mt photocatalyst under different experimental conditions are presented in fig 5 a while similar parameters were observed using a tio2 mo saturated cs mt photocatalyst in the presence of radicals quenchers as portrayed in fig 5b 3 4 1 effect of n2 gas during the photocatalytic degradation process the excited electron at the cb of tio2 can reduce the adsorbed o2 to the o2 ions eq 6 thus inhibit the possibility of recombination with the h at the vb in order to seek the effect of o2 on the photocatalytic activity of this tio2 cs mtphotocatalyst n2 gas was given to the photocatalytic reactor instead of o2 gas as observed in fig 5a the removal efficiency and rate constant decreased to 91 1 and 0 64 min 1 respectively when n2 gas was present as compared to the control condition with o2 under the uv vis light with 98 3 and 0 089 min 1 respectively the observed percentage of mo removal and rate constant in the presence of n2 gas were still significant due to the contribution of the 87 4 and 0 051 min 1 respectively by adsorption process as compared with 89 6 and 0 051 min 1 respectively in the presence of o2 gas although the n2 gas is inert and does not involve in the photocatalytic reaction the gas can still provide a driving force for the mass transfer of the dye onto the tio2 cs mt and assist in the adsorption process as similar as the removal by o2 that eventually contributes to the high removal and rate constant achieved however no o2 radicals can be generated from the electron excitation process in the presence of n2 gas as it is not an electron scavenger whereby the removal efficiency and rate constant were merely from the adsorption process this shows that the o2 is an important source for the oh radicals production for a complete photocatalytic decolorization of mo dye 3 4 2 effect of radical quenchers in order to identify the production route of oh radicals the tio2 mo saturated cs mt was used the cs mt sub layer was saturated with mo dye before coating tio2 on the top layer to eliminate the adsorption process and ensure that only the active radicals contributed to the photocatalytic decolorization of mo dye in this investigation the 1 4 bq c6h4o2 and edta solutions were spiked into the mo solution containing the saturated plate respectively and irradiated for 60 min when 1 4 bq was present in the dye solution the photocatalytic decolorization of mo slowed down as portrayed by a drop in the rate and percent of mo removed from 0 045 min 1 to 0 033 min 1 and 92 7 to 69 6 respectively during the quenching process 1 4 bq molecule was reduced to the semiquinone radicals eq 13 and in the presence of h ions the semiquinone radicals underwent a reaction with the o2 ions to form the hydroquinone eq 14 this would essentially reduce the amount of o2 forming into the oh radicals and eventually slow down the photocatalytic degradation process on the tio2 top layer 13 c6h4o2 e cb c6h4o2 14 c6h4o2 o2 2h c6h6o2 o2 meanwhile edta is known as a sacrificial electron donor where it can be reduced by the h to become an oxidized edta under light irradiation 43 as shown in eq 15 the consumption of h during the reaction with edta would essentially produce less oh radicals which reduced the photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalyst 15 edta h edta as shown in fig 5b when the edta solution was present in the mo solution under light irradiation the exhibited rate constant was as similar as without its presence which was 0 049 min 1 implying that the h was not the main source for the oh radicals production and therefore the degradation process did not cease without its presence as there was no direct adsorption within the photocatalyst it was proven that the photocatalytic decolorization of mo mainly occurred via the e o2 route 3 4 3 effect of light fig 5a and b also depict the photocatalytic decolorization of mo dye under uv vis and visible light conditions by tio2 cs mt and tio2 mo saturated cs mt respectively a uv filter was used to cut off the uv radiation leakage and condition the lamp to emit total visible light irradiation the tio2 mo saturated cs mt plates were purposely used so that the only mode of mo decolorization was photocatalysis 42 in order to detect the photosensitization of tio2 by the mo dye 44 46 it was observed in fig 5a that the rate constant and removal efficiency of tio2 cs mt slightly decreased to 0 083 min 1 and 89 1 respectively under visible light as opposed to 0 089 min 1 and 98 3 under uv vis light source similarly in fig 5b the activity of the tio2 mo saturated cs mt photocatalyst shows no much difference when used under the uv vis and visible light irradiation where the rate constant and removal efficiency of the former was 0 045 min 1 and 92 7 respectively while it was 0 045 min 1 and 89 7 respectively for the latter condition the reason could be due to the adsorbed mo dye that can be self sensitized under visible light irradiation where the dye absorbs the light photon directly and then excites the electrons from its homo to lumo level eq 16 as seen in fig 6 a as the band gap of lumo level of mo dye 2 07 ev is more positive relative to the cb edge potential of tio2 4 21 ev the electron transfer from the lumo of the dye to the cb of tio2 becomes feasible 47 49 this eventually caused the photocatalytic activity of the bilayer photocatalyst to be also active under visible light irradiation the electrons can be also used to produce the o2 and oh radicals and degrade all the dye molecules eq 17 50 16 moads hv vis moads 17 moads tio2 moads tio2 e the results as presented by both figures mean that the o2 gas and o2 ions were the main species involved in the photocatalytic decolorization of mo by tio2 cs mt whereby in their absence the production of oh radicals was suppressed and subsequently led to a decrement in the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst 3 5 mechanism of tio2 cs mt photocatalysis adsorption processes a layer by layer photocatalyst was designed in order to remove the pollutant via dual processes of adsorption by the adsorbent sub layer while being photocatalytically oxidized by the porous tio2 on the top layer it has been accepted that tio2 plays the main role in the photocatalytic decolorization of pollutants while cs mt is a good adsorbent of mo since tio2 cs mt is made up of the photocatalyst and the adsorbent the photocatalysis and adsorption processes occur simultaneously upon irradiation by light as observed in fig 6b when light was irradiated over the mo dye some of the dye molecules would be photocatalytically oxidized on the tio2 top layer route i some molecules would diffuse into the cs mt sub layer through the tio2 top layer route ii due to high electrostatic attraction between the so3 groups of the dye and the cs mt sub layer 18 nh3 r r so3 r so3 nh3 r based on the identified active species in previous section the degradation of mo by this tio2 cs mt would not occur through the h oh route at the vb of tio2 instead the reaction of the excited electrons with the o2 at the cb of tio2 would produce the oxidative radical ions o2 ho2 and h2o2 which were converted to the oh radicals 42 in addition the adsorbed mo dye at the tio2 surface and within the cs mt sub layer became a photosensitizer for tio2 under visible light irradiation at this point the excited electrons at the lumo level of mo dye were transferred to the cb of tio2 and reacted with the o2 to produce more oh radicals route iii the mo radicals could also react with the o2 and oh ions to be converted to the mineralization products 51 52 19 mo mo o2 oh mineralization products the cs mt would continuously adsorb the mo dye until the concentration of mo in the bulk solution decreased and ceased the adsorbed mo molecules within the cs mt sub layer would then migrate to the interface of tio2 route iv where they would be oxidized by the oh radicals at the interface of tio2 and were mineralized into the harmless compounds such as co2 h2o and mineral acids this process continued until all the mo molecules were fully oxidized and mineralized by the photocatalyst apparently the presence of cs mt as the sub layer increased the concentration of mo near the tio2 surface and increased the possible chances of the dye molecules to collide and remain in contact with tio2 nanoparticles for further reaction without the cs mt sub layer the process of concentrating the pollutant molecules could be harder since the dye molecules adsorbed poorly on the tio2 surface 18 moreover the dye molecules would diffuse back into the bulk solution and overcome the mass transfer again to collide with tio2 which eventually would decrease the decolorization rate and efficiency 53 3 6 detection of intermediates and photocatalytic mineralization mechanism the photocatalytic decolorization of the mo dye during the treatment is a result of the oxidative attack on its chromophore nn which cleavages the two aromatic rings on the parent structure 16 17 however a colorless solution does not mean a full mineralization has been executed as an amount of suitable energy is required to break down the parent structure from its aromatic ring to the aliphatic chain small compound 18 19 for instance the energy required to break the cn bond 305 kj mol 1 is smaller as compared with the nn bonding 418 kj mol 1 54 after the mechanistic of mo photocatalytic decolorization by tio2 cs mt was understood the mineralization pathway of the dye was further investigated using the lc ms instrument in the negative mode the mo solution was obtained after 1 h of treatment under uv vis light by tio2 cs mt for this experiment two batches of eluents namely phosphate buffer methanol and acetonitrile water were used respectively to detect the intermediates using the same mo treated solution fig 7 a shows the lc ms chromatogram in a 20 min full scan and the main peaks of degradation products present in the treated mo solution when using phosphate buffer methanol mobile phase whereas the proposed mechanism pathway is shown in fig 7b the peaks of m z 309 and 304 are the parent molecules of mo after losing na due to dissolution in aqueous solution in the form of hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated species respectively the main difference of both species is that the ch3 in the former species was replaced by the h bonding at both endings of n atom furthermore the substitution of h atom by the hydroxyl groups at the ortho and meta positions to the n atom and so3 group of the aromatic rings respectively formed the hydroxylated parent molecule of mo 20 the initial dissociation after the oxidative attack was the elimination of a hydroxyl and an alkyl group from the parent molecules which gave the m z 293 and 290 peaks respectively the species with m z 293 lost the second hydroxyl group and produced the m z 277 species for the 290 species the nch3 bonding became weaker due to electron withdrawing of the alkyl group thus it was easy to lose another ch3 group by the second attack of the active radicals at this point the nh2 was then taken off by the radicals which produced the m z 261 species the aromatic ring which was bonded with the azo bond of the latter species was broken down to m z 253 species and then the m z 233 species it was assumed that more oh radicals were required to break the aromatic bonding into the aliphatic chain form the oh groups were taken off from the end of azo bond which essentially produced the m z 217 and 199 species the nn bond was the most reactive bonding in the m z 199 species containing two set of lone pairs and could be easily attacked by the oh radicals to form the m z 159 species the continuous attack by the oh radicals on the m z 159 species broke down the bonding and obtained the co2 h2o and hso4 species with m z 97 as the final products at the end of the degradation process for the acetonitrile water eluent the lc ms spectrum for the intermediates produced and the proposed mechanism pathway can be referred to fig 8 a and b respectively the degradation proceeded in a straightforward pathway since no hydroxylated products were detected in this type of eluent which was in contrast with the intermediates detected using the phosphate methanol eluent that consist of a mixture of hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated species such chromatographic behavior was likely influenced by the structure of the species involved as well as the interactions between the mobile phase and the n containing moieties together with the so3 group 20 similarly as the phosphate methanol eluent the initial oxidative attack on the nonhydroxylated parent molecule of m z 304 subsequently lost both of the ch3 groups at the end of the n atom of one of the aromatic ring to form the m z 290 and m z 276 species the ring containing ch3 group is an electron donor and an ortho directing activators it also contains the negatively charged molecule from the fragmentation process which induced such type of substitution involving an internal hydrogen bond and the engagement of the lone electron pairs on the nch3 groups 20 the dissociation of the m z 233 species by the oh radicals broke down the nn bond from the adjacent aromatic rings to form the m z 157 and 173 species where the latter species then further dissociated to m z 119 species after the elimination of an alkyl group at this stage the n n bonding would be reduced to form the no3 ions or n2 gas during the ring opening process the benzene ring and the branched chains linking to the benzene ring were shorter and more stable at this point the radical species reached a high level in the solution in order to break the benzene ring to the aliphatic chains and finally reached a complete oxidation process to form the harmless compounds 55 both mineralization mechanism pathways produced much smaller aliphatic chain compounds to hso4 co2 and h2o as the end products of mo dye oxidation therefore it can be concluded that the oxidation process proceeded in three stages which are bond breaking by the oxidation process ring opening process and complete oxidation process to harmless compounds 46 table 2 tabulates various photocatalysts and their identified intermediates of mo dye it was observed that different intermediates of mo were produced by different photocatalysts degradation conditions and chromatographic separation modes the degradation process that used very high energy such as microwave uv and gamma radiation could break the aromatic ring more easily even at high concentration with smaller structures were predominantly observed as the corresponding intermediates however due to the cost environmental and user friendly concern the degradation assisted photocatalyst catalyst is more favorable than the radiation type process as shown in table 2 the m z 290 and 276 species frequently appeared during the early stage of mo degradation due to the weak bond energy of cn which became the easiest target for the oh radicals attack 37 moreover the difference in the intermediate species detection for each degradation systems suggests that the proposed mineralization pathway of mo is highly dependent on the type of the photocatalysts degradation conditions as well as the chromatographic separation modes this can be seen from the results of the present study which suggests that the identified products of mo degradation by separation instrument could be varied depending on the interaction of eluent species and the degradation products however further investigations are needed to clarify the possible intermediates produced by the affected parameters 4 conclusions the tio2 cs mt photocatalyst operated via the synergy process of adsorption by the cs mt sub layer and photocatalysis by the tio2 top layer was studied successfully the cs mt composite adsorbent was stronger mechanically and swelled less than the cs adsorbent minimal loss of cs mt on the plates was observed for all the plates due to strong adherence of the positively charged amino group of cs to the negatively charged surface of the glass plate in the presence of mt clay faster photocatalytic decolorization of mo dye was observed for tio2 cs mt as compared to tio2 photocatalyst for 90 min of treatment the maximum photocatalytic decolorization of mo by the tio2 cs mt photocatalyst was achieved in the presence of o2 gas under uv vis light irradiation due to the important role of o2 as the electron scavenger for radicals production as well as the need of appropriate light wavelength to initiate the electron excitation of tio2 the photocatalytic decolorization of mo occurred via the e o2 route with the assist of adsorption process by the cs mt sub layer and photosensitization of tio2 by the adsorbed mo dye the proposed degradation pathway of mo dye differed with respect to the type of eluent used for separation in lc ms analysis the photocatalytic oxidation process involves three stages which are bond breaking by the oxidation process ring opening process and complete oxidation process to harmless compounds acknowledgments the authors would like to thank universiti sains malaysia for all the provided research facilities to conduct this present study we are also grateful to

14348,the mechanistic of photocatalytic decolorization and mineralization of methyl orange mo dye have been successfully studied using immobilized titanium dioxide chitosan montmorillonite tio2 cs mt a combination of tio2 as the top layer and cs mt as the sub layer on a glass plate the immobilized cs mt film was selected over the cs film since the former adhered stronger and swelled less than the latter which showed its favorability in the aqueous medium this bilayer photocatalyst operated via a simultaneous occurrence of adsorption of mo dye from the cs mt layer and photocatalytic degradation by tio2 layer the bilayer photocatalyst could remove the mo dye from the solution 3 times faster than the single tio2 within 90 min of irradiation under a uv vis lamp due to strong adsorption of mo by the cs mt sub layer the mechanistic study revealed that the degradation occurred via the e o2 route while the lc ms analysis suggested the possible degradation pathway of mo dye it was found that the eluent used for separation of compounds in the lc ms analysis influenced the intermediates detected for which two degradation mechanisms were proposed keywords chitosan montmorillonite degradation

reactive sulfur azo and vat dyes whereby azo dyes are the major units and account for 70 of all the dyestuffs produced 1 the raw materials that are commonly used are hydrocarbons benzene toluene

dimethylaniline and used for dyeing in textile printing pharmaceutical paper manufacturing food industries leather industries and research laboratories 3 4 it has a very short excited state life and is stable in visible and near uv light as one of the azo dye family mo is carcinogenic due to its decomposition to aromatic amines which are hazardous to the aquatic organisms and the food web 5 in

and mt in various cs mt composite forms has been proven to improve the pore size mechanical strength chemical stability hydrophilicity and biocompatibility of cs 12 as generally known the removal of the dyes by sole adsorption process cannot destroy the dye completely as the process is only a liquid solid phase transfer process 13 14 moreover some of the adsorbents are not reusable and even saturated after the dye adsorption which make them costly ineffective since some dyes are very stable in the environment non biodegradable and carcinogenic 15 the cs mt adsorbent should be combined with a photocatalyst such as tio2 so that the dyes can be converted into harmless products the combination can also overcome the tio2 drawback due to its poor adsorption capacity of some pollutants which influences its degradation performance 16 this synergistic photocatalysis adsorption process has shown enhanced photocatalytic performance than the bare tio2 in the removal of various organic contaminants 9 17 19 in general the fundamental of tio2 mediated photocatalysis is based on the electron excitation from the photocatalyst valence band to its conduction band producing the electron hole pairs 20 the electron and hole of tio2 react with o2 and h2o respectively to form the oxidative radicals for degrading the organic compounds at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure 21 however the band gap energy of tio2 lies in the uv region making them inactive under visible light irradiation 22 23 many efforts have been manifested to enable and enlarge the tio2 applications under visible light such as doping with metals nonmetals semiconductors and adsorbents 24 the visible light activity is supported by the enhancement in electrochemical and electronic properties as well as adsorption process throughout the entire photocatalytic oxidation process 25 26 enhanced separation of the charge carriers of tio2 will eventually produce more oxidative radicals to oxidize the organic contaminants moreover some dyes can be self sensitized under visible light irradiation making the dye treatment by tio2 becomes more favorable 27 28 this study combined the tio2 and cs mt composite as an immobilized bilayer photocatalyst to solve the conventional post treatment problem of filtration this type of immobilization assemblage could also overcome the reduction in the exposed surface area after immobilization which frequently slows down the photocatalytic activity the tio2 properties would not be discussed in the present study since the details have been extensively reported by nawi and zain 29 only the physicochemical properties of cs mt sub layer were investigated through several selected tests and analyses the present work hopefully can give an insight into the mechanistic of photocatalytic decolorization by tio2 combined adsorbent as the adsorption of the dye specifically onto the adsorbent is involved as well as predicting the dye mineralization

chemicals were used as received without purification 2 2 preparation of tio2 cs mt plates cs flakes in the range of 0 25 g to 1 25 g of loading were mixed with a fixed amount of mt powder of 0 09 g respectively all the mixtures were dispersed in 50 ml of 5 v v of acetic acid solution by grinding with zirconium beads in a ball mill grinder at the rate of 40 rpm for 6 h in a schott bottle the solutions were cast directly on the glass plates with 4 7 cm 7 0 cm 0 2 cm of dimensions the wet plates were dried in open air and an oven at 100 c for overnight and 2 nights respectively before the dried weight was measured the preparation of the tio2 on the top layer of cs mt has been explained previously by nawi and zain 29 where the tio2 formulation was prepared based on the reported method briefly 6 g of tio2 powder in 100 ml of enr c7h8 and pvc ch2cl2 adhesive blend mixture was sonicated until a homogeneous formulation was obtained the amount of tio2 loading was determined by weighing the plate before and after dip coating where for this study the optimum loading of 2 5 mg cm 2 was coated on the dried cs mt plates 2 3 characterizations the adherence test to determine the strength of the cs and cs mt plates was performed following the reported method 30 the initial weight of the cast plates were measured and they were immersed in a beaker containing water respectively and sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 5 s dried in the oven and weighed the steps were repeated until 30 s meanwhile the swelling study was performed by peeling off the adsorbent film from the glass plate using a razor blade and the film was soaked in 10 ml of water in a vial for 24 h after taken out the wet film was patted slightly with a paper tissue before weighing the adhesiveness and swelling ratio of the polymer adsorbents are calculated using the following equations 1 a d h e s i v e n e s s w 1 w 2 m x 100 2 s w e l l i n g r a t i o w s w d w d x 100 here w 1 is the initial

is the weight of dried sample the determination of textural properties of the cs and cs mt samples were carried out at 77 k under n2 gas flow using a physisorption analyzer model asap 2010 micrometrics the functional groups of cs and cs mt composites were identified using a fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy model series 2000 perkin elmer at 650 4000 cm 1 with a resolution of 4 cm 1 while the surface morphology composition and crystallography observations of the samples were done on a high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem jem 2100 f jeol 2 4 photocatalytic reactor set up the photocatalytic reactor in fig 1 was equipped with a 45 watt home fluorescent lamp philips an aquarium pump a pasteur pipette and a pvc tubing the uv leakage of the lamp was measured by a radiometer equipped with uv a and uv b broadband detectors from solar light co pma 2100 the glass cell used in this experiment was 5 cm 8 cm 1 cm of dimensions where the prepared plates were put vertically and the coated area of the plates faced the lamp the directly measured uv leakage of the lamp was 2 78 wm 2 and 1 78 wm 2 with glass cell a total visible light irradiation was conditioned by placing a uv cut off filter in front of the lamp meanwhile the adsorption study was performed using the similar set up in which the glass cell was put into a sealed box and the lamp was taken out the photocatalytic decolorization and adsorption experiments were conducted using 20 ml of 20 mg l 1 of mo solution ambient ph of 6 5 at room temperature 30 c and contact time of 60 min with 15 min of time interval the absorbance of mo solution between each interval was measured using a direct reading spectrophotometer hach dr 2000 at 464 nm the mo removal r and the apparent pseudo first order rate constant k from the langmuir hinshelwood kinetic model were calculated using the following equations respectively 3 r c e c o x 100 4 ln c o c t k t here co ce and ct is the concentration of mo dye mg l 1 at initial equilibrium and time t respectively the k values min 1 can be obtained from the slope of the ln c o c t versus t plot 2 5 mechanism analyses the role of oxygen in the photocatalytic degradation by tio2 cs mt was carried out in the absence of o2 by supplying the n2 gas from the gas tank via a pvc tubing which was connected to the pasteur pipette of the photocatalytic reactor set up the top of the glass cell was covered tightly with a parafilm wrapped around the entrance of the cell to prevent the entry of o2 from the air meanwhile the tio2 mo saturated plate was used for the detection of radical quenchers where the mo was adsorbed onto the cs mt plate until fully saturated before coating with tio2 then about 0 001 m of edta and 1 4 bq solutions were spiked into a 20 ml of 20 mg l 1 mo solution respectively for the intermediates detection the plate of tio2 cs mt was firstly photo etched for 10 h to eliminate any interferences especially from the degradation of polymer binder within tio2 the samples for lc ms analysis were collected after 1 h of irradiation of the mo solution the analysis was done on a lc ms instrument from agilent technologies under the flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 using 0 025 m phosphate buffer ph 6 9 methanol 40 60 v v 31 and ultra pure water acetonitrile 50 50 v v as the eluents respectively using a reversed phase column lc 18 supelcosil with dimensions 25 cm 4 6 cm 5 μm from supelco the obtained chromatograms and mass values were evaluated using the mass hunter qualitative analysis b 04 00 software 3 results and discussions 3 1 optimization of cs loading for the fabrication of cs mt sub layer the effect of the amount of cs loading within the cs mt plate is significant since cs can function as bioadhesive and biosorbent 32 in this study the cs mt plates were prepared from the casting solutions consisting of a series of cs flakes amount from 0 25 g to 1 25 g with a fixed mt loading of 0 09 g respectively the purpose of adding mt clay to the cs matrix is to enhance the physicochemical properties of the composite film for extended usage in aqueous environment 33 however only a little amount of mt was added into the casting solution as an excessive amount of the clay would result in the brittleness of the composite film the suitability of this polymer composite adsorbent for an aqueous application was analyzed using the adherence and swelling tests from the test s result in table 1 an increase in the cs amount from 0 25 to 1 25 g within the cs mt plates has significantly increased the mechanical strength of the plates from 94 5 to 97 8 that was likely due to the increasing amount of the positively charged amino groups of cs which facilitated the electrostatic attraction with the negatively charged silicate of the glass plates and subsequently increased the adhesion of cs mt on the plates meanwhile the plate coated with 100 of cs exhibited a mechanical strength of 83 1 after the 30 sec adherence test which shows that 16 9 of cs was lost from the adsorbent initial weight here it was proven that the cs could function as an adhesive and bind very well to the glass plate whereby the strength of the immobilized adsorbent was much better in the presence of mt clay the data for the swelling test of the similar cs mt composition series are tabulated in table 1 the swelling test indicates that for a lower degree of swelling the corresponding plates are more hydrophobic and less hydrophilic and vice versa in this case the increment of the cs amount from 0 25 to 1 25 g within the composite has decreased the swelling ratio of the plates from 77 2 to 33 6 due to the increased hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and amino groups of cs with the silicate groups of mt clay this will reduce the cs mt composite contact with water molecules to become more hydrophobic 34 35 apparently the presence of mt has resulted in a stronger cs composite on the solid support as compared to cs film since the mt clay hardened when it is in contact with water besides the clay also expands the volume and lengthens the distance of water molecules causing the hydrophobicity of the composite 36 as for cs content the plates with higher cs induce stronger cs mt plates as more of the positively charged amino groups can bind to the negatively charged glass plate higher cs can also form less hydrogen bonding with the adsorbed water decreases the swelling properties of the adsorbent thus it is more suitable for longer usage since some of the amino groups of cs are used for the cs mt clay bonding as well as binding with the glass plate an optimum amount of cs flakes is required to obtain the best cs mt plate in term of adherence swelling properties and mo removal efficiency it can be observed that increasing the amount of cs flakes from 0 25 to 0 75 g in the cs mt casting solution has also increased the mo removal by the corresponding cs mt plates from 47 7 to 91 8 the increasing cs loading provides more positively amino groups for the negatively charged mo to bind onto the cs mt composite thus improves its removal ability however increasing the amount of cs over 1 g within the cs mt casting solution decreased the removal efficiency of mo to 44 7 this drastic change is related to the sudden reduction of surface area of the composite adsorbent with higher cs content corresponding to the availability of adsorption sites to adequately bind all the mo molecules herein the best amount of cs flakes at the fixed mt loading in the cs mt casting solution was 0 75 g which is equivalent to 89 of cs within the composite showing the best removal efficiency with comparable mechanical strength and swelling ratio properties as a reference the cs film that was prepared from the 0 75 g cs casting solution only removed 80 2 of mo from the aqueous solution from the surface area perspective the incorporation of mt within the cs matrix has increased the bet surface area from 3 82 to 4 38 m2 g 1 but reduced the pore volume and pore diameter from 8 1 to 7 6 10 2 cm3 g 1 and 8 39 to 6 96 nm respectively however increasing the cs content at fixed mt loading has essentially reduced the surface area of the cs mt composite as well as the pore volume and pore diameter to 2 27 m2 g 1 2 7 10 2 cm3 g 1 and 4 74 nm respectively similar trend can be observed for particle size where the size decreased when the clay was present and then increased with high cs content within the composite from these data it can be deduced that mt clay is a surface modifier which can affect the characteristics of pores while an excessive cs content exhibits inhibitory effect on the properties of the composite s pores nonetheless all the pores either with and without mt samples are categorized as mesopores 2 50 nm according to iupac classification 37 3 2 physical characterizations fig 2 shows the ft ir spectra for the detection of any changes in the functional groups of cs after the mt addition the peaks of the main functional groups of cs are 3447 cm 1 1641 cm 1 and 1559 cm 1 which correspond to the overlapping of the nh and oh stretching vibrations amide i and amide ii respectively 38 after becoming the composite a broad peak at around 3410 3480 cm 1 is observed that relates to the overlapping of nh and oh stretching vibrations of cs and oh groups of silanol of mt 11 39 the appearance of a new peak at 1559 cm 1 of cs mt composite is detected due to the bending vibration of nh2 of amide ii within the cs structure the morphology of cs and cs mt surface were then taken under a high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem and the corresponding micrographs are shown in fig 2 the cs flakes were well dissolved in the acid solution as the cs distribution is homogeneous and no significant particulate can be seen in the micrograph for the cs mt micrograph it can be seen that the mt clay was well distributed throughout the polymer matrix where no agglomeration and aggregation of cs and mt is observed the composite surface seems heterogeneous as the clay particles had occupied the cs matrix 3 3 photocatalysis adsorption processes 3 3 1 uv vis spectral changes the optimized cs mt sub layer was coated with tio2 on the top layer to produce the tio2 cs mt bilayer photocatalyst the photocatalyst was used to treat the mo dye solution under the uv vis light irradiation and was compared with the single tio2 layer the disappearance of mo dye as detected via uv vis spectrophotometer during the photocatalytic decolorization by tio2 cs mt and tio2 photocatalysts are shown in fig 3 a and b respectively the main absorbance peak of mo is at 464 nm in the visible region corresponding to the azo bond of mo which is responsible for the disappearance of its original color while the peak at 268 nm is related to the benzene ring of the dye chromophore 40 it can be observed that the reduction in absorbance at 268 and 464 nm peaks with increasing treatment time corresponds to the breaking of aromatic ring and azo bond of mo respectively that means more mo molecules were being degraded by tio2 cs mt at the same time as by tio2 showing enhanced decolorization of the dye by the former photocatalyst due to the contribution of adsorption process by cs mt sub layer as compared to tio2 3 3 2 reusability the reusability of tio2 cs mt and its counterpart tio2 for the removal of mo under uv vis light irradiation was compared by means of percentage of mo removed as shown in fig 4 high percentage of mo removed means more mo molecules were being degraded by tio2 cs mt leaving less mo remained in the solution in this case the dye treatment by tio2 cs mt in the presence of light showed the best removal followed by the reaction in the dark adsorption and irradiated tio2 the tio2 cs mt under light irradiation removed almost 95 98 of mo throughout the 10 cycles the bilayer photocatalyst could maintain its removal throughout the cycles due to the influence of adsorption of mo by the cs mt sub layer and photocatalytic reaction by the tio2 top layer the adsorbed mo within the adsorption sites of bilayer photocatalyst was removed by the oh radicals continuously at each cycle and therefore similar sites could be provided for the reaction at the next cycle during the treatment in the dark adsorption a good removal of mo was achieved where about 90 of mo were removed at the first three cycles however after the 4th cycle the removal declined continuously from 88 77 until the 10th cycle the reason was due to the saturation of adsorption sites within the tio2 cs mt after the repetitive cycles as the adsorption process did not degrade mo to smaller products as compared to the photocatalytic oxidation 41 therefore the mo molecules continuously filled up remained within and saturated the adsorption sites this event eventually decreased the removal efficiency significantly meanwhile the single tio2 operated under the light irradiation could only remove an average of 30 of mo throughout the ten cycles mainly due to the poor adsorption of mo on the photocatalyst surface 18 3 4 identification of the main species in the photocatalysis adsorption processes a mechanistic study was performed to identify the main active species that are responsible in the photocatalytic adsorption processes of the tio2 cs mt photocatalyst the study used n2 gas for providing an anaerobic condition a uv filter for a total visible light condition and chemical solutions 1 4 benzoquinone 1 4 bq as the superoxide o2 quenchers and edta as the positive holes h quenchers 42 and compared with the normal conditions the mechanism of photocatalysis is well established whereby the production of o2 and h which are responsible for the oh radicals formation are depicted in equation 5 12 31 33 on the tio2 surface the photocatalytic oxidation is initialized when sufficient or greater energy of light than the band gap energy of tio2 eg 3 2 ev is applied whereby the electron in the valence band of tio2 is excited to the conduction band cb and leaving the hole h at the valence band equation 5 at the cb the excited electrons react with the o2 to produce the o2 ho2 and h2o2 radical ions equation 6 10 which then are converted to the oh radicals the photo generated h at the vb will oxidize the h2o molecules eq 11 and oh ions eq 12 at the surface or in the tio2 bulk to produce the oh radicals 5 tio2 hv h e 6 e o2 o2 7 o2 h ho2 hydroperoxyl 8 ho2 ho2 h2o2 o2 9 h2o2 o2 oh oh o2 10 h2o2 e oh oh 11 h h2o oh h 12 h oh oh the efficiency and rate constant of mo removal by the tio2 cs mt photocatalyst under different experimental conditions are presented in fig 5 a while similar parameters were observed using a tio2 mo saturated cs mt photocatalyst in the presence of radicals quenchers as portrayed in fig 5b 3 4 1 effect of n2 gas during the photocatalytic degradation process the excited electron at the cb of tio2 can reduce the adsorbed o2 to the o2 ions eq 6 thus inhibit the possibility of recombination with the h at the vb in order to seek the effect of o2 on the photocatalytic activity of this tio2 cs mtphotocatalyst n2 gas was given to the photocatalytic reactor instead of o2 gas as observed in fig 5a the removal efficiency and rate constant decreased to 91 1 and 0 64 min 1 respectively when n2 gas was present as compared to the control condition with o2 under the uv vis light with 98 3 and 0 089 min 1 respectively the observed percentage of mo removal and rate constant in the presence of n2 gas were still significant due to the contribution of the 87 4 and 0 051 min 1 respectively by adsorption process as compared with 89 6 and 0 051 min 1 respectively in the presence of o2 gas although the n2 gas is inert and does not involve in the photocatalytic reaction the gas can still provide a driving force for the mass transfer of the dye onto the tio2 cs mt and assist in the adsorption process as similar as the removal by o2 that eventually contributes to the high removal and rate constant achieved however no o2 radicals can be generated from the electron excitation process in the presence of n2 gas as it is not an electron scavenger whereby the removal efficiency and rate constant were merely from the adsorption process this shows that the o2 is an important source for the oh radicals production for a complete photocatalytic decolorization of mo dye 3 4 2 effect of radical quenchers in order to identify the production route of oh radicals the tio2 mo saturated cs mt was used the cs mt sub layer was saturated with mo dye before coating tio2 on the top layer to eliminate the adsorption process and ensure that only the active radicals contributed to the photocatalytic decolorization of mo dye in this investigation the 1 4 bq c6h4o2 and edta solutions were spiked into the mo solution containing the saturated plate respectively and irradiated for 60 min when 1 4 bq was present in the dye solution the photocatalytic decolorization of mo slowed down as portrayed by a drop in the rate and percent of mo removed from 0 045 min 1 to 0 033 min 1 and 92 7 to 69 6 respectively during the quenching process 1 4 bq molecule was reduced to the semiquinone radicals eq 13 and in the presence of h ions the semiquinone radicals underwent a reaction with the o2 ions to form the hydroquinone eq 14 this would essentially reduce the amount of o2 forming into the oh radicals and eventually slow down the photocatalytic degradation process on the tio2 top layer 13 c6h4o2 e cb c6h4o2 14 c6h4o2 o2 2h c6h6o2 o2 meanwhile edta is known as a sacrificial electron donor where it can be reduced by the h to become an oxidized edta under light irradiation 43 as shown in eq 15 the consumption of h during the reaction with edta would essentially produce less oh radicals which reduced the photocatalytic efficiency of the photocatalyst 15 edta h edta as shown in fig 5b when the edta solution was present in the mo solution under light irradiation the exhibited rate constant was as similar as without its presence which was 0 049 min 1 implying that the h was not the main source for the oh radicals production and therefore the degradation process did not cease without its presence as there was no direct adsorption within the photocatalyst it was proven that the photocatalytic decolorization of mo mainly occurred via the e o2 route 3 4 3 effect of light fig 5a and b also depict the photocatalytic decolorization of mo dye under uv vis and visible light conditions by tio2 cs mt and tio2 mo saturated cs mt respectively a uv filter was used to cut off the uv radiation leakage and condition the lamp to emit total visible light irradiation the tio2 mo saturated cs mt plates were purposely used so that the only mode of mo decolorization was photocatalysis 42 in order to detect the photosensitization of tio2 by the mo dye 44 46 it was observed in fig 5a that the rate constant and removal efficiency of tio2 cs mt slightly decreased to 0 083 min 1 and 89 1 respectively under visible light as opposed to 0 089 min 1 and 98 3 under uv vis light source similarly in fig 5b the activity of the tio2 mo saturated cs mt photocatalyst shows no much difference when used under the uv vis and visible light irradiation where the rate constant and removal efficiency of the former was 0 045 min 1 and 92 7 respectively while it was 0 045 min 1 and 89 7 respectively for the latter condition the reason could be due to the adsorbed mo dye that can be self sensitized under visible light irradiation where the dye absorbs the light photon directly and then excites the electrons from its homo to lumo level eq 16 as seen in fig 6 a as the band gap of lumo level of mo dye 2 07 ev is more positive relative to the cb edge potential of tio2 4 21 ev the electron transfer from the lumo of the dye to the cb of tio2 becomes feasible 47 49 this eventually caused the photocatalytic activity of the bilayer photocatalyst to be also active under visible light irradiation the electrons can be also used to produce the o2 and oh radicals and degrade all the dye molecules eq 17 50 16 moads hv vis moads 17 moads tio2 moads tio2 e the results as presented by both figures mean that the o2 gas and o2 ions were the main species involved in the photocatalytic decolorization of mo by tio2 cs mt whereby in their absence the production of oh radicals was suppressed and subsequently led to a decrement in the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalyst 3 5 mechanism of tio2 cs mt photocatalysis adsorption processes a layer by layer photocatalyst was designed in order to remove the pollutant via dual processes of adsorption by the adsorbent sub layer while being photocatalytically oxidized by the porous tio2 on the top layer it has been accepted that tio2 plays the main role in the photocatalytic decolorization of pollutants while cs mt is a good adsorbent of mo since tio2 cs mt is made up of the photocatalyst and the adsorbent the photocatalysis and adsorption processes occur simultaneously upon irradiation by light as observed in fig 6b when light was irradiated over the mo dye some of the dye molecules would be photocatalytically oxidized on the tio2 top layer route i some molecules would diffuse into the cs mt sub layer through the tio2 top layer route ii due to high electrostatic attraction between the so3 groups of the dye and the cs mt sub layer 18 nh3 r r so3 r so3 nh3 r based on the identified active species in previous section the degradation of mo by this tio2 cs mt would not occur through the h oh route at the vb of tio2 instead the reaction of the excited electrons with the o2 at the cb of tio2 would produce the oxidative radical ions o2 ho2 and h2o2 which were converted to the oh radicals 42 in addition the adsorbed mo dye at the tio2 surface and within the cs mt sub layer became a photosensitizer for tio2 under visible light irradiation at this point the excited electrons at the lumo level of mo dye were transferred to the cb of tio2 and reacted with the o2 to produce more oh radicals route iii the mo radicals could also react with the o2 and oh ions to be converted to the mineralization products 51 52 19 mo mo o2 oh mineralization products the cs mt would continuously adsorb the mo dye until the concentration of mo in the bulk solution decreased and ceased the adsorbed mo molecules within the cs mt sub layer would then migrate to the interface of tio2 route iv where they would be oxidized by the oh radicals at the interface of tio2 and were mineralized into the harmless compounds such as co2 h2o and mineral acids this process continued until all the mo molecules were fully oxidized and mineralized by the photocatalyst apparently the presence of cs mt as the sub layer increased the concentration of mo near the tio2 surface and increased the possible chances of the dye molecules to collide and remain in contact with tio2 nanoparticles for further reaction without the cs mt sub layer the process of concentrating the pollutant molecules could be harder since the dye molecules adsorbed poorly on the tio2 surface 18 moreover the dye molecules would diffuse back into the bulk solution and overcome the mass transfer again to collide with tio2 which eventually would decrease the decolorization rate and efficiency 53 3 6 detection of intermediates and photocatalytic mineralization mechanism the photocatalytic decolorization of the mo dye during the treatment is a result of the oxidative attack on its chromophore nn which cleavages the two aromatic rings on the parent structure 16 17 however a colorless solution does not mean a full mineralization has been executed as an amount of suitable energy is required to break down the parent structure from its aromatic ring to the aliphatic chain small compound 18 19 for instance the energy required to break the cn bond 305 kj mol 1 is smaller as compared with the nn bonding 418 kj mol 1 54 after the mechanistic of mo photocatalytic decolorization by tio2 cs mt was understood the mineralization pathway of the dye was further investigated using the lc ms instrument in the negative mode the mo solution was obtained after 1 h of treatment under uv vis light by tio2 cs mt for this experiment two batches of eluents namely phosphate buffer methanol and acetonitrile water were used respectively to detect the intermediates using the same mo treated solution fig 7 a shows the lc ms chromatogram in a 20 min full scan and the main peaks of degradation products present in the treated mo solution when using phosphate buffer methanol mobile phase whereas the proposed mechanism pathway is shown in fig 7b the peaks of m z 309 and 304 are the parent molecules of mo after losing na due to dissolution in aqueous solution in the form of hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated species respectively the main difference of both species is that the ch3 in the former species was replaced by the h bonding at both endings of n atom furthermore the substitution of h atom by the hydroxyl groups at the ortho and meta positions to the n atom and so3 group of the aromatic rings respectively formed the hydroxylated parent molecule of mo 20 the initial dissociation after the oxidative attack was the elimination of a hydroxyl and an alkyl group from the parent molecules which gave the m z 293 and 290 peaks respectively the species with m z 293 lost the second hydroxyl group and produced the m z 277 species for the 290 species the nch3 bonding became weaker due to electron withdrawing of the alkyl group thus it was easy to lose another ch3 group by the second attack of the active radicals at this point the nh2 was then taken off by the radicals which produced the m z 261 species the aromatic ring which was bonded with the azo bond of the latter species was broken down to m z 253 species and then the m z 233 species it was assumed that more oh radicals were required to break the aromatic bonding into the aliphatic chain form the oh groups were taken off from the end of azo bond which essentially produced the m z 217 and 199 species the nn bond was the most reactive bonding in the m z 199 species containing two set of lone pairs and could be easily attacked by the oh radicals to form the m z 159 species the continuous attack by the oh radicals on the m z 159 species broke down the bonding and obtained the co2 h2o and hso4 species with m z 97 as the final products at the end of the degradation process for the acetonitrile water eluent the lc ms spectrum for the intermediates produced and the proposed mechanism pathway can be referred to fig 8 a and b respectively the degradation proceeded in a straightforward pathway since no hydroxylated products were detected in this type of eluent which was in contrast with the intermediates detected using the phosphate methanol eluent that consist of a mixture of hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated species such chromatographic behavior was likely influenced by the structure of the species involved as well as the interactions between the mobile phase and the n containing moieties together with the so3 group 20 similarly as the phosphate methanol eluent the initial oxidative attack on the nonhydroxylated parent molecule of m z 304 subsequently lost both of the ch3 groups at the end of the n atom of one of the aromatic ring to form the m z 290 and m z 276 species the ring containing ch3 group is an electron donor and an ortho directing activators it also contains the negatively charged molecule from the fragmentation process which induced such type of substitution involving an internal hydrogen bond and the engagement of the lone electron pairs on the nch3 groups 20 the dissociation of the m z 233 species by the oh radicals broke down the nn bond from the adjacent aromatic rings to form the m z 157 and 173 species where the latter species then further dissociated to m z 119 species after the elimination of an alkyl group at this stage the n n bonding would be reduced to form the no3 ions or n2 gas during the ring opening process the benzene ring and the branched chains linking to the benzene ring were shorter and more stable at this point the radical species reached a high level in the solution in order to break the benzene ring to the aliphatic chains and finally reached a complete oxidation process to form the harmless compounds 55 both mineralization mechanism pathways produced much smaller aliphatic chain compounds to hso4 co2 and h2o as the end products of mo dye oxidation therefore it can be concluded that the oxidation process proceeded in three stages which are bond breaking by the oxidation process ring opening process and complete oxidation process to harmless compounds 46 table 2 tabulates various photocatalysts and their identified intermediates of mo dye it was observed that different intermediates of mo were produced by different photocatalysts degradation conditions and chromatographic separation modes the degradation process that used very high energy such as microwave uv and gamma radiation could break the aromatic ring more easily even at high concentration with smaller structures were predominantly observed as the corresponding intermediates however due to the cost environmental and user friendly concern the degradation assisted photocatalyst catalyst is more favorable than the radiation type process as shown in table 2 the m z 290 and 276 species frequently appeared during the early stage of mo degradation due to the weak bond energy of cn which became the easiest target for the oh radicals attack 37 moreover the difference in the intermediate species detection for each degradation systems suggests that the proposed mineralization pathway of mo is highly dependent on the type of the photocatalysts degradation conditions as well as the chromatographic separation modes this can be seen from the results of the present study which suggests that the identified products of mo degradation by separation instrument could be varied depending on the interaction of eluent species and the degradation products however further investigations are needed to clarify the possible intermediates produced by the affected parameters 4 conclusions the tio2 cs mt photocatalyst operated via the synergy process of adsorption by the cs mt sub layer and photocatalysis by the tio2 top layer was studied successfully the cs mt composite adsorbent was stronger mechanically and swelled less than the cs adsorbent minimal loss of cs mt on the plates was observed for all the plates due to strong adherence of the positively charged amino group of cs to the negatively charged surface of the glass plate in the presence of mt clay faster photocatalytic decolorization of mo dye was observed for tio2 cs mt as compared to tio2 photocatalyst for 90 min of treatment the maximum photocatalytic decolorization of mo by the tio2 cs mt photocatalyst was achieved in the presence of o2 gas under uv vis light irradiation due to the important role of o2 as the electron scavenger for radicals production as well as the need of appropriate light wavelength to initiate the electron excitation of tio2 the photocatalytic decolorization of mo occurred via the e o2 route with the assist of adsorption process by the cs mt sub layer and photosensitization of tio2 by the adsorbed mo dye the proposed degradation pathway of mo dye differed with respect to the type of eluent used for separation in lc ms analysis the photocatalytic oxidation process involves three stages which are bond breaking by the oxidation process ring opening process and complete oxidation process to harmless compounds acknowledgments the authors would like to thank universiti sains malaysia for all the provided research facilities to conduct this present study we are also grateful to

results from at least three independent experiments were calculated using tukey test ibm spss statistics 20 usa microsoft excel software microsoft readings were considered significant when p was 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of lactic acid bacteria in this research using api 50 chl test system isolated test strain was analyzed and weissella viridescens was identified according to 16s rrna sequencing one of the molecular techniques the test isolate had nearly 1452 nucleotides then in consequence of the blast study performed by using the database included in the genbank and eztaxon it was determined that this isolate resembled w viridescens lb37 genbank number km365459 at a high rate 98 24 3 2 three phase partitioning the results of enzyme recovery and protein content in aqueous phases for all of the purification steps were given in fig 1 in the first step of purification with tpp different ratios of t butanol were applied 1 0 25 1 0 0 5 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 5 and 1 0 2 0 for a constant 20 w v ammonium sulfate saturation it was observed that t butanol ensured maximum recovery for laccase enzyme in 1 0 0 25 ratios with maximum fold purification and recovery of 5 62 and 63 92 respectively it was determined that as the butanol ratio increased the amount of purification fold and the recovery of the enzyme activity of the laccase decreased in the second step of tpp the best saturation of the ammonium sulfate concentration was observed for the purification of laccase from w viridescens lb37 in the aqueous phase for this purpose different ratios of ammonium sulphate were applied between 20 and 80 for constant 1 0 25 v v n buthanol saturation the laccase recovery and purification fold were determined as 83 07 and 12 69 respectively in the aqueous phase at 40 saturation of ammonium sulfate with the 1 0 0 25 crude extract t butanol ratio when the ammonium sulfate concentrations were increased the laccase enzyme s recovery was decreased in aqueous phase fig 2 the molecular mass of the purified laccase enzyme from w viridescens lb37 was 23 49 kda in the present study fig 3 the molecular weight of the enzyme was determined as 94 0 kda by using the sds page analysis and comparing with known standard proteins the results showed that purified laccase enzyme had four subunits nadaroglu and tasgin 5 purified laccase from lactarius volemus at 73 08 fold and with 55 6 eu mg specific activity by using using nh4 2so4 precipitation deae cellulose and sephacryl s200 and determined the molecular mass of the enzyme as 20 kda with three subunits in terms of molecular weight our findings are compatible with the results reported in the literature 3 3 xrd studies the xrd patterns of chitosan immobilized laccase and dye immobilized laccase were shown in fig 4 for fe3o4 nanoparticles 2θ 39 35 35 79 42 44 52 81 57 26 and 62 84 correspond to 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 respectively the same peaks were obtained after the immobilization of the laccase and the removal of the dye it was suggested that the structure of the magnetic chitosan nps support material preserved the crystal structure of support material for the crystal structure of the chitosan sample they observed sharp peaks at 10 08 25 85 31 92 46 74 49 46 53 08 and 63 96 and extensive diffraction peaks at 21 with intense reflections in the range of 10 70 25 the characteristic peaks of the chitosan were 9 10 and 19 and 20 in yen et al reported 26 3 4 ft ir studies the ft ir spectrums of chitosan immobilized laccase and dye immobilized laccase were given in fig 5 fig 5 showed the co stretching vibration at 1388 7 cm 1 and the nh vibration at 1637 6 cm 1 characteristic peaks of carbohydrates were observed at 1049 3 cm 1 and 1120 6 cm 1 in fig 5 the peaks of both chitosan and fe3o4 molecules were clearly visible the bond vibration of the cn bond structure of the support material was observed at 1627 9 cm 1 the bands at 1637 6 cm 1 and 1677 9 cm 1 were belonging to the protein structure of the laccase enzyme so the immobilization of laccase enzyme to the magnetic chitosan support material was clearly visible it was also observed that the structure was preserved after the dye removal using immobilized laccase enzyme the broad peak at 3421 9 cm 1 which was present in the chitosan laccase enzyme spectra indicated the presence of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding among the chitosan and laccase enzyme similar results were reported previously by kumari and rath 27 and teli and sheikh 28 3 5 sem and edx analyzes sem and edx images of immobilized laccase enzyme on fe3o4 chitosan nps were shown in fig 6 the sem image showed that the surface of the magnetic chitosan nps support material had a surface area suitable for immobilizing the laccase enzyme in addition it appears that fe3o4 nps was uniformly distributed on the chitosan surface also magnetic chitosan nanoparticles synthesized by nadaroglu and onem 10 and nadaroglu and sonmez 11 were reported to have smooth surfaces and were spherical shaped nanoparticles 3 6 properties of the immobilized laccase the results of the effects of time ph and temperature on the covalent immobilization of laccase enzyme to magnetic chitosan nps support material were given in fig 7 a c the laccase enzyme was immobilized as maximally during 1 h at20 c and ph 6 0 trametes pubescens purified laccase tplac cross linker from white decay fungi was placed on chitosan beads with glutaraldehyde as the reaction time was extended cross linking would be increased leading to an increase in the steric hindrance of the enzyme therefore a suitable crosslinking timewas very important to maintain high laccase activity after immobilization 29 the results of this research supported the results of our study in some researches enzyme immobilization was also performed on the magnetic chitosan using other extension arms such as squaric acid however glutaraldehyde had been found to be more favorable and it supported our findings 19 30 we found that the enzyme was immobilized on magnetic chitosan at a rate of 128 7 mg protein g also in a research immobilization of enzyme was covalently immobilized to magnetic chitosan at the rate of 112 3 mg g and it supported our work 19 in terms of practical applications the immobilized laccase enzyme was used 10 times consecutively for the guaiacol substrate to be oxidized in this experiment laccase covalently immobilized was returned 10 times the activity assay was performed after each recycle and the recovery in the activity of iml lac was given in fig 7d from the results obtained it was determined that the enzyme iml lac retained about 47 of its activity after 10 cycles these results were very important and attractive in terms of industrial applications of laccase enzyme 22 3 7 optimum ph and temperature for free and immobilized laccase the effect of ph was investigated by determining free and immobilized laccase enzyme activity at the range of ph 3 11 at 30 c and the results were shown in fig 8 a the maximum activity for the immobilized laccase which was the same as the free laccase was observed at ph 6 0 when immobilized laccase enzyme activity was compared with free laccase enzyme activity immobilized laccase enzyme was found to have higher activity in general this result indicated the preferred ph suitability for immobilized laccase the effect of the temperature on the activity was studied at ph 6 0 between 10 and 80 c fig 8b showed that the optimum temperature for the immobilized and free laccase was 30 c it had been found that the immobilized enzyme had higher activity than the free enzyme also immobilized laccase had better heat resistance than the free laccase 3 8 ph stability fig 9 showed the ph stability of the free and immobilized laccase during the one week test at ph 3 11 when the optimum ph was selected ph 6 0 for the comparison of f lac and iml lac it was determined that iml lac enzyme activity lost only about 15 while losing approximately 30 of the free enzyme after 7 days from the results obtained it was concluded that the immobilized enzyme was more suitable for storage and that the enzyme iml lac could be used for a longer time in industrial area 23 31 32 overall the immobilized laccase suffered less interference from the external environment than free laccase and possessed higher tolerance to acidic and alkali conditions and thus wider applicability in catalysis 29 3 9 thermal stability fig 10 showed the thermal stability of the free and immobilized laccase enzyme during the 2 h test at all temperatures 10 80 c when the highest temperature of 80 c was selected for the comparison of f lac and iml lac it was determined that at the end of 2 h about 67 of the activity of the free enzyme was lost while the lost of iml lac enzyme activity was only about 20 these results might be the functional properties of the fe3o4 chitosan nps support material this predicted stability was very important in terms of the practical use of the iml lac enzyme 10 11 21 similar results have been presented in the literature for purified laccase from the white rot fungus trametes pubescens immobilized from on chitosan beads grafted with the natural cross linker genipin after immobilization the stability of the laccase was significantly increased at the tested temperature with an optimum temperature of 55 c compared with 50 c for free laccase 33 3 10 vmax and km vmax and km kinetic parameters of free and immobilized laccase were determined using guaicol pyrogallol dimethoxyphenol and abts as substrates lineweaver burk plots were plotted for activity of each substrate at concentrations ranging from 0 15 to 2 7 mm and vmax and km values were calculated from these plots the results obtained were given in table 1 from the obtained results it was determined that the vmax and km values for all of the substrates were very close to each other for the free and the immobilized enzyme these results indicated that the active center of immobilized enzyme was not affected by enzyme immobilization onto mag cts nps the values of vmax km were also reported in table 2 for easy comparison of the catalytic efficiency of each enzyme substrate system these values ranged between 8 and 208 for free enzyme and between 21 and 302 for immobilized laccase the dimetoxyphenol was the substrate towards which the free and immobilized laccase had the highest catalytic efficiency the lower value of the ratio vmax km of the pyrogallol was tied to a possible effect of steric hindrance due to the presence of substituents 3 11 decolorization study for some synthetic dyes decolorization of reactive black 5 evans blue tripan blue and direct blue 15 synthetic dyes using free and immobilized laccase enzymes were investigated and the results were shown in fig 11 a d for this purpose azo dyes were removed using f lac and imb lac enzymes in addition the same experiments were performed by adding h2o2 to reaction mixtures with the f lac and imb lac enzymes all experiments were conducted against the blind experiment prepared by adding pure water instead of enzyme fig 11a d from the results obtained it was determined that the removal of the rb5 dye resulted in removal of the immobilized enzyme by 73 while the free enzyme provided at about 32 removal after the addition of h2o2 rb5 dye was removed in rate of 93 and 95 by f lac and imb lac respectively similar results were obtained for db15 eb and ar37 azo dyes the highest removal rates were obtained for f lac against ar37 dye at rate of 97 and rb5 db15 eb and dye removal of immobilized enzyme were also determined to be 93 95 and 96 respectively the effectiveness of imb lac on decolorizing the dyes was decreased in the order ar37 eb db15 rb5 respectively it was believed that the high yield determined against the ar37 dye was caused by the amino groups of the azo dye in the structure because enzyme fixed by binding to the ar37 it was facilitated the hydrolysis of azo dye 34 35 3 12 mechanism of degradation of azo dyes the removal mechanisms of rb4 eb db5 and ar37 azo dyes using imb lac were given in fig 12 the structure of rb5 was symmetrical connected to azo group rb5 azo dye were oxidized in two steps by radical reaction mechanism with the reduction of cu ii to cu i which was situated in the active center of laccase enzyme subsequently it was degraded to benzene and naphthalene by deamination and sulfonation eb and db5 azo dyes were also symmetrical structures connected via azo group however the middle part was composed of 3 3dimethylbiphenyl in eb and 3 3 dimethoxybiphenyl in db5 both azo dyes could be degraded to 3 3 dimethylbiphenyl and 3 3 dimethoxybiphenyl end products by the same mechanistic mechanism ar37 was connected to a single azo group oh in the azo dye which was bound to napthol group was turned to keto group with radical mechanism and azo group was transformed to radical when ar37 azo dye was degraded to laccase catalyze it was decomposed to benzene and naphthalene the degradation mechanism of azo dyes such as c i reactive red 2 orange ii and c i reactive black 8 36 c i acid red 337 direct blue 71 reactive red 198 acid red 2 37 also supported the proposed degradation mechanism in our study 38 40 fig 12 4 conclusion this research has provided an insight in to the removal capacity of the laccase immobilized onto magnetic chitosan nps for different types of toxic azo dyes laccase enzyme was purified from w viridescens lb37 using the tpp system and it was covalently immobilized to the chitosan support material which was magnetized by modifying with fe3o4 nps through the l glutaraldehyde intermediate and it used for remediation of azo dyes from waste water study results showed that the optimum conditions for a reduction of 50 mg l of the dyes with an efficiency of in the range of 94 96 was obtained under ph 6 contact time of 60 min and at a temperature of 30 c thus the results show that enzymatic remediation of ar37 rb5 eb and db15 dyes by the immobilized laccase was influenced by various parameters such as ph contact time and temperature such that dye removal efficiency had direct relationship according to the results obtained the immobilization performance of laccase enzyme was very satisfactory the imb lac enzyme could be used for removal of synthetic azo dyes from waste water and it was also thought to be very effective for use as biocatalyst for continuous decolorization of textile dyes in different sectors of industrial and

10 20 afterward the products were magnetically separated and washed with the same buffer for removing un immobilized laccase enzyme 2 7 characterization the x ray diffraction xrd measurements were carried out with a analytical empyrean x ray diffractometer uk instrument x ray diffraction method xrd was based on the fact that each crystal differed in a characteristic order of x rays depending on the atomic sequences of the phase for each crystalline phase these diffraction profiles defined a crystal such as a fingerprint the crystalline index icr was calculated from normalized diffractograms

results from at least three independent experiments were calculated using tukey test ibm spss statistics 20 usa microsoft excel software microsoft readings were considered significant when p was 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of lactic acid bacteria in this research using api 50 chl test system isolated test strain was analyzed and weissella viridescens was identified according to 16s rrna sequencing one of the molecular techniques the test isolate had nearly 1452 nucleotides then in consequence of the blast study performed by using the database included in the genbank and eztaxon it was determined that this isolate resembled w viridescens lb37 genbank number km365459 at a high rate 98 24 3 2 three phase partitioning the results of enzyme recovery and protein content in aqueous phases for all of the purification steps were given in fig 1 in the first step of purification with tpp different ratios of t butanol were applied 1 0 25 1 0 0 5 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 5 and 1 0 2 0 for a constant 20 w v ammonium sulfate saturation it was observed that t butanol ensured maximum recovery for laccase enzyme in 1 0 0 25 ratios with maximum fold purification and recovery of 5 62 and 63 92 respectively it was determined that as the butanol ratio increased the amount of purification fold and the recovery of the enzyme activity of the laccase decreased in the second step of tpp the best saturation of the ammonium sulfate concentration was observed for the purification of laccase from w viridescens lb37 in the aqueous phase for this purpose different ratios of ammonium sulphate were applied between 20 and 80 for constant 1 0 25 v v n buthanol saturation the laccase recovery and purification fold were determined as 83 07 and 12 69 respectively in the aqueous phase at 40 saturation of ammonium sulfate with the 1 0 0 25 crude extract t butanol ratio when the ammonium sulfate concentrations were increased the laccase enzyme s recovery was decreased in aqueous phase fig 2 the molecular mass of the purified laccase enzyme from w viridescens lb37 was 23 49 kda in the present study fig 3 the molecular weight of the enzyme was determined as 94 0 kda by using the sds page analysis and comparing with known standard proteins the results showed that purified laccase enzyme had four subunits nadaroglu and tasgin 5 purified laccase from lactarius volemus at 73 08 fold and with 55 6 eu mg specific activity by using using nh4 2so4 precipitation deae cellulose and sephacryl s200 and determined the molecular mass of the enzyme as 20 kda with three subunits in terms of molecular weight our findings are compatible with the results reported in the literature 3 3 xrd studies the xrd patterns of chitosan immobilized laccase and dye immobilized laccase were shown in fig 4 for fe3o4 nanoparticles 2θ 39 35 35 79 42 44 52 81 57 26 and 62 84 correspond to 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 respectively the same peaks were obtained after the immobilization of the laccase and the removal of the dye it was suggested that the structure of the magnetic chitosan nps support material preserved the crystal structure of support material for the crystal structure of the chitosan sample they observed sharp peaks at 10 08 25 85 31 92 46 74 49 46 53 08 and 63 96 and extensive diffraction peaks at 21 with intense reflections in the range of 10 70 25 the characteristic peaks of the chitosan were 9 10 and 19 and 20 in yen et al reported 26 3 4 ft ir studies the ft ir spectrums of chitosan immobilized laccase and dye immobilized laccase were given in fig 5 fig 5 showed the co stretching vibration at 1388 7 cm 1 and the nh vibration at 1637 6 cm 1 characteristic peaks of carbohydrates were observed at 1049 3 cm 1 and 1120 6 cm 1 in fig 5 the peaks of both chitosan and fe3o4 molecules were clearly visible the bond vibration of the cn bond structure of the support material was observed at 1627 9 cm 1 the bands at 1637 6 cm 1 and 1677 9 cm 1 were belonging to the protein structure of the laccase enzyme so the immobilization of laccase enzyme to the magnetic chitosan support material was clearly visible it was also observed that the structure was preserved after the dye removal using immobilized laccase enzyme the broad peak at 3421 9 cm 1 which was present in the chitosan laccase enzyme spectra indicated the presence of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding among the chitosan and laccase enzyme similar results were reported previously by kumari and rath 27 and teli and sheikh 28 3 5 sem and edx analyzes sem and edx images of immobilized laccase enzyme on fe3o4 chitosan nps were shown in fig 6 the sem image showed that the surface of the magnetic chitosan nps support material had a surface area suitable for immobilizing the laccase enzyme in addition it appears that fe3o4 nps was uniformly distributed on the chitosan surface also magnetic chitosan nanoparticles synthesized by nadaroglu and onem 10 and nadaroglu and sonmez 11 were reported to have smooth surfaces and were spherical shaped nanoparticles 3 6 properties of the immobilized laccase the results of the effects of time ph and temperature on the covalent immobilization of laccase enzyme to magnetic chitosan nps support material were given in fig 7 a c the laccase enzyme was immobilized as maximally during 1 h at20 c and ph 6 0 trametes pubescens purified laccase tplac cross linker from white decay fungi was placed on chitosan beads with glutaraldehyde as the reaction time was extended cross linking would be increased leading to an increase in the steric hindrance of the enzyme therefore a suitable crosslinking timewas very important to maintain high laccase activity after immobilization 29 the results of this research supported the results of our study in some researches enzyme immobilization was also performed on the magnetic chitosan using other extension arms such as squaric acid however glutaraldehyde had been found to be more favorable and it supported our findings 19 30 we found that the enzyme was immobilized on magnetic chitosan at a rate of 128 7 mg protein g also in a research immobilization of enzyme was covalently immobilized to magnetic chitosan at the rate of 112 3 mg g and it supported our work 19 in terms of practical applications the immobilized laccase enzyme was used 10 times consecutively for the guaiacol substrate to be oxidized in this experiment laccase covalently immobilized was returned 10 times the activity assay was performed after each recycle and the recovery in the activity of iml lac was given in fig 7d from the results obtained it was determined that the enzyme iml lac retained about 47 of its activity after 10 cycles these results were very important and attractive in terms of industrial applications of laccase enzyme 22 3 7 optimum ph and temperature for free and immobilized laccase the effect of ph was investigated by determining free and immobilized laccase enzyme activity at the range of ph 3 11 at 30 c and the results were shown in fig 8 a the maximum activity for the immobilized laccase which was the same as the free laccase was observed at ph 6 0 when immobilized laccase enzyme activity was compared with free laccase enzyme activity immobilized laccase enzyme was found to have higher activity in general this result indicated the preferred ph suitability for immobilized laccase the effect of the temperature on the activity was studied at ph 6 0 between 10 and 80 c fig 8b showed that the optimum temperature for the immobilized and free laccase was 30 c it had been found that the immobilized enzyme had higher activity than the free enzyme also immobilized laccase had better heat resistance than the free laccase 3 8 ph stability fig 9 showed the ph stability of the free and immobilized laccase during the one week test at ph 3 11 when the optimum ph was selected ph 6 0 for the comparison of f lac and iml lac it was determined that iml lac enzyme activity lost only about 15 while losing approximately 30 of the free enzyme after 7 days from the results obtained it was concluded that the immobilized enzyme was more suitable for storage and that the enzyme iml lac could be used for a longer time in industrial area 23 31 32 overall the immobilized laccase suffered less interference from the external environment than free laccase and possessed higher tolerance to acidic and alkali conditions and thus wider applicability in catalysis 29 3 9 thermal stability fig 10 showed the thermal stability of the free and immobilized laccase enzyme during the 2 h test at all temperatures 10 80 c when the highest temperature of 80 c was selected for the comparison of f lac and iml lac it was determined that at the end of 2 h about 67 of the activity of the free enzyme was lost while the lost of iml lac enzyme activity was only about 20 these results might be the functional properties of the fe3o4 chitosan nps support material this predicted stability was very important in terms of the practical use of the iml lac enzyme 10 11 21 similar results have been presented in the literature for purified laccase from the white rot fungus trametes pubescens immobilized from on chitosan beads grafted with the natural cross linker genipin after immobilization the stability of the laccase was significantly increased at the tested temperature with an optimum temperature of 55 c compared with 50 c for free laccase 33 3 10 vmax and km vmax and km kinetic parameters of free and immobilized laccase were determined using guaicol pyrogallol dimethoxyphenol and abts as substrates lineweaver burk plots were plotted for activity of each substrate at concentrations ranging from 0 15 to 2 7 mm and vmax and km values were calculated from these plots the results obtained were given in table 1 from the obtained results it was determined that the vmax and km values for all of the substrates were very close to each other for the free and the immobilized enzyme these results indicated that the active center of immobilized enzyme was not affected by enzyme immobilization onto mag cts nps the values of vmax km were also reported in table 2 for easy comparison of the catalytic efficiency of each enzyme substrate system these values ranged between 8 and 208 for free enzyme and between 21 and 302 for immobilized laccase the dimetoxyphenol was the substrate towards which the free and immobilized laccase had the highest catalytic efficiency the lower value of the ratio vmax km of the pyrogallol was tied to a possible effect of steric hindrance due to the presence of substituents 3 11 decolorization study for some synthetic dyes decolorization of reactive black 5 evans blue tripan blue and direct blue 15 synthetic dyes using free and immobilized laccase enzymes were investigated and the results were shown in fig 11 a d for this purpose azo dyes were removed using f lac and imb lac enzymes in addition the same experiments were performed by adding h2o2 to reaction mixtures with the f lac and imb lac enzymes all experiments were conducted against the blind experiment prepared by adding pure water instead of enzyme fig 11a d from the results obtained it was determined that the removal of the rb5 dye resulted in removal of the immobilized enzyme by 73 while the free enzyme provided at about 32 removal after the addition of h2o2 rb5 dye was removed in rate of 93 and 95 by f lac and imb lac respectively similar results were obtained for db15 eb and ar37 azo dyes the highest removal rates were obtained for f lac against ar37 dye at rate of 97 and rb5 db15 eb and dye removal of immobilized enzyme were also determined to be 93 95 and 96 respectively the effectiveness of imb lac on decolorizing the dyes was decreased in the order ar37 eb db15 rb5 respectively it was believed that the high yield determined against the ar37 dye was caused by the amino groups of the azo dye in the structure because enzyme fixed by binding to the ar37 it was facilitated the hydrolysis of azo dye 34 35 3 12 mechanism of degradation of azo dyes the removal mechanisms of rb4 eb db5 and ar37 azo dyes using imb lac were given in fig 12 the structure of rb5 was symmetrical connected to azo group rb5 azo dye were oxidized in two steps by radical reaction mechanism with the reduction of cu ii to cu i which was situated in the active center of laccase enzyme subsequently it was degraded to benzene and naphthalene by deamination and sulfonation eb and db5 azo dyes were also symmetrical structures connected via azo group however the middle part was composed of 3 3dimethylbiphenyl in eb and 3 3 dimethoxybiphenyl in db5 both azo dyes could be degraded to 3 3 dimethylbiphenyl and 3 3 dimethoxybiphenyl end products by the same mechanistic mechanism ar37 was connected to a single azo group oh in the azo dye which was bound to napthol group was turned to keto group with radical mechanism and azo group was transformed to radical when ar37 azo dye was degraded to laccase catalyze it was decomposed to benzene and naphthalene the degradation mechanism of azo dyes such as c i reactive red 2 orange ii and c i reactive black 8 36 c i acid red 337 direct blue 71 reactive red 198 acid red 2 37 also supported the proposed degradation mechanism in our study 38 40 fig 12 4 conclusion this research has provided an insight in to the removal capacity of the laccase immobilized onto magnetic chitosan nps for different types of toxic azo dyes laccase enzyme was purified from w viridescens lb37 using the tpp system and it was covalently immobilized to the chitosan support material which was magnetized by modifying with fe3o4 nps through the l glutaraldehyde intermediate and it used for remediation of azo dyes from waste water study results showed that the optimum conditions for a reduction of 50 mg l of the dyes with an efficiency of in the range of 94 96 was obtained under ph 6 contact time of 60 min and at a temperature of 30 c thus the results show that enzymatic remediation of ar37 rb5 eb and db15 dyes by the immobilized laccase was influenced by various parameters such as ph contact time and temperature such that dye removal efficiency had direct relationship according to the results obtained the immobilization performance of laccase enzyme was very satisfactory the imb lac enzyme could be used for removal of synthetic azo dyes from waste water and it was also thought to be very effective for use as biocatalyst for continuous decolorization of textile dyes in different sectors of industrial and
