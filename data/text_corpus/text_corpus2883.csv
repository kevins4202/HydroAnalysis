14415,new methodologies for recovering metals in wastewater are important in the control and treatment of industrial effluents as well as in the remediation of contaminated environments the removal of metallic ions using liquid membranes is a technology already used in industrial processes and it can be adapted for the treatment of effluents and for bioremediation in this context the production of biosurfactant membranes to substitute the use of synthetic surfactants is a possibility due to the adequacy of liquid membrane use for treating effluents containing toxic metal this research approaches the economics of mn ii removal from contaminated water using liquid membranes of a biosurfactant produced in loco containing d2ehpa edta h2so4 and nacl different compositions of emulsion liquid membrane of biosurfactant elmb were tested n 35 the optimisation of the elmb system was obtained using an artificial neural network ann and heuristic optimisation using artificial bee colony optimisation abcoptim that reported good results r 2 0 76 in the manganese removal simulation the treatment with elmb was demonstrated to be fast economic and efficacious in mn ii ion removal from wastewater removing more than 77 of mn ii ions in 2 min of contact time at a total of cost of 51 62 usd m3 of effluent keywords manganese biosurfactant emulsion liquid membrane treatment economic 1 introduction heavy metals enter the environment through natural and anthropogenic processes the anthropogenic processes include the activities of mining smelting welding alloy production and pesticide use in natural processes volcanic activities are known to liberate heavy metals into the environment 1 4 manganese mn is an essential element for vegetal and animal growth however high concentrations show toxic characteristics in humans animals and plants according to the world health organization who the limit of manganese concentration for humans is 0 05 mg l in humans excess mn can cause disturbances in the central nervous system as well as anaemia parkinson s disease and pulmonary disease in other living organisms such as crustaceans and plants excess manganese can cause ca2 pump dysfunction and negative effects in growth respectively 5 12 anthropogenic emission is responsible for a huge portion of soil and hydro resource contamination including that in subterranean and superficial water manganese ions are present in several industrial wastewaters such as those of textile industries presenting concentrations of 100 200 mg l and those of hydrometallurgical processes with concentrations of 2 5 g l in mine draining processes the concentration of manganese ions in the basin is near 200 mg l 13 15 several techniques are traditionally used in heavy metal removal such as adsorption ionic exchange extraction using solvents and chemical precipitation among others however these processes have some limitations in an ionic exchange process for example resin incrustation can occur which should be regenerated generating secondary pollution chemical precipitation generates in process slush which requires an adequate final environmental destination and is not the best recommended technique for treatment of low concentrations of mn due to the co precipitation of other metals in the partial recuperation process increasing the expense with general inputs extraction with the use of a solvent presents difficulties of emulsification and manipulation of volatile toxic solvents among other difficulties 16 18 to overcome these barriers new technology like the emulsion liquid membrane elm which appears to be an efficient alternative with low operational cost and economies of time and high selectivity has already been described in the literature for the removal of several metallic ions such as copper cadmium cobalt vanadium arsenic lead and chromium 19 25 the elm process was proposed by li in 1968 with the objective of separating hydrocarbons 26 however this technique is not restricted just to the separation of organic compounds but also extends to heavy metal removal from effluents there are studies directed towards organic compound removal such as the work by abbassian and kargari 27 wherein the elm technique in phenol removal was utilised in addition other researchers have investigated heavy metal removal using the elm technique ahmad et al 22 studied the removal of cadmium ions present in an aqueous solution using the elm technique and lend 18 studied the removal of lead from printed circuit board effluent using a surfactant emulsion membrane demonstrating the treatment as an efficacious method to remove heavy metals the elm technique is composed of three phases the membrane phase internal phase and external phase in an elm system the primary emulsion is first obtained or formed by an organic solvent a carrier and the addition of surfactant to stabilise the emulsion then this emulsion is set in contact with the external phase under agitation so that the extraction process occurs the metallic ions that are present in a metallic solution form a complex with the extraction agent and this complex is transferred through the phase to the interface of the organic stripping phase where it is encapsulated 19 28 29 the elm is considered an extraction process of extreme complexity and the existing models do not completely describe the effect of the process parameters temperature relation of phase volume additives and emulsification process that exhibit nonlinear behaviour this complex system of removal can be evaluated using an artificial neural network ann this method is based on the operation of the brain in that the neurons are interconnected with each other composing a network system with several functions the ann shows characteristics of self learning and self adaptability which make this methodology adequate and advantageous to describe complex systems with nonlinear behaviour 30 35 although the elm technique is promising in metallic ion removal of effluents the chemical surfactant used as a stabiliser of the emulsion presents a high cost and can cause environmental damage associated with its production and disposal the substitution of this commercial surfactant with a compound produced by biological synthesis becomes an alternative solution for the associated environmental problems and economics the biosurfactant produced from microorganisms such as bacteria fungi and yeasts presents emulsifier characteristics biodegradability low toxicity and low production costs that make this an attractive solution to compose the elm system 36 37 more specifically the rhamnolipids are a class of biosurfactants produced from low cost renewable sources and they form microemulsions and nano emulsions for distinct conditions of thermic treatments saline concentrations and ph 38 41 thus the present work evaluates manganese ion removal using an elm system with a biosurfactant economically produced in loco which has not yet been explored in the literature the mn ii ion removal process using the emulsion liquid membrane of biosurfactant elmb was adjusted using the ann model which is often used to adjust nonlinear systems and followed a case study in optimised conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the elmb was prepared with di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid d2ehpa ethane 1 2 diyldinitrile tetraacetic acid edta sodium chloride nacl sulfuric acid h2so4 kerosene and biosurfactant solution bs produced in loco the d2ehpa was obtained from sigma aldrich and the h2so4 edta nacl and salts for the fermentation medium in production in loco of the biosurfactant nano3 kh2po4 k2hpo4 mgso4 7h2o cacl2 2h2o and fecl3 6h2o were obtained in analytical grade from the companies proquímios and vetec 2 2 biosurfactant solution production to produce bs pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 10145 provided by the tropical cultures collection of the tosello foundation campinas sp was used this microorganism was fermented for 72 h in a fermentation medium composed of 30 0 g l glycerol 6 0 g l nano3 1 0 g l kh2po4 1 0 g l k2hpo4 0 2 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 02 g l cacl2 2h2o and 0 05 g l fecl3 6h2o 37 the biosurfactant produced was evaluated according to the method described by rahman et al 42 in which 2 ml of supernatant from the centrifugation 8000 rpm at 20 min of the fermentation medium and 2 ml of ethyl acetate were vortexed right after 1 ml of the mixture was withdrawn and 4 5 ml of 70 sulfuric acid were added the solution was stirred in a stirrer vortex phoenix ap56 with orbital motion at a speed of 3800 rpm for 2 min followed by heating 100 c for 10 min then 0 1 ml of 3 thioglycolic acid were added and the mixture remained in the absence of light for 3 h after this time the absorbance was determined with a spectrophotometer 420 nm and the rhamnolipid produced was quantified using a calibration curve the emulsification index test described by cooper and goldenberg 43 was also performed to evaluate the biosurfactant production a mixture of 2 ml of centrifuged supernatant was stirred with 2 ml of kerosene for 2 min using a stirrer vortex phoenix ap56 with orbital motion at a speed of 3800 rpm and the emulsification index was measured after 24 h using equation 1 as follows 1 e i e e t 100 where e and et are the height of the emulsified layer and the total height of the mixture in the tub respectively and ei is the emulsification index another test that evaluates biosurfactant production involves measuring the surface tension with a tensiometer as described by the du noüy ring 44 2 3 development of the biosurfactant emulsion liquid membrane fig 1 shows elmb production and mn ii removal the production of elmb is carried out in sequential batch steps of fermentation cell removal and emulsification of the surfactant with other compounds used in membrane formulation and mn ii removal the first step was the biosurfactant production from fermentation in loco of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 10145 bacteria in the membrane formulation the components nacl h2so4 d2ehpa and edta which were dissolved in bs and the organic phase of kerosene in a ratio of 1 1 were mixed with a mechanical stirrer ika rw20 at a speed of 1750 rpm for 15 min the speed condition was obtained by previous tests not presented in this work that evaluated the stability of the emulsion for 15 min of stirring at a stirrer speed variation from 600 to 1800 rpm 18 fig 1 also shows the mechanism of the ion manganese removal in the external feed phase membrane phase and stripping phase the manganese ions presented in the external feed phase pass to the membrane phase forming a complex with the complexing agents d2ehpa and edta sequentially the mn ii ions pass to the stripping phase where the nacl and h2so4 were evaluated in the composition of the stripping solution 2 4 mn ii removal solutions containing 25 200 ppm of mn2 ions were prepared from manganese sulphate heptahydrate mnso4 7h2o different quantities of the prepared emulsions were added under agitation of 130 rpm to each 30 g of solution containing manganese ions the analysis of manganese ions was realised by removing samples in different intervals of contact time lower phase of the membrane the final concentration of the samples was realised using a spectrophotometer of atomic absorption shimadzu model aa 7000 that is equipped with a deuterium background correction lamp and an air acetylene flame this methodology is broadly used in working with heavy metal analysis 47 48 aliquots of 10 ml of diluted mn2 ions were used in the calculation of the manganese ion concentration and the removal was calculated using equation 2 as follows 2 r e m o v a l c i c f c i 100 where ci corresponds to the initial concentration of manganese and cf is the final concentration of the metal after the removal process 2 5 artificial neural network and experimental design the ann descriptive model of manganese ion removal was implemented in the r language with the amore package http cran r project org web packages amore using the values of the input variables and responses which were both previously normalised using the z score standardisation method the ann for manganese ion removal used back propagation to adjust parameters and used three layers input hidden and output layers the synaptic weights associated with the neurons of these layers were adjusted according to the descending gradient method using the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function tansig in the hidden layer and the linear transfer function purelin in the output layer the hidden layer had the number of the neurons of the network adjusted according to the scheme as shown in fig 2 in which the root mean square error rmse measures the magnitude of the mean of the error and can be calculated using equation 3 49 50 3 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i c a l c y i e x p 2 1 2 where y i c a l c represents the predicted value y i e x p is the experimental value and n is the number of tests to obtain the model that describes manganese removal 35 assays were performed with different concentrations of nacl d2ehpa h2so4 and edta at different contact times as described in table 1 2 6 optimal conditions and effect of variables the effects of the variables were obtained using the weight partitioning method described in equation 4 as follows 4 v i j 1 h i w i j k 1 m i w k j l w j i 1 m j 1 h i w i j k 1 m i w k j l w j where vi is the relative effect of the input variable i m and h are the numbers of neurons in the input and hidden layers respectively and iw and lw are the connection weights of the hidden and output layers respectively optimal conditions of the elmb system were obtained using the artificial bee colony optimisation method abcoptim https cran r project org web packages abcoptim abcoptim pdf this method was inspired by the collective intelligence of bee swarms which demonstrate self organisation and the division of tasks as fundamental characteristics the optimisation obtains the global optimum of the process through simulation of the behaviour of bee operators explorers and observers as described in the literature 51 52 3 results and discussion 3 1 biosurfactant production for the biosurfactant emulsion liquid membrane technique fig 3 shows the results of biosurfactant production with reference to the superficial tension the minor tension obtained was 33 mn m for 72 h the superficial tension is an important parameter that evaluates the possibility that in the fermentation the production of rhamnolipid has a concentration equal to or higher than the critical micelle concentration cmc that is desirable in obtaining elmb according to rodrigues et al 53 mono rhamnolipids and di rhamnolipids that are dissolved in demineralised water reduce the superficial tension by up to 25 9 mn m cmc 50 mg l and 33 5 mn m cmc 50 mg l respectively higher rhamnolipid concentrations above the cmc promote a higher stability of elmb and the value of 33 mn m obtained in the present work is approximately the same as that observed of di rhamnolipids in the work described in the literature 53 54 with reference to the emulsification index and biosurfactant concentration biosurfactant production occurs satisfactorily between 48 h and 72 h because in this interval of time the emulsification index et was 100 an emulsification index that is lower than 100 for fermentation times lower than 48 h can be explained by the adaptation of the microorganism in the fermentation medium in the initial phase of this process and the degeneracy of the biosurfactant for periods longer than 72 h lovaglio et al 55 investigated the emulsifying activity of rhamnolipids and obtained an emulsification index of approximately 65 with kerosene for 72 h of fermentation costa et al 56 studied the structure properties and applications of the rhamnolipids and obtained an emulsification index of 100 using kerosene for different surfactant concentrations both values are compatible with the present study table 2 shows a comparative calculation of the cost of production of the biosurfactant produced in loco of the present work and the commercial surfactant span 80 table 2 illustrates that the use of 3 of span 80 as a surfactant has a cost 5 times higher than that of the elm system using biosurfactant produced from microorganisms in the elmb system successful biosurfactant production depends on the development of an inexpensive process and the use of low cost raw materials like cellulose and glycerol as described in the literature as possible sources of low cost biomass 57 58 3 2 artificial neural network model table 3 summarises the best ann model for the experimental data of manganese removal according to the high r 2 values and the residual standard error the accuracy of the ann in predicting future outcomes is satisfactory for the neurons in the hidden layer although an exact equation capable of predicting the number of neurons of the hidden layer does exist the value of 11 neurons obtained in this work is compatible with equation 5 described in the work by zhao et al 60 that estimates 11 neurons 5 n h 2 n p 1 where nh and np correspond to the number of neurons in the hidden layer and number of variables respectively 3 3 influence of the input variables according to the artificial neural network ann and ann artificial bee colony optimisation optimisation of the removal conditions using abcoptim predicted 33 removal under the operating conditions of 3 6 mm of edta 0 49 m h2so4 0 11 m of d2ehpa 2 min of contact time and the absence of nacl experimental validation with the optimised conditions indicated that manganese removal was 36 for a solution containing 100 ppm of mn ii which was in good agreement with the abcoptim results table 4 shows the effects associated with the concentrations of edta d2ehpa nacl and h2so4 and the contact time between the phases in optimised conditions the comparison between these optimised values and the literature is difficult because of the absence of research that describes the experimental conditions however the results can be compared with other systems that used edta nacl h2so4 and d2ehpa with reference to edta the same process forming coordination complexes that are stable with several metallic ions presented the optimal concentration of 3 6 mm in the present work this is lower than that observed by kumbar and kasap 61 in the extraction process of nickel from cobalt which presented a higher extraction efficiency up to 25 mm moreover h2so4 is a compound used in the composition of the stripping solution the optimal value of h2so4 in elm systems is extremely important because high concentrations of acid provoke the increase of hydrogen ions in the internal phase which can reduce the membrane stability 62 in the present work the optimal concentration of h2so4 was 0 49 m which is compatible with that found by lende 18 and mohammed et al 63 which showed the optimal extraction of pb ii contained 0 5 m of h2so4 with relation to d2ehpa this exercises the function of a facilitator in the transport of metallic ions and is identified as a reagent of selective extraction of manganese above other metals such as nickel cobalt and magnesium 64 in this work d2ehpa presents an optimal concentration of 0 11 m a value lower than that found by liu et al 23 in the study of the extraction of vanadium iv which was 10 6 approximately 0 3 m with reference to the stability time of the biosurfactant membrane the elmb system presents the optimal time of 2 min 120 s a value compatible with the half life of 440 495 s found by feng et al 65 with relation to nacl this parameter was studied in the internal phase in the stripping solution 1 m and obtained an extraction of 36 3 of ethylparaben a lower value than the stripping solutions studied by kohli et al 66 this is similar to the work of noah et al 67 in that the nacl presented a lower efficiency as a stripping agent among the agents investigated for chromium removal in the elmb system the obtained absence of nacl in the optimised conditions demonstrated the parameters to have a negative effect in the process of manganese ion removal 3 4 evaluation of biosurfactant emulsion liquid membrane cost table 5 shows that the elmb can be produced at a total cost of 51 62 usd m³ of contaminated water using 32 2 g of the bs solution per 30 g of metallic solution although there are no papers describing the economic aspects of the removal of mn ii the results are satisfactory when compared to the removal processes of other environmental contaminants the total cost of the elmb process is equivalent to 1564 24 usd kg of mn not including the cost of kerosene which can be fully recycled representing a cost that is 13 2 times higher than that described in the literature for the removal of phosphorus 68 69 however the proposed process was economically compatible when compared to the removal of chromium vi containing 0 1 1 mg l of cr vi which presents a cost that is approximately 1 5 higher than that for mn ii removal using the elmb process 70 clearly d2ehpa and h2so4 have the most prominent effect on the cost of production representing 57 and 29 of the total cost of elmb respectively it is also important to note that biosurfactant is produced economically representing only 12 of the total cost of the process the cost of these substances during the process can be reduced by the recovery of d2ehpa which is carried out in industrial processes 3 5 study of optimised conditions fig 4 shows the removal of manganese under optimal conditions at the optimal time 2 min for different emulsion metal solution ratios w w for concentrations of 25 50 100 and 200 ppm the efficiency of mn ii using elmb was investigated in distinct ratios of emulsion to metallic ion solution w w and the results demonstrated values of 30 70 of the removal of mn ii ions in a ratio of 1 1 in the present work at an initial concentration of 25 ppm of mn ii solution manganese ion removal was approximately 77 for a membrane contact time of 2 min in the literature 84 5 mn ii removal was obtained for a 20 ppm initial solution of metal ions at an equilibrium contact time of 120 min using the polyvinyl alcohol pva chitosan adsorption process 71 in this study with an initial concentration of 50 ppm ion mn ii removal was 10 reaching approximately 60 for a contact time of 2 min in another work for the same initial concentration of 50 ppm of mn ii 82 2 of the metal ions were removed using the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and 56 8 were removed using the unmodified mesoporous carbon method 72 for the process studied when in contact with the surfactant elm at a concentration of 100 ppm the metal ion removal reached about 50 in 2 min in an investigation by khobragade and pal 73 on the manganese adsorption process on modified alumina surfactant for 100 ppm the removal reached 36 within 70 min for a concentration of 200 ppm about 30 of the metal ions were removed using the liquid membrane process studied while manganese removal was found to be 26 using the nano biosorbent method with a contact time of 25 min 74 thus it was verified that the removal of manganese using the elmb process is a rapid metal removal technology since the time of contact of the metal solution with the adsorbent medium is longer for other removal methods than what was optimised in this work 4 conclusions the elmb technique was demonstrated to be an innovative process of elm with the use the biosurfactant produced in loco in the composition of the system compared to the use of commercial surfactants this substitution permitted manganese ion removal in an economic and environmentally advantageous way while the total cost of biosurfactant production specifically rhamnolipid is 7 45 usd m3 for the bs the total cost of the chemical surfactant span 80 3 solution is approximately 5 times higher than that of microbial origin the ann model satisfactorily represented the elmb system presenting an r 2 of 0 76 in the simulation of manganese removal the optimised conditions showed an optimal manganese removal in the operational conditions of 0 11 m of d2ehpa 2 min of contact time 0 49 m of h2so4 absence of nacl and 3 6 mm of edta the mn ii ion removal using elmb proved to be a fast process 2 min with low cost 51 62 usd m3 for contaminated water and was efficient 77 of removal for a concentration of 25 ppm and sustainable in optimised conditions compared with other adsorption processes of mn ii described in the literature

square error rmse measures the magnitude of the mean of the error and can be calculated using equation 3 49 50 3 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i c a l c y i e x p 2 1 2 where y i c a l c represents the predicted value y i e x p is the experimental value and n is the number of tests to obtain the model that describes manganese removal 35 assays were performed with different concentrations of nacl d2ehpa h2so4 and edta at different contact times as described in table 1 2 6 optimal conditions and effect of variables the effects of the variables were obtained using the weight partitioning method described in equation 4 as follows 4 v i j 1 h i w i j k 1 m i w k j l w j i 1 m j 1 h i w i j k 1 m i w k j l w j where vi is the relative effect of the input variable i m and h are the numbers of neurons in the input and hidden layers respectively and iw and lw are the connection weights of the hidden and output layers respectively optimal conditions of the elmb system were obtained using the artificial bee colony optimisation method abcoptim https cran r project org web packages abcoptim abcoptim pdf this method was inspired by the collective intelligence of bee swarms which demonstrate self organisation and the division of tasks as fundamental characteristics the optimisation obtains the global optimum of the process through simulation of the behaviour of bee operators explorers and observers as described in the literature 51 52 3 results and discussion 3 1 biosurfactant production for the biosurfactant emulsion liquid membrane technique fig 3 shows the results of biosurfactant production with reference to the superficial tension the minor tension obtained was 33 mn m for 72 h the superficial tension is an important parameter that evaluates the possibility that in the fermentation the production of rhamnolipid has a concentration equal to or higher than the critical micelle concentration cmc that is desirable in obtaining elmb according to rodrigues et al 53 mono rhamnolipids and di rhamnolipids that are dissolved in demineralised water reduce the superficial tension by up to 25 9 mn m cmc 50 mg l and 33 5 mn m cmc 50 mg l respectively higher rhamnolipid concentrations above the cmc promote a higher stability of elmb and the value of 33 mn m obtained in the present work is approximately the same as that observed of di rhamnolipids in the work described in the literature 53 54 with reference to the emulsification index and biosurfactant concentration biosurfactant production occurs satisfactorily between 48 h and 72 h because in this interval of time the emulsification index et was 100 an emulsification index that is lower than 100 for fermentation times lower than 48 h can be explained by the adaptation of the microorganism in the fermentation medium in the initial phase of this process and the degeneracy of the biosurfactant for periods longer than 72 h lovaglio et al 55 investigated the emulsifying activity of rhamnolipids and obtained an emulsification index of approximately 65 with kerosene for 72 h of fermentation costa et al 56 studied the structure properties and applications of the rhamnolipids and obtained an emulsification index of 100 using kerosene for different surfactant concentrations both values are compatible with the present study table 2 shows a comparative calculation of the cost of production of the biosurfactant produced in loco of the present work and the commercial surfactant span 80 table 2 illustrates that the use of 3 of span 80 as a surfactant has a cost 5 times higher than that of the elm system using biosurfactant produced from microorganisms in the elmb system successful biosurfactant production depends on the development of an inexpensive process and the use of low cost raw materials like cellulose and glycerol as described in the literature as possible sources of low cost biomass 57 58 3 2 artificial neural network model table 3 summarises the best ann model for the experimental data of manganese removal according to the high r 2 values and the residual standard error the accuracy of the ann in predicting future outcomes is satisfactory for the neurons in the hidden layer although an exact equation capable of predicting the number of neurons of the hidden layer does exist the value of 11 neurons obtained in this work is compatible with equation 5 described in the work by zhao et al 60 that estimates 11 neurons 5 n h 2 n p 1 where nh and np correspond to the number of neurons in the hidden layer and number of variables respectively 3 3 influence of the input variables according to the artificial neural network ann and ann artificial bee colony optimisation optimisation of the removal conditions using abcoptim predicted 33 removal under the operating conditions of 3 6 mm of edta 0 49 m h2so4 0 11 m of d2ehpa 2 min of contact time and the absence of nacl experimental validation with the optimised conditions indicated that manganese removal was 36 for a solution containing 100 ppm of mn ii which was in good agreement with the abcoptim results table 4 shows the effects associated with the concentrations of edta d2ehpa nacl and h2so4 and the contact time between the phases in optimised conditions the comparison between these optimised values and the literature is difficult because of the absence of research that describes the experimental conditions however the results can be compared with other systems that used edta nacl h2so4 and d2ehpa with reference to edta the same process forming coordination complexes that are stable with several metallic ions presented the optimal concentration of 3 6 mm in the present work this is lower than that observed by kumbar and kasap 61 in the extraction process of nickel from cobalt which presented a higher extraction efficiency up to 25 mm moreover h2so4 is a compound used in the composition of the stripping solution the optimal value of h2so4 in elm systems is extremely important because high concentrations of acid provoke the increase of hydrogen ions in the internal phase which can reduce the membrane stability 62 in the present work the optimal concentration of h2so4 was 0 49 m which is compatible with that found by lende 18 and mohammed et al 63 which showed the optimal extraction of pb ii contained 0 5 m of h2so4 with relation to d2ehpa this exercises the function of a facilitator in the transport of metallic ions and is identified as a reagent of selective extraction of manganese above other metals such as nickel cobalt and magnesium 64 in this work d2ehpa presents an optimal concentration of 0 11 m a value lower than that found by liu et al 23 in the study of the extraction of vanadium iv which was 10 6 approximately 0 3 m with reference to the stability time of the biosurfactant membrane the elmb system presents the optimal time of 2 min 120 s a value compatible with the half life of 440 495 s found by feng et al 65 with relation to nacl this parameter was studied in the internal phase in the stripping solution 1 m and obtained an extraction of 36 3 of ethylparaben a lower value than the stripping solutions studied by kohli et al 66 this is similar to the work of noah et al 67 in that the nacl presented a lower efficiency as a stripping agent among the agents investigated for chromium removal in the elmb system the obtained absence of nacl in the optimised conditions demonstrated the parameters to have a negative effect in the process of manganese ion removal 3 4 evaluation of biosurfactant emulsion liquid membrane cost table 5 shows that the elmb can be produced at a total cost of 51 62 usd m³ of contaminated water using 32 2 g of the bs solution per 30 g of metallic solution although there are no papers describing the economic aspects of the removal of mn ii the results are satisfactory when compared to the removal processes of other environmental contaminants the total cost of the elmb process is equivalent to 1564 24 usd kg of mn not including the cost of kerosene which can be fully recycled representing a cost that is 13 2 times higher than that described in the literature for the removal of phosphorus 68 69 however the proposed process was economically compatible when compared to the removal of chromium vi containing 0 1 1 mg l of cr vi which presents a cost that is approximately 1 5 higher than that for mn ii removal using the elmb process 70 clearly d2ehpa and h2so4 have the most prominent effect on the cost of production representing 57 and 29 of the total cost of elmb respectively it is also important to note that biosurfactant is produced economically representing only 12 of the total cost of the process the cost of these substances during the process can be reduced by the recovery of d2ehpa which is carried out in industrial processes 3 5 study of optimised conditions fig 4 shows the removal of manganese under optimal conditions at the optimal time 2 min for different emulsion metal solution ratios w w for concentrations of 25 50 100 and 200 ppm the efficiency of mn ii using elmb was investigated in distinct ratios of emulsion to metallic ion solution w w and the results demonstrated values of 30 70 of the removal of mn ii ions in a ratio of 1 1 in the present work at an initial concentration of 25 ppm of mn ii solution manganese ion removal was approximately 77 for a membrane contact time of 2 min in the literature 84 5 mn ii removal was obtained for a 20 ppm initial solution of metal ions at an equilibrium contact time of 120 min using the polyvinyl alcohol pva chitosan adsorption process 71 in this study with an initial concentration of 50 ppm ion mn ii removal was 10 reaching approximately 60 for a contact time of 2 min in another work for the same initial concentration of 50 ppm of mn ii 82 2 of the metal ions were removed using the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and 56 8 were removed using the unmodified mesoporous carbon method 72 for the process studied when in contact with the surfactant elm at a concentration of 100 ppm the metal ion removal reached about 50 in 2 min in an investigation by khobragade and pal 73 on the manganese adsorption process on modified alumina surfactant for 100 ppm the removal reached 36 within 70 min for a concentration of 200 ppm about 30 of the metal ions were removed using the liquid membrane process studied while manganese removal was found to be 26 using the nano biosorbent method with a contact time of 25 min 74 thus it was verified that the removal of manganese using the elmb process is a rapid metal removal technology since the time of contact of the metal solution with the adsorbent medium is longer for other removal methods than what was optimised in this work 4 conclusions the elmb technique was demonstrated to be an innovative process of elm with the use the biosurfactant produced in loco in the composition of the system compared to the use of commercial surfactants this substitution permitted manganese ion removal in an economic and environmentally advantageous way while the total cost of biosurfactant production specifically rhamnolipid is 7 45 usd m3 for the bs the total cost of the chemical surfactant span 80 3 solution is approximately 5 times higher than that of microbial origin the ann model satisfactorily represented the elmb system presenting an r 2 of 0 76 in the simulation of manganese removal the optimised conditions showed an optimal manganese removal in the operational conditions of 0 11 m of d2ehpa 2 min of contact time 0 49 m of h2so4 absence of nacl and 3 6 mm of edta the mn ii ion removal using elmb proved to be a fast process 2 min with low cost 51 62 usd m3 for contaminated water and was efficient 77 of removal for a concentration of 25 ppm and sustainable in optimised conditions compared with other adsorption processes of mn ii described in the literature

14416,uniform deposition of sio2 nanoparticles nps on the outer surface of si3n4 hollow fiber membrane was achieved via sol gel method using tetraethyl orthosilicate teos at various concentrations the experimental results sem xrd xps afm demonstrated that the sio2 nps were strongly adhered to the grains of si3n4 at highest teos concentration the generated sio2 nps entirely covered the membrane surface resulting in the presence of a newly formed smooth selective filtering layer it has reduced the surface roughness and increased the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane these features have considerably enhanced the selectivity of the membranes especially in the case of submicron contaminants and suppressed fouling phenomena as recorded in filtration experiments using a stable oil in water emulsion high separation performance 95 oil rejection was achieved in sio2 coated si3n4 hollow fiber membrane prepared with 7 5 mol l 1 teos concentration keywords si3n4 hollow fiber sio2 nanoparticles sol gel process oil in water emulsion cross flow filtration 1 introduction treatment and purification of oily waste water in the form of stable oil in water emulsion produced by various industrial activities is a key issue in the last decade 1 2 membrane separation is an effective filtration process for such types of waste 3 5 in comparison with the polymer membranes ceramic membranes are highly considered for industrial applications 6 7 since they display high mechanical 8 and thermal stability 9 as well as remarkable durability in harsh environments 10 herein ceramic membranes such as γ alumina 11 go modified al2o3 microfiltration membrane 12 mullite ceramic based membranes and their composite hollow fibers with the titania and alumina 13 15 and ceramic membranes based on low cost inorganic clays and metakaolins 16 17 have been fabricated and used for wastewater filtration besides metal oxides which are commonly used for fabricating ceramic hollow fiber membranes silicon nitride si3n4 with excellent resistance to the corrosion and oxidation and high hardness properties are also attractive alternatives to metal oxide ceramics and exhibit wide applicability and high performance in membrane process 18 19 for instance 99 salt rejection efficiency has been reported using si3n4 hollow fibers in vacuum membrane distillation and direct contact membrane distillation 20 in conjunction with the high aspect ratio length breadth of β si3n4 grains which provides high mechanical strength 21 the above features suggest that the si3n4 hollow fibers can be suited for installation in pressure driven membrane modules with no risk of breaking even under high applied trans membrane pressures tmp however the rod like si3n4 grains at the surface of the membrane cause a rough surface structure which can negatively affect the membrane performance in oil water emulsion microfiltration by trapping the oil droplets onto the membrane surface and intensification of fouling phenomena moreover the membranes based on si3n4 as a non oxide ceramic material showed lower hydrophilicity characteristics with water contact angle of 55 compared to the super hydrophilic metal oxides such as tio2 and sio2 20 surface modification of the membrane is proposed in order to modify the physico chemical properties of the membranes and enhance separation efficiency several nanoscale materials such as al2o3 zro2 tio2 and sio2 have been used to modify the surface of various ceramic and polymeric membranes 22 26 the results of these studies showed that the deposition of hydrophilic nanoparticles nps on the surface of commercial membranes increased the hydrophilicity and separation proficiency of the resultant membranes herein in this report the si3n4 based hollow fiber membrane as a non oxide ceramic structure was subjected to surface modification using sio2 nanoparticles to improve the hydrophilic characteristic and physico chemical properties for efficient oil water emulsion filtration combined phase inversion sintering technique was used for fabricating asymmetric membrane structures with a finger like micro void layer at the inner part and a spongy selective layer on the outer surface of the fiber through a simple and single step process 27 29 uniformly deposited sio2 nps on the surface of si3n4 membrane changed the surface property and morphology of membranes and resulted in a super hydrophilic robust ceramic hollow fiber for efficient oil water filtration moreover the newly formed layer of the sio2 nps at high teos concentration is expected to act as a secondary separation layer and increase the selectivity of the hollow fiber the morphology and structural features of the produced membranes as well as their separation performance in stable oil in water emulsion cross flow filtration were experimentally investigated 2 materials and experimental procedure 2 1 fabrication modification and characterization of the membranes the detailed procedure for si3n4 hollow fiber fabrication has been presented elsewhere 7 in brief a mixture of starting ceramic powders containing α si3n4 90 wt al2o3 4 wt and y2o3 6 wt was added to a stable polymer solution of polyethersulfone pes radela 100 solvay advanced polymers in n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china o 2 aminopropyl o 2 methoxyethyl polypropyleneglycol ampg sigma aldrich co ltd usa was used as dispersant to prepare a homogeneous ceramic suspension after ball milling for 48 h the ceramic suspension was extruded through a tube in orifice spinneret to form hollow fiber structure and directly discharged into a water bath for phase inversion process the fibers were sintered at 1700 c for 4 h under n2 atmosphere the inlet and outlet of the fibers were sealed with epoxy resin to prevent penetration of reactants and undesirable materials into the fiber structure during the following steps of surface functionalization and modification the first step of the modification process involves the increase of the number of oh groups on the surface of the membranes thus the si3n4 hollow fibers were immersed in a mixture of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 v v and h2so4 h2o2 h2so4 80 20 v v for 30 min thereafter the surface of the hydroxylated hollow fibers was washed with deionized water for several times followed by drying at 70 c for 12 h next the hydroxylated hollow fibers were immersed in an ammonia sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china aqueous solution 30 v v then a solution of ethanol teos sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china was added dropwise under vigorous stirring the stirring continued for 24 h to complete the reaction four different concentrations of teos at 2 5 10 and 15 v v in ethanol were tested and the resultant coated membranes were designated as mf1 mf2 mf3 and mf4 respectively the modified membranes were washed with water and dried at 80 c for 12 h then they were subjected to ultrasonic vibration in water for 30 min to remove the remaining non sticking particles from the outer surface of the fibers finally the fibers were heat treated at 500 c for 4 h with a heating and cooling rate of 3 k min 1 the whole process of surface functionalization and modification is schematically summarized in fig 1 the solid loading of sio2 nps for each modified membrane at different concentration of teos was calculated by weighing the membranes before and after modification eq 1 was used to calculate sio2 solid loading 1 s o l i d l o a d i n g w m w b w m 100 in above equation wm and wb are assigned to the weight of modified and unmodified si3n4 hollow fiber membranes respectively the morphology of the produced samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm 6390la japan the crystalline structure analysis was performed by x ray diffraction xrd philips pw1700 at 40 kv and 100 ma with a graphite monochromatic using cu ka1 radiation λ 0 154056 nm at a scanning rate of 0 5 min elemental analysis was carried out by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific escalab 250 the surface topography of the fibers was scanned with an atomic force microscope afm veecodilnnova veeco instruments inc over an area of 5 5 μm2 the average pore size of the membranes was determined by bubble point methodology and their porosity was measured by archimedes immersion method 30 the stability of the sio2 nps on the surface of the membrane was tested with abrasion tests in this case a suspension of 4 wt sic in water was prepared then the modified mf4 fiber which was found to have the highest amount of sio2 nps on its outer surface was immersed in this abrasive slurry for 72 h under vigorous stirring 2 2 filtration experiments to evaluate the performance of the produced membranes filtration experiments with a stable oil in water emulsion were conducted a cylindrical membrane module consisting of a circular fibers holder was used to install hollow fiber membranes inside the chamber 7 hollow fiber membranes with the active length of 5 cm and outer diameter of 2 1 mm total active surface area of 23 1 cm2 7 3 2 cm2 were vertically installed on the fibers holder using epoxy resin and exposed to the feed emulsion the emulsion was prepared by dispersion of gasoline sinopec china in water at concentration of 1000 mg l 1 using polyoxyethylene 80 sorbitanmonooleat tween 80 merck as a surfactant at a concentration of 100 mg l 1 emulsification and homogenization of the oil in water emulsion were conducted by a laboratory mixer at 1000 rpm for 20 min the average oil droplet size distribution determined by dynamic light scattering dls analysis malvern mastersizer 2000 was narrow since 70 of the droplets were sized at about 600 nm the ph of the feed solution was in the neutral range 6 5 the fabricated hollow fiber membranes structure of the fibers holder and membrane module were shown in fig 2 all the membranes were pre treated by the cross flow of deionized water at a trans membrane pressure of 2 bar for 2 h to avoid undesirable trans membrane hydraulic resistance during the main microfiltration runs the oil in water emulsion was transferred from the stainless steel tank to the membrane module through a high pressure centrifugal pump which was connected to an inverter in order to adjust the operational pressure at 1 bar cross flow velocity of the feed solution during circulation was controlled by a flow valve located after the membrane module the reynold s number was calculated as 3261 for a feed flow rate of 3 l min 1 these calculations were performed for the cross sectional area of the membrane module by considering the hydraulic diameter in the presence of the membrane the permeate flux was measured until reaching a stable trans membrane flux determined by weighing the produced clean water at pre determined time intervals the feeding liquid was at room temperature 25 c which was controlled by a heat exchanger in the feed container tank the oil separation performance of the membranes was measured by uv vis spectrophotometric analysis agilent technology uv vis cary 60 at the wavelength of 259 nm the filtrate flux was calculated by the eq 2 2 j v f a δ t where j is the permeate flux l m 2 h 1 vf is known as the volume of the filtrate flow l a is the active surface area of the membranes and δt h is the time interval the oil rejection r was calculated by the eq 3 3 r 1 c f c i 100 where cf and ci mg l are the oil concentrations in permeate and feed flow respectively in order to recovery of the fouled membranes the fibers were subjected to a high flow rate of tape water 4 l min 1 to remove the loose particles from the membranes surface for 45 min in continue the fibers were immersed into the acidic hcl 0 5 m and alkaline naoh 0 5 m aqueous solutions for 15 min then the fibers were washed with di water for several times the water permeation of fresh membrane before oily wastewater filtration and cleaned membrane after the recover were measured and used to calculate the membrane recovery and fouling index fi factor eq 4 4 f i j f j c j f 100 where the jf and jc are defined as the water permeation of the fresh and cleaned membranes respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane structure and morphology the sem images obtained from the outer surface of the membranes presented in fig 3 suggest that the nps were uniformly deposited on the particles of si3n4 whose typical rod like shape is seen in fig 3a on the surface of the membrane covering is more pronounced for the membranes produced with higher concentration of teos more specifically in low concentration of teos the newly formed nps did not cover the si3n4 particles completely thorough covering of the outer surface of the membrane occurred in mf4 fig 3e in this case the deposition of the nps onto the walls of passing way channels on the outer surface of mf4 membrane should decrease the pores radius acting therefore as a new effective separation layer which should improve selectivity and separation performance by improving hydrophilicity and physico chemical properties of the membrane morphology and cross sectional structure of the sio2 nps modified si3n4 hollow fiber membrane mf4 were also presented in fig 3g and h respectively the hollow fiber shows an asymmetric structure containing a finger like voids layer at inner edge and a sponge like structure at outer part of the membrane which is expected for the membranes prepared by the phase inversion process formation of finger like voids layer can improve the permeation characteristics of the membranes by the reduction of trans membrane hydraulic resistance 28 cross sectional surface structure of the mf4 membrane shows the formation of a thin layer of sio2 nps onto the si3n4 hollow fiber substrate in this case the thickness of sio2 nps layer varied from a single nanoparticle layer at the top of rod like si3n4 grains to a multi layer sio2 nps in the spaces between the si3n4 grains with thickness of 800 nm observations on the spongy inner layer of the membranes fig 4 showed that there was no evidence of deposition of nps in mf1 however uniform deposition of nps is observed in mf4 membranes hence the sol gel process using high concentration of teos can modify both the outer surface and the spongy layer of the si3n4 membrane sio2 nps loading on each of the modified membranes was calculated by the eq 1 herein the weight of the membranes was separately recorded before and after modification by sio2 nps the sio2 solid loadings of 1 90 0 96 0 51 and 0 28 wt were recorded for the mf4 mf3 mf2 and mf1 membranes respectively the results further demonstrate that upon the increase of teos concentration during sol gel process more sio2 nps were deposited on the membrane structure the sio2 nps were strongly adhered to the grains of si3n4 as suggested by the results of the abrasion test the influence of the treatment of the mf4 hollow fiber with the sic slurry for 72 h under vigorous stirring is shown in fig 5 these sem images show that the sio2 nps practically remained on the outer surface of the fibers after the abrasion test this strong interfacial adherence should be due to covalent bonds developed between the sio2 nps and the si3n4 grains formed through the dehydration condensation reaction among the oh groups on the hydroxylated surface of the si3n4 hollow fibers and the hydrated silica the results of the abrasion test suggest that the modified surface can be stable even at high cross flow velocity filtration under harsh operational conditions without losing the nps the nature of these nps was determined by xrd and xps analyses more specifically the x ray diffractograms of the unmodified si3n4 membrane and four modified membranes are shown in fig 6 the characteristic peaks of β si3n4 were recorded in the diffractograms of unmodified si3n4 membrane mf1 and mf2 new peak ascribed to the sio2 at 2θ 23 is observed in the diffractogram of mf3 and only sio2 peak is detected in mf4 spectrum whose surface was completely covered by the sio2 nps fig 3e evidently the amount of sio2 in mf1 and mf2 membranes was too small to be detected by the xrd analysis the existence of sio2 nps was also confirmed by xps analysis fig 7 the characteristic peaks of the si n and o elements were clearly recognized in the xps spectra of unmodified and modified mf4 membranes fig 7a the difference in the intensity of the peaks in the xps spectra between the unmodified membrane and the membrane after modification leads to the following conclusions the high oxygen intensity in mf4 suggests the presence of sio2 on the outer surface of the mf4 membrane fig 7b the peak of si 2p shifted from 103 44 to 101 43 ev suggesting that silicon bonds have been changed from the si n4 environment to the si o4 state after the modification of membrane surface fig 7d 31 finally the intensity of n atoms was significantly reduced after surface modification fig 7c it can be suggested that the reduction in nitrogen should be due to the covering of the membrane surface by the deposited sio2 nps the elemental xps analysis showed that the atomic percent of n in mf4 sample is 4 the values of binding energies for each element and the elemental analysis for the unmodified si3n4 and mf4 membranes are presented in table 1 the results of afm analysis shed light on the influence of membrane modification on the surface roughness which directly affects membrane performance and fouling phenomena 32 more specifically the experimental results from afm measurements fig 8 a and b showed that the deposition of sio2 nps caused a reduction in the surface roughness of the membranes the rout mean square rms surface roughness decreased from 114 to 64 3 nm and the average roughness ra from 86 to 50 5 nm for the unmodified and the modified mf4 membranes respectively however the roughness could be increased or decreased by the nanoparticles deposition onto the membrane surface which is attributed to the surface structure of the substrate size and concentration of the nanoparticles and the quality of nanoparticles formation on the membranes surface with or without formation of a uniform thin layer the rough surface of porous mullite membrane with a glassy framework formed by the grown mullite grains has been altered to a smooth surface through the formation of a uniform thin layer of titania nanoparticles onto the mullite titania membrane surface 14 moreover formation of a thin layer of tio2 and γ al2o3 nanoparticles on the α al2o3 substrate membrane introduced a smooth membrane surface with higher wettability properties 33 34 on the other hand sio2 nanoparticles deposition on the smooth pores surfaces of a porous glass membrane have increased the surface roughness of the modified membranes 35 in addition zro2 γ al2o3 tio2 and ag nanoparticles decoration on the grains of α al2o3 substrate increased the roughness properties of the membranes 23 26 36 37 a rougher surface increases friction and contact area between the membrane surface and the contaminants in the main feed stream with the increase in friction the back movement of materials from the membrane surface towards the bulk flow is restricted favoring accumulation of contaminants on the surface of the membrane 38 39 in the case of the contaminants studied in this work more oil droplets will be trapped and deposited on the valleys of a rough surface in comparison with a smooth one the more valley clogging occurs the higher flux decrease takes place consequently the deposition of sio2 nps on the surface of the membrane provides higher surface densification that enhances selectivity and decreases surface roughness that suppresses fouling effect water contact analysis was performed to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the membranes surface before and after modification mf4 water contact angle was recorded after 2 s of water dropping 0 5 μl on the membranes surface fig 8a and b it has been observed that the hydrophilicity of the membrane has significantly improved after the deposition of sio2 nps onto the membrane surface accordingly the water contact angle decreased from 59 for unmodified membrane to 0 for mf4 membrane hydrophilicity improvement can be explained by the presence of abundant hydroxyl functional groups of sio2 nps on the membrane surface through the hydrogen bonds formation with the water molecules the increase of oxygen atomic percent on the membrane surface mf4 has already been demonstrated by xps analysis table 1 on the other hand the surface roughness affects the wettability of the membrane surface according to the wenzel s equation the surface roughness can reinforce the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces respectively 40 however in the present study the roughness reduction was accompanied with the change of surface chemistry upon the formation of hydrophilic silica nps onto the membranes surface in the case of non ideal surface the surface which is not completely smooth the surface texture contains trapped air pockets which affects the wettability properties 41 wang et al reported that the reduction of the size of the deposited silica nanoparticles onto a silicon waver substrate from 600 nm to 100 nm decreased the water contact angle from 32 to 12 42 the pristine si3n4 membrane surface contains big rod like si3n4 grains which traps bigger air pockets in comparison with the modified membranes with silica nanoparticles as shown in fig 3 the spaces between the si3n4 grains were occupied by the hydrophilic silica nanoparticles that suppresses the air trapping into the membrane surface structure moreover the narrow spaces between the sio2 nps facilitates the capillary motion of the water through the nano structured modified membrane surface and increases the surface hydrophilicity properties of the membrane 35 the deposition of sio2 nps has also affected the average pore size of the membranes fig 8c the average pore size decreases from 680 nm for unmodified si3n4 membrane to 525 nm in the mf4 membrane nonetheless there was negligible influence of surface modification i e due to the deposition of sio2 nps on the porosity of the produced membranes which was measured as 68 for all the membranes this result suggests that the modification occurred mainly on the surface of the membranes which was an important aim in this study the bending strength of the membranes before and after modification has also been presented all the membranes showed mechanical strength at 200 mpa 3 2 membrane permeability and separation performance the permeate flux curves during separation process for the unmodified and the four modified fibers are plotted in fig 9 a in all cases a decrease in permeate flux was recorded in the beginning but this decrease until a stable flux was established was more pronounced in the unmodified mf1 and mf2 fibers than in the mf3 and mf4 membranes the decrease was 74 in the unmodified membrane and 35 in the mf4 oil droplets are accumulated on the surface of the membrane during filtration causing a decrease in the permeability of a hollow fiber apparently the smoother surface of the mf3 and mf4 membranes which is due to the extended covering of their outer surface with sio2 nps favors the suppression of fouling effect since fewer contaminant species can be trapped in the valleys of the surface of the membrane moreover the hydrophilicity of the membranes has intensely improved by the deposition of sio2 nps which can facilitate the permeation of water through the membrane structure the hydrophilic surface also can repulse the oil droplets and decreases their accumulation on the surface of the membrane the separation performance and selectivity of the modified membranes were also evaluated in the oil rejection curves over filtration time shown in fig 9b in all cases the rejection has increased up to a stable regime in fact the rejected oil droplets are accumulated on the surface of the membrane forming a cake layer which results in clogging the membrane pores and preventing diffusion of smaller oil droplets through the membrane structure therefore before the formation of this cake layer the oil droplets easier penetrate through the pores which decreases oil rejection the increase of rejection for modified fibers specially for mf3 and mf4 in comparison with unmodified membrane can be attributed to the formation of the new separation layer owing to the deposition of sio2 nps on the membrane surface the mf4 fiber with higher sio2 nps deposition on the surface presented more than 95 oil rejection it can be explained by the super hydrophilic surface and the slight reduction of average pore size of the modified membrane after nps deposition which can increase the effect of steric hindrance of the membranes the concept of normalized permeate flux j j0 j0 is defined as the initial permeate flux of filtration was utilized to study the antifouling characteristics of the membranes fig 9c this factor has increased from 0 23 for unmodified fiber to 0 53 and 0 64 for mf3 and mf4 respectively it clearly shows that the reduction of permeate flux was more intense for unmodified fiber compared to the modified membranes moreover membrane recovery and fouling index fi factor have further demonstrated the improvement of antifouling properties for modified membranes fig 9d membrane recovery increased from 78 for unmodified fiber to 92 for mf4 membrane which is attributed to the loose structure of the accumulated oil droplets on the surface of the modified membranes fouling index has also decreased to 8 for mf4 membrane the results indicated that the surface modification of si3n4 membrane with hydrophilic sio2 nps has successfully improved the separation proficiency of the membranes in the aspects of water permeation rejection and antifouling properties the surface morphology of the modified membranes was further evaluated after oil in water emulsion separation after microfiltration the membranes were dried at room temperature and subjected to sem analysis as shown in fig 10 the sio2 nps constantly remained on the surface of the si3n4 hollow fiber during the wastewater filtration which demonstrates the structural stabilities of the fabricated membranes moreover the water contact angle of the membranes was measured directly after microfiltration it has been observed that the water contact angle decreased for the membranes with higher sio2 nps loading it can be explained by the antifouling properties of the modified membranes mf3 and mf4 showed higher normalized permeate flux compared to the other membranes therefore by less oil droplets accumulation on the membrane surface higher hydrophilicity was recorded for the mf3 and mf4 membranes after microfiltration the performance of several modified ceramic membrane structures reported in literature along with the results from the present study are summarized in table 2 with respect to the features of the membrane pore size and the feed solution oil droplets size it can be suggested that the produced si3n4 doped sio2 modified hollow fiber membranes display an excellent performance as to treating oily waste water owing to the high permeate flux which is produced 690 l m 2 h 1 and to the oil rejection 95 it can be suggested that the highly selective deposited layer of sio2 nps on the outer surface of the fiber as well as the asymmetric structure which includes finger like micro void spongy layers provided a unique structure which can be used in various types of filtration processes 4 conclusions uniform deposition of sio2 nps on the outer surface of si3n4 hollow fiber membrane was successfully achieved by sol gel method the sio2 nps were strongly adhered to the si3n4 grains the increase in the concentration of teos greatly favors the fabrication of an ideal microstructure at the surface of the membranes which displays an excellent separation performance during filtration analyses with xrd and xps confirmed that the deposited layer was made of sio2 nps reduction of surface roughness and increase of hydrophilicity characteristic

14416,uniform deposition of sio2 nanoparticles nps on the outer surface of si3n4 hollow fiber membrane was achieved via sol gel method using tetraethyl orthosilicate teos at various concentrations the experimental results sem xrd xps afm demonstrated that the sio2 nps were strongly adhered to the grains of si3n4 at highest teos concentration the generated sio2 nps entirely covered the membrane surface resulting in the presence of a newly formed smooth selective filtering layer it has reduced the surface roughness and increased the surface hydrophilicity of the membrane these features have considerably enhanced the selectivity of the membranes especially in the case of submicron contaminants and suppressed fouling phenomena as recorded in filtration experiments using a stable oil in water emulsion high separation performance 95 oil rejection was achieved in sio2 coated si3n4 hollow fiber membrane prepared with 7 5 mol l 1 teos concentration keywords si3n4 hollow fiber sio2 nanoparticles sol gel process oil in water emulsion cross flow filtration 1 introduction treatment and purification of oily waste water in the form of stable oil in water emulsion produced by various industrial activities is a key issue in the last decade 1 2 membrane separation is an effective filtration process for such types of waste 3 5 in comparison with the polymer membranes ceramic membranes are highly considered for industrial applications 6 7 since they display high mechanical 8 and thermal stability 9 as well as remarkable durability in harsh environments 10 herein ceramic membranes such as γ alumina 11 go modified al2o3 microfiltration membrane 12 mullite ceramic based membranes and their composite hollow fibers with the titania and alumina 13 15 and ceramic membranes based on low cost inorganic clays and metakaolins 16 17 have been fabricated and used for wastewater filtration besides metal oxides which are commonly used for fabricating ceramic hollow fiber membranes silicon nitride si3n4 with excellent resistance to the corrosion and oxidation and high hardness properties are also attractive alternatives to metal oxide ceramics and exhibit wide applicability and high performance in membrane process 18 19 for instance 99 salt rejection efficiency has been reported using si3n4 hollow fibers in vacuum membrane distillation and direct contact membrane distillation 20 in conjunction with the high aspect ratio length breadth of β si3n4 grains which provides high mechanical strength 21 the above features suggest that the si3n4 hollow fibers can be suited for installation in pressure driven membrane modules with no risk of breaking even under high applied trans membrane pressures tmp however the rod like si3n4 grains at the surface of the membrane cause a rough surface structure which can negatively affect the membrane performance in oil water emulsion microfiltration by trapping the oil droplets onto the membrane surface and intensification of fouling phenomena moreover the membranes based on si3n4 as a non oxide ceramic material showed lower hydrophilicity characteristics with water contact angle of 55 compared to the super hydrophilic metal oxides such as tio2 and sio2 20 surface modification of the membrane is proposed in order to modify the physico chemical properties of the membranes and enhance separation efficiency several nanoscale materials such as al2o3 zro2 tio2 and sio2 have been used to modify the surface of various ceramic and polymeric membranes 22 26 the results of these studies showed that the deposition of hydrophilic nanoparticles nps on the surface of commercial membranes increased the hydrophilicity and separation proficiency of the resultant membranes herein in this report the si3n4 based hollow fiber membrane as a non oxide ceramic structure was subjected to surface modification using sio2 nanoparticles to improve the hydrophilic characteristic and physico chemical properties for efficient oil water emulsion filtration combined phase inversion sintering technique was used for fabricating asymmetric membrane structures with a finger like micro void layer at the inner part and a spongy selective layer on the outer surface of the fiber through a simple and single step process 27 29 uniformly deposited sio2 nps on the surface of si3n4 membrane changed the surface property and morphology of membranes and resulted in a super hydrophilic robust ceramic hollow fiber for efficient oil water filtration moreover the newly formed layer of the sio2 nps at high teos concentration is expected to act as a secondary separation layer and increase the selectivity of the hollow fiber the morphology and structural features of the produced membranes as well as their separation performance in stable oil in water emulsion cross flow filtration were experimentally investigated 2 materials and experimental procedure 2 1 fabrication modification and characterization of the membranes the detailed procedure for si3n4 hollow fiber fabrication has been presented elsewhere 7 in brief a mixture of starting ceramic powders containing α si3n4 90 wt al2o3 4 wt and y2o3 6 wt was added to a stable polymer solution of polyethersulfone pes radela 100 solvay advanced polymers in n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china o 2 aminopropyl o 2 methoxyethyl polypropyleneglycol ampg sigma aldrich co ltd usa was used as dispersant to prepare a homogeneous ceramic suspension after ball milling for 48 h the ceramic suspension was extruded through a tube in orifice spinneret to form hollow fiber structure and directly discharged into a water bath for phase inversion process the fibers were sintered at 1700 c for 4 h under n2 atmosphere the inlet and outlet of the fibers were sealed with epoxy resin to prevent penetration of reactants and undesirable materials into the fiber structure during the following steps of surface functionalization and modification the first step of the modification process involves the increase of the number of oh groups on the surface of the membranes thus the si3n4 hollow fibers were immersed in a mixture of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 v v and h2so4 h2o2 h2so4 80 20 v v for 30 min thereafter the surface of the hydroxylated hollow fibers was washed with deionized water for several times followed by drying at 70 c for 12 h next the hydroxylated hollow fibers were immersed in an ammonia sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china aqueous solution 30 v v then a solution of ethanol teos sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china was added dropwise under vigorous stirring the stirring continued for 24 h to complete the reaction four different concentrations of teos at 2 5 10 and 15 v v in ethanol were tested and the resultant coated membranes were designated as mf1 mf2 mf3 and mf4 respectively the modified membranes were washed with water and dried at 80 c for 12 h then they were subjected to ultrasonic vibration in water for 30 min to remove the remaining non sticking particles from the outer surface of the fibers finally the fibers were heat treated at 500 c for 4 h with a heating and cooling rate of 3 k min 1 the whole process of surface functionalization and modification is schematically summarized in fig 1 the solid loading of sio2 nps for each modified membrane at different concentration of teos was calculated by weighing the membranes before and after modification eq 1 was used to calculate sio2 solid loading 1 s o l i d l o a d i n g w m w b w m 100 in above equation wm and wb are assigned to the weight of modified and unmodified si3n4 hollow fiber membranes respectively the morphology of the produced samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem jeol jsm 6390la japan the crystalline structure analysis was performed by x ray diffraction xrd philips pw1700 at 40 kv and 100 ma with a graphite monochromatic using cu ka1 radiation λ 0 154056 nm at a scanning rate of 0 5 min elemental analysis was carried out by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo scientific escalab 250 the surface topography of the fibers was scanned with an atomic force microscope afm veecodilnnova veeco instruments inc over an area of 5 5 μm2 the average pore size of the membranes was determined by bubble point methodology and their porosity was measured by archimedes immersion method 30 the stability of the sio2 nps on the surface of the membrane was tested with abrasion tests in this case a suspension of 4 wt sic in water was prepared then the modified mf4 fiber which was found to have the highest amount of sio2 nps on its outer surface was immersed in this abrasive slurry for 72 h under vigorous stirring 2 2 filtration experiments to evaluate the performance of the produced membranes filtration experiments with a stable oil in water emulsion were conducted a cylindrical membrane module consisting of a circular fibers holder was used to install hollow fiber membranes inside the chamber 7 hollow fiber membranes with the active length of 5 cm and outer diameter of 2 1 mm total active surface area of 23 1 cm2 7 3 2 cm2 were vertically installed on the fibers holder using epoxy resin and exposed to the feed emulsion the emulsion was prepared by dispersion of gasoline sinopec china in water at concentration of 1000 mg l 1 using polyoxyethylene 80 sorbitanmonooleat tween 80 merck as a surfactant at a concentration of 100 mg l 1 emulsification and homogenization of the oil in water emulsion were conducted by a laboratory mixer at 1000 rpm for 20 min the average oil droplet size distribution determined by dynamic light scattering dls analysis malvern mastersizer 2000 was narrow since 70 of the droplets were sized at about 600 nm the ph of the feed solution was in the neutral range 6 5 the fabricated hollow fiber membranes structure of the fibers holder and membrane module were shown in fig 2 all the membranes were pre treated by the cross flow of deionized water at a trans membrane pressure of 2 bar for 2 h to avoid undesirable trans membrane hydraulic resistance during the main microfiltration runs the oil in water emulsion was transferred from the stainless steel tank to the membrane module through a high pressure centrifugal pump which was connected to an inverter in order to adjust the operational pressure at 1 bar cross flow velocity of the feed solution during circulation was controlled by a flow valve located after the membrane module the reynold s number was calculated as 3261 for a feed flow rate of 3 l min 1 these calculations were performed for the cross sectional area of the membrane module by considering the hydraulic diameter in the presence of the membrane the permeate flux was measured until reaching a stable trans membrane flux determined by weighing the produced clean water at pre determined time intervals the feeding liquid was at room temperature 25 c which was controlled by a heat exchanger in the feed container tank the oil separation performance of the membranes was measured by uv vis spectrophotometric analysis agilent technology uv vis cary 60 at the wavelength of 259 nm the filtrate flux was calculated by the eq 2 2 j v f a δ t where j is the permeate flux l m 2 h 1 vf is known as the volume of the filtrate flow l a is the active surface area of the membranes and δt h is the time interval the oil rejection r was calculated by the eq 3 3 r 1 c f c i 100 where cf and ci mg l are the oil concentrations in permeate and feed flow respectively in order to recovery of the fouled membranes the fibers were subjected to a high flow rate of tape water 4 l min 1 to remove the loose particles from the membranes surface for 45 min in continue the fibers were immersed into the acidic hcl 0 5 m and alkaline naoh 0 5 m aqueous solutions for 15 min then the fibers were washed with di water for several times the water permeation of fresh membrane before oily wastewater filtration and cleaned membrane after the recover were measured and used to calculate the membrane recovery and fouling index fi factor eq 4 4 f i j f j c j f 100 where the jf and jc are defined as the water permeation of the fresh and cleaned membranes respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane structure and morphology the sem images obtained from the outer surface of the membranes presented in fig 3 suggest that the nps were uniformly deposited on the particles of si3n4 whose typical rod like shape is seen in fig 3a on the surface of the membrane covering is more pronounced for the membranes produced with higher concentration of teos more specifically in low concentration of teos the newly formed nps did not cover the si3n4 particles completely thorough covering of the outer surface of the membrane occurred in mf4 fig 3e in this case the deposition of the nps onto the walls of passing way channels on the outer surface of mf4 membrane should decrease the pores radius acting therefore as a new effective separation layer which should improve selectivity and separation performance by improving hydrophilicity and physico chemical properties of the membrane morphology and cross sectional structure of the sio2 nps modified si3n4 hollow fiber membrane mf4 were also presented in fig 3g and h respectively the hollow fiber shows an asymmetric structure containing a finger like voids layer at inner edge and a sponge like structure at outer part of the membrane which is expected for the membranes prepared by the phase inversion process formation of finger like voids layer can improve the permeation characteristics of the membranes by the reduction of trans membrane hydraulic resistance 28 cross sectional surface structure of the mf4 membrane shows the formation of a thin layer of sio2 nps onto the si3n4 hollow fiber substrate in this case the thickness of sio2 nps layer varied from a single nanoparticle layer at the top of rod like si3n4 grains to a multi layer sio2 nps in the spaces between the si3n4 grains with thickness of 800 nm observations on the spongy inner layer of the membranes fig 4 showed that there was no evidence of deposition of nps in mf1 however uniform deposition of nps is observed in mf4 membranes hence the sol gel process using high concentration of teos can modify both the outer surface and the spongy layer of the si3n4 membrane sio2 nps loading on each of the modified membranes was calculated by the eq 1 herein the weight of the membranes was separately recorded before and after modification by sio2 nps the sio2 solid loadings of 1 90 0 96 0 51 and 0 28 wt were recorded for the mf4 mf3 mf2 and mf1 membranes respectively the results further demonstrate that upon the increase of teos concentration during sol gel process more sio2 nps were deposited on the membrane structure the sio2 nps were strongly adhered to the grains of si3n4 as suggested by the results of the abrasion test the influence of the treatment of the mf4 hollow fiber with the sic slurry for 72 h under vigorous stirring is shown in fig 5 these sem images show that the sio2 nps practically remained on the outer surface of the fibers after the abrasion test this strong interfacial adherence should be due to covalent bonds developed between the sio2 nps and the si3n4 grains formed through the dehydration condensation reaction among the oh groups on the hydroxylated surface of the si3n4 hollow fibers and the hydrated silica the results of the abrasion test suggest that the modified surface can be stable even at high cross flow velocity filtration under harsh operational conditions without losing the nps the nature of these nps was determined by xrd and xps analyses more specifically the x ray diffractograms of the unmodified si3n4 membrane and four modified membranes are shown in fig 6 the characteristic peaks of β si3n4 were recorded in the diffractograms of unmodified si3n4 membrane mf1 and mf2 new peak ascribed to the sio2 at 2θ 23 is observed in the diffractogram of mf3 and only sio2 peak is detected in mf4 spectrum whose surface was completely covered by the sio2 nps fig 3e evidently the amount of sio2 in mf1 and mf2 membranes was too small to be detected by the xrd analysis the existence of sio2 nps was also confirmed by xps analysis fig 7 the characteristic peaks of the si n and o elements were clearly recognized in the xps spectra of unmodified and modified mf4 membranes fig 7a the difference in the intensity of the peaks in the xps spectra between the unmodified membrane and the membrane after modification leads to the following conclusions the high oxygen intensity in mf4 suggests the presence of sio2 on the outer surface of the mf4 membrane fig 7b the peak of si 2p shifted from 103 44 to 101 43 ev suggesting that silicon bonds have been changed from the si n4 environment to the si o4 state after the modification of membrane surface fig 7d 31 finally the intensity of n atoms was significantly reduced after surface modification fig 7c it can be suggested that the reduction in nitrogen should be due to the covering of the membrane surface by the deposited sio2 nps the elemental xps analysis showed that the atomic percent of n in mf4 sample is 4 the values of binding energies for each element and the elemental analysis for the unmodified si3n4 and mf4 membranes are presented in table 1 the results of afm analysis shed light on the influence of membrane modification on the surface roughness which directly affects membrane performance and fouling phenomena 32 more specifically the experimental results from afm measurements fig 8 a and b showed that the deposition of sio2 nps caused a reduction in the surface roughness of the membranes the rout mean square rms surface roughness decreased from 114 to 64 3 nm and the average roughness ra from 86 to 50 5 nm for the unmodified and the modified mf4 membranes respectively however the roughness could be increased or decreased by the nanoparticles deposition onto the membrane surface which is attributed to the surface structure of the substrate size and concentration of the nanoparticles and the quality of nanoparticles formation on the membranes surface with or without formation of a uniform thin layer the rough surface of porous mullite membrane with a glassy framework formed by the grown mullite grains has been altered to a smooth surface through the formation of a uniform thin layer of titania nanoparticles onto the mullite titania membrane surface 14 moreover formation of a thin layer of tio2 and γ al2o3 nanoparticles on the α al2o3 substrate membrane introduced a smooth membrane surface with higher wettability properties 33 34 on the other hand sio2 nanoparticles deposition on the smooth pores surfaces of a porous glass membrane have increased the surface roughness of the modified membranes 35 in addition zro2 γ al2o3 tio2 and ag nanoparticles decoration on the grains of α al2o3 substrate increased the roughness properties of the membranes 23 26 36 37 a rougher surface increases friction and contact area between the membrane surface and the contaminants in the main feed stream with the increase in friction the back movement of materials from the membrane surface towards the bulk flow is restricted favoring accumulation of contaminants on the surface of the membrane 38 39 in the case of the contaminants studied in this work more oil droplets will be trapped and deposited on the valleys of a rough surface in comparison with a smooth one the more valley clogging occurs the higher flux decrease takes place consequently the deposition of sio2 nps on the surface of the membrane provides higher surface densification that enhances selectivity and decreases surface roughness that suppresses fouling effect water contact analysis was performed to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the membranes surface before and after modification mf4 water contact angle was recorded after 2 s of water dropping 0 5 μl on the membranes surface fig 8a and b it has been observed that the hydrophilicity of the membrane has significantly improved after the deposition of sio2 nps onto the membrane surface accordingly the water contact angle decreased from 59 for unmodified membrane to 0 for mf4 membrane hydrophilicity improvement can be explained by the presence of abundant hydroxyl functional groups of sio2 nps on the membrane surface through the hydrogen bonds formation with the water molecules the increase of oxygen atomic percent on the membrane surface mf4 has already been demonstrated by xps analysis table 1 on the other hand the surface roughness affects the wettability of the membrane surface according to the wenzel s equation the surface roughness can reinforce the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces respectively 40 however in the present study the roughness reduction was accompanied with the change of surface chemistry upon the formation of hydrophilic silica nps onto the membranes surface in the case of non ideal surface the surface which is not completely smooth the surface texture contains trapped air pockets which affects the wettability properties 41 wang et al reported that the reduction of the size of the deposited silica nanoparticles onto a silicon waver substrate from 600 nm to 100 nm decreased the water contact angle from 32 to 12 42 the pristine si3n4 membrane surface contains big rod like si3n4 grains which traps bigger air pockets in comparison with the modified membranes with silica nanoparticles as shown in fig 3 the spaces between the si3n4 grains were occupied by the hydrophilic silica nanoparticles that suppresses the air trapping into the membrane surface structure moreover the narrow spaces between the sio2 nps facilitates the capillary motion of the water through the nano structured modified membrane surface and increases the surface hydrophilicity properties of the membrane 35 the deposition of sio2 nps has also affected the average pore size of the membranes fig 8c the average pore size decreases from 680 nm for unmodified si3n4 membrane to 525 nm in the mf4 membrane nonetheless there was negligible influence of surface modification i e due to the deposition of sio2 nps on the porosity of the produced membranes which was measured as 68 for all the membranes this result suggests that the modification occurred mainly on the surface of the membranes which was an important aim in this study the bending strength of the membranes before and after modification has also been presented all the membranes showed mechanical strength at 200 mpa 3 2 membrane permeability and separation performance the permeate flux curves during separation process for the unmodified and the four modified fibers are plotted in fig 9 a in all cases a decrease in permeate flux was recorded in the beginning but this decrease until a stable flux was established was more pronounced in the unmodified mf1 and mf2 fibers than in the mf3 and mf4 membranes the decrease was 74 in the unmodified membrane and 35 in the mf4 oil droplets are accumulated on the surface of the membrane during filtration causing a decrease in the permeability of a hollow fiber apparently the smoother surface of the mf3 and mf4 membranes which is due to the extended covering of their outer surface with sio2 nps favors the suppression of fouling effect since fewer contaminant species can be trapped in the valleys of the surface of the membrane moreover the hydrophilicity of the membranes has intensely improved by the deposition of sio2 nps which can facilitate the permeation of water through the membrane structure the hydrophilic surface also can repulse the oil droplets and decreases their accumulation on the surface of the membrane the separation performance and selectivity of the modified membranes were also evaluated in the oil rejection curves over filtration time shown in fig 9b in all cases the rejection has increased up to a stable regime in fact the rejected oil droplets are accumulated on the surface of the membrane forming a cake layer which results in clogging the membrane pores and preventing diffusion of smaller oil droplets through the membrane structure therefore before the formation of this cake layer the oil droplets easier penetrate through the pores which decreases oil rejection the increase of rejection for modified fibers specially for mf3 and mf4 in comparison with unmodified membrane can be attributed to the formation of the new separation layer owing to the deposition of sio2 nps on the membrane surface the mf4 fiber with higher sio2 nps deposition on the surface presented more than 95 oil rejection it can be explained by the super hydrophilic surface and the slight reduction of average pore size of the modified membrane after nps deposition which can increase the effect of steric hindrance of the membranes the concept of normalized permeate flux j j0 j0 is defined as the initial permeate flux of filtration was utilized to study the antifouling characteristics of the membranes fig 9c this factor has increased from 0 23 for unmodified fiber to 0 53 and 0 64 for mf3 and mf4 respectively it clearly shows that the reduction of permeate flux was more intense for unmodified fiber compared to the modified membranes moreover membrane recovery and fouling index fi factor have further demonstrated the improvement of antifouling properties for modified membranes fig 9d membrane recovery increased from 78 for unmodified fiber to 92 for mf4 membrane which is attributed to the loose structure of the accumulated oil droplets on the surface of the modified membranes fouling index has also decreased to 8 for mf4 membrane the results indicated that the surface modification of si3n4 membrane with hydrophilic sio2 nps has successfully improved the separation proficiency of the membranes in the aspects of water permeation rejection and antifouling properties the surface morphology of the modified membranes was further evaluated after oil in water emulsion separation after microfiltration the membranes were dried at room temperature and subjected to sem analysis as shown in fig 10 the sio2 nps constantly remained on the surface of the si3n4 hollow fiber during the wastewater filtration which demonstrates the structural stabilities of the fabricated membranes moreover the water contact angle of the membranes was measured directly after microfiltration it has been observed that the water contact angle decreased for the membranes with higher sio2 nps loading it can be explained by the antifouling properties of the modified membranes mf3 and mf4 showed higher normalized permeate flux compared to the other membranes therefore by less oil droplets accumulation on the membrane surface higher hydrophilicity was recorded for the mf3 and mf4 membranes after microfiltration the performance of several modified ceramic membrane structures reported in literature along with the results from the present study are summarized in table 2 with respect to the features of the membrane pore size and the feed solution oil droplets size it can be suggested that the produced si3n4 doped sio2 modified hollow fiber membranes display an excellent performance as to treating oily waste water owing to the high permeate flux which is produced 690 l m 2 h 1 and to the oil rejection 95 it can be suggested that the highly selective deposited layer of sio2 nps on the outer surface of the fiber as well as the asymmetric structure which includes finger like micro void spongy layers provided a unique structure which can be used in various types of filtration processes 4 conclusions uniform deposition of sio2 nps on the outer surface of si3n4 hollow fiber membrane was successfully achieved by sol gel method the sio2 nps were

shown in fig 1 a b c d e the broad intensity band at 3440 cm 1 and a low intense peak at 3619 cm 1 ascribed the presence of free water molecules and the oh stretching of si oh group 30 a medium intensity band at 1713 cm 1 is attributed to stretching vibration of carboxylic group acrylic polymer 31 sharp intensity bands at 1407 and 1236 cm 1 are credited the stretching vibration of cc and c n bonds respectively another sharp intensity band at 1016 cm 1 confirmed the existence of alkene group ch 1 the bands at 920 840 and 711 cm 1 are assigned to the stretching and bending vibration of al o oh al almgoh and out of plane vibrations of coupled alo and si o respectively 32 the spectra of all samples illustrate a broad band in the region 900 670 cm 1 representing the aromatic ch in plane bending a medium intensity peak in the region of 1640 1620 cm 1 is attributed to the presence of organic nitrate other broad bands in the range of 800 700 cm 1 represent aliphatic chloro ccl stretching bands at 1609 1581 in the range of 1650 1550 1378 1340 1195 cm 1 after adsorption of dye is attributed to the deformation of nh group aromatic nitrate and sulfate group of bg molecule respectively 13 presence of additional bands in dye modified ben zeo acry coating confirms the surface area pore volume and pore size of ben zeo acry were estimated by n2 adsorption desorption isotherm using brunauer emmet teller bet method the bet analysis established surface area pore volume and pore size of ben zeo acry coating as 2 085 m2 g 0 0065 cm3 g and 125 3 å respectively the surface area ben zeo acry 2 085 m2 g was found to be less than cac 5 550 m2 g 33 addition of zeolite may decrease the surface area of coating however it increased the rate of adsorption and has the potential to remove 90 of the basic dye from 50 mg l solution within 30 min the results of particle size distribution analysis of bentonite zeolite acrylic polymer and ben zeo acry coating are shown in fig s 2 the particle size of ben zeo acry coating was found to be higher 35 96 μm compared to bentonite 6 050 μm zeolite 4 340 μm and acrylic polymer 6 080 μm due to the formation of composite coating according to the brunauer deming deming and teller bddt classification zeolite has microporous structure the microporous structure of zeolite contains metal framework units of si o al associated with negative charge o which results in the formation of negative charge on the external as well as interior surface of zeolite montmorillonite bentonite consists of two tetrahedral sheets of silica along with one octahedral sheet of alumina in 2 1 ratio and which form sandwiching like structure plate shaped particles of montmorillonite cover an average diameter of around 1 μm associated with 9 6 nm thickness 34 35 the interlayer spaces of bentonite montmorillonite sheets also absorb cationic dyes due to the presence of oxygen atoms of silica and alumina grauer et al have reported the adsorption of cationic dye by the interlayer spaces of both minerals montmorillonite and laponite 36 thus the oxygen atoms of zeolite and montmorillonite have potential to attract intercalating reagent cationic dye on the surface of zeolite as well as interlayer of montmorillonite which results in its adsorption on the basis of interaction of dye molecules brilliant green on the surface and interlayer of zeolite and montmorillonite a proposed mechanism of ben zeo acry is shown in scheme 1 36 37 alternation in morphology of ben zeo acry adsorbent coating of bg was examined by sem analysis fig 2 a b no significant difference in morphology was found after adsorption of bg on ben zeo acry however existence of additional chemical components in adsorbent coating was established by edx the edx analysis before and after adsorption of bg on ben zeo acry adsorbent are shown in fig 3 a b the existence of sio2 and al2o3 as major component together with other entities c ca ti na mg confirmed the attribution of bentonite and zeolite in composite coating 38 additionally presence of sulfur s and nitrogen n content established adsorption of bg on ben zeo acry coating the s and n are believed to have originated from bg c27h34n2o4s fig 3b chemical compositions of acry bentonite zeolite acry bentonite and acry ben zeo coatings using xrf analysis are listed in table 1 the contents of sio2 and al2o3 were found to be acry sio2 22 14 al2o3 14 57 bentonite sio2 70 80 al2o3 20 98 the contents of cao and tio2 in acrylic polymer were 39 55 and 20 81 respectively whiteness brightness and opacity of acrylic polymer occurred due to the highest amount of tio2 39 the chemical composition of other oxides was found to be 0 3 4 mgo fe2o3 na2o so3 k2o p2o5 sro zro2 nio after the mixing of acrylic polymer and bentonite the content of sio2 and al2o3 slightly decreased 39 08 and 16 42 the edx analysis also confirmed maximum content of si and al in the acry ben zeo coating 3 2 the effect of formulation on adsorbent coating different fillers bentonite zeolite caco3 tio2 and zno were used to prepare composite coatings which showed an optimal adsorption of bg in a short time fig 4 a among all fillers maximum removal of bg 83 4 was achieved by zeolite followed by bentonite caco3 tio2 and zno respectively in 30 min adsorption capacity of native adsorbent was calculated as zeolite 21 021 mg g bentonite 22 780 mg g caco3 18 850 mg g tio2 19 591 mg g and zno 19 190 mg g at equilibrium bentonite covered the highest bg removal efficiency 96 3 compared to zeolite 91 7 by using 50 mg l of bg solution thus the adsorption capacity and percentage removal showed that zeolite and bentonite were better compared to other fillers fig 4b based on experimental results zeolite showed the fastest adsorption compared to other fillers with an adsorption capacity 18 990 mg g within 30 min compared to other fillers feng yui et al reported that zeolite achieved fastest adsorption of methyl blue in 30 min 40 zeolite is negatively charged and has high specific surface area to get high metal selectivity therefore it showed high adsorption for cationic dye brilliant green 41 due to the fast absorption rate zeolite adsorbent coating also saturated faster compared to the other fillers in addition bentonite showed the highest removal efficiency for bg compared to the others fillers which might be due to its high adsorption capacity and more number of negative charges 42 on the basis of higher percentage removal and adsorption capacity of bg with the lowest contact time bentonite and zeolite were selected as fillers to prepare ben zeo acry composite adsorbent coating to achieve maximum adsorption of bg different formulations of ben zeo acry were prepared by varying the ratio of bentonite and zeolite as listed in table 2 it is inferred from table 2 that among three prepared formulations better dye removal efficiency 95 60 and maximum adsorption capacity 20 710 mg g was achieved by formulation f 3 which contain bentonite to zeolite ratio as 0 07 0 03 fig 5 a moreover compared to zeolite bentonite achieved the highest adsorption capacity with clear appearance in 30 min however bentonite reaction was slower compared to that of zeolite therefore a mixing volume ratio of 0 07 0 03 for bentonite and zeolite was selected to achieve the highest and fastest adsorption of bg the selection of bentonite in the form of major content was based on its cost effective economical and biodegradable nature 3 3 the effect of dye content the adsorption performance of ben zeo acry was examined by using different initial concentrations of bg fig 5b the results revealed that the adsorption of bg per unit mass increased 20 710 89 770 mg g with increasing dye content 50 200 mg l as a result of improvement in the driving force concentration gradient initially adsorption was fast however it slowed down over time which might be owing to the decreasing availability of occupying binding site or due to the repulsive force between the dye molecules 43 3 4 the effect of temperature temperature plays a key role on dye adsorption which alters the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent foo et al 2012 the adsorption efficiency of bg against time for different temperatures was tested fig 5c the results revealed improvement in dye adsorption qe from 42 6 49 3 mg g as a result of increasing temperature from 30 to 50 c significant improvement in dye removal capacity of bg from 95 to 99 1 at high temperature established the endothermic nature of dye adsorption on ben zeo acry 44 moreover increment in dye mobility leads to the diffusion of dye molecule due to declining solution viscosity 5 3 5 the effect of ph adsorption potential of composite materials also depends on solution ph which can be changed by altering solution medium from acid to base or vice versa salem elsharkawy hablas 2016 the adsorption potential of ben zeo acry towards bg is shown in fig 5d the result showed that the normal ph 5 64 provided the highest adsorption capacity qe 49 30 mg g and maximum dye removal capacity 99 1 compared to the other ph values studied the adsorption ability was found to increase from 4 5 46 96 mg g with increasing solution ph 3 5 on increasing solution ph 7 11 the adsorption efficiency drastically decreased 22 980 to 3 150 mg g reduction in adsorption was due to the excess of h at lower ph acidic medium which increased the number of positive charges thus the competition occurred between excess positive ions and the dye molecules 43 in basic medium increase of negative ions results in electrostatic attraction with bg molecules positively charged dye which decreased adsorption of dye 44 3 6 adsorption models adsorption of bg was examined using the langmuir freundlich temkin models and dubinin redushkevich model linear plots of these models are presented in fig s 3 a b and c and their resultant data are listed in table s 2 the value of r2 coefficient of determination was calculated from the graphs plotted the values of kf and n were determined through intercept and slope of the linear graph log qe against log ce the values of temkin isotherm constants at and b were calculated through intercept and slope of a linear plot qe against in ce the langmuir constant kl and qm were calculated through slope and intercept of linear plot of 1 qe against 1 ce and the values of the isotherms are listed in table s 2 the selection of isotherm was based on relative coefficient value r2 the value of r2 for langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin redushkevich models was found to be 0 9631 0 9097 and 0 9405 respectively on the basis of higher relative coefficient value the langmuir model was better suited for the adsorption of cationic antiseptic dye on ben zeo acry adsorbent coating the value of rl equilibrium factor was found to be 0 6535 which established favorable adsorption the langmuir model described homogenous adsorption and equilibrium took place after the dye completely occupied the adsorbent sites and no more space was available for further adsorption 45 3 7 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics of bg onto ben zeo acry adsorbent coating was evaluated using pseudo first order and the pseudo second order models on the experimental data as shown in table 4 the results of adsorption kinetics showed higher value of r2 0 998 for the pseudo second order model compared to that of the pseudo first order model r2 0 562 moreover the calculated adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe cal was similar to the experimental data qe exp adsorption was found to be controlled by chemisorption through electron sharing between adsorbent and adsorbate or covalent forces 46 47 3 8 thermodynamic studies thermodynamics parameters δgº δhº and δsº were calculated using van t hoff plots figs not shown the values of gibbs free energy δgº at different temperatures 303 313 and 323 k were found to be 5084 39 5930 92 and 6777 46 kj mol respectively kongkachuichay shitangkoon chinwongamorn 2002 and the value of δhº was calculated as 20565 51 j mol which confirm spontaneous and endothermic adsorption of bg onto the ben zeo acry 48 49 the positive value of δso 0 083 kj mol k implies improvement in randomness at the interface of solid solution throughout the adsorption of bg onto the ben zeo acry 4 cost effective adsorbent a comparative study on the cost of adsorbents was carried out and is listed in table 3 the study established that bentonite clay has the lowest price even less than 0 50 us kg which makes bentonite a more useful adsorbent compared to other high cost adsorbents such as calcium carbonate chitin chitosan and activated carbon on the other hand the cost of carbon nanotube cnt and organic inorganic composite was more than four to fifth folds compared to bentonite alone in terms of cost bentonite and zeolite are found to be the cheapest adsorbents as compared to other reported adsorbents in between zeolite and bentonite the cost of zeolite is higher compared to bentonite the main aim of the present study was to come up with cost effective adsorbent coating thus low cost natural adsorbents find their applicability in the treatment of industrial wastewaters table 3 5 conclusion cost effective ben zeo acry adsorbent coating has been successfully used for treatment of antiseptic dye from aqueous medium bentonite and zeolite in the weight ratio of 0 07 0 03 was found to be the most appropriate formulation for fabrication of composite coating which showed optimal adsorption efficiency towards bg the ben zeo acry adsorbent coating achieved 99 dye removal efficiency at room temperature the adsorption data followed the langmuir isotherm and the pseudo second order kinetics together with optimal adsorption 90 09 mg g the results of thermodynamic δgº δhº and δsº and kinetic studies confirm a spontaneous and endothermic process and pseudo second order

coating 1 introduction discharging of dyes from textiles paint and varnishes food pulp and paper plastics rubber and cosmetic industries have become a major source of water pollution 1 among all industries dye based textile industries are playing a key role in contaminating water bodies 2 among the different types of dyes brilliant green bg cationic dye is generally used in poultry feed to reduce proliferation of mold and dermatological agent 3 brilliant green dye is effectively used as an antiseptic in various products such as solutions and swabs to prevent infection 4 decomposition of bg releases co2 no2 and so2 5 and result in deficiency of o2 that damages the dna which affects human health 6 so it has become an important issue to treat dye containing effluents before discharge into natural water bodies in this regard a number of techniques such as coagulation and flocculation 7 membrane filtration 8 ozonation 9 photocatalytic degradation 10 ion exchange 11 12 and adsorption 13 have been effectively employed to remove the dye from wastewaters treatment of dyes through adsorption is an extensively used method owing to its low cost and easy operation 14 recently removal of

organic pollutants using activated carbon and polyaniline based nanocomposite is used for their high adsorption capacity however activated carbon is quite expensive and its powder forms are found to be difficult to handle and maintain to remove the draw backs associated with activated carbon and other expensive nanocomposite adsorbents research has been focused on fabrication of cost effective and eco friendly nature inspired composite adsorbent coatings chen and coworkers developed a granulated coating by using polymer latex in the mixture of fe al ce for treatment of fluoride in drinking water 18 in another study iron coated sand was developed for treatment of dyes from synthetic and wastewater 19 moreover sand coated material had insufficient adsorption potential and adsorbent is easily shredded off leaving the sand which may cause water pollution 20 thus to obtain chemically stable cost effective coating an adsorbent coating of clay was fabricated for removal of methylene blue from water 21 to improve dye removal efficiency in a short time and at low temperature bentonite supported coating was prepared by the combination of bentonite zeolite and acrylic polymer the present study deals with the development of bentonite zeolite acrylic polymer supported composite coating ben zeo acry for removal of cationic dyes fabrication of ben zeo acry adsorbent coating is the

using eq 16 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 ftir sem edx bet xrf and psd studies ftir spectra of acrylic polymer zeolite bentonite and benz zeo acry before and after adsorption are shown in fig 1 a b c d e the broad intensity band at 3440 cm 1 and a low intense peak at 3619 cm 1 ascribed the presence of free water molecules and the oh stretching of si oh group 30 a medium intensity band at 1713 cm 1 is attributed to stretching vibration of carboxylic group acrylic polymer 31 sharp intensity bands at 1407 and 1236 cm 1 are credited the stretching vibration of cc and c n bonds respectively another sharp intensity band at 1016 cm 1 confirmed the existence of alkene group ch 1 the bands at 920 840 and 711 cm 1 are assigned to the stretching and bending vibration of al o oh al almgoh and out of plane vibrations of coupled alo and si o respectively 32 the spectra of all samples illustrate a broad band in the region 900 670 cm 1 representing the aromatic ch in plane bending a medium intensity peak in the region of 1640 1620 cm 1 is attributed to the presence of organic nitrate other broad bands in the range of 800 700 cm 1 represent aliphatic chloro ccl stretching bands at 1609 1581 in the range of 1650 1550 1378 1340 1195 cm 1 after adsorption of dye is attributed to the deformation of nh group aromatic nitrate and sulfate group of bg molecule respectively 13 presence of additional bands in dye modified ben zeo acry coating confirms the surface area pore volume and pore size of ben zeo acry were estimated by n2 adsorption desorption isotherm using brunauer emmet teller bet method the bet analysis established surface area pore volume and pore size of ben zeo acry coating as 2 085 m2 g 0 0065 cm3 g and 125 3 å respectively the surface area ben zeo acry 2 085 m2 g was found to be less than cac 5 550 m2 g 33 addition of zeolite may decrease the surface area of coating however it increased the rate of adsorption and has the potential to remove 90 of the basic dye from 50 mg l solution within 30 min the results of particle size distribution analysis of bentonite zeolite acrylic polymer and ben zeo acry coating are shown in fig s 2 the particle size of ben zeo acry coating was found to be higher 35 96 μm compared to bentonite 6 050 μm zeolite 4 340 μm and acrylic polymer 6 080 μm due to the formation of composite coating according to the brunauer deming deming and teller bddt classification zeolite has microporous structure the microporous structure of zeolite contains metal framework units of si o al associated with negative charge o which results in the formation of negative charge on the external as well as interior surface of zeolite montmorillonite bentonite consists of two tetrahedral sheets of silica along with one octahedral sheet of alumina in 2 1 ratio and which form sandwiching like structure plate shaped particles of montmorillonite cover an average diameter of around 1 μm associated with 9 6 nm thickness 34 35 the interlayer spaces of bentonite montmorillonite sheets also absorb cationic dyes due to the presence of oxygen atoms of silica and alumina grauer et al have reported the adsorption of cationic dye by the interlayer spaces of both minerals montmorillonite and laponite 36 thus the oxygen atoms of zeolite and montmorillonite have potential to attract intercalating reagent cationic dye on the surface of zeolite as well as interlayer of montmorillonite which results in its adsorption on the basis of interaction of dye molecules brilliant green on the surface and interlayer of zeolite and montmorillonite a proposed mechanism of ben zeo acry is shown in scheme 1 36 37 alternation in morphology of ben zeo acry adsorbent coating of bg was examined by sem analysis fig 2 a b no significant difference in morphology was found after adsorption of bg on ben zeo acry however existence of additional chemical components in adsorbent coating was established by edx the edx analysis before and after adsorption of bg on ben zeo acry adsorbent are shown in fig 3 a b the existence of sio2 and al2o3 as major component together with other entities c ca ti na mg confirmed the attribution of bentonite and zeolite in composite coating 38 additionally presence of sulfur s and nitrogen n content established adsorption of bg on ben zeo acry coating the s and n are believed to have originated from bg c27h34n2o4s fig 3b chemical compositions of acry bentonite zeolite acry bentonite and acry ben zeo coatings using xrf analysis are listed in table 1 the contents of sio2 and al2o3 were found to be acry sio2 22 14 al2o3 14 57 bentonite sio2 70 80 al2o3 20 98 the contents of cao and tio2 in acrylic polymer were 39 55 and 20 81 respectively whiteness brightness and opacity of acrylic polymer occurred due to the highest amount of tio2 39 the chemical composition of other oxides was found to be 0 3 4 mgo fe2o3 na2o so3 k2o p2o5 sro zro2 nio after the mixing of acrylic polymer and bentonite the content of sio2 and al2o3 slightly decreased 39 08 and 16 42 the edx analysis also confirmed maximum content of si and al in the acry ben zeo coating 3 2 the effect of formulation on adsorbent coating different fillers bentonite zeolite caco3 tio2 and zno were used to prepare composite coatings which showed an optimal adsorption of bg in a short time fig 4 a among all fillers maximum removal of bg 83 4 was achieved by zeolite followed by bentonite caco3 tio2 and zno respectively in 30 min adsorption capacity of native adsorbent was calculated as zeolite 21 021 mg g bentonite 22 780 mg g caco3 18 850 mg g tio2 19 591 mg g and zno 19 190 mg g at equilibrium bentonite covered the highest bg removal efficiency 96 3 compared to zeolite 91 7 by using 50 mg l of bg solution thus the adsorption capacity and percentage removal showed that zeolite and bentonite were better compared to other fillers fig 4b based on experimental results zeolite showed the fastest adsorption compared to other fillers with an adsorption capacity 18 990 mg g within 30 min compared to other fillers feng yui et al reported that zeolite achieved fastest adsorption of methyl blue in 30 min 40 zeolite is negatively charged and has high specific surface area to get high metal selectivity therefore it showed high adsorption for cationic dye brilliant green 41 due to the fast absorption rate zeolite adsorbent coating also saturated faster compared to the other fillers in addition bentonite showed the highest removal efficiency for bg compared to the others fillers which might be due to its high adsorption capacity and more number of negative charges 42 on the basis of higher percentage removal and adsorption capacity of bg with the lowest contact time bentonite and zeolite were selected as fillers to prepare ben zeo acry composite adsorbent coating to achieve maximum adsorption of bg different formulations of ben zeo acry were prepared by varying the ratio of bentonite and zeolite as listed in table 2 it is inferred from table 2 that among three prepared formulations better dye removal efficiency 95 60 and maximum adsorption capacity 20 710 mg g was achieved by formulation f 3 which contain bentonite to zeolite ratio as 0 07 0 03 fig 5 a moreover compared to zeolite bentonite achieved the highest adsorption capacity with clear appearance in 30 min however bentonite reaction was slower compared to that of zeolite therefore a mixing volume ratio of 0 07 0 03 for bentonite and zeolite was selected to achieve the highest and fastest adsorption of bg the selection of bentonite in the form of major content was based on its cost effective economical and biodegradable nature 3 3 the effect of dye content the adsorption performance of ben zeo acry was examined by using different initial concentrations of bg fig 5b the results revealed that the adsorption of bg per unit mass increased 20 710 89 770 mg g with increasing dye content 50 200 mg l as a result of improvement in the driving force concentration gradient initially adsorption was fast however it slowed down over time which might be owing to the decreasing availability of occupying binding site or due to the repulsive force between the dye molecules 43 3 4 the effect of temperature temperature plays a key role on dye adsorption which alters the adsorption efficiency of the adsorbent foo et al 2012 the adsorption efficiency of bg against time for different temperatures was tested fig 5c the results revealed improvement in dye adsorption qe from 42 6 49 3 mg g as a result of increasing temperature from 30 to 50 c significant improvement in dye removal capacity of bg from 95 to 99 1 at high temperature established the endothermic nature of dye adsorption on ben zeo acry 44 moreover increment in dye mobility leads to the diffusion of dye molecule due to declining solution viscosity 5 3 5 the effect of ph adsorption potential of composite materials also depends on solution ph which can be changed by altering solution medium from acid to base or vice versa salem elsharkawy hablas 2016 the adsorption potential of ben zeo acry towards bg is shown in fig 5d the result showed that the normal ph 5 64 provided the highest adsorption capacity qe 49 30 mg g and maximum dye removal capacity 99 1 compared to the other ph values studied the adsorption ability was found to increase from 4 5 46 96 mg g with increasing solution ph 3 5 on increasing solution ph 7 11 the adsorption efficiency drastically decreased 22 980 to 3 150 mg g reduction in adsorption was due to the excess of h at lower ph acidic medium which increased the number of positive charges thus the competition occurred between excess positive ions and the dye molecules 43 in basic medium increase of negative ions results in electrostatic attraction with bg molecules positively charged dye which decreased adsorption of dye 44 3 6 adsorption models adsorption of bg was examined using the langmuir freundlich temkin models and dubinin redushkevich model linear plots of these models are presented in fig s 3 a b and c and their resultant data are listed in table s 2 the value of r2 coefficient of determination was calculated from the graphs plotted the values of kf and n were determined through intercept and slope of the linear graph log qe against log ce the values of temkin isotherm constants at and b were calculated through intercept and slope of a linear plot qe against in ce the langmuir constant kl and qm were calculated through slope and intercept of linear plot of 1 qe against 1 ce and the values of the isotherms are listed in table s 2 the selection of isotherm was based on relative coefficient value r2 the value of r2 for langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin redushkevich models was found to be 0 9631 0 9097 and 0 9405 respectively on the basis of higher relative coefficient value the langmuir model was better suited for the adsorption of cationic antiseptic dye on ben zeo acry adsorbent coating the value of rl equilibrium factor was found to be 0 6535 which established favorable adsorption the langmuir model described homogenous adsorption and equilibrium took place after the dye completely occupied the adsorbent sites and no more space was available for further adsorption 45 3 7 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics of bg onto ben zeo acry adsorbent coating was evaluated using pseudo first order and the pseudo second order models on the experimental data as shown in table 4 the results of adsorption kinetics showed higher value of r2 0 998 for the pseudo second order model compared to that of the pseudo first order model r2 0 562 moreover the calculated adsorption capacity at equilibrium qe cal was similar to the experimental data qe exp adsorption was found to be controlled by chemisorption through electron sharing between adsorbent and adsorbate or covalent forces 46 47 3 8 thermodynamic studies thermodynamics parameters δgº δhº and δsº were calculated using van t hoff plots figs not shown the values of gibbs free energy δgº at different temperatures 303 313 and 323 k were found to be 5084 39 5930 92 and 6777 46 kj mol respectively kongkachuichay shitangkoon chinwongamorn 2002 and the value of δhº was calculated as 20565 51 j mol which confirm spontaneous and endothermic adsorption of bg onto the ben zeo acry 48 49 the positive value of δso 0 083 kj mol k implies improvement in randomness at the interface of solid solution throughout the adsorption of bg onto the ben zeo acry 4 cost effective adsorbent a comparative study on the cost of adsorbents was carried out and is listed in table 3 the study established that bentonite clay has the lowest price even less than 0 50 us kg which makes bentonite a more useful adsorbent compared to other high cost adsorbents such as calcium carbonate chitin chitosan and activated carbon on the other hand the cost of carbon nanotube cnt and organic inorganic composite was more than four to fifth folds compared to bentonite alone in terms of cost bentonite and zeolite are found to be the cheapest adsorbents as compared to other reported adsorbents in between zeolite and bentonite the cost of zeolite is higher compared to bentonite the main aim of the present study was to come up with cost effective adsorbent coating thus low cost natural adsorbents find their applicability in the treatment of industrial wastewaters table 3 5 conclusion cost effective ben zeo acry adsorbent coating has been successfully used for treatment of antiseptic dye from aqueous medium bentonite and zeolite in the weight ratio of 0 07 0 03 was found to be the most appropriate formulation for fabrication of composite coating which showed optimal adsorption efficiency towards bg the ben zeo acry adsorbent coating achieved 99 dye removal efficiency at room temperature the adsorption data followed the langmuir isotherm and the pseudo second order kinetics together with optimal adsorption 90 09 mg g the results of thermodynamic δgº δhº and δsº and kinetic studies confirm a spontaneous and endothermic process and pseudo second order kinetics thus low cost natural inspired ben zeo acry coating can be effectively applied on industrial scale for removal of cationic antiseptic dyes in industrial waste water conflict of interest no

14418,the paper discusses the effectiveness of pollutants removal from pre treated domestic wastewater using a vertical flow filter with a plastic waste filling raw and treated wastewater samples were analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the removal of organic compounds cod and bod5 suspended solids and nitrogen as n nh4 depending on the filter filling type and working volume multidimensional clustering including the hierarchical and non hierarchical method proved to be an efficient source data clustering tool it was found that reduction of hardly biodegradable organic compounds as indicated by cod was the main criterion of affiliation to the respective clusters the studies lasted for four months and showed that operation of the filter filled with 0 5 v of the polyurethane foam sponge waste was characterized by the highest operating stability under varied organic loading rates olr from 5 0 to 80 2 g cod m 3 d 1 on average cod bod5 suspended solids and n nh4 reductions for that filter type were 87 8 91 0 80 0 and 74 1 respectively in the removal of hardly biodegradable organic compounds and suspended solids comparable performance figures were recorded for poly ethylene terephthalate flakes at organic loading rate values of 3 05 g cod m 3 d 1 in that case average reductions of cod and suspended solids were 87 1 and 84 0 respectively keywords poly ethylene terephthalate flakes polyurethane foam sponge vertical flow filter wastewater treatment 1 introduction the global plastics production and sales have been on the increase year by year which is believed by the industry to contribute to sustainable development by protecting natural resources including energy on the other hand it has the disadvantage of generating higher and higher volumes of plastic waste europe countries generate 25 1 million tons of post consumer plastic waste a year 1 2 on december 2nd 2015 the european commission proposed a package of laws concerning circular economy 3 the conventional economy model in the european union is based on the linear concept take make use dispose and ought to be switched to the circular model the circular product cycle of life model intends to preserve as long as possible the value of materials and energy contained in products intensified recycling and reuse of products save energy and reduce greenhouse emissions i e co2 which are expected to provide measurable benefits to the environment on december 18th 2017 the european parliament commission and council reached a political consensus about amendments in the directives on waste and circular economy commission confirmed that all plastic packaging is recyclable by 2030 in a long term perspective plastic recycling is to reach 65 by the year 2035 according to the concept proposed by the european commission 1 the statistics for the year 2014 say that as much as 54 of municipal waste in the eu member states is dumped in landfills or disposed of thermally and only 28 is recycled 4 in regions which continue to suffer from poor water supply and sewage infrastructure domestic wastewater treatment remains an issue the concept of onsite wastewater treatment systems owts is materialized for instance in the form of domestic wastewater treatment plants the most cost effective and uncomplicated solution involves sand bed filters a system comprising a septic tank and sand bed vertical flow filters vff is highly effective in reducing physical and chemical pollutants 5 but the sand bed filter has a tendency to get clogged this is often observed for high strength sewage concentrated wastewater represents cases of e g low water usage per capita sand as a filter filling material may be substituted with plastics they have a comparable specific surface area and a lower tendency to clog the filter in operation it is a common practice to use filter packets or bulk fragments another solution is to use materials of a 90 or higher porosity such as polyurethane foam sponges or polyethylene since the 90 s japanese researchers have tested six generations of sponges working in the system composed of a uasb upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor dhs downflow hanging sponge reactor 6 9 the dhs reactor has the advantage of working without extra aeration treatment of concentrated sewage by aerobic activated sludge technology is highly expensive especially with respect to operational costs the aeration costs increase linearly with increasing organic loading rate olr in concentrated sewage it is why interest in methods such uasb dhs or uasb cfid type sbr systems increases 10 conducting a proper assessment of input data and finding links between them may be difficult due to the large number of variables and cases as well as due to their complex group structure one of the most important elements of the statistical multidimensional data analysis is cluster analysis the use of various types of data grouping techniques i e the agglomeration method ward s method and the division method k means method makes it possible to find separate clusters cluster analysis therefore allows the creation and assessment of data classification and mining and thus more accurate and faster evaluation 11 this paper discusses the option of using shredded plastic waste in the form of pet flakes and polyurethane foam sponges in domestic wastewater plants the effectiveness of the removal of organics suspended solids and n nh4 were assessed using the multidimensional clustering method vs the type of plastic waste material and the working volume of the filter bed 2 materials and methods 2 1 filter with a plastic waste filling semi technical models with identical pvc columns were built to assess the performance of vertical flow filters filled with various types of waste material the experimental filters were cross sectional models of vff each column had 10 cm in inner diameter and was 100 cm high the total volume of each filter was 7 85 l the waste volumes were equivalent to 90 45 and 22 of the columns volume and the rest of the filters were empty a grate supporting the bed was installed at the bottom of each filter layer fig 1 shows a photo of the column model the filling materials included two types of plastic waste shredded pet flakes or fragmented polyurethane foam sponge puf fig 2 commercially available poly ethylene terephthalate pet bottles with caps made of high density polyethylene hdpe were shreded into flakes 6 12 mm or less nominal diameters d10 and d60 of pet waste were 1 6 mm and 2 7 mm respectively the coefficient of graining non uniformity d60 d10 had value of 1 7 which indicated one fraction grain size polyurethane foam sponges were manufactured by eurofoam polska llc puf waste came from elastic polyurethane material used in the furniture industry comfort foam in the automotive industry technical foam and as packaging material dividers foam sheets according to information provided by the manufacturer the polyurethane foams are types of both polyester and polyether foams with different rigidity 1 05 5 8 kpa for new foam and bulk density 13 5 40 0 kg m 3 for new foam 12 the dimensions of foam sponges waste were from 5 to 35 mm nominal diameters d10 and d60 of puf waste were 4 mm and 10 mm respectively the coefficient of graining non uniformity d60 d10 had the value of 2 5 which meant one fraction grain size bulk density for tested waste foam sponges was lower than new ones and ranged from 9 44 kg m 3 to 16 01 kg m 3 they featured high porosity of 94 5 13 the volume v occupied by the dry waste inside the columns was 7 06 l 3 53 l and 1 77 l it meant that the working volume based on the initial occupancy of the waste was 1 v 0 5 v and 0 25 v respectively the domestic sewage was first pretreated in a septic tank the effluent from the septic tank was fed onto the top of filters and then flowed gravitationally down the filter models were supplied periodically 24 doses per day each with the same volume of pre treated domestic wastewater of similar qualitative compositions the pvc columns were operated continuously under variable hydraulic conditions for a few weeks before being subjected to the analyses the studies lasted for four months and the olr was changing from 0 95 210 g cod m 3 d 1 2 2 physicochemical analysis the effectiveness of the organics removal from raw wastewater pretreated in a septic tank and treated wastewater filter effluents was assessed by analyzing seven indicators and parameters the organic compounds were determined as cod in accordance with pn iso 6060 2006 and as bod5 by the hg free method using the oxitop kit in accordance with en 1899 1 2002 nitrogen as n nh4 was determined by the colorimetric method set out in pn iso 5664 2002 suspended solids were determined by means of glass fiber filters in accordance with pn en 872 2007 oxygen saturation and ph were determined using the cpo 401 ph oxygen meter from elmetron those analyses were made following the commonly applied methods 14 2 3 statistical analysis the results were statistically analyzed using statistica 13 5 software mean minimum and maximum values standard deviation and coefficient of variation for these indicators of contamination were found for the materials tested the first step was the analysis of variance anova for the contamination indicators extent of removal of organics suspended solids nitrogen as n nh4 and parameters degree of oxygen saturation the values of analyzed sewage pollutants were used as dependent variables grouping variables were type and working volume of filter bed materials in order to establish which intergroup differences in the reduction rate were of the highest significance the non parametric kruskal wallis test was performed if the probability value p value is less than 0 05 there is a significant difference between the means for a given pair of group the next step was multidimensional clustering assumptions about the normality of data were not necessary but the data could not be strongly correlated with each other 11 the conducted correlation analysis showed high and logical correlation only for 9 correlation coefficients out of 105 the remaining coefficients were characterized by weak to average correlation as the investigated parameters and indicators were expressed in variable units the data variables for 132 samples of treated sewage cases were standardized prior to the hierarchical data clustering using the hierarchical data clustering agglomerates were determined by linking minor clusters obtained from the earlier steps of the algorithm 11 the group average method upgma unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages was used as the agglomeration method the euclidean distance was used as the measure of distance the resulting dendrogram illustrated the hierarchical structure of the source data this enabled for preliminary assessment of the number of clusters k which was then used in the non hierarchical analysis the present authors used the k means method it is similar to the algorithm proposed by stuart lloyd in 1982 where no cluster is a sub cluster of another cluster using the k means method the initially assumed cluster is corrected while performing the agglomeration procedure by transferring data between them this results in two outcomes firstly least differentiated objects are contained within a cluster and secondly the separate clusters formed are the most different from one another the algorithm is based on the euclidean distances matrix between objects the parameters indispensable in the agglomeration procedure based on the k means method agglomeration include starting centers i e objects from which the algorithm will start to construct clusters and the stop criterion which determines the way to stop the algorithm 11 the source data analysis n 132 cases gave clusters at different olr ranges between which differences were statistically significant for the assumed signifance level 0 05 clusters generated from the k means method of the clustering algorithm were compared using a single factor variance analysis for independent groups 3 results and discussion the raw domestic sewage had high contents of organic and biogenic pollutants average values of cod ammonia nitrogen and orthophosphates was 770 mgo2 l 1 173 mg l 1 and 51 mg l 1 respectively according to the literature this sewage could be classified as high strength domestic wastewater compared with common domestic wastewater 15 16 in countries with low water consumption raw wastewater is highly concentrated this causes that real quality parameters of septic tank effluents exceed the values presented in the literature 17 18 the qualitative characteristics of wastewater pretreated in the septic tank are shown in table 1 a statistical analysis indicates that the values of the indicators of contamination in the wastewater streams coming from the septic tank to the respective columns of the model systems were comparable to those reported in the literature 19 22 3 1 analysis of variance tables 2 and 3 present the results of non parametric kruskal wallis test for variables that lack normal distribution and show non homogeneous variance the conducted non parametric analysis of variance in the case of division into the type of filling revealed significant differences in elimination of cod at the significance level of α 0 05 during four months of studies under the variable olr however in the case of division into working volume statistically significant differences occurred for reduction of cod and reduction of ammonium nitrogen 0 25 v volume significantly deviated from other volumes 3 2 hierarchical data clustering since it was rather hard to see any significant relationship between the source data 132 cases 8 variables the source data using clustering methods were arranged by minimizing the number of original data these methods described the effectiveness of the pollutants removal while preserving the maximum amount of information a preliminary hierarchical arrangement with clustering enabled isolation of two major source data clusters after their standardization fig 3 shows the resulting structure of data in the set as determined by the group average method the linkage distance was assessed to be 19 the parameters characterized the respective model columns determining the degree of removal of the pollutants and degree of oxygen saturation were assigned to the first agglomeration group the second group was formed by the olr of these filters 3 3 non hierarchical data clustering the k means method described the reduction of cod bod5 n nh4 and suspended solids for different olr ranges the results are shown in the charts in figs 4 and 5 depending on their division to two or three clusters k 2 or k 3 3 3 1 filter filling material in dividing the filling material with respect to the plastic waste type we assumed two clusters for the parameters of treated wastewater the clusters were determined by different values of organic loading rates fig 4a and b when filtering the pretreated wastewater through a filter bed made of pet flakes the highest average reductions of cod bod5 and suspended solids were observed at the lowest organic loading rate of 3 05 g cod m 3 d 1 their values were 87 1 85 6 and 84 0 respectively table 4 a better result 62 5 on average was obtained for n nh4 removal from the wastewater at an organic loading rate of 31 9 g cod m 3 d 1 wąsik and chmielowski 19 who investigated the effectiveness of ammonia and pathogens removal during domestic wastewater treatment in a system comprising a septic tank and vertical flow filter filled with pet flakes observed a nearly 67 average reduction of n nh4 in the model system with the columns filled polyurethane foam lower reduction values were observed at increasing organic loading rates both for organic compounds and n nh4 table 4 for olr values of 1 9 3 6 and 6 8 kg cod m 3 d 1 tawfik et al 23 obtained comparable results in their study on greywater treatment doma et al 24 who investigated a uasb dhs system showed decreasing values of cod and bod5 reduction for increasing organic loading rates ranging from 1 1 5 9 kg cod m 3 d 1 almeida et al 25 observed this relationship only for n nh4 removal olr values ranging from 0 3 to 0 65 kg cod m 3 d 1 did not affect bod5 removal in a tricking filter filled with rotosponge after removing a majority of readily biodegradable pollutants in the uasb reactor in our study the highest organics reduction of approximately 80 was noticed for an olr average value of 8 6 g cod m 3 d 1 in this case cod reduction was ithree times higher than the value obtained at an olr of 68 7 g cod m 3 d 1 in their bench scale tests of the uasb dhs reactor model beas et al 26 reported 67 2 cod reduction and 80 9 bod5 reduction for olr 0 86 kg cod m 3 d 1 the anova analysis of the results of the four month test of pet flakes as a filtering material used in domestic wastewater treatment indicates that statistically significant differences were not observed only for elimination of bod5 table 5 an analysis of variance for the test samples of wastewater treated with puf as the filtering material table 3 determined the degree of the organics removal cod and bod5 as indicators as the data groups with statistic variance differences at the significance level of 0 05 the results f and p values seem to indicate cod reduction as the main criterion of the source data clustering in respect of the filter bed type a determinant of data allocation to the two clusters 3 3 2 filter bed working volume when evaluating the results of the treated wastewater samples the number of clusters was assumed to be three depending on the filter bed working volume fig 5a c the three clusters were determined by different olr ranges tables 6 8 and there were significant differences between the dimensions of interest as indicated by the results of anova table in the column filled with the lowest volume of waste 0 25 v fig 4a bod5 reduction increased to an average value of 83 6 as the olr values decreased from 154 3 32 1 g cod m 3 d 1 the degree of reduction of hardly biodegradable organic compounds for that olr value was on average 66 3 table 6 the highest degree of reduction of suspended solids for the working volume of 0 25 v may be accounted for by the prevailing growth conditions which were unfavorable mainly for the nitrifying bacteria the pollution retention time was too short and the degree of oxygen saturation was too low these two factors adversely affected sludge retention time srt similar observations were reported by tawfik et al 23 in their greywater treatment study in the analyzed period of studiesauthors noticed that a working volume of 0 25 v gave the lowest microorganism growth organic suspended solids in the filtrate consisted mainly of dead bacteria washed out from the filter bed thebod5 cod ratio for treated wastewater indicated the presence of hardly biodegradable chemical compounds only average cod reduction ab 88 turned out the highest for the lowest olr value 5 0 g cod m 3 d 1 comparably high values were obtained by tawfik et al 23 in their greywater treatment study based on the use of non waste filling materials and by bundy et al 27 in domestic wastewater treatment with effluent recirculation for an olr value of 0 2 kg cod m 3 d 1 as regards the reduction of readily biodegradable organic compounds and n nh4 the best effectiveness 91 0 and 74 1 respectively on average were obtained for the column with a working volume of 0 5 v operated at an organic loading rate of 80 2 g cod m 3 d 1 table 7 the degree of reduction of bod and n nh4 increased with increasing olr values this is accounted for by the fact that the material was highly porous providing desirable mass transfer conditions for oxygen substrate nutrients and promoting the growth of heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria 28 in the study on the uasb dhs system using a sponge curtain second generation dhs 29 the authors obtained reduction efficiencies for cod bod5 and n nh4 at the levels of 84 95 and 61 respectively according to tandukar et al 7 who studied the third and fourth generation dhs systems reduction of cod bod5 and n nh4 was 95 98 and 86 respectively it is worth noting that n nh4 concentration in treated in a system comprising a septic tank and filter bed wastewater was roughly five times as high as that in the uasb dhs system for the highest working volume 1 v reduction of cod and suspended solids was on average 79 and 83 respectively at the lowest olr 3 3 g cod m 3 d 1 table 8 reduction of n nh4 varied slightly between 57 and 65 the highest reduction of readily biodegradable compounds 91 6 on average was obtained for an organic loading rate of 27 9 g cod m 3 d 1 tandukar et al 7 and tawfik et al 23 obtained comparable bod5 reduction using a dhs system combined with the anaerobic uasb reactor an analysis of variance table 9 for the working volume of 0 25 v indicated that statistically significant differences were not observed only in the case of suspended solids reduction according to the analysis of variance relating to post treatment wastewater samples for a filter bed composed of 0 5 v of waste material reduction of cod and n nh4 were clusters in which statistic variance differences were at a significance level of 0 05 an analysis of variance for the working volume v indicates that statistically significant differences were not observed only in the case of n nh4 reduction also in the source data classification in respect of the working volume of the filter filling reduction of cod is the main criterion which determines the affiliation to one of the three clusters 4 conclusions it was found that the multidimensional clustering method enabled data mining of the input data comprising data on the degree of removal of organic compounds reduction of n nh4 and degree of oxygen saturation vs the type and working volume of the filter bed by creation of clusters where cod reduction was the main grouping criterion the reuse of shredded pet bottles and fragmented puf foam sponge waste as a filling of vertical flow filter proved to be effective method in a treatment of wastewater pretreated in a septic tank in comparison with the existing aerobic systems this very simple and cost effective method which requires no external aeration seems an promising solution for treatment of high strength domestic wastewater especially in developing countries since this type of plastic waste is very effective it is suggested that a long term study including its regenerated form should also be conducted plastics will make a significant contribution to the circular economy when their entire life cycle is investigated nowadays life cycle thinking of plastic waste is essential for the environment 
14418,the paper discusses the effectiveness of pollutants removal from pre treated domestic wastewater using a vertical flow filter with a plastic waste filling raw and treated wastewater samples were analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the removal of organic compounds cod and bod5 suspended solids and nitrogen as n nh4 depending on the filter filling type and working volume multidimensional clustering including the hierarchical and non hierarchical method proved to be an efficient source data clustering tool it was found that reduction of hardly biodegradable organic compounds as indicated by cod was the main criterion of affiliation to the respective clusters the studies lasted for four months and showed that operation of the filter filled with 0 5 v of the polyurethane foam sponge waste was characterized by the highest operating stability under varied organic loading rates olr from 5 0 to 80 2 g cod m 3 d 1 on average cod bod5 suspended solids and n nh4 reductions for that filter type were 87 8 91 0 80 0 and 74 1 respectively in the removal of hardly biodegradable organic compounds and suspended solids comparable performance figures were recorded for poly ethylene terephthalate flakes at organic loading rate values of 3 05 g cod m 3 d 1 in that case average reductions of cod and suspended solids were 87 1 and 84 0 respectively keywords poly ethylene terephthalate flakes polyurethane foam sponge vertical flow filter wastewater treatment 1 introduction the global plastics production and sales have been on the increase year by year which is believed by the industry to contribute to sustainable development by protecting natural resources including energy on the other hand it has the disadvantage of generating higher and higher volumes of plastic waste europe countries generate 25 1 million tons of post consumer plastic waste a year 1 2 on december 2nd 2015 the european commission proposed a package of laws concerning circular economy 3 the conventional economy model in the european union is based on the linear concept take make use dispose and ought to be switched to the circular model the circular product cycle of life model intends to preserve as long as possible the value of materials and energy contained in products intensified recycling and reuse of products save energy and reduce greenhouse emissions i e co2 which are expected to provide measurable benefits to the environment on december 18th 2017 the european parliament commission and council reached a political consensus about amendments in the directives on waste and circular economy commission confirmed that all plastic packaging is recyclable by 2030 in a long term perspective plastic recycling is to reach 65 by the year 2035 according to the concept proposed by the european commission 1 the statistics for the year 2014 say that as much as 54 of municipal waste in the eu member states is dumped in landfills or disposed of thermally and only 28 is recycled 4 in regions which continue to suffer from poor water supply and sewage infrastructure domestic wastewater treatment remains an issue the concept of onsite wastewater treatment systems owts is materialized for instance in the form of domestic wastewater treatment plants the most cost effective and uncomplicated solution involves sand bed filters a system comprising a septic tank and sand bed vertical flow filters vff is highly effective in reducing physical and chemical pollutants 5 but the sand bed filter has a tendency to get clogged this is often observed for high strength sewage concentrated wastewater represents cases of e g low water usage per capita sand as a filter filling material may be substituted with plastics they have a comparable specific surface area and a lower tendency to clog the filter in operation it is a common practice to use filter packets or bulk fragments another solution is to use materials of a 90 or higher porosity such as polyurethane foam sponges or polyethylene since the 90 s japanese researchers have tested six generations of sponges working in the system composed of a uasb upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor dhs downflow hanging sponge reactor 6 9 the dhs reactor has the advantage of working without extra aeration treatment of concentrated sewage by aerobic activated sludge technology is highly expensive especially with respect to operational costs the aeration costs increase linearly with increasing organic loading rate olr in concentrated sewage it is why interest in methods such uasb dhs or uasb cfid type sbr systems increases 10 conducting a proper assessment of input data and finding links between them may be difficult due to the large number of variables and cases as well as due to their complex group structure one of the most important elements of the statistical multidimensional data analysis is cluster analysis the use of various types of data grouping techniques i e the agglomeration method ward s method and the division method k means method makes it possible to find separate clusters cluster analysis therefore allows the creation and assessment of data classification and mining and thus more accurate and faster evaluation 11 this paper discusses the option of using shredded plastic waste in the form of pet flakes and polyurethane foam sponges in domestic wastewater plants the effectiveness of the removal of organics suspended solids and n nh4 were assessed using the multidimensional clustering method vs the type of plastic waste material and the working volume of the filter bed 2 materials and methods 2 1 filter with a plastic waste filling semi technical models with identical pvc columns were built to assess the performance of vertical flow filters filled with various types of waste material the experimental filters were cross sectional models of vff each column had 10 cm in inner diameter and was 100 cm high the total volume of each filter was 7 85 l the waste volumes were equivalent to 90 45 and 22 of the columns volume and the rest of the filters were empty a grate supporting the bed was installed at the bottom of each filter layer fig 1 shows a photo of the column model the filling materials included two types of plastic waste shredded pet flakes or fragmented polyurethane foam sponge puf fig 2 commercially available poly ethylene terephthalate pet bottles with caps made of high density polyethylene hdpe were shreded into flakes 6 12 mm or less nominal diameters d10 and d60 of pet waste were 1 6 mm and 2 7 mm respectively the coefficient of graining non uniformity d60 d10 had value of 1 7 which indicated one fraction grain size polyurethane foam sponges were manufactured by eurofoam polska llc puf waste came from elastic polyurethane material used in the furniture industry comfort foam in the automotive industry technical foam and as packaging material dividers foam sheets according to information provided by the manufacturer the polyurethane foams are types of both polyester and polyether foams with different rigidity 1 05 5 8 kpa for new foam and bulk density 13 5 40 0 kg m 3 for new foam 12 the dimensions of foam sponges waste were from 5 to 35 mm nominal diameters d10 and d60 of puf waste were 4 mm and 10 mm respectively the coefficient of graining non uniformity d60 d10 had the value of 2 5 which meant one fraction grain size bulk density for tested waste foam sponges was lower than new ones and ranged from 9 44 kg m 3 to 16 01 kg m 3 they featured high porosity of 94 5 13 the volume v occupied by the dry waste inside the columns was 7 06 l 3 53 l and 1 77 l it meant that the working volume based on the initial occupancy of the waste was 1 v 0 5 v and 0 25 v respectively the domestic sewage was first pretreated in a septic tank the effluent from the septic tank was fed onto the top of filters and then flowed gravitationally down the filter models were supplied periodically 24 doses per day each with the same volume of pre treated domestic wastewater of similar qualitative compositions the pvc columns were operated continuously under variable hydraulic conditions for a few weeks before being subjected to the analyses the studies lasted for four months and the olr was changing from 0 95 210 g cod m 3 d 1 2 2 physicochemical analysis the effectiveness of the organics removal from raw wastewater pretreated in a septic tank and treated wastewater filter effluents was assessed by analyzing seven indicators and parameters the organic compounds were determined as cod in accordance with pn iso 6060 2006 and as bod5 by the hg free method using the oxitop kit in accordance with en 1899 1 2002 nitrogen as n nh4 was determined by the colorimetric method set out in pn iso 5664 2002 suspended solids were determined by means of glass fiber filters in accordance with pn en 872 2007 oxygen saturation and ph were determined using the cpo 401 ph oxygen meter from elmetron those analyses were made following the commonly applied methods 14 2 3 statistical analysis the results were statistically analyzed using statistica 13 5 software mean minimum and maximum values standard deviation and coefficient of variation for these indicators of contamination were found for the materials tested the first step was the analysis of variance anova for the contamination indicators extent of removal of organics suspended solids nitrogen as n nh4 and parameters degree of oxygen saturation the values of analyzed sewage pollutants were used as dependent variables grouping variables were type and working volume of filter bed materials in order to establish which intergroup differences in the reduction rate were of the highest significance the non parametric kruskal wallis test was performed if the probability value p value is less than 0 05 there is a significant difference between the means for a given pair of group the next step was multidimensional clustering assumptions about the normality of data were not necessary but the data could not be strongly correlated with each other 11 the conducted correlation analysis showed high and logical correlation only for 9 correlation coefficients out of 105 the remaining coefficients were characterized by weak to average correlation as the investigated parameters and indicators were expressed in variable units the data variables for 132 samples of treated sewage cases were standardized prior to the hierarchical data clustering using the hierarchical data clustering agglomerates were determined by linking minor clusters obtained from the earlier steps of the algorithm 11 the group average method upgma unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages was used as the agglomeration method the euclidean distance was used as the measure of distance the resulting dendrogram illustrated the hierarchical structure of the source data this enabled for preliminary assessment of the number of clusters k which was then used in the non hierarchical analysis the present authors used the k means method it is similar to the algorithm proposed by stuart lloyd in 1982 where no cluster is a sub cluster of another cluster using the k means method the initially assumed cluster is corrected while performing the agglomeration procedure by transferring data between them this results in two outcomes firstly least differentiated objects are contained within a cluster and secondly the separate clusters formed are the most different from one another the algorithm is based on the euclidean distances matrix between objects the parameters indispensable in the agglomeration procedure based on the k means method agglomeration include starting centers i e objects from which the algorithm will start to construct clusters and the stop criterion which determines the way to stop the algorithm 11 the source data analysis n 132 cases gave clusters at different olr ranges between which differences were statistically significant for the assumed signifance level 0 05 clusters generated from the k means method of the clustering algorithm were compared using a single factor variance analysis for independent groups 3 results and discussion the raw domestic sewage had high contents of organic and biogenic pollutants average values of cod ammonia nitrogen and orthophosphates was 770 mgo2 l 1 173 mg l 1 and 51 mg l 1 respectively according to the literature this sewage could be classified as high strength domestic wastewater compared with common domestic wastewater 15 16 in countries with low water consumption raw wastewater is highly concentrated this causes that real quality parameters of septic tank effluents exceed the values presented in the literature 17 18 the qualitative characteristics of wastewater pretreated in the septic tank are shown in table 1 a statistical analysis indicates that the values of the indicators of contamination in the wastewater streams coming from the septic tank to the respective columns of the model systems were comparable to those reported in the literature 19 22 3 1 analysis of variance tables 2 and 3 present the results of non parametric kruskal wallis test for variables that lack normal distribution and show non homogeneous variance the conducted non parametric analysis of variance in the case of division into the type of filling revealed significant differences in elimination of cod at the significance level of α 0 05 during four months of studies under the variable olr however in the case of division into working volume statistically significant differences occurred for reduction of cod and reduction of ammonium nitrogen 0 25 v volume significantly deviated from other volumes 3 2 hierarchical data clustering since it was rather hard to see any significant relationship between the source data 132 cases 8 variables the source data using clustering methods were arranged by minimizing the number of original data these methods described the effectiveness of the pollutants removal while preserving the maximum amount of information a preliminary hierarchical arrangement with clustering enabled isolation of two major source data clusters after their standardization fig 3 shows the resulting structure of data in the set as determined by the group average method the linkage distance was assessed to be 19 the parameters characterized the respective model columns determining the degree of removal of the pollutants and degree of oxygen saturation were assigned to the first agglomeration group the second group was formed by the olr of these filters 3 3 non hierarchical data clustering the k means method described the reduction of cod bod5 n nh4 and suspended solids for different olr ranges the results are shown in the charts in figs 4 and 5 depending on their division to two or three clusters k 2 or k 3 3 3 1 filter filling material in dividing the filling material with respect to the plastic waste type we assumed two clusters for the parameters of treated wastewater the clusters were determined by different values of organic loading rates fig 4a and b when filtering the pretreated wastewater through a filter bed made of pet flakes the highest average reductions of cod bod5 and suspended solids were observed at the lowest organic loading rate of 3 05 g cod m 3 d 1 their values were 87 1 85 6 and 84 0 respectively table 4 a better result 62 5 on average was obtained for n nh4 removal from the wastewater at an organic loading rate of 31 9 g cod m 3 d 1 wąsik and chmielowski 19 who investigated the effectiveness of ammonia and pathogens removal during domestic wastewater treatment in a system comprising a septic tank and vertical flow filter filled with pet flakes observed a nearly 67 average reduction of n nh4 in the model system with the columns filled polyurethane foam lower reduction values were observed at increasing organic loading rates both for organic compounds and n nh4 table 4 for olr values of 1 9 3 6 and 6 8 kg cod m 3 d 1 tawfik et al 23 obtained comparable results in their study on greywater treatment doma et al 24 who investigated a uasb dhs system showed decreasing values of cod and bod5 reduction for increasing organic loading rates ranging from 1 1 5 9 kg cod m 3 d 1 almeida et al 25 observed this relationship only for n nh4 removal olr values ranging from 0 3 to 0 65 kg cod m 3 d 1 did not affect bod5 removal in a tricking filter filled with rotosponge after removing a majority of readily biodegradable pollutants in the uasb reactor in our study the highest organics reduction of approximately 80 was noticed for an olr average value of 8 6 g cod m 3 d 1 in this case cod reduction was ithree times higher than the value obtained at an olr of 68 7 g cod m 3 d 1 in their bench scale tests of the uasb dhs reactor model beas et al 26 reported 67 2 cod reduction and 80 9 bod5 reduction for olr 0 86 kg cod m 3 d 1 the anova analysis of the results of the four month test of pet flakes as a filtering material used in domestic wastewater treatment indicates that statistically significant differences were not observed only for elimination of bod5 table 5 an analysis of variance for the test samples of wastewater treated with puf as the filtering material table 3 determined the degree of the organics removal cod and bod5 as indicators as the data groups with statistic variance differences at the significance level of 0 05 the results f and p values seem to indicate cod reduction as the main criterion of the source data clustering in respect of the filter bed type a determinant of data allocation to the two clusters 3 3 2 filter bed working volume when evaluating the results of the treated wastewater samples the number of clusters was assumed to be three depending on the filter bed working volume fig 5a c the three clusters were determined by different olr ranges tables 6 8 and there were significant differences between the dimensions of interest as indicated by the results of anova table in the column filled with the lowest volume of waste 0 25 v fig 4a bod5 reduction increased to an average value of 83 6 as the olr values decreased from 154 3 32 1 g cod m 3 d 1 the degree of reduction of hardly biodegradable organic compounds for that olr value was on average 66 3 table 6 the highest degree of reduction of suspended solids for the working volume of 0 25 v may be accounted for by the prevailing growth conditions which were unfavorable mainly for the nitrifying bacteria the pollution retention time was too short and the degree of oxygen saturation was too low these two factors adversely affected sludge retention time srt similar observations were reported by tawfik et al 23 in their greywater treatment study in the analyzed period of studiesauthors noticed that a working volume of 0 25 v gave the lowest microorganism growth organic suspended solids in the filtrate consisted mainly of dead bacteria washed out from the filter bed thebod5 cod ratio for treated wastewater indicated the presence of hardly biodegradable chemical compounds only average cod reduction ab 88 turned out the highest for the lowest olr value 5 0 g cod m 3 d 1 comparably high values were obtained by tawfik et al 23 in their greywater treatment study based on the use of non waste filling materials and by bundy et al 27 in domestic wastewater treatment with effluent recirculation for an olr value of 0 2 kg cod m 3 d 1 as regards the reduction of readily biodegradable organic compounds and n nh4 the best effectiveness 91 0 and 74 1 respectively on average were obtained for the column with a working volume of 0 5 v operated at an organic loading rate of 80 2 g cod m 3 d 1 table 7 the degree of reduction of bod and n nh4 increased with increasing olr values this is accounted for by the fact that the material was highly porous providing desirable mass transfer conditions for oxygen substrate nutrients and promoting the growth of heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria 28 in the study on the uasb dhs system using a sponge curtain second generation dhs 29 the authors obtained reduction efficiencies for cod bod5 and n nh4 at the levels of 84 95 and 61 respectively according to tandukar et al 7 who studied the third and fourth generation dhs systems reduction of cod bod5 and n nh4 was 95 98 and 86 respectively it is worth noting that n nh4 concentration in treated in a system comprising a septic tank and filter bed wastewater was roughly five times as high as that in the uasb dhs system for the highest working volume 1 v reduction of cod and suspended solids was on average 79 and 83 respectively at the lowest olr 3 3 g cod m 3 d 1 table 8 reduction of n nh4 varied slightly between 57 and 65 the highest reduction of readily biodegradable compounds 91 6 on average was obtained for an organic loading rate of 27 9 g cod m 3 d 1 tandukar et al 7 and tawfik et al 23 obtained comparable bod5 reduction using a dhs system combined with the anaerobic uasb reactor an analysis of variance table 9 for the working volume of 0 25 v indicated that statistically significant differences were not observed only in the case of suspended solids reduction according to the analysis of variance relating to post treatment wastewater samples for a filter bed composed of 0 5 v of waste material reduction of cod and n nh4 were clusters in which statistic variance differences were at a significance level of 0 05 an analysis of variance for the working volume v indicates that statistically significant differences were not observed only in the case of n nh4 reduction also in the source data classification in respect of the working volume of the filter filling reduction of cod is the main criterion which determines the affiliation to one of the three clusters 4 conclusions it was found that the multidimensional clustering method enabled data mining of the input data comprising data on the degree of removal of organic compounds reduction of n nh4 and degree of oxygen saturation vs the type and working volume of the filter bed by creation of clusters where cod reduction was the main grouping criterion the reuse of shredded pet bottles and fragmented puf foam sponge waste as a filling of vertical flow filter proved to be effective method in a treatment of wastewater pretreated in a septic tank in comparison with the existing aerobic systems this very simple and cost effective method which requires no external aeration seems an promising solution for treatment of high strength domestic wastewater especially in developing countries since this type of plastic waste is very effective it is suggested that a long term study including its regenerated form should also be conducted plastics will make a significant contribution to the circular economy when their entire life cycle is

14419,this article reports the preparation of ceramic membranes using inexpensive precursors for microfiltration of bacteria the membranes were prepared via uniaxial compaction method and sintered at different temperatures in the ranges of 900 1100 c the membranes were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd thermo gravimetric tg and scanning electron microscopic sem analysis the porosity water permeability average pore size ph and chlorine tolerance of membranes were also evaluated it was found that the porosity decreased from 42 to 34 with increasing temperature on the other hand the pore size and water permeability increased from 180 to 650 nm and 3 24 10 4 to 3 60 10 3 l m2hpa respectively with increasing temperature the membranes showed excellent ph and chlorine tolerance based on the results the membrane fired at 900 c was selected as an optimum membrane and subjected to the microfiltration of bacteria the membrane provided bacterial rejection of 90 24 with good permeate flux of 50 65 l m2h in addition the fouling test was conducted by microfiltration of synthetic polyethylene glycol peg solutions it was analysed that the cake filtration model offered good fit with the measured experimental values of both bacteria and peg membrane cleaning experiment was conducted using water surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate alkali naoh and ultrasonication it was found that the ultrasonication method provide maximum flux recovery during bacterial cleaning whereas alkali treatment was sufficient to clean the peg henceforth the low cost membranes with better properties can be utilized for bacteria removal application in biotechnology field keywords clays ph tolerance quartz ceramics bacteria 1 introduction ceramic membranes show excellent performance in different applications including oil water separation heavy metal removal dye separation bacteria removal and wastewater treatment 1 5 ceramic membranes can be operated over a wide ph range 1 13 high pressure 30 bar and high temperature up to 500 c moreover ceramic membranes can be effectively cleaned using acid and basic medium and their performance remains stable over several years even under harsh environmental conditions however the ceramic membranes are expensive compared to polymeric membranes to reduce the membrane cost the research in the field of ceramic membrane is now targeted towards the utilization of clay based raw materials many articles have described the production of ceramic membranes using natural clays 6 11 however the reported membranes were sintered at higher sintering temperature 1125 1250 c also the membranes possessed larger pore size ranging between 4 5 and11 μm to reduce the pore size and sintering temperature the mixed clay materials were deployed for the fabrication of membranes during the recent times for instance the membrane prepared using clay materials such as kaolin ballclay cristoballite pyrophyllite feldspar calcium carbonate sodium metasilicate boric acid and quartz provided lower pore size 0 2 μm 12 similarly the lower pore size membrane 0 1 μm was prepared at lower sintering temperature 900 c using mixed clay materials 13 nandi et al 14 produced the circular disc shape membranes from inexpensive clays the membranes provided average pore size in the ranges of 550 to 810 nm with varying sintering temperature 850 1000 c monash et al 15 manufactured a ceramic membrane with pore size of 0 96 μm at a sintering temperature of 900 c using kaolin based raw materials in another work monash et al 16 fabricated the cheap membranes pore size 0 83 μm porosity 36 using mixture of precursors a low cost tubular mullite membrane was prepared using mixture of kaolin clay 67 wt and distilled water 33 wt by extrusion method the mean pore size of the membrane was evaluated to be 0 451 μm with porosity of 42 6 17 the extensive survey of above literatures concluded that the mixed clay raw material composition provided sub micron pore size 0 1 1 μm at lower sintering temperatures in biotechnology field bacteria have been widely used to produce valuable products such as enzymes nano particles biodegradable biopolymers also the recombinant bacteria particularly e coli have been used for the production of hormones after fermentation the bacterial cells have to be separated from fermentation broth for the most part centrifugation process is used as the bio separation process to remove the bacterial cells and cell debris however the centrifugation is a slow process and expensive in terms of power requirement ultrafiltration and microfiltration processes are widely accepted as the efficient process to remove the biological particle such as bacteria and yeast very few literatures demonstrate the removal of bacteria using membrane process 18 22 judd and till 18 conducted the microfiltration of synthetic bacterial solutions using polypropylene membrane 0 45 μm and obtained 0 5 log reduction value lrv using the polycarbonate track etched membrane the microfiltration of bacteria was carried out with bacterial concentration of 104 colony forming unit per milliliter cfu ml 19 lebleu et al 20 deployed cellulose membrane for separation of e coli from synthetic bacterial solutions feed concentration of 104 cfu ml simonsis and basson 21 deployed ceramic membrane for microfiltration of bacteria and obtained 4 lrv for feed concentration of 6 104 cfu ml bielefeldt et al 22 conducted the microfiltration of bacteria employing ceramic membrane and obtained 3 4 lrv at a flow rate of 1 9 l per hour lph for bacteria concentration of 106 cfu ml vinod et al 23 used flat plate membrane to perform the microfiltration of washed e coli suspension with dry cell weight of 1 2 g l persson et al 24 conducted the microfiltration using ceramic membrane for the separation of lactic acid producing bacteria from fermentation broth thus based on literature review it can be analyzed that majority investigations focused on the relevance of polymeric membranes for separation of bacterial solutions it is well known that polymeric membranes are easily susceptible to biological attacks moreover polymeric membranes can t be subjected to rigorous cleaning schemes due to their lower corrosive resistance on the other hand very few literatures describe the applicability of ceramic membrane for separation of bacterial solution hence from research perspective low cost ceramic membrane technology needs to be developed for the microfiltration of bacterial solution preliminary investigations with low cost ceramic membranes need to assess upon their competence in terms of fouling and process parameter optimization in summary work conducted till date confirms that very less low cost ceramic membranes have been investigated for separation of bacterial cells using dead end filtration considering this as a primary objective this article describes the dead end microfiltration of aqueous bacterial solutions using inexpensive ceramic membrane uni axial compaction method was adopted as a simple technique to fabricate the membranes and sintered at lower temperatures 900 1100 c the membranes were characterized to measure the porosity water permeability average pore size ph and chlorine tolerance the microfiltration of bacteria was conducted to investigate the effect of pressure and feed concentration on the permeate flux and bacteria removal moreover the fouling experiment was conducted using synthetic peg solution subsequently the fouling mechanism during microfiltration of bacteria and peg was investigated using different pore blocking models furthermore the cleaning test was performed using different cleaning agents eventually the production cost of the membranes was estimated based on raw materials pressing and sintering cost 2 experimental 2 1 materials in this work various inexpensive precursors such as china clay powder tulsi 052 quartz and calcium carbonate were utilized to fabricate the membranes and their relevant composition is presented in table 1 the composition was formulated using trial and error based approach the different raw materials selected in this work serve for different functional attributes china clay provides refractory characteristics to the membranes whereas quartz enhances the thermal and mechanical stability of the membrane calcium carbonate plays two different role namely pore forming agent as well as sintering aid the formation of porous texture in the membrane is due to calcium carbonate which will dissociate into cao and co2 gas during sintering the evolved co2 gas creates the porous texture in the ceramic membranes china clay mined in india and quartz powders were purchased from royalty minerals mumbai calcium carbonate was purchased from loba chem ltd all these precursors were used without any pretreatment the major constituents of china clay are alumina silicates chemical composition analysis shows that the main oxides in the clay sample are sio2 59 76 wt and al2o3 21 84 wt whereas other oxides such as fe2o3 3 60 wt na2o 6 68 wt k2o 1 79 wt cao 2 01 wt mgo 0 96 wt and loi 2 82 wt are present in small quantities 2 2 synthesis of membrane the membranes were synthesized by uni axial compaction method using the raw material composition given in table 1 briefly the powder mixture was thoroughly mixed with 4 ml of 2 polyvinyl alcohol pva mol wt 72 000 using mortar and pestle the necessary quantity of powder mixture was pressed in stainless steel mould at a pressure of 50 mpa using hydraulic press guru ramdas machine works raipur india the obtained membranes 52 mm diameter and 5 mm thickness were dried at 100 c for 12 h to eliminate the moisture from the membrane using hot air oven pooja scientific instruments india subsequently the membranes were fired at different sintering temperatures 900 1100 c for 5 h using pid controlled muffle furnace nanotec chennai india the membranes were rubbed using abrasive sheet no 220 and washed in ultrasonicator pci analytics india using water as solvent finally the membranes were dried at 100 c for 12 h 2 3 membrane characterization the membranes were characterized by tg xrd and sem analysis porosity clean water permeability average pore size ph and chlorine tolerance tga was performed using thermogravimetric analyzer mettler toledo tga1 sf 1100 under nitrogen atmosphere at a flow rate of 70 ml min to identify the thermal degradation behavior of raw material xrd was conducted using xrd instrument bruker axs instrument germany to investigate the phase alteration occurred during firing surface morphology of membranes was examined using scanning electron microscope zeis evo18 porosity of membranes was calculated by archimedes s principle using water as wetting liquid for this the initial weight of membranes w1 was first evaluated after drying the membranes at 100 c for 6 h next the membranes were immersed in distilled water and kept for 24 h in room temperature finally the wet weight w2 of the membranes was evaluated after taking out from water the porosity was calculated using the following expression 1 ε w 2 w 1 ρ w a t e r 100 v m e m where w2 w1 represents the wet and dry weight of membranes respectively ρwater denotes density of water and νmem is volume of the membranes the clean water flux j l m2h of membranes was measured using continuous dead end filtration setup fig 1 the filtration setup consists of feed tank diaphragm pump stainless steel membrane module capacity 300 ml and control valves the membrane module consists of cylindrical top portion and bottom plate which has a membrane holder the membrane was fixed in the membrane holder and feed was given in the top cylindrical section the pressure was generated by adjusting the valves fitted in the feed and bypass tube the volume of water collected q per unit time was measured using an electronic weighing balance at various pressures 69 345 kpa at an interval of 5 min for 30 min the flux was calculated using the following relation 2 j q a t where q denotes the permeate volume t is the time and a is the membrane area m2 for permeation the pore size and permeability of the membranes were calculated using the equation 25 3 j v ε r 2 δ p 8 μ l l h δ p where jv δp lh l r ε and μ represents the water flux transmembrane pressure water permeatbility pore length pore radius porosity and viscosity of water respectively the permeability was determined from water flux measured at different applied pressure the data was regressed by a linear curve and slope value provides the permeability of membrane the pore radius r of membrane is then calculated by assuming existence of cylindrical pores in the membranes using the following equation deduced from eq 3 as 4 r 8 μ l l h ε 0 5 ph tolerance of membranes was measured at different ph in the ranges of 1 14 for this the membranes were immersed in different solutions having different ph for seven consecutive days at room temperature ph of the solutions was adjusted using naoh or hcl finally the weight of ph exposed membranes was compared with dry membrane weight the weight loss due to ph of the solutions indicates the ph tolerance of the membranes chlorine tolerance was tested by exposing the membranes into aqueous chlorine solutions five different chlorine concentrations 1000 2000 3000 4000 and 5000 mg l were prepared from stock aqueous sodium hypochlorite naocl 4 6 active chlorine the membranes were immersed for seven consecutive days and then compared the weight of chlorine exposed membrane with dry membrane weight the weight loss of chlorine exposed membranes shows the chlorine tolerance of the membranes 2 4 microfiltration of bacteria the microfiltration mf test was carried out in a continuous dead end filtration setup using synthetic bacterial solutions for this the bacterial strain e coli was isolated from soil and grown in nutrient broth at 37 c for 24 h after that the solution was centrifuged and bacterial cells were separated the bacterial cells are typically rod shaped and are about 2 μm long and 0 5 μm in diameter the bacterial cells were then re suspended in millipore water to prepare the feed bacterial solution the microfiltration was carried out at different pressures 69 345 kpa and five different feed concentrations 1 3 g l the flux was noted at every 10 min for 240 min of experiment time the bacterial rejection was measured using the following equation 5 r c f c p c f 100 where c f and c p denotes the concentration of bacteria in feed and permeate respectively the bacterial concentration was estimated using uv vis spectrophotometer the bacterial solution was calibrated by measuring the absorbance of various known bacterial concentrations at a wavelength of 600 nm 4 the absorbance versus bacterial concentration mg l was found to be linear the calibration chart was used to determine the unknown bacterial concentration 2 5 microfiltration of peg the filtration test was performed using synthetic peg mol wt 4000 da solutions at a feed concentration and pressure of 2 g l and 345 kpa respectively the peg solution was prepared by mixing of peg with pure water using magnetic stirrer the permeate flux was determined at every 10 min for 240 min of experimental time the peg rejection was also calculated using eq 5 the concentration of peg was measured at a wave length of 200 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer 2 6 investigation of membrane fouling fouling mechanism of membrane during mf of bacteria and peg was analysed using complete standard and intermediate pore blocking models and cake filtration model 26 during complete pore blocking the active surface area of membrane for fluid permeation decreases proportionally to the permeate volume due to deposition of bigger solutes on membrane pores which completely block the membrane pores on the other hand the standard pore blocking takes places when solute sizes are lesser than membrane pore size during standard pore blocking the solute deposition in the internal pore walls of membrane causes the reduction in pore volume however a comparable size of the solute with the membrane pore size facilitates the solute to either settle on membrane surface or block the membrane pores such a scenario gives rise to intermediate pore blocking the cake filtration takes place when the solutes colloids macromolecules deposits on the surface of membrane which give rise to a thick cake layer on membrane surface the gel layer gives excess resistance to the fluid flow the fouling mechanism can be represented through the fitness of measured flux reduction with any of the following expressions a complete pore blocking model 6 in j 1 in j 0 1 k b t b standard pore blocking model 7 j 0 5 j 0 0 5 k s t c intermediate pore blocking model 8 j 1 j 0 1 k i t d cake filtration model 9 j 2 j 0 2 k c t thus the fitness of the above model for measured flux decline will be based on the regression based fitness for a respective plot of flux term for example ln j 1 in complete pore blocking case and time term t for all cases the obtained slope for example k b in case of complete pore blocking and intercept for example ln j0 1 in case of complete pore blocking convey the relevance of mass transfer coefficients and instantaneous flux values 2 7 membrane cleaning the fouled membrane during microfiltration of bacteria and peg was cleaned using water an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate sds an alkaline solution sodium hydroxide naoh and ultrasonication the sds and naoh was purchased from loba chem ltd and used without any purification the sds was primarily chosen as an anionic surfactant which reduces the surface tension of in contact molecules and enhances the hydrophilic strength of membrane 17 moreover sds plays a significant role in bacterial cell lysis that solubilizes the protein and lipid present in the cell membrane of bacteria the alkali naoh reduces the number of bond between the organic foulants and membrane surface that lead to membrane is to be cleaned ultrasonication is an environment friendly process that removes the adhered bacterial cells from the membrane pore walls the cleaning experiment was conducted as follows firstly the distilled water di was circulated for 15 min without applying any pressure to separate cake layer from the membrane surface secondly the sodium dodecyl sulphate solution concentration of 2 wt was passed through the membrane for 15 min at a pressure of 345 kpa thirdly the sodium hydroxide solution ph 12 was passed through the membrane for 15 min at a pressure of 345 kpa eventually the membrane was taken out and subjected to the ultrasonication for 10 min after each cleaning steps the water flux was measured at 345 kpa for 1 h to determine the flux recovery 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane preparation and characterization thermal analysis was conducted to identify the temperature regimes where the major weight loss occurs during sintering also tga enables the determination of sintering temperature required for fabrication of ceramic membrane sintering temperature is a key parameter which significantly influences the membrane characteristics fig 2 illustrates the tga dta curves of raw powder mixture used for the preparation of membrane the total weight loss of the powder mixture is calculated to be 13 the weight loss of sample below 150 c can be attributed to removal of moisture from the powder mixture about 12 9 of weight loss is observed in the temperature range between 520 780 c this is due to thermal disintegration of caco3 into cao and co2 the formation of co2 occurred at 730 c which enhances the porous structure of the membrane porosity and pore size of membranes are mainly related to the evolved gas of co2 in dta curve an endothermic peak is observed at 730 c which is attributed to formation of anorthite via las layered aluminosilicate 27 further the sample mixture exhibits insignificant weight loss at temperature above 780 c thus it is clear that the minimum sintering temperature for the membrane preparation should be above 780 c xrd graphs of raw powder mixture and the membranes sintered at different temperatures are presented in fig 3 as shown quartz q calicite c illitte i and kaolinite k are the main phases appeared in the raw powder after firing the peak corresponds to calcite caco3 vanished due to disintegration of caco3 into cao and co2 similarly the peak of kaolinite is disappeared in the entire graphs which are due to conversion of kaolinite to metakaolinite 8 however the characteristic peak of quartz is most intense and remains unchanged in all diffractograms this shows the thermal stability of the quartz powder it is also noted that the anorthite phase is present in the sintered membranes the formation of anorthite cao al2o3 2sio2 is attributed to reaction of cao with alumina and quartz present in the raw material in this regard it could be pointed out that the formation of anorthite is illustrated by tga dta curve in the previous subsection at a temperature of 730 c the formation of anorthite is complying with the result presented in the literature 27 at the temperature of 1000 c the peak of illite i is found to be disappeared on the other hand the mullite phase is appeared the mullite is formed due to phase transformation of kaolin to mullite via metakolinite by decomposition of kaolin structure the critical observation of peaks in the sintered membranes shows that no other significant phase transformation occurs above 900 1100 c from the xrd analysis it can be concluded the minimum sintering temperature required for fabrication membrane should be above 780 c thus minimum sintering temperature of 900 c selected in this work is justified fig 4 depicts the sem images of membranes fired at different temperatures in the ranges of 900 1100 c it is visible that all the membranes possess rough and porous morphological texture however there is a significant variation in surface morphology of membranes fired at various temperatures this is attributed to densification and growth of grain boundaries at elevated temperature moreover the increase in temperature causes enlargement in pore diameter it is also analysed that all the membranes have crack free surface the variation of membrane porosity with sintering temperature is depicted in fig 5 a it is observed that the porosity of membranes varied significantly with sintering temperature the porosity is measured to be 42 37 and 34 for the membranes sintered at 900 1000 and 1100 c respectively as observed the porosity of membranes decreases with increasing sintering temperature this is attributed to densification of membranes at higher temperature moreover it can be analyzed from porosity trend reported by dong et al 28 that the porosity decreases from 45 77 to 17 69 while the sintering temperature increases from 1300 to 1400 c thus it is apparent that the membranes reported in this work showed significantly higher porosity the similar fashion of porosity trends was also reported in other literatures 15 29 fig 5 b d illustrates the time dependent water flux of membranes measured at various trans membrane pressures it is seen that the clean water flux is constant over entire time duration for all trans membrane pressures which indicates that there is no any resistance for pure water flow this is in consistent with the result presented in the literature 30 the variation of clean water permeability and pore size with sintering temperature is illustrated in fig 6 it is noted that the permeability increases from 3 24 10 4 to 3 60 10 3 l m2hpa with an increase in the sintering temperature similarly the mean pore size of membranes varied from 180 to 650 nm with varying sintering temperature 900 1100 c thus indicates that higher sintering temperature enabled the increase in pore size this is due to increase in grain growth at higher temperature which results in enlargement in membrane pore size moreover it can be pointed out that the reported pore size 180 650 nm is significantly lower than the average pore size obtained from other clay materials namely apatite 6 μm moroccan clay 11 μm and cordierite 8 66 μm 7 8 28 the variation of clean water flux with trans membrane pressure is also depicted in fig 6 inset the variation of clean water flux with pressure is found to be linear moreover the clean water flux increases from 25 41 to 115 06 l m2h 214 29 to 899 63 l m2h and 363 11 to 1576 95 l m2h with increasing pressure from 69 to 345 kpa for the membranes sintered at 900 1000 and 1100 c the ph tolerance of membranes was measured to identify their suitability in highly corrosive medium in view of this the membranes were exposed in different ph solutions 1 14 the membranes showed insignificant weight loss in all ph conditions this indicates that the membranes are stable over a broader ph range from this study it can be concluded that the membranes can be applied for any process application whose feed ph range vary 1 14 further the membranes can permit stronger faster and more effective cleaning procedure to be used the free chlorine tolerance of membranes was tested at different chlorine concentrations 1000 5000 mg l during chlorine treatment no weight loss is observed which shows that the membranes are more resistant to chlorine attack it can be pointed out that the prepared membranes can be subjected to disinfection using highly concentrated chlorine solutions table 2 presents the overall characteristics of membranes fabricated at different sintering temperatures further a comparison of the membranes with the other membranes reported in literatures is given in table 3 from tables 2 and 3 it can be observed that the prepared membranes are comparatively good than other low cost membranes described in the literatures 6 11 14 17 28 31 34 considering the membrane properties pore size of 180 nm and porosity of 42 the membrane sintered at 900 c is selected as an optimum membrane for bacterial removal application 3 2 microfiltration of bacteria 3 2 1 effect of transmembrane pressure fig 7 a illustrates the permeate flux reduction with time at different applied pressures 69 345 kpa for feed concentration of 2 g l the initial flux is higher than the steady state flux and thereby infers that permeate flux decline occurred during the first 30 min of operation the flux declines very sharply due to quicker membrane pores blocking and bacterial cells adhesion subsequently the flux declines gradually and reaches pseudo steady state at initial stage pore blocking mechanism contributes to flux reduction which is generally quick process the flux reduction in later stage is attributed to concentration polarization and formation of cake layer further the variation of permeate flux with applied pressure is also presented in fig 7a inset the permeate flux increases with increasing pressure which is due to enhancement in the driving force the enhancement of flux with applied pressure didn t follow linear trend this represents that there is excess resistance to permeate flow which may be due to pore blocking concentration polarization and gel layer formation it can also be noted that the rate of pore blocking increases with increasing pressure fig 7a at higher pressure the convection of bacterial cells towards the membrane surface increases and hence more and more bacterial cells are deposited into the porous membrane texture that reduces the membrane flux the permeate flux reduction for the first 30 min is more at higher pressure for instance at a fixed feed concentration of 2 g l the flux reduction at 69 kpa is 54 while at 345 kpa the flux reduction is much higher and is about 64 the maximum permeate flux of 50 65 l m2h is obtained at a pressure of 345 kpa after 60 min of filtration operation the variation of bacterial removal with varying pressure is shown in fig 7 b the bacterial removal decreases from 99 32 to 90 24 with increasing pressure from 69 to 345 kpa when increasing the pressure the bacterial cells are forced to penetrate through the membrane and reaches the permeate stream however the reduction in bacterial removal with pressure is not significant for all pressures the membrane provided good rejection above 90 from this investigation the pressure of 345 kpa is considered to be the best choice and further study was conducted at this pressure 3 2 2 effect of feed concentration fig 7 c depicts the variation of permeate flux as a function of time at different feed concentrations 1 3 g l and fixed pressure of 345 kpa it can be viewed that permeate flux decreases with increasing feed concentration the increase in feed concentration enhances the formation of cake layer with larger thickness that provides resistance to solvent flow through the membrane higher feed concentration indicates higher quantity of bacterial cells and hence enhanced adhesion of bacterial cells onto the membrane surface to form a gel layer with greater thickness the maximum average permeate flux of 69 71 l m2h is observed at lower feed concentration of 1 g l after 60 min operation fig 7c inset as shown in fig 7 d the rejection of bacteria increases with increasing feed concentration the rejection increases from 67 90 to 95 09 with increasing feed concentration from 1 to 3 g l as discussed earlier increasing feed concentration leads to formation gel layer on the membrane surface with larger thickness this cake layer acts as a secondary filtering medium and provides resistance to flow of bacterial cells therefore the rejection is enhanced at higher feed concentration the maximum average separation of 95 09 is observed at higher feed concentration of 3 g l generally the bacterial removal occurs based on the sieving mechanism where the solute size greater than the pore size of membrane the e coli cells are comparatively bigger size 2 μm 0 5 μm than the average pore size 180 nm of membrane however about 5 of unexpected bacteria permeation is observed during filtration this is due to presence of few larger pores in the membrane texture considering permeate flux and rejection the pressure of 345 kpa and concentration of 2 g l is considered as an optimum process condition to achieve adequate bacterial removal 90 24 with good permeate flux of 50 65 l m2h the reported flux and rejection values are average of first 60 min of filtration the separation performance of the membrane 90 24 removal at concentration of 2 g l and pressure of 345 kpa is comparable with other polymeric and ceramic membranes 18 22 simonsis and basson 21 reported 4 lrv during microfiltration of bacteria conducted with ceramic membrane for feed concentration of 6 104 cfu ml bielefeldt et al 22 obtained 3 4 lrv with ceramic membrane during microfiltration of bacteria performed at a flow rate of 1 9 lph and bacteria concentration of 106 cfu ml judd and till 18 obtained 0 5 lrv with polypropylene 0 45 μm membrane during microfiltration of synthetic bacterial e coli solution using the polycarbonate track etched membrane about 3 2 lrv was achieved with bacteria concentration of 104 cfu ml 19 lebleu et al 20 reported approximately 7 lrv during removal of e coli at a feed concentration of 104 cfu ml using the cellulose membrane this comparative statement clarifies that the membrane reported in this work performs well in terms of bacteria removal compared to the other membranes presented in the literatures 3 3 microfiltration of peg the microfiltration was performed at a fixed pressure of 345 kpa and concentration of 2 g l this experiment was performed for the purpose of analyzing membrane fouling during filtration of polymeric materials fig 8 depicts the flux profile of membrane during microfiltration of peg it is seen that the flux reduces gradually till the end of the operation the permeate flux decreases from 114 to 44 33 l m2h and total flux reduction is evaluated to be 61 12 at the end of operation the molecular size of peg is approximately 4 kda which is smaller than membrane pore size therefore the peg solutes can readily penetrate through the membrane in this context the flux reduction can be attributed to adhesion of polymer in the walls of pores and formation cake layer on the surface of membrane the total rejection of peg after 60 min operation is evaluated to be 40 with average permeate flux of 95 85 l m2h the low rejection is obvious because mean pore size of membrane is bigger than the peg solute size 3 4 investigation of membrane fouling the pertinent fouling mechanism was identified using different pore blocking models during microfiltration of bacteria and peg solutions the linear fit of flux versus time for various pore blocking models for bacteria and peg is presented in fig 9 for both cases the cake filtration model gives the perfect fit among all other models the initial flux values j0 at t 0 correlation coefficient r2 and slope for various pore blocking models are given in table 4 amongst all models the cake filtration model provides highest r2 value of 0 99 and 0 96 for bacteria and peg respectively thus it is inferred that cake filtration followed by intermediate pore blocking mechanism represent the most pertinent flux reduction koltuniewicz et al 35 and nandi et al 36 have also observed the cake filtration model represents the pertinent fouling mechanism during dead end filtration of oil emulsions the values of slope k for various pore blocking models are also given in table 4 a physical interpretation of k values confirms that its magnitude is indicating upon fouling severity moreover it can be noted that the initial flux j0 determined from diverse models are little lower than the experimental results except cake filtration model therefore cake filtration offers good agreement to the experimental result in comparison with the other models it is also expected that cake filtration only contributes strongly towards external fouling and therefore is promising to affirm higher membrane shelf life due to insignificant impact of external cake layer deposition on irreversible membrane fouling 3 5 membrane cleaning the flux recovery of membrane with different cleaning agents is shown in fig 10 a b it is visible that the flux recovery is markedly improved at each cleaning steps for both cases the flux recovery due to distilled water is found to be 30 and 64 for bacteria and peg respectively the distilled water cleaning can be attributed to removal of cake layer from membrane surface sds and naoh cleaning was lead to enhancing the flux recovery upto 51 and 94 for bacteria and peg respectively the sds is a strong detergent that involves in bacterial cell lysis by denaturing the protein and lipids of cell membrane causing desorption between bacterial cells and membrane surface also sds reduces the surface tension and increases the repulsion between the membrane surfaces and negatively charged organic foulants that lead to membrane is to be cleaned 17 in general alkaline solutions are recommended for organic fouled membranes the alkaline solution naoh decreases the interaction between organic foulants and membrane surface during alkali treatment the membrane fouled by peg is reached maximum 94 flux recovery however the membrane fouled by bacteria was further subjected to ultrasonic cleaning which provided about 88 flux recovery ultrasonic cleaning effect can be attributed to removal of bacterial cells present in the pore path of membrane by ultrasonic vibration in this context it can be concluded that the chemical cleaning naoh is more suitable for cleaning of peg whereas ultrasonication is more competitive for cleaning of membrane fouled by bacteria 4 cost estimation the applicability of ceramic membrane for industrial process is primarily depending upon their cost due to this the preparation of clay based inexpensive ceramic membrane is targeted for various industrial as well as laboratory applications in this context the preparation of ceramic membrane at lower price will create a huge impact in ceramic membrane market in this work the ceramic membranes were synthesized using china clay powder calcium carbonate and quartz the detail of price estimation is presented in table 5 considering raw material pressing and sintering cost the total price of fabricated ceramic membrane is estimated to be rs m2 987 81 m2 15 19 the membrane prepared in this work is very cheaper than the other membranes presented in the literatures 14 15 5 conclusions the ceramic membranes were successfully prepared using cheaper ceramic precursors via uniaxial compaction method the porosity of membranes decreased from 42 and 34 with increasing sintering temperature the pore size of membranes was found to be 180 to 650 nm and water permeability was determined to be 3 24 10 4 to 3 60 10 3 l m2hpa for the membranes sintered at 900 to 1100 c respectively the ph and chlorine tolerance of membranes was found to be excellent for all membranes the membrane offered rejection of 90 24 and 40 with good permeate flux of 50 65 and 95 85 l m2h during separation of bacteria and peg respectively the cake filtration model offered good agreement to represent pertinent flux decline with the experimental data for both bacteria and peg microfiltration the cleaning study showed that ultrasonic cleaning was more suitable along with chemical treatment for cleaning of bacteria on the other hand the alkali treatment along with distilled water was adequate to clean the peg the total price of membrane was determined to be rs m2 987 81 m215 19 in summary the present work reveals the capability of the prepared membrane towards the separation of bacteria from its aqueous solution acknowledgement the authors wish to show their sincere gratitude to department of science and technology dst serb government of india for the financial assistance to perform this work 
14419,this article reports the preparation of ceramic membranes using inexpensive precursors for microfiltration of bacteria the membranes were prepared via uniaxial compaction method and sintered at different temperatures in the ranges of 900 1100 c the membranes were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd thermo gravimetric tg and scanning electron microscopic sem analysis the porosity water permeability average pore size ph and chlorine tolerance of membranes were also evaluated it was found that the porosity decreased from 42 to 34 with increasing temperature on the other hand the pore size and water permeability increased from 180 to 650 nm and 3 24 10 4 to 3 60 10 3 l m2hpa respectively with increasing temperature the membranes showed excellent ph and chlorine tolerance based on the results the membrane fired at 900 c was selected as an optimum membrane and subjected to the microfiltration of bacteria the membrane provided bacterial rejection of 90 24 with good permeate flux of 50 65 l m2h in addition the fouling test was conducted by microfiltration of synthetic polyethylene glycol peg solutions it was analysed that the cake filtration model offered good fit with the measured experimental values of both bacteria and peg membrane cleaning experiment was conducted using water surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate alkali naoh and ultrasonication it was found that the ultrasonication method provide maximum flux recovery during bacterial cleaning whereas alkali treatment was sufficient to clean the peg henceforth the low cost membranes with better properties can be utilized for bacteria removal application in biotechnology field keywords clays ph tolerance quartz ceramics bacteria 1 introduction ceramic membranes show excellent performance in different applications including oil water separation heavy metal removal dye separation bacteria removal and wastewater treatment 1 5 ceramic membranes can be operated over a wide ph range 1 13 high pressure 30 bar and high temperature up to 500 c moreover ceramic membranes can be effectively cleaned using acid and basic medium and their performance remains stable over several years even under harsh environmental conditions however the ceramic membranes are expensive compared to polymeric membranes to reduce the membrane cost the research in the field of ceramic membrane is now targeted towards the utilization of clay based raw materials many articles have described the production of ceramic membranes using natural clays 6 11 however the reported membranes were sintered at higher sintering temperature 1125 1250 c also the membranes possessed larger pore size ranging between 4 5 and11 μm to reduce the pore size and sintering temperature the mixed clay materials were deployed for the fabrication of membranes during the recent times for instance the membrane prepared using clay materials such as kaolin ballclay cristoballite pyrophyllite feldspar calcium carbonate sodium metasilicate boric acid and quartz provided lower pore size 0 2 μm 12 similarly the lower pore size membrane 0 1 μm was prepared at lower sintering temperature 900 c using mixed clay materials 13 nandi et al 14 produced the circular disc shape membranes from inexpensive clays the membranes provided average pore size in the ranges of 550 to 810 nm with varying sintering temperature 850 1000 c monash et al 15 manufactured a ceramic membrane with pore size of 0 96 μm at a sintering temperature of 900 c using kaolin based raw materials in another work monash et al 16 fabricated the cheap membranes pore size 0 83 μm porosity 36 using mixture of precursors a low cost tubular mullite membrane was prepared using mixture of kaolin clay 67 wt and distilled water 33 wt by extrusion method the mean pore size of the membrane was evaluated to be 0 451 μm with porosity of 42 6 17 the extensive survey of above literatures concluded that the mixed clay raw material composition provided sub micron pore size 0 1 1 μm at lower sintering temperatures in biotechnology field bacteria have been widely used to produce valuable products such as enzymes nano particles biodegradable biopolymers also the recombinant bacteria particularly e coli have been used for the production of hormones after fermentation the bacterial cells have to be separated from fermentation broth for the most part centrifugation process is used as the bio separation process to remove the bacterial cells and cell debris however the centrifugation is a slow process and expensive in terms of power requirement ultrafiltration and microfiltration processes are widely accepted as the efficient process to remove the biological particle such as bacteria and yeast very few literatures demonstrate the removal of bacteria using membrane process 18 22 judd and till 18 conducted the microfiltration of synthetic bacterial solutions using polypropylene membrane 0 45 μm and obtained 0 5 log reduction value lrv using the polycarbonate track etched membrane the microfiltration of bacteria was carried out with bacterial concentration of 104 colony forming unit per milliliter cfu ml 19 lebleu et al 20 deployed cellulose membrane for separation of e coli from synthetic bacterial solutions feed concentration of 104 cfu ml simonsis and basson 21 deployed ceramic membrane for microfiltration of bacteria and obtained 4 lrv for feed concentration of 6 104 cfu ml bielefeldt et al 22 conducted the microfiltration of bacteria employing ceramic membrane and obtained 3 4 lrv at a flow rate of 1 9 l per hour lph for bacteria concentration of 106 cfu ml vinod et al 23 used flat plate membrane to perform the microfiltration of washed e coli suspension with dry cell weight of 1 2 g l persson et al 24 conducted the microfiltration using ceramic membrane for the separation of lactic acid producing bacteria from fermentation broth thus based on literature review it can be analyzed that majority investigations focused on the relevance of polymeric membranes for separation of bacterial solutions it is well known that polymeric membranes are easily susceptible to biological attacks moreover polymeric membranes can t be subjected to rigorous cleaning schemes due to their lower corrosive resistance on the other hand very few literatures describe the applicability of ceramic membrane for separation of bacterial solution hence from research perspective low cost ceramic membrane technology needs to be developed for the microfiltration of bacterial solution preliminary investigations with low cost ceramic membranes need to assess upon their competence in terms of fouling and process parameter optimization in summary work conducted till date confirms that very less low cost ceramic membranes have been investigated for separation of bacterial cells using dead end filtration considering this as a primary objective this article describes the dead end microfiltration of aqueous bacterial solutions using inexpensive ceramic membrane uni axial compaction method was adopted as a simple technique to fabricate the membranes and sintered at lower temperatures 900 1100 c the membranes were characterized to measure the porosity water permeability average pore size ph and chlorine tolerance the microfiltration of bacteria was conducted to investigate the effect of pressure and feed concentration on the permeate flux and bacteria removal moreover the fouling experiment was conducted using synthetic peg solution subsequently the fouling mechanism during microfiltration of bacteria and peg was investigated using different pore blocking models furthermore the cleaning test was performed using different cleaning agents eventually the production cost of the membranes was estimated based on raw materials pressing and sintering cost 2 experimental 2 1 materials in this work various inexpensive precursors such as china clay powder tulsi 052 quartz and calcium carbonate were utilized to fabricate the membranes and their relevant composition is presented in table 1 the composition was formulated using trial and error based approach the different raw materials selected in this work serve for different functional attributes china clay provides refractory characteristics to the membranes whereas quartz enhances the thermal and mechanical stability of the membrane calcium carbonate plays two different role namely pore forming agent as well as sintering aid the formation of porous texture in the membrane is due to calcium carbonate which will dissociate into cao and co2 gas during sintering the evolved co2 gas creates the porous texture in the ceramic membranes china clay mined in india and quartz powders were purchased from royalty minerals mumbai calcium carbonate was purchased from loba chem ltd all these precursors were used without any pretreatment the major constituents of china clay are alumina silicates chemical composition analysis shows that the main oxides in the clay sample are sio2 59 76 wt and al2o3 21 84 wt whereas other oxides such as fe2o3 3 60 wt na2o 6 68 wt k2o 1 79 wt cao 2 01 wt mgo 0 96 wt and loi 2 82 wt are present in small quantities 2 2 synthesis of membrane the membranes were synthesized by uni axial compaction method using the raw material composition given in table 1 briefly the powder mixture was thoroughly mixed with 4 ml of 2 polyvinyl alcohol pva mol wt 72 000 using mortar and pestle the necessary quantity of powder mixture was pressed in stainless steel mould at a pressure of 50 mpa using hydraulic press guru ramdas machine works raipur india the obtained membranes 52 mm diameter and 5 mm thickness were dried at 100 c for 12 h to eliminate the moisture from the membrane using hot air oven pooja scientific instruments india subsequently the membranes were fired at different sintering temperatures 900 1100 c for 5 h using pid controlled muffle furnace nanotec chennai india the membranes were rubbed using abrasive sheet no 220 and washed in ultrasonicator pci analytics india using water as solvent finally the membranes were dried at 100 c for 12 h 2 3 membrane characterization the membranes were characterized by tg xrd and sem analysis porosity clean water permeability average pore size ph and chlorine tolerance tga was performed using thermogravimetric analyzer mettler toledo tga1 sf 1100 under nitrogen atmosphere at a flow rate of 70 ml min to identify the thermal degradation behavior of raw material xrd was conducted using xrd instrument bruker axs instrument germany to investigate the phase alteration occurred during firing surface morphology of membranes was examined using scanning electron microscope zeis evo18 porosity of membranes was calculated by archimedes s principle using water as wetting liquid for this the initial weight of membranes w1 was first evaluated after drying the membranes at 100 c for 6 h next the membranes were immersed in distilled water and kept for 24 h in room temperature finally the wet weight w2 of the membranes was evaluated after taking out from water the porosity was calculated using the following expression 1 ε w 2 w 1 ρ w a t e r 100 v m e m where w2 w1 represents the wet and dry weight of membranes respectively ρwater denotes density of water and νmem is volume of the membranes the clean water flux j l m2h of membranes was measured using continuous dead end filtration setup fig 1 the filtration setup consists of feed tank diaphragm pump stainless steel membrane module capacity 300 ml and control valves the membrane module consists of cylindrical top portion and bottom plate which has a membrane holder the membrane was fixed in the membrane holder and feed was given in the top cylindrical section the pressure was generated by adjusting the valves fitted in the feed and bypass tube the volume of water collected q per unit time was measured using an electronic weighing balance at various pressures 69 345 kpa at an interval of 5 min for 30 min the flux was calculated using the following relation 2 j q a t where q denotes the permeate volume t is the time and a is the membrane area m2 for permeation the pore size and permeability of the membranes were calculated using the equation 25 3 j v ε r 2 δ p 8 μ l l h δ p where jv δp lh l r ε and μ represents the water flux transmembrane pressure water permeatbility pore length pore radius porosity and viscosity of water respectively the permeability was determined from water flux measured at different applied pressure the data was regressed by a linear curve and slope value provides the permeability of membrane the pore radius r of membrane is then calculated by assuming existence of cylindrical pores in the membranes using the following equation deduced from eq 3 as 4 r 8 μ l l h ε 0 5 ph tolerance of membranes was measured at different ph in the ranges of 1 14 for this the membranes were immersed in different solutions having different ph for seven consecutive days at room temperature ph of the solutions was adjusted using naoh or hcl finally the weight of ph exposed membranes was compared with dry membrane weight the weight loss due to ph of the solutions indicates the ph tolerance of the membranes chlorine tolerance was tested by exposing the membranes into aqueous chlorine solutions five different chlorine concentrations 1000 2000 3000 4000 and 5000 mg l were prepared from stock aqueous sodium hypochlorite naocl 4 6 active chlorine the membranes were immersed for seven consecutive days and then compared the weight of chlorine exposed membrane with dry membrane weight the weight loss of chlorine exposed membranes shows the chlorine tolerance of the membranes 2 4 microfiltration of bacteria the microfiltration mf test was carried out in a continuous dead end filtration setup using synthetic bacterial solutions for this the bacterial strain e coli was isolated from soil and grown in nutrient broth at 37 c for 24 h after that the solution was centrifuged and bacterial cells were separated the bacterial cells are typically rod shaped and are about 2 μm long and 0 5 μm in diameter the bacterial cells were then re suspended in millipore water to prepare the feed bacterial solution the microfiltration was carried out at different pressures 69 345 kpa and five different feed concentrations 1 3 g l the flux was noted at every 10 min for 240 min of experiment time the bacterial rejection was measured using the following equation 5 r c f c p c f 100 where c f and c p denotes the concentration of bacteria in feed and permeate respectively the bacterial concentration was estimated using uv vis spectrophotometer the bacterial solution was calibrated by measuring the absorbance of various known bacterial concentrations at a wavelength of 600 nm 4 the absorbance versus bacterial concentration mg l was found to be linear the calibration chart was used to determine the unknown bacterial concentration 2 5 microfiltration of peg the filtration test was performed using synthetic peg mol wt 4000 da solutions at a feed concentration and pressure of 2 g l and 345 kpa respectively the peg solution was prepared by mixing of peg with pure water using magnetic stirrer the permeate flux was determined at every 10 min for 240 min of experimental time the peg rejection was also calculated using eq 5 the concentration of peg was measured at a wave length of 200 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer 2 6 investigation of membrane fouling fouling mechanism of membrane during mf of bacteria and peg was analysed using complete standard and intermediate pore blocking models and cake filtration model 26 during complete pore blocking the active surface area of membrane for fluid permeation decreases proportionally to the permeate volume due to deposition of bigger solutes on membrane pores which completely block the membrane pores on the other hand the standard pore blocking takes places when solute sizes are lesser than membrane pore size during standard pore blocking the solute deposition in the internal pore walls of membrane causes the reduction in pore volume however a comparable size of the solute with the membrane pore size facilitates the solute to either settle on membrane surface or block the membrane pores such a scenario gives rise to intermediate pore blocking the cake filtration takes place when the solutes colloids macromolecules deposits on the surface of membrane which give rise to a thick cake layer on membrane surface the gel layer gives excess resistance to the fluid flow the fouling mechanism can be represented through the fitness of measured flux reduction with any of the following expressions a complete pore blocking model 6 in j 1 in j 0 1 k b t b standard pore blocking model 7 j 0 5 j 0 0 5 k s t c intermediate pore blocking model 8 j 1 j 0 1 k i t d cake filtration model 9 j 2 j 0 2 k c t thus the fitness of the above model for measured flux decline will be based on the regression based fitness for a respective plot of flux term for example ln j 1 in complete pore blocking case and time term t for all cases the obtained slope for example k b in case of complete pore blocking and intercept for example ln j0 1 in case of complete pore blocking convey the relevance of mass transfer coefficients and instantaneous flux values 2 7 membrane cleaning the fouled membrane during microfiltration of bacteria and peg was cleaned using water an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate sds an alkaline solution sodium hydroxide naoh and ultrasonication the sds and naoh was purchased from loba chem ltd and used without any purification the sds was primarily chosen as an anionic surfactant which reduces the surface tension of in contact molecules and enhances the hydrophilic strength of membrane 17 moreover sds plays a significant role in bacterial cell lysis that solubilizes the protein and lipid present in the cell membrane of bacteria the alkali naoh reduces the number of bond between the organic foulants and membrane surface that lead to membrane is to be cleaned ultrasonication is an environment friendly process that removes the adhered bacterial cells from the membrane pore walls the cleaning experiment was conducted as follows firstly the distilled water di was circulated for 15 min without applying any pressure to separate cake layer from the membrane surface secondly the sodium dodecyl sulphate solution concentration of 2 wt was passed through the membrane for 15 min at a pressure of 345 kpa thirdly the sodium hydroxide solution ph 12 was passed through the membrane for 15 min at a pressure of 345 kpa eventually the membrane was taken out and subjected to the ultrasonication for 10 min after each cleaning steps the water flux was measured at 345 kpa for 1 h to determine the flux recovery 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane preparation and characterization thermal analysis was conducted to identify the temperature regimes where the major weight loss occurs during sintering also tga enables the determination of sintering temperature required for fabrication of ceramic membrane sintering temperature is a key parameter which significantly influences the membrane characteristics fig 2 illustrates the tga dta curves of raw powder mixture used for the preparation of membrane the total weight loss of the powder mixture is calculated to be 13 the weight loss of sample below 150 c can be attributed to removal of moisture from the powder mixture about 12 9 of weight loss is observed in the temperature range between 520 780 c this is due to thermal disintegration of caco3 into cao and co2 the formation of co2 occurred at 730 c which enhances the porous structure of the membrane porosity and pore size of membranes are mainly related to the evolved gas of co2 in dta curve an endothermic peak is observed at 730 c which is attributed to formation of anorthite via las layered aluminosilicate 27 further the sample mixture exhibits insignificant weight loss at temperature above 780 c thus it is clear that the minimum sintering temperature for the membrane preparation should be above 780 c xrd graphs of raw powder mixture and the membranes sintered at different temperatures are presented in fig 3 as shown quartz q calicite c illitte i and kaolinite k are the main phases appeared in the raw powder after firing the peak corresponds to calcite caco3 vanished due to disintegration of caco3 into cao and co2 similarly the peak of kaolinite is disappeared in the entire graphs which are due to conversion of kaolinite to metakaolinite 8 however the characteristic peak of quartz is most intense and remains unchanged in all diffractograms this shows the thermal stability of the quartz powder it is also noted that the anorthite phase is present in the sintered membranes the formation of anorthite cao al2o3 2sio2 is attributed to reaction of cao with alumina and quartz present in the raw material in this regard it could be pointed out that the formation of anorthite is illustrated by tga dta curve in the previous subsection at a temperature of 730 c the formation of anorthite is complying with the result presented in the literature 27 at the temperature of 1000 c the peak of illite i is found to be disappeared on the other hand the mullite phase is appeared the mullite is formed due to phase transformation of kaolin to mullite via metakolinite by decomposition of kaolin structure the critical observation of peaks in the sintered membranes shows that no other significant phase transformation occurs above 900 1100 c from the xrd analysis it can be concluded the minimum sintering temperature required for fabrication membrane should be above 780 c thus minimum sintering temperature of 900 c selected in this work is justified fig 4 depicts the sem images of membranes fired at different temperatures in the ranges of 900 1100 c it is visible that all the membranes possess rough and porous morphological texture however there is a significant variation in surface morphology of membranes fired at various temperatures this is attributed to densification and growth of grain boundaries at elevated temperature moreover the increase in temperature causes enlargement in pore diameter it is also analysed that all the membranes have crack free surface the variation of membrane porosity with sintering temperature is depicted in fig 5 a it is observed that the porosity of membranes varied significantly with sintering temperature the porosity is measured to be 42 37 and 34 for the membranes sintered at 900 1000 and 1100 c respectively as observed the porosity of membranes decreases with increasing sintering temperature this is attributed to densification of membranes at higher temperature moreover it can be analyzed from porosity trend reported by dong et al 28 that the porosity decreases from 45 77 to 17 69 while the sintering temperature increases from 1300 to 1400 c thus it is apparent that the membranes reported in this work showed significantly higher porosity the similar fashion of porosity trends was also reported in other literatures 15 29 fig 5 b d illustrates the time dependent water flux of membranes measured at various trans membrane pressures it is seen that the clean water flux is constant over entire time duration for all trans membrane pressures which indicates that there is no any resistance for pure water flow this is in consistent with the result presented in the literature 30 the variation of clean water permeability and pore size with sintering temperature is illustrated in fig 6 it is noted that the permeability increases from 3 24 10 4 to 3 60 10 3 l m2hpa with an increase in the sintering temperature similarly the mean pore size of membranes varied from 180 to 650 nm with varying sintering temperature 900 1100 c thus indicates that higher sintering temperature enabled the increase in pore size this is due to increase in grain growth at higher temperature which results in enlargement in membrane pore size moreover it can be pointed out that the reported pore size 180 650 nm is significantly lower than the average pore size obtained from other clay materials namely apatite 6 μm moroccan clay 11 μm and cordierite 8 66 μm 7 8 28 the variation of clean water flux with trans membrane pressure is also depicted in fig 6 inset the variation of clean water flux with pressure is found to be linear moreover the clean water flux increases from 25 41 to 115 06 l m2h 214 29 to 899 63 l m2h and 363 11 to 1576 95 l m2h with increasing pressure from 69 to 345 kpa for the membranes sintered at 900 1000 and 1100 c the ph tolerance of membranes was measured to identify their suitability in highly corrosive medium in view of this the membranes were exposed in different ph solutions 1 14 the membranes showed insignificant weight loss in all ph conditions this indicates that the membranes are stable over a broader ph range from this study it can be concluded that the membranes can be applied for any process application whose feed ph range vary 1 14 further the membranes can permit stronger faster and more effective cleaning procedure to be used the free chlorine tolerance of membranes was tested at different chlorine concentrations 1000 5000 mg l during chlorine treatment no weight loss is observed which shows that the membranes are more resistant to chlorine attack it can be pointed out that the prepared membranes can be subjected to disinfection using highly concentrated chlorine solutions table 2 presents the overall characteristics of membranes fabricated at different sintering temperatures further a comparison of the membranes with the other membranes reported in literatures is given in table 3 from tables 2 and 3 it can be observed that the prepared membranes are comparatively good than other low cost membranes described in the literatures 6 11 14 17 28 31 34 considering the membrane properties pore size of 180 nm and porosity of 42 the membrane sintered at 900 c is selected as an optimum membrane for bacterial removal application 3 2 microfiltration of bacteria 3 2 1 effect of transmembrane pressure fig 7 a illustrates the permeate flux reduction with time at different applied pressures 69 345 kpa for feed concentration of 2 g l the initial flux is higher than the steady state flux and thereby infers that permeate flux decline occurred during the first 30 min of operation the flux declines very sharply due to quicker membrane pores blocking and bacterial cells adhesion subsequently the flux declines gradually and reaches pseudo steady state at initial stage pore blocking mechanism contributes to flux reduction which is generally quick process the flux reduction in later stage is attributed to concentration polarization and formation of cake layer further the variation of permeate flux with applied pressure is also presented in fig 7a inset the permeate flux increases with increasing pressure which is due to enhancement in the driving force the enhancement of flux with applied pressure didn t follow linear trend this represents that there is excess resistance to permeate flow which may be due to pore blocking concentration polarization and gel layer formation it can also be noted that the rate of pore blocking increases with increasing pressure fig 7a at higher pressure the convection of bacterial cells towards the membrane surface increases and hence more and more bacterial cells are deposited into the porous membrane texture that reduces the membrane flux the permeate flux reduction for the first 30 min is more at higher pressure for instance at a fixed feed concentration of 2 g l the flux reduction at 69 kpa is 54 while at 345 kpa the flux reduction is much higher and is about 64 the maximum permeate flux of 50 65 l m2h is obtained at a pressure of 345 kpa after 60 min of filtration operation the variation of bacterial removal with varying pressure is shown in fig 7 b the bacterial removal decreases from 99 32 to 90 24 with increasing pressure from 69 to 345 kpa when increasing the pressure the bacterial cells are forced to penetrate through the membrane and reaches the permeate stream however the reduction in bacterial removal with pressure is not significant for all pressures the membrane provided good rejection above 90 from this investigation the pressure of 345 kpa is considered to be the best choice and further study was conducted at this pressure 3 2 2 effect of feed concentration fig 7 c depicts the variation of permeate flux as a function of time at different feed concentrations 1 3 g l and fixed pressure of 345 kpa it can be viewed that permeate flux decreases with increasing feed concentration the increase in feed concentration enhances the formation of cake layer with larger thickness that provides resistance to solvent flow through the membrane higher feed concentration indicates higher quantity of bacterial cells and hence enhanced adhesion of bacterial cells onto the membrane surface to form a gel layer with greater thickness the maximum average permeate flux of 69 71 l m2h is observed at lower feed concentration of 1 g l after 60 min operation fig 7c inset as shown in fig 7 d the rejection of bacteria increases with increasing feed concentration the rejection increases from 67 90 to 95 09 with increasing feed concentration from 1 to 3 g l as discussed earlier increasing feed concentration leads to formation gel layer on the membrane surface with larger thickness this cake layer acts as a secondary filtering medium and provides resistance to flow of bacterial cells therefore the rejection is enhanced at higher feed concentration the maximum average separation of 95 09 is observed at higher feed concentration of 3 g l generally the bacterial removal occurs based on the sieving mechanism where the solute size greater than the pore size of membrane the e coli cells are comparatively bigger size 2 μm 0 5 μm than the average pore size 180 nm of membrane however about 5 of unexpected bacteria permeation is observed during filtration this is due to presence of few larger pores in the membrane texture considering permeate flux and rejection the pressure of 345 kpa and concentration of 2 g l is considered as an optimum process condition to achieve adequate bacterial removal 90 24 with good permeate flux of 50 65 l m2h the reported flux and rejection values are average of first 60 min of filtration the separation performance of the membrane 90 24 removal at concentration of 2 g l and pressure of 345 kpa is comparable with other polymeric and ceramic membranes 18 22 simonsis and basson 21 reported 4 lrv during microfiltration of bacteria conducted with ceramic membrane for feed concentration of 6 104 cfu ml bielefeldt et al 22 obtained 3 4 lrv with ceramic membrane during microfiltration of bacteria performed at a flow rate of 1 9 lph and bacteria concentration of 106 cfu ml judd and till 18 obtained 0 5 lrv with polypropylene 0 45 μm membrane during microfiltration of synthetic bacterial e coli solution using the polycarbonate track etched membrane about 3 2 lrv was achieved with bacteria concentration of 104 cfu ml 19 lebleu et al 20 reported approximately 7 lrv during removal of e coli at a feed concentration of 104 cfu ml using the cellulose membrane this comparative statement clarifies that the membrane reported in this work performs well in terms of bacteria removal compared to the other membranes presented in the literatures 3 3 microfiltration of peg the microfiltration was performed at a fixed pressure of 345 kpa and concentration of 2 g l this experiment was performed for the purpose of analyzing membrane fouling during filtration of polymeric materials fig 8 depicts the flux profile of membrane during microfiltration of peg it is seen that the flux reduces gradually till the end of the operation the permeate flux decreases from 114 to 44 33 l m2h and total flux reduction is evaluated to be 61 12 at the end of operation the molecular size of peg is approximately 4 kda which is smaller than membrane pore size therefore the peg solutes can readily penetrate through the membrane in this context the flux reduction can be attributed to adhesion of polymer in the walls of pores and formation cake layer on the surface of membrane the total rejection of peg after 60 min operation is evaluated to be 40 with average permeate flux of 95 85 l m2h the low rejection is obvious because mean pore size of membrane is bigger than the peg solute size 3 4 investigation of membrane fouling the pertinent fouling mechanism was identified using different pore blocking models during microfiltration of bacteria and peg solutions the linear fit of flux versus time for various pore blocking models for bacteria and peg is presented in fig 9 for both cases the cake filtration model gives the perfect fit among all other models the initial flux values j0 at t 0 correlation coefficient r2 and slope for various pore blocking models are given in table 4 amongst all models the cake filtration model provides highest r2 value of 0 99 and 0 96 for bacteria and peg respectively thus it is inferred that cake filtration followed by intermediate pore blocking mechanism represent the most pertinent flux reduction koltuniewicz et al 35 and nandi et al 36 have also observed the cake filtration model represents the pertinent fouling mechanism during dead end filtration of oil emulsions the values of slope k for various pore blocking models are also given in table 4 a physical interpretation of k values confirms that its magnitude is indicating upon fouling severity moreover it can be noted that the initial flux j0 determined from diverse models are little lower than the experimental results except cake filtration model therefore cake filtration offers good agreement to the experimental result in comparison with the other models it is also expected that cake filtration only contributes strongly towards external fouling and therefore is promising to affirm higher membrane shelf life due to insignificant impact of external cake layer deposition on irreversible membrane fouling 3 5 membrane cleaning the flux recovery of membrane with different cleaning agents is shown in fig 10 a b it is visible that the flux recovery is markedly improved at each cleaning steps for both cases the flux recovery due to distilled water is found to be 30 and 64 for bacteria and peg respectively the distilled water cleaning can be attributed to removal of cake layer from membrane surface sds and naoh cleaning was lead to enhancing the flux recovery upto 51 and 94 for bacteria and peg respectively the sds is a strong detergent that involves in bacterial cell lysis by denaturing the protein and lipids of cell membrane causing desorption between bacterial cells and membrane surface also sds reduces the surface tension and increases the repulsion between the membrane surfaces and negatively charged organic foulants that lead to membrane is to be cleaned 17 in general alkaline solutions are recommended for organic fouled membranes the alkaline solution naoh decreases the interaction between organic foulants and membrane surface during alkali treatment the membrane fouled by peg is reached maximum 94 flux recovery however the membrane fouled by bacteria was further subjected to ultrasonic cleaning which provided about 88 flux recovery ultrasonic cleaning effect can be attributed to removal of bacterial cells present in the pore path of membrane by ultrasonic vibration in this context it can be concluded that the chemical cleaning naoh is more suitable for cleaning of peg whereas ultrasonication is more competitive for cleaning of membrane fouled by bacteria 4 cost estimation the applicability of ceramic membrane for industrial process is primarily depending upon their cost due to this the preparation of clay based inexpensive ceramic membrane is targeted for various industrial as well as laboratory applications in this context the preparation of ceramic membrane at lower price will create a huge impact in ceramic membrane market in this work the ceramic membranes were synthesized using china clay powder calcium carbonate and quartz the detail of price estimation is presented in table 5 considering raw material pressing and sintering cost the total price of fabricated ceramic membrane is estimated to be rs m2 987 81 m2 15 19 the membrane prepared in this work is very cheaper than the other membranes presented in the literatures 14 15 5 conclusions the ceramic membranes were successfully prepared using cheaper ceramic precursors via uniaxial compaction method the porosity of membranes decreased from 42 and 34 with increasing sintering temperature the pore size of membranes was found to be 180 to 650 nm and water permeability was determined to be 3 24 10 4 to 3 60 10 3 l m2hpa for the membranes sintered at 900 to 1100 c respectively the ph and chlorine tolerance of membranes was found to be excellent for all membranes the membrane offered rejection of 90 24 and 40 with good permeate flux of 50 65 and 95 85 l m2h during separation of bacteria and peg respectively the cake filtration model offered good agreement to represent pertinent flux decline with the experimental data for both bacteria and peg microfiltration the cleaning study showed that ultrasonic cleaning was more suitable along with chemical treatment for cleaning of bacteria on the other hand the alkali treatment along with distilled water was adequate to clean the peg the total price of membrane was determined to be rs m2 987 81 m215 19 in summary the present work reveals the capability of the prepared membrane towards the separation of bacteria from its aqueous solution acknowledgement the authors wish to show their sincere gratitude to department of science and technology dst serb government of india for the financial
