15535,lake carbon c cycling is a key component of the global c cycle and associated c source and sink processes the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 and carbon dioxide co2 exchange flux at the lake air interface fc are controlled by complex physical chemical and biological mechanisms it would be instructively significant to determine whether hydrological processes drive conversion shifts between c sources and sinks in floodplain lake systems findings from this study show that exogenous input and in situ metabolism related to photosynthesis respiration and organic matter degradation were the main driving mechanisms of co2 absorption and release in a large floodplain lake system i e lake poyang moreover the intense and frequent water level fluctuations inherent to floodplain lakes may also have a direct or indirect impact on c cycling processes and co2 exchange rates in floodplain lake systems via their effect on physical processes inorganic c transport in situ metabolic processes we confirmed the potential of c source and sink conversion in floodplain lakes under hydrological fluctuations and strengthen the understanding of driving mechanisms of c source and sink conversion in floodplain systems keywords partial pressure of carbon dioxide water air carbon exchange flux carbon dioxide emission carbon source carbon sink hydrological process 1 introduction the carbon c cycle which can be observed clearly through co2 and methane ch4 emissions that accelerate the greenhouse effect particularly underpins natural aquatic ecosystems selvam et al 2014 the lake c cycling process is the primary focus of current lake research being a key component of the global c cycle and associated c source and sink behavior due to the high c input processing burial and emittance rates cole et al 2007 the partial pressure of co2 pco2 of lake systems is controlled by complex physical chemical and biological mechanisms in a very general way pco2 represents the balance between biological co2 consumption photosynthesis and production respiration and photorespiration as well as flux from and to the atmosphere sediment and watershed systems and changes in the carbonate equilibria controlled by ph perga et al 2016 despite the large uncertainty in global co2 emission estimations lake systems are indisputably an important co2 source with an equivalent c emission rate of 0 11 0 57 pg yr 1 cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 however the underlying controls of lake pco2 and co2 exchange flux at the lake air interface fc remain elusive especially pertaining to specific areas some studies have suggested that decreasing extraneous nutrient inputs into lake systems would increase co2 emissions to the atmosphere santoso et al 2017 chen et al 2019 although the response of co2 concentrations to nutrient reductions may vary among different lake systems marotta et al 2010 variations in meteorological conditions thermal stratification and mixing exchanges with the atmosphere and lateral advection macintyre et al 2019 can also contribute to variability in co2 concentrations water level fluctuations will inevitably alter the c balance of shallow lake systems van der lee et al 2017 cheung et al 2018 however abrupt flooding events caused by planned ecological water transfer projects as well as increases in minimum water levels and reductions in seasonal water level fluctuations resulting from water level controls have inevitably induced changes to biological processes while simultaneously influencing c balances water level fluctuations can directly affect primary productivity while also impacting nutrients through their influence on hydrological connectivity water flow velocity and other environmental parameters which subsequently influence phytoplankton growth and primary productivity in floodplain lake systems wang et al 2021 lake floodplains are hydrologically complex and dynamic systems that experience high water level fluctuations and frequent flooding and drying events li et al 2018 thomas et al 2015 they have also been long recognized as globally threatened ecosystems while being extremely sensitive to anthropogenic interventions and climate change entwistle et al 2019 although it would be instructively significant to determine whether hydrological processes drive conversion shifts between c sources and sinks in floodplain lake systems this topic has been largely under explored accordingly the objectives of this study were 1 to explore intra annual and inter annual pco2 and fc patterns in lake poyang namely the largest freshwater lake in china 2 to determine the specific factors that affect pco2 and fc in lake poyang and 3 to attempt to clarify interactions between c cycling and hydrological processes in a floodplain lake system results from this study are intended to strengthen our understanding concerning the driving mechanisms of co2 emissions in floodplain systems under conditions of high water level fluctuations while providing significant references for the research of co2 source and sink conversion in floodplain lakes worldwide 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites

lake namely the gan river the fu river the xin river the rao river and the xiu river which then discharge into the yangtze river from a narrow channel at the hukou gaging station to the north of the study area yao et al 2015 the effect of these interactions determines the water level and its associated intra annual and inter annual variation the expansion and contraction of the lake area as well as the drought and flood events that occur in the lake this lake experiences considerable intra annual water level fluctuations i e 7 9 19 4 m liu et al 2015 and the annual mean precipitation is about 1622 mm throughout the entire region under a typical warm and humid subtropical climate jin et al 2012 from september 2017 to july 2021 we collected samples at each sampling point four times per year

samples for this study a total of 45 sampling sites were established in the main lake area the sub lakes area and the water channel of lake poyang based on landform complexity and lake water fluidity fig 1 the yellow dots were sampled every time during 2017 2021 while the gray dots were sampled only from july 2020 to 2021 a total of 16 sampling sites i e those situated in the western and eastern regions of the lake as shown in fig 1b were established in sub lake areas 14 sampling sites i e those situated in the southern and central regions of the lake as shown in fig 1b were established within the main lake area and 15 sampling sites i e those situated in the northern region of the lake as shown in fig 1b were established within the water channel 2 2 sample collection and analysis baseflow water samples obtained from the 45 sampling sites were collected from a 0 to 40 cm surface water depth by water collector between 2017 and 2021 during sampling put two 100 ml polyethylene plastic bottles under the water let the lake water flow into the bottles until they are full be careful to ensure that there were no bubbles in the bottles one was wrapped in a sealing film which was used to determine δ13c dic values and the other was used to determine the ion concentrations prior to sampling previously unused new collection bottles were washed in deionized di water three separate times then these water samples were refrigerated and transported to the laboratory for immediate filtration and analysis 2 3 environment variables water level data were collected from the hukou gaging station 114 16 e longitude 30 37 n latitude fig 1b located at the junction of lake poyang and the yangtze river which were used to determine water levels between 1989 and 2019 a portable hand held

china see text s1 for more detail on chl a sample collection and analysis 2 5 pco2 and co2 flux calculation the pco2 was calculated using co2sys co2sys v2 1 running in excel 2010 co2sys requires any two co2 system parameters i e total alkalinity dic and ph water temperature and atmospheric pressure lewis and wallace 2006 pierrot et al 2006 the co2sys macro was run under the recommended freshwater option i e salinity 0 abril et al 2015 pointed out that the calculated pco2 may be overestimated due to the contribution of organic acids to alkalinity and the lower carbonate system buffering capacity especially at a ph of 7 0 however in our study dic and ph were selected to calculate pco2 to avoid errors caused by organic acids in addition in our dataset 92 44 of the samples had ph values greater than 7 therefore our calculated pco2 was less likely to be overestimated abril et al 2015 the uncertainty of pco2 calculation was 2 3 arising from the uncertainty in the measurements of ph 0 01 ph units meanwhile direct measurements of pco2 via headspace equilibration method were conducted in the lake poyang in 2021 and the indirectly calculated pco2 by ph and dic was highly correlated with directly measured pco2 r2 0 75 p 0 01 fig s1 the lake air interface fc g m 2 d 1 where positive values indicate co2 emissions from the lake to the atmosphere was calculated based on the bulk diffusion model cole and caraco 1998 4 f c 0 044 k k h p c o 2 p a where 0 044 is a conversion factor pa is the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in the atmosphere μatm k is the gas transfer coefficient m d 1 in this study k was estimated based on the study by cole and caraco 1998 more detail concerning k estimations are provided in supplementary materials i e text s2 2 6 data analysis to better illustrate relationships among water levels and other relevant factors this study applied four different time periods fig 2 a namely the dry season ds december and january the water level rising period rp from february to june the wet season ws july and the water level falling period fp from august to november the classification of these four periods was primarily based on water level variation the kruskal wallis h test and pairwise comparisons applying the wilcoxon rank sum test were conducted in r version 3 6 3 which were used to evaluate significant differences in parameters during the four different water level periods structural equation model was conducted in r version 3 6 3 which were used to evaluate the effect of various environmental factors on pco2 3 results 3 1 environmental parameters lake poyang water levels obtained from the hukou gaging station between 2017 and 2021 varied from 7 29 to 22 46 m with a mean value of 12 84 m water levels exhibited high seasonal fluctuations and water levels among the four different periods differed significantly p 0 01 table 1 and fig 2a mean water level values were lowest during the dry season 8 86 m and reached 12 41 m during the water level rising period before peaking during the wet season 18 38 m and then decreasing during the water level falling period 13 93 m table 1 fig 2a additionally from 2017 to 2021 the annual mean and minimum water level changes were relatively stable while the annual maximum water level changed greatly fig 2b in 2018 the annual maximum water level was smaller at 17 14 m while the annual maximum water level reached 22 46 m in 2020 fig 2b results showed that lake poyang wt differed significantly between 2017 and 2021 during all four periods p 0 05 while wt values were lowest during the dry season 10 11 3 76 c and highest during the wet season 30 22 2 34 c table 1 moreover ph values were lower during the water level rising period 7 29 0 41 and the water level falling period 7 39 0 43 and higher during the wet season 7 56 0 43 and the dry season 7 61 0 24 additionally ec and tds values were higher during the water level falling period and the dry season while they were lower during the water level rising period and the wet season table 1 as fig 3 a shows do content during dry season 9 29 0 53 mg l 1 the water level falling period 8 72 1 03 mg l 1 and the water

lake poyang except for nh4 n between 2017 and 2021 differed significantly among all four periods with p values 0 05 for nitrogen n tn content 3 02 1 82 mg l 1 was higher during the water level falling period and lower during the water level rising period fig 3b conversely no3 n content during the water level rising period 0 83 0 61 mg l 1 was significantly higher compared to the other three periods p 0 01 fig 3b furthermore nh4 n content was low particularly during the water level rising period and the water level falling period fig 3b moreover tp and po4 p content during the dry season with mean values of 0 70 0 57 and 0 46 0 41 mg l 1 respectively was significantly higher compared to corresponding values during the other three periods p 0 01 fig 3b additionally tp and po4 p content trended extremely low during the water level rising period with mean values of 0 12 and 0 05 mg l 1 respectively fig 3b 3 2 pco2 and fc between 2017 and 2021 pco2 values in lake poyang varied significantly from 0 99 to 6859 62 μatm with an average value of 981 19 1059 13 μatm fig 4 a the pco2 values of the sub lakes 1233 71 1221 01 μatm were significantly higher than that of the main lake 950 05 861 17 μatm and the water channel 426 09 318 26 μatm in lake poyang p 0 01 fig 4a lake poyang pco2 values showed a higher trend during the water level rising period 1489 59 1629 24 μatm differing significantly from corresponding values during the dry season 623 77 402 82 μatm and the wet season 796 05 660 71 μatm fig 4a in terms of inter annual variation pco2 values of 2018 were significantly higher compared to pco2 values during 2019 2020 and 2021 in lake poyang p 0 01 fig 4a additionally the trend in co2 flux at the lake air interface averaging 0 63 1 15 g m 2 d 1 was similar to pco2 of lake poyang between 2017 and 2021 fig 4b mean co2 flux in lake poyang was highest during the water level rising period 1 18 1 64 g m 2 d 1 and lowest during the dry season 0 23 0 45 g m 2 d 1 fig 4b from 2017 to 2021 co2 flux of lake poyang exhibited an obvious decreasing trend which varied from 1 25 1 03 g m 2 d 1 in 2017 to 0 41 0 76 g m 2 d 1 in 2021 fig 4b 3 3 dic doc and δ13cdic as fig 5 a shows dic content in lake poyang between 2017 and 2021 trended high during the water level rising period 6 66 4 24 mg l 1 and significantly differed compared to the wet season 4 29 2 19 mg l 1 fig 5a doc content differed significantly among all four periods p 0 01 being highest during the dry season 7 75 2 21 mg l 1 and lowest during the water level falling period 3 56 2 45 mg l

periods p 0 01 fig 5a additionally δ13cdic values in lake poyang between 2018 and 2021 varied from 19 30 to 5 30 with a mean value of 12 18 fig 5b specifically results showed that δ13cdic values during the water level falling period 10 16 1 71 were more similar to the δ13c value of atmospheric co2 approximately 8 50 graven et al 2017 which was significantly higher compared to δ13cdic values during the other three periods p 0 01 fig 5b 4 discussion generally inland lake systems are oversaturated with co2 therefore they act as important atmospheric co2 sources nydahl et al 2017 ni et al 2020 serving as funnels for organic and inorganic c export storage and conversion lapierre and del giorgio 2012 in recent years the decrease observed in co2 degassing flux from lake systems appears to be a global phenomenon finlay et al 2015 ran et al 2021 which is likely influenced by anthropogenic activity and climate change similar to most relevant studies raymond et al 2013 liu et al 2019 the pco2 calculation from this study i e 981 19 1059 13 μatm confirms co2 oversaturation relative to the atmospheric equilibrium 410 μatm thus having acted as net co2 sources to the atmosphere between 2017 and 2021 fig 4 the averaged pco2 of lake poyang was slightly higher compared to other eutrophic lake systems in china i e lake donghu 520 3 455 6 μatm and lake taihu 778 169 μatm li et al 2018 xiao et al 2020 yan et al 2021 and lower than median pco2 values 1044 3552 µatm of lake and reservoir systems across china ran et al 2021 however co2 exchange flux dynamics indicated that lake poyang shifted from a co2 source in 2017 2020 to a co2 sink in 2021 where co2 flux varied from 1 25 1 03 g m 2 d 1 in 2017 to 0 41 0 76 g m 2 d 1 in 2021 fig 4b the mean co2 flux of lake poyang 0 63 1 15 g m 2 d 1 between 2017 and 2021 was lower than the mean co2 flux 0 92 1 26 g m 2 d 1 reported from global lake systems tranvik et al 2009 holgerson and raymond 2016 and much lower than the mean co2 flux of lake systems in china 1 64 3 01 g m 2 d 1 li et al 2018 4 1 factors influencing pco2 and co2 supersaturation the atmospheric sediment and watershed flux perga et al 2016 the carbonate equilibria zagarese et al 2021 the balance between photosynthesis and respiration of primary producers i e phytoplankton and macrophytes kaijser et al 2021 and variations caused by meteorological factors and hydrological processes blackburn and stanley 2020 yuan et al 2021 all affect the co2 saturation status of floodplain lake systems to varying degrees principal component analysis pca identified two principal components pcs and explained 42 4 of the total variance of lake poyang between 2017 and 2021 table s1 fig 6 a the pc1 accounted for 23 7 of the variance comprising of dic dtc chl a and ph which represent the coupling of terrestrial c transport and phytoplankton production processes ni et al 2021 in most inland waters the carbonate system regulates ph and in cases where the lake water receives some acidic sources such as acid rain it can be explained that ph controls the partial pressure pco2 cole and prairie 2009 ph can change the physical and chemical environment of water which subsequently plays a role in regulating the dynamic balance and distribution of carbonate systems co2 co3 2 and hco3 in water thus affecting the release of co2 in water salimon et al 2013 our results showed that ph levels had a significant and negative correlation to pco2 and co2 flux p 0 01 fig 6b which demonstrates the importance of carbonate buffering on co2 dynamics stets et al 2017 higher ph levels increased the co2 absorption capacity of the lake while also enhancing its c sink capacity at the same time the co2 absorption and release also regulate the ph level of lake systems external dic inputs may directly impact the co2 concentration of surface waters in lakes thus leading to co2 supersaturation and co2 efflux to the atmosphere mcdonald et al 2013 wilkinson et al 2016 in addition higher inputs of doc are also expected to impact co2 concentration by providing a carbon substrate in lakes algesten et al 2003 sobek et al 2005 our result exhibited that both dic and doc content had significant and positive correlations to pco2 rdic 0 59 rdoc 0 33 p 0 01 also confirming the vital role of external c input on pco2 in lake poyang fig 6b additionally pc2 explained 18 7 of the variance consisting significantly of water level do doc and tn table s1 fig 6a which is attributed to hydrological conditions and aquatic metabolism processes staehr and sand jensen 2006 moreover do content is widely recognized to be a sensitive indicator of photosynthetic intensity and a regulator of organic c decomposition müller et al 2012 additionally biological activities such as photosynthesis respiration and decomposition of organic matter can affect do content in water and photosynthetically generated do also affects co2 production and emissions arend et al 2011 this is supported by structural equation modeling results showing that water level tn and chl a together explained 56 of the do variance in lake poyang p 0 001 fig 7 in this study significant and negative correlations were observed between do and pco2 r 0 26 p 0 01 fig 6b which proved that in situ respiration contributed more to the co2 release than photosynthesis consumption cole and prairie 2009 young doc is the preferential source of in situ respiration mayorga et al 2005 and the significant variation of doc concentration in different periods p 0 01 also indicated that there is a considerable amount of biomineralization in lake poyang both the chl a and doc content had significant and positive correlations to pco2 rchl a 0 40 rdoc 0 33 p 0 01 fig 6b also proving that co2 consumed by phytoplankton photosynthesis was offset by co2 produced by in situ respiration and terrestrial input balmer and downing 2011 moreover this study also found that the pco2 values of the sub lakes were significantly higher than that of the main lake and the water channel in lake poyang p 0 01 fig 4a this may be due to the fact that the aquatic vegetation in the sub lakes area is more abundant and the water depth is shallow so it is greatly affected by the degradation of soil and vegetation organic matter wang et al 2022 at the same time our previous study found that the transparency of the sub lakes is low which may reduce the light availability of phytoplankton and macrophytes and thus affect the photosynthetic intensity wang et al 2022 nutrients are key factors affecting pco2 levels in aquatic ecosystems yuan et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 in this study both pco2 and co2 flux increased with an increased in lake poyang no3 n content fig 6b which is in agreement with results from other studies davidson et al 2015 sun et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 nutrient supplies can regulate co2 content in water by enhancing primary production or promoting bacterial mineralization larsen et al 2011 in lake systems however correlation analysis demonstrated that pco2 and co2 flux was negatively correlated to various forms of phosphorus p content i e tp and po4 p in lake poyang fig 6b other studies have reported similar results santoso et al 2017 trolle et al 2012 moreover p availability promoted the primary production of phytoplankton reducing co2 content in water delsontro et al 2018 furthermore it has been shown that catchment c input may actually completely reverse the relationship between nutrients and lake co2 concentrations by directly adding dic maberly et al 2013 or by doc to promote aquatic metabolism lapierre and del giorgio 2012 in order to more clearly explore the relationship between water level major driving factors and co2 emissions in water we constructed a structural equation model fig 7 on the one hand the water level fluctuation of floodplain lakes could affect pco2 by direct c transport on the other hand it could affect aquatic metabolism by regulating lake nutrient and chl a content and further regulates pco2 fig 7 in addition carbonate weathering in the watershed is also closely related to co2 supersaturation in the lake which should be considered in future studies on c dynamics marcé et al 2015 in addition to these factors air temperature solar radiation precipitation wind speed and other meteorological factors also play a key role in the pco2 and co2 flux of shallow lake systems amaral et al 2020 precipitation and rainstorm events play a particularly critical role when they flush large amounts of terrestrial c into lake systems which subsequently release co2 bartosiewicz et al 2015 tonetta et al 2017 pco2 was higher during the water level rising period fig 4a suggesting that rainfall increased terrestrial input and flooding transported more organic matter to the lake this is also supported by the corresponding high dic concentrations during the water level falling period fig 5 indicating that rainfall can enhance hydraulic erosion and soil flushing in lake poyang wei et al 2007 irradiance also affect the chemical activity biological activity and physical transport of lake systems nakayama et al 2019 water temperature is an important factor affecting organic carbon mineralization and carbonate balance in water bodies butman and raymond 2011 wang et al 2017 which was supported by the significant negative correlations between water temperature and c fractions in our study p 0 01 fig 6b river inflow and wind turbulence mix biotic and abiotic material buried in sediment into the water column andersen et al 2017 czikowsky et al 2018 additionally the contact area between waterbodies and the surrounding air increases as wind speeds increase resulting in an increase in the co2 exchange rate at the water air interface alin et al 2011 however in this study significant negative correlations were found between wind speed and pco2 i e co2 flux fig 6b this could be explained by the lower wind speed i e a mean wind speed of 1 99 m s 1 during our sampling periods which were relatively weak and therefore unable to cause water turbulence guérin et al 2007 4 2 interaction between carbon cycling and hydrological processes the water column and the sediment surface are active c pools and c is fixed and released at the water land interface the water air interface and the water sediment interface through inorganic and organic c pool conversion processes as well as the conversion processes between these pools barker et al 2013 gao et al 2022 biological and solubility pumps between the atmosphere and waterbodies can be used to determine co2 exchange rates at the water air interface gao et al 2021 the solubility pump refers to the process whereby atmospheric co2 enters lake water via dissolution at the water air interface where it is then stored in the form of co3 2 and hco3 in waterbodies gao et al 2022 atmospheric and aqueous co2 are continuously converted into organic c and biologically derived carbonates through autotroph photosynthetic processes before being transported from the carbonate equilibria down to the hypolimnion via sequential food web processes which collectively act as a biological pump passow and carlson 2012 raymond et al 2013 solubility and biological pumps in floodplain lake systems are affected by the frequent fluctuation of their hydrological conditions nutrient levels inorganic ion conditions and climate factors polimene et al 2016 wang et al 2022 the intense and frequent water level fluctuations that take place in floodplain lake systems and associated consequences have an important impact on the c cycle and co2 emission rates wang et al 2021 pilcher et al 2015 this study also observed very significant and positive correlations between water levels and pco2 i e co2 flux r 0 30 p 0 01 fig 6b the hydrological connectivity of lake poyang was poor during the dry season owing to the annual appearance of greater than 100 sub lake systems hu et al 2019 moreover lower water tables and processes such as drought induced acidification may reduce organic c production and sever the link between terrigenous c and waterbodies clark et al 2005 the most direct effect that rising water levels have on pco2 and co2 flux in this floodplain lake system is water area expansion which may significantly enhance the hydrological connectivity of the lake system enabling it to receive a greater amount of terrestrial c and dissolved co2 in situ co2 production from terrestrially derived c degradation coupled with direct co2 inputs through river inflow may result in higher pco2 and co2 flux maberly et al 2013 a similar increase in co2 efflux was reported by lupon et al 2019 conducted in a boreal headwater stream where higher co2 flux was also reinforced by a reduction in gross primary production gpp i e co2 uptake given that this process is often more strongly affected by flooding than ecosystem respiration qasem et al 2019 in the dry season due to less rainfall and low flow less exogenous carbon input coupled with higher nutrient concentration fig 3b is conducive to aquatic primary production thus reducing the pco2 level li et al 2012 judd et al 2015 in addition shallow water depth during dry season may be more conducive to light availability by phytoplankton and submerged plants therefore we attribute the lowest mean pco2 during the dry season to less sediment c input and enhanced water production liu et al 2013 also pointed out that sediment c n ratio and water depth were important factors affecting co2 emission in lake poyang additionally this study also showed that pco2 of lake poyang exhibited an obvious decreasing trend and the mean pco2 value was the largest in 2018 1474 89 μatm and the smallest in 2020 474 28 μatm while the annual maximum water level was the lowest at 17 14 m in 2018 and the highest at 22 46 m in 2020 fig 2b it indicated that the higher water level for a long time in a year may drive the change trend of c source to c sink in floodplain systems and long term monitoring is of great significance for accurate evaluation of lake co2 source and sink conversion moreover water level fluctuations may also directly or indirectly affect the c cycle and co2 emission rates of floodplain lake systems through their effect on water flow velocity wang et al 2021 water retention time pacheco 2015 and vertical mixing schmiedeskamp et al 2021 which further affects carbonate dissolution maberly et al 2013 nutrient supplies and phytoplankton photosynthesis and respiration wang et al 2021 results from this study showed that water levels significantly and positively correlated to dic content r 0 20 p 0 01 and negatively correlated to ph r 0 20 p 0 01 confirming that water level fluctuations effect carbonate dissolution and co2 emission rates fig 6b many studies have revealed the importance that water levels play on phytoplankton production qian et al 2017 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2019 lake poyang s appreciable water level fluctuations have significantly impacted its nutrient levels e g n p and silicon si which has subsequently influenced phytoplankton growth and primary production wang et al 2021 this study has shown that lake poyang water levels significantly and positively correlated to its available nutrients i e tn and no3 n p 0 01 and significantly and negatively correlated to other available nutrients i e nh4 n and po4 p p 0 01 which is indicative of the complex impact that water level fluctuations have on nutrient supplies on the one hand rising water levels may to some extent have dilution and washout effects on nutrients in waterbodies on the other hand lake poyang may comparably also receive higher nutrient inputs wu et al 2013 additionally increased water flow rates caused by water level fluctuations generally inhibit phytoplankton growth valdes weaver et al 2006 lake sediments benefit herbaceous plant growth when exposed to air and plants may decay and subsequently release co2 after being submerged by rising water levels potentially increasing lake co2 emissions yuan et al 2021 results from this study showed that mean co2 flux in lake poyang was highest during the water level rising period 1 18 1 64 g m 2 d 1 which may be due to the flooding of wetland vegetation during this period results specifically showed that δ13cdic values during the water level falling period 10 16 1 71 were closer to δ13c values of atmospheric co2 i e approximately 8 50 fig 5b indicating the important contribution of atmospheric co2 on dic during the water level falling period in lake poyang graven et al 2017 the pco2 value of 48 57 of the samples was lower than the atmospheric partial pressure of co2 during the water level falling period and the trend of co2 absorption from the atmosphere was stronger which was speculated to be the influence of higher co2 uptake throughout the whole wet season as well as high outflow and fast water velocity in some regions during the water level falling period yuan et al 2021 water level fluctuations may also have an impact on vertical mixing processes which is an extremely important physical lake process given that it controls biochemical flux gudasz et al 2010 additionally owing to the appreciable water depth differences that occur during different periods the effect of wind speed on co2 emissions may also significantly differ in floodplain lake systems to summarize under strong hydrological fluctuations floodplain lakes have obvious potential for c source and sink conversion and the intense and frequent water level fluctuations may also have a direct or indirect impact on c cycling processes and co2 exchange in floodplain lake systems via their effect on physical processes exogenous input and in situ metabolism related to photosynthesis respiration and organic matter degradation in floodplain lakes 5 conclusion this study found that the pco2 in lake poyang acted as a co2 source to the atmosphere between 2017 and 2021 with a mean pco2 range of 981 19 1059 13 μatm during 2017 2021 the pco2 and co2 flux of lake poyang showed significant spatial and temporal differences the pco2 values trended high during the water level rising period and the pco2 values in the sub lakes area were significantly higher than those in the main lake area and the water channel of lake poyang in 2017 2021 moreover co2 exchange flux dynamics of lake poyang exhibited an obvious decreasing trend during 2017 2021 exogenous input and in situ metabolism were the main driving mechanisms of co2 absorption and release of lake poyang in 2017 2021 moreover the intense and frequent water level fluctuations inherent to floodplain lake systems and their associated consequential effects also played a crucial role in co2 dynamics of lake poyang we confirmed that floodplain lakes have obvious potential for c source and sink conversion significant water level fluctuations of lake poyang on the one hand through the direct effects on inorganic c transport and physical processes in the watershed regulate pco2 dynamics on the other hand it could affect in situ metabolic processes such as photosynthesis respiration and organic matter degradation by regulating biological factors such as nutrients chl a and organic c and then indirectly drive co2 absorption and release in lake poyang the results of this study clarify the source and sink characteristics of co2 in floodplain lakes with drastic hydrological changes which can potentially explain part of the missing sink in the global c cycle results from this study will help to strengthen our understanding of driving mechanisms of c emissions in floodplain systems under appreciable water level fluctuations while providing important references for the study of co2 emission in floodplain lakes worldwide declaration of competing interest the

15535,lake carbon c cycling is a key component of the global c cycle and associated c source and sink processes the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 and carbon dioxide co2 exchange flux at the lake air interface fc are controlled by complex physical chemical and biological mechanisms it would be instructively significant to determine whether hydrological processes drive conversion shifts between c sources and sinks in floodplain lake systems findings from this study show that exogenous input and in situ metabolism related to photosynthesis respiration and organic matter degradation were the main driving mechanisms of co2 absorption and release in a large floodplain lake system i e lake poyang moreover the intense and frequent water level fluctuations inherent to floodplain lakes may also have a direct or indirect impact on c cycling processes and co2 exchange rates in floodplain lake systems via their effect on physical processes inorganic c transport in situ metabolic processes we confirmed the potential of c source and sink conversion in floodplain lakes under hydrological fluctuations and strengthen the understanding of driving mechanisms of c source and sink conversion in floodplain systems keywords partial pressure of carbon dioxide water air carbon exchange flux carbon dioxide emission carbon source carbon sink hydrological process 1 introduction the carbon c cycle which can be observed clearly through co2 and methane ch4 emissions that accelerate the greenhouse effect particularly underpins natural aquatic ecosystems selvam et al 2014 the lake c cycling process is the primary focus of current lake research being a key component of the global c cycle and associated c source and sink behavior due to the high c input processing burial and emittance rates cole et al 2007 the partial pressure of co2 pco2 of lake systems is controlled by complex physical chemical and biological mechanisms in a very general way pco2 represents the balance between biological co2 consumption photosynthesis and production respiration and photorespiration as well as flux from and to the atmosphere sediment and watershed systems and changes in the carbonate equilibria controlled by ph perga et al 2016 despite the large uncertainty in global co2 emission estimations lake systems are indisputably an important co2 source with an equivalent c emission rate of 0 11 0 57 pg yr 1 cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 however the underlying controls of lake pco2 and co2 exchange flux at the lake air interface fc remain elusive especially pertaining to specific areas some studies have suggested that decreasing extraneous nutrient inputs into lake systems would increase co2 emissions to the atmosphere santoso et al 2017 chen et al 2019 although the response of co2 concentrations to nutrient reductions may vary among different lake systems marotta et al 2010 variations in meteorological conditions thermal stratification and mixing exchanges with the atmosphere and lateral advection macintyre et al 2019 can also contribute to variability in co2 concentrations water level fluctuations will inevitably alter the c balance of shallow lake systems van der lee et al 2017 cheung et al 2018 however abrupt flooding events caused by planned ecological water transfer projects as well as increases in minimum water levels and reductions in seasonal water level fluctuations resulting from water level controls have inevitably induced changes to biological processes while simultaneously influencing c balances water level fluctuations can directly affect primary productivity while also impacting nutrients through their influence on hydrological connectivity water flow velocity and other environmental parameters which subsequently influence phytoplankton growth and primary productivity in floodplain lake systems wang et al 2021 lake floodplains are hydrologically complex and dynamic systems that experience high water level fluctuations and frequent flooding and drying events li et al 2018 thomas et al 2015 they have also been long recognized as globally threatened ecosystems while being extremely sensitive to anthropogenic interventions and climate change entwistle et al 2019 although it would be instructively significant to determine whether hydrological processes drive conversion shifts between c sources and sinks in floodplain lake systems this topic has been largely under explored accordingly the objectives of this study were 1 to explore intra annual and inter annual pco2 and fc patterns in lake poyang namely the largest freshwater lake in china 2 to determine the specific factors that affect pco2 and fc in lake poyang and 3 to attempt to clarify interactions between c cycling and hydrological processes in a floodplain lake system results from this study are intended to strengthen our understanding concerning the driving mechanisms of co2 emissions in floodplain systems under conditions of high water level fluctuations while providing significant references for the research of co2 source and sink conversion in floodplain lakes worldwide 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sites

lake namely the gan river the fu river the xin river the rao river and the xiu river which then discharge into the yangtze river from a narrow channel at the hukou gaging station to the north of the study area yao et al 2015 the effect of these interactions determines the water level and its associated intra annual and inter annual variation the expansion and contraction of the lake area as well as the drought and flood events that occur in the lake this lake experiences considerable intra annual water level fluctuations i e 7 9 19 4 m liu et al 2015 and the annual mean precipitation is about

samples for this study a total of 45 sampling sites were established in the main lake area the sub lakes area and the water channel of lake poyang based on landform complexity and lake water fluidity fig 1 the yellow dots were sampled every time during 2017 2021 while the gray dots were sampled only from july 2020 to 2021 a total of 16 sampling sites i e those situated in the western and eastern regions of the lake as shown in fig 1b were established in sub lake areas 14 sampling sites i e those situated in the southern and central regions of the lake as shown in fig 1b were established

baseflow water samples obtained from the 45 sampling sites were collected from a 0 to 40 cm surface water depth by water collector between 2017 and 2021 during sampling put two 100 ml polyethylene plastic bottles under the water let the lake water flow into the bottles until they are full be careful to ensure that there were no bubbles in the bottles one was wrapped in a sealing film which was used to determine δ13c dic values and the other was used to determine the ion concentrations prior to sampling previously unused new collection bottles were washed in deionized di water three separate times then these water samples were refrigerated and transported to the laboratory for immediate filtration and analysis 2 3 environment variables water level data were collected from the hukou gaging

china see text s1 for more detail on chl a sample collection and analysis 2 5 pco2 and co2 flux calculation the pco2 was calculated using co2sys co2sys v2 1 running in excel 2010 co2sys requires any two co2 system parameters i e total alkalinity dic and ph water temperature and atmospheric pressure lewis and wallace 2006 pierrot et al 2006 the co2sys macro was run under the recommended freshwater option i e salinity 0 abril et al 2015 pointed out that the calculated pco2 may be overestimated due to the contribution of organic acids to alkalinity and the lower carbonate system buffering capacity especially at a ph of 7 0 however in our study dic and ph were selected to calculate pco2 to avoid errors caused by organic acids in addition in our dataset 92 44 of the samples had ph values greater than 7 therefore our calculated pco2 was less likely to be overestimated abril et al 2015 the uncertainty of pco2 calculation was 2 3 arising from the uncertainty in the measurements of ph 0 01 ph units meanwhile direct measurements of pco2 via headspace equilibration method were conducted in the lake poyang in 2021 and the indirectly calculated pco2 by ph and dic was highly correlated with directly measured pco2 r2 0 75 p 0 01 fig s1 the lake air interface fc g m 2 d 1 where positive values indicate co2 emissions from the lake to the atmosphere was calculated based on the bulk

illustrate relationships among water levels and other relevant factors this study applied four different time periods fig 2 a namely the dry season ds december and january the water level rising period rp from february to june the wet season ws july and the water level falling period fp from august to november the classification of these four periods was primarily based on water level variation the kruskal wallis h test and pairwise comparisons applying the wilcoxon rank sum test were conducted in r version 3 6 3 which were used to evaluate significant differences in parameters during the four different water level periods structural equation model was conducted in r version 3 6 3 which were used to evaluate the effect of various environmental factors on pco2 3 results 3 1 environmental parameters lake poyang water levels obtained from the hukou gaging station between 2017 and 2021 varied from 7 29 to 22 46 m with a mean value of 12 84 m water levels exhibited high seasonal fluctuations and water levels among the four different periods differed significantly p 0 01 table 1 and fig 2a mean water level values were lowest during the dry season 8 86 m and reached 12 41 m during the water level rising period before peaking during the wet season 18 38 m and then decreasing during the water level falling period 13 93 m table 1 fig 2a additionally from 2017 to 2021 the annual mean and minimum water level changes were relatively stable while the annual maximum water level changed greatly fig 2b in 2018 the annual maximum water level was smaller at 17 14 m while the annual maximum water level reached 22 46 m in 2020 fig 2b results showed that lake poyang wt differed significantly between 2017 and 2021 during all four periods p 0 05 while wt values were lowest during the dry season 10 11 3 76 c and highest during the wet season 30 22 2 34 c table 1 moreover ph values were lower during the water level rising period 7 29 0 41 and the water level falling period 7 39 0 43 and higher during the wet season 7 56 0 43 and the dry season 7 61 0 24 additionally ec and tds values were higher during the water level falling period and the dry season while they

lake poyang except for nh4 n between 2017 and 2021 differed significantly among all four periods with p values 0 05 for nitrogen n tn content 3 02 1 82 mg l 1 was higher during the water level falling period and lower during the water level rising period fig 3b conversely no3 n content during the water level rising period 0 83 0 61 mg l 1 was significantly higher compared to the other three periods p 0 01 fig 3b furthermore nh4 n content was low particularly during the water level rising period and the water level falling period fig 3b moreover tp and po4 p content during the dry season with mean values of 0 70 0 57 and 0 46 0 41 mg l 1 respectively was significantly higher compared to corresponding values during the other three periods p 0 01 fig 3b additionally tp and po4 p content trended extremely low during the water level rising period with mean values of 0 12 and 0 05 mg l 1 respectively fig 3b 3 2 pco2 and fc between 2017 and 2021 pco2 values in lake poyang varied significantly from 0 99 to 6859 62 μatm with an average value of 981 19 1059 13 μatm fig 4 a the pco2 values of the sub lakes 1233 71 1221 01 μatm were significantly higher than that of the main lake 950 05 861 17 μatm and the water channel 426 09 318 26 μatm in lake poyang p 0 01 fig 4a lake poyang pco2 values showed a higher trend during the water level rising period 1489 59 1629 24 μatm differing significantly from corresponding values during the dry season 623 77 402 82 μatm and the wet season 796 05 660 71 μatm fig 4a in terms of inter annual variation pco2 values of 2018 were significantly higher compared to pco2 values during 2019 2020 and 2021 in lake poyang p 0 01 fig 4a additionally the trend in co2 flux at the lake air interface averaging 0 63 1 15 g m 2 d 1 was similar to pco2 of lake poyang between 2017 and 2021 fig 4b mean co2 flux in lake poyang was highest during the water level rising period 1 18 1 64 g m 2 d 1 and lowest during the dry season 0 23 0 45 g m 2 d 1 fig 4b from 2017 to 2021 co2 flux of lake poyang exhibited an obvious decreasing trend which varied from 1 25 1 03 g m 2 d 1 in 2017 to 0 41 0 76 g m 2 d 1 in 2021 fig 4b 3 3 dic doc and δ13cdic as fig 5 a shows dic content in lake poyang between 2017 and 2021 trended high during the water level rising period 6 66 4 24 mg l 1 and significantly differed compared to the wet season 4 29 2 19 mg l 1 fig 5a doc content differed significantly among all four periods p 0 01 being highest during the dry season 7 75 2 21 mg l 1 and lowest during the water level falling period 3 56 2 45 mg l

periods p 0 01 fig 5a additionally δ13cdic values in lake poyang between 2018 and 2021 varied from 19 30 to 5 30 with a mean value of 12 18 fig 5b specifically results showed that δ13cdic values during the water level falling period 10 16 1 71 were more similar to the δ13c value of atmospheric co2 approximately 8 50 graven et al 2017 which was significantly higher compared to δ13cdic values during the other three periods p 0 01 fig 5b 4 discussion generally inland lake systems are oversaturated with co2 therefore they act as important atmospheric co2 sources nydahl et al 2017 ni et al 2020 serving as funnels for organic and inorganic c export storage and conversion lapierre and del giorgio 2012 in recent years the decrease observed in co2 degassing flux from lake systems appears to be a global phenomenon finlay et al 2015 ran et al 2021 which is likely influenced by anthropogenic activity and climate change similar to most relevant studies raymond et al 2013 liu et al 2019 the pco2 calculation from this study i e 981 19 1059 13 μatm confirms co2 oversaturation relative to the atmospheric equilibrium 410 μatm thus having acted as net co2 sources to the atmosphere between 2017 and 2021 fig 4 the averaged pco2 of lake poyang was slightly higher compared to other eutrophic lake systems in china i e lake donghu 520 3 455 6 μatm and lake taihu 778 169 μatm li et al 2018 xiao et al 2020 yan et al 2021 and lower than median pco2 values 1044 3552 µatm of lake and reservoir systems across china ran et al 2021 however co2 exchange flux dynamics indicated that lake poyang shifted from a co2 source in 2017 2020 to a co2 sink in 2021 where co2 flux varied from 1 25 1 03 g m 2 d 1 in 2017 to 0 41 0 76 g m 2 d 1 in 2021 fig 4b the mean co2 flux of lake poyang 0 63 1 15 g m 2 d 1 between 2017 and 2021 was lower than the mean co2 flux 0 92 1 26 g m 2 d 1 reported from global lake systems tranvik et al 2009 holgerson and raymond 2016 and much lower than the mean co2 flux of lake systems in china 1 64 3 01 g m 2 d 1 li et al 2018 4 1 factors influencing pco2 and co2 supersaturation the atmospheric sediment and watershed flux perga et al 2016 the carbonate equilibria zagarese et al 2021 the balance between photosynthesis and respiration of primary producers i e phytoplankton and macrophytes kaijser et al 2021 and variations caused by meteorological factors and hydrological processes blackburn and stanley 2020 yuan et al 2021 all affect the co2 saturation status of floodplain lake systems to varying degrees principal component analysis pca identified two principal components pcs and explained 42 4 of the total variance of lake poyang between 2017 and 2021 table s1 fig 6 a the pc1 accounted for 23 7 of the variance comprising of dic dtc chl a and ph which represent the coupling of terrestrial c transport and phytoplankton production processes ni et al 2021 in most inland waters the carbonate system regulates ph and in cases where the lake water receives some acidic sources such as acid rain it can be explained that ph controls the partial pressure pco2 cole and prairie 2009 ph can change the physical and chemical environment of water which subsequently plays a role in regulating the dynamic balance and distribution of carbonate systems co2 co3 2 and hco3 in water thus affecting the release of co2 in water salimon et al 2013 our results showed that ph levels had a significant and negative correlation to pco2 and co2 flux p 0 01 fig 6b which demonstrates the importance of carbonate buffering on co2 dynamics stets et al 2017 higher ph levels increased the co2 absorption capacity of the lake while also enhancing its c sink capacity at the same time the co2 absorption and release also regulate the ph level of lake systems external dic inputs may directly impact the co2 concentration of surface waters in lakes thus leading to co2 supersaturation and co2 efflux to the atmosphere mcdonald et al 2013 wilkinson et al 2016 in addition higher inputs of doc are also expected to impact co2 concentration by providing a carbon substrate in lakes algesten et al 2003 sobek et al 2005 our result exhibited that both dic and doc content had significant and positive correlations to pco2 rdic 0 59 rdoc 0 33 p 0 01 also confirming the vital role of external c input on pco2 in lake poyang fig 6b additionally pc2 explained 18 7 of the variance consisting significantly of water level do doc and tn table s1 fig 6a which is attributed to hydrological conditions and aquatic metabolism processes staehr and sand jensen 2006 moreover do content is widely recognized to be a sensitive indicator of photosynthetic intensity and a regulator of organic c decomposition müller et al 2012 additionally biological activities such as photosynthesis respiration and decomposition of organic matter can affect do content in water and photosynthetically generated do also affects co2 production and emissions arend et al 2011 this is supported by structural equation modeling results showing that water level tn and chl a together explained 56 of the do variance in lake poyang p 0 001 fig 7 in this study significant and negative correlations were observed between do and pco2 r 0 26 p 0 01 fig 6b which proved that in situ respiration contributed more to the co2 release than photosynthesis consumption cole and prairie 2009 young doc is the preferential source of in situ respiration mayorga et al 2005 and the significant variation of doc concentration in different periods p 0 01 also indicated that there is a considerable amount of biomineralization in lake poyang both the chl a and doc content had significant and positive correlations to pco2 rchl a 0 40 rdoc 0 33 p 0 01 fig 6b also proving that co2 consumed by phytoplankton photosynthesis was offset by co2 produced by in situ respiration and terrestrial input balmer and downing 2011 moreover this study also found that the pco2 values of the sub lakes were significantly higher than that of the main lake and the water channel in lake poyang p 0 01 fig 4a this may be due to the fact that the aquatic vegetation in the sub lakes area is more abundant and the water depth is shallow so it is greatly affected by the degradation of soil and vegetation organic matter wang et al 2022 at the same time our previous study found that the transparency of the sub lakes is low which may reduce the light availability of phytoplankton and macrophytes and thus affect the photosynthetic intensity wang et al 2022 nutrients are key factors affecting pco2 levels in aquatic ecosystems yuan et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 in this study both pco2 and co2 flux increased with an increased in lake poyang no3 n content fig 6b which is in agreement with results from other studies davidson et al 2015 sun et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 nutrient supplies can regulate co2 content in water by enhancing primary production or promoting bacterial mineralization larsen et al 2011 in lake systems however correlation analysis demonstrated that pco2 and co2 flux was negatively correlated to various forms of phosphorus p content i e tp and po4 p in lake poyang fig 6b other studies have reported similar results santoso et al 2017 trolle et al 2012 moreover p availability promoted the primary production of phytoplankton reducing co2 content in water delsontro et al 2018 furthermore it has been shown that catchment c input may actually completely reverse the relationship between nutrients and lake co2 concentrations by directly adding dic maberly et al 2013 or by doc to promote aquatic metabolism lapierre and del giorgio 2012 in order to more clearly explore the relationship between water level major driving factors and co2 emissions in water we constructed a structural equation model fig 7 on the one hand the water level fluctuation of floodplain lakes could affect pco2 by direct c transport on the other hand it could affect aquatic metabolism by regulating lake nutrient and chl a content and further regulates pco2 fig 7 in addition carbonate weathering in the watershed is also closely related to co2 supersaturation in the lake which should be considered in future studies on c dynamics marcé et al 2015 in addition to these factors air temperature solar radiation precipitation wind speed and other meteorological factors also play a key role in the pco2 and co2 flux of shallow lake systems amaral et al 2020 precipitation and rainstorm events play a particularly critical role when they flush large amounts of terrestrial c into lake systems which subsequently release co2 bartosiewicz et al 2015 tonetta et al 2017 pco2 was higher during the water level rising period fig 4a suggesting that rainfall increased terrestrial input and flooding transported more organic matter to the lake this is also supported by the corresponding high dic concentrations during the water level falling period fig 5 indicating that rainfall can enhance hydraulic erosion and soil flushing in lake poyang wei et al 2007 irradiance also affect the chemical activity biological activity and physical transport of lake systems nakayama et al 2019 water temperature is an important factor affecting organic carbon mineralization and carbonate balance in water bodies butman and raymond 2011 wang et al 2017 which was supported by the significant negative correlations between water temperature and c fractions in our study p 0 01 fig 6b river inflow and wind turbulence mix biotic and abiotic material buried in sediment into the water column andersen et al 2017 czikowsky et al 2018 additionally the contact area between waterbodies and the surrounding air increases as wind speeds increase resulting in an increase in the co2 exchange rate at the water air interface alin et al 2011 however in this study significant negative correlations were found between wind speed and pco2 i e co2 flux fig 6b this could be explained by the lower wind speed i e a mean wind speed of 1 99 m s 1 during our sampling periods which were relatively weak and therefore unable to cause water turbulence guérin et al 2007 4 2 interaction between carbon cycling and hydrological processes the water column and the sediment surface are active c pools and c is fixed and released at the water land interface the water air interface and the water sediment interface through inorganic and organic c pool conversion processes as well as the conversion processes between these pools barker et al 2013 gao et al 2022 biological and solubility pumps between the atmosphere and waterbodies can be used to determine co2 exchange rates at the water air interface gao et al 2021 the solubility pump refers to the process whereby atmospheric co2 enters lake water via dissolution at the water air interface where it is then stored in the form of co3 2 and hco3 in waterbodies gao et al 2022 atmospheric and aqueous co2 are continuously converted into organic c and biologically derived carbonates through autotroph photosynthetic processes before being transported from the carbonate equilibria down to the hypolimnion via sequential food web processes which collectively act as a biological pump passow and carlson 2012 raymond et al 2013 solubility and biological pumps in floodplain lake systems are affected by the frequent fluctuation of their hydrological conditions nutrient levels inorganic ion conditions and climate factors polimene et al 2016 wang et al 2022 the intense and frequent water level fluctuations that take place in floodplain lake systems and associated consequences have an important impact on the c cycle and co2 emission rates wang et al 2021 pilcher et al 2015 this study also observed very significant and positive correlations between water levels and pco2 i e co2 flux r 0 30 p 0 01 fig 6b the hydrological connectivity of lake poyang was poor during the dry season owing to the annual appearance of greater than 100 sub lake systems hu et al 2019 moreover lower water tables and processes such as drought induced acidification may reduce organic c production and sever the link between terrigenous c and waterbodies clark et al 2005 the most direct effect that rising water levels have on pco2 and co2 flux in this floodplain lake system is water area expansion which may significantly enhance the hydrological connectivity of the lake system enabling it to receive a greater amount of terrestrial c and dissolved co2 in situ co2 production from terrestrially derived c degradation coupled with direct co2 inputs through river inflow may result in higher pco2 and co2 flux maberly et al 2013 a similar increase in co2 efflux was reported by lupon et al 2019 conducted in a boreal headwater stream where higher co2 flux was also reinforced by a reduction in gross primary production gpp i e co2 uptake given that this process is often more strongly affected by flooding than ecosystem respiration qasem et al 2019 in the dry season due to less rainfall and low flow less exogenous carbon input coupled with higher nutrient concentration fig 3b is conducive to aquatic primary production thus reducing the pco2 level li et al 2012 judd et al 2015 in addition shallow water depth during dry season may be more conducive to light availability by phytoplankton and submerged plants therefore we attribute the lowest mean pco2 during the dry season to less sediment c input and enhanced water production liu et al 2013 also pointed out that sediment c n ratio and water depth were important factors affecting co2 emission in lake poyang additionally this study also showed that pco2 of lake poyang exhibited an obvious decreasing trend and the mean pco2 value was the largest in 2018 1474 89 μatm and the smallest in 2020 474 28 μatm while the annual maximum water level was the lowest at 17 14 m in 2018 and the highest at 22 46 m in 2020 fig 2b it indicated that the higher water level for a long time in a year may drive the change trend of c source to c sink in floodplain systems and long term monitoring is of great significance for accurate evaluation of lake co2 source and sink conversion moreover water level fluctuations may also directly or indirectly affect the c cycle and co2 emission rates of floodplain lake systems through their effect on water flow velocity wang et al 2021 water retention time pacheco 2015 and vertical mixing schmiedeskamp et al 2021 which further affects carbonate dissolution maberly et al 2013 nutrient supplies and phytoplankton photosynthesis and respiration wang et al 2021 results from this study showed that water levels significantly and positively correlated to dic content r 0 20 p 0 01 and negatively correlated to ph r 0 20 p 0 01 confirming that water level fluctuations effect carbonate dissolution and co2 emission rates fig 6b many studies have revealed the importance that water levels play on phytoplankton production qian et al 2017 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2019 lake poyang s appreciable water level fluctuations have significantly impacted its nutrient levels e g n p and silicon si which has subsequently influenced phytoplankton growth and primary production wang et al 2021 this study has shown that lake poyang water levels significantly and positively correlated to its available nutrients i e tn and no3 n p 0 01 and significantly and negatively correlated to other available nutrients i e nh4 n and po4 p p 0 01 which is indicative of the complex impact that water level fluctuations have on nutrient supplies on the one hand rising water levels may to some extent have dilution and washout effects on nutrients in waterbodies on the other hand lake poyang may comparably also receive higher nutrient inputs wu et al 2013 additionally increased water flow rates caused by water level fluctuations generally inhibit phytoplankton growth valdes weaver et al 2006 lake sediments benefit herbaceous plant growth when exposed to air and plants may decay and subsequently release co2 after being submerged by rising water levels potentially increasing lake co2 emissions yuan et al 2021 results from this study showed that mean co2 flux in lake poyang was highest during the water level rising period 1 18 1 64 g m 2 d 1 which may be due to the flooding of wetland vegetation during this period results specifically showed that δ13cdic values during the water level falling period 10 16 1 71 were closer to δ13c values of atmospheric co2 i e approximately 8 50 fig 5b indicating the important contribution of atmospheric co2 on dic during the water level falling period in lake poyang graven et al 2017 the pco2 value of 48 57 of the samples was lower than the atmospheric partial pressure of co2 during the water level falling period and the trend of co2 absorption from the atmosphere was stronger which was speculated to be the influence of higher co2 uptake throughout the whole wet season as well as high outflow and fast water velocity in some regions during the water level falling period yuan et al 2021 water level fluctuations may also have an impact on vertical mixing processes which is an extremely important physical lake process given that it controls biochemical flux gudasz et al 2010 additionally owing to the appreciable water depth differences that occur during different periods the effect of wind speed on co2 emissions may also significantly differ in floodplain lake systems to summarize under strong hydrological fluctuations floodplain lakes have obvious potential for c source and sink conversion and the intense and frequent water level fluctuations may also have a direct or indirect impact on c cycling processes and co2 exchange in floodplain lake systems via their effect on physical processes exogenous input and in situ metabolism related to photosynthesis respiration and organic matter degradation in floodplain lakes 5 conclusion this study found that the pco2 in lake poyang acted as a co2 source to the atmosphere between 2017 and 2021 with a mean pco2 range of 981 19 1059 13 μatm during 2017 2021 the pco2 and co2 flux of lake poyang showed significant spatial and temporal differences the pco2 values trended high during the water level rising period and the pco2 values in the sub lakes area were significantly higher than those in the main lake area and the water channel of lake poyang in 2017 2021 moreover co2 exchange flux dynamics of lake poyang exhibited an obvious decreasing trend during 2017 2021 exogenous input and in situ metabolism were the main driving mechanisms of co2 absorption and release of lake poyang in 2017 2021 moreover the intense and frequent water level fluctuations inherent to floodplain lake systems and their associated consequential effects also played a crucial role in co2 dynamics of lake poyang we confirmed that floodplain lakes have obvious potential for c source and sink conversion significant water level fluctuations of lake poyang on the one hand through the direct effects on inorganic c transport and physical processes in the watershed regulate pco2 dynamics on the other hand it could affect in situ metabolic processes such as photosynthesis respiration and organic matter degradation by regulating biological factors such as nutrients chl a and organic c and then indirectly drive co2 absorption and release in lake poyang the results of this study clarify the source and sink characteristics of co2 in floodplain lakes with drastic hydrological changes which can potentially explain part of the missing sink in the global c cycle results from this study will help to strengthen our understanding of driving mechanisms of c emissions in floodplain systems under appreciable water level fluctuations while providing important references for the study of co2 emission in floodplain lakes worldwide declaration of competing interest the

15536,in this study sodium tetraborate na2b4o7 was introduced to enhance the degradation of acetaminophen act in heat activated peroxymonosulfate pms process the elimination of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process followed the pseudo first order kinetics the corresponding kobs value with 10 mm na2b4o7 was 33 1 times higher than that in heat pms process 1o2 and ho were identified as primary reactive species via quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance technology b oh 4 the hydrolysis product of na2b4o7 reacted with pms to generate hoob oh 3 1o2 was generated by the self decomposition of pms using b oh 4 as catalyst while ho was produced via the breakage of peroxide bond of pms and hoob oh 3 under high temperature act was degraded by reactive species via the pathways of nh bond breakage oh replacement nh2 oxidation and benzene ring cleavage nine transformation intermediates were detected by lc q tof ms and the toxicity of reaction solution decreased significantly with the elimination of act increasing na2b4o7 dosage pms concentration initial ph and reaction temperature were conducive to act elimination humic acid cl and co3 2 inhibited the degradation of act heavily while so4 2 and no3 had the negligible effects moreover b oh 4 could react with free chlorine to the inert b oh 3ocl and further significantly suppress the formation of chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water in na2b4o7 heat pms process this study provided an effective way to enhance the oxidation capacity of heat pms process and suppress the formation of chlorinated by products in chloride containing water and the findings had important implications for using borate buffer in the studies of pms based advanced oxidation processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peroxymonosulfate heat activation sodium tetraborate monoperoxyborate chlorinated by products 1 introduction in recent years heat activated peroxymonosulfate pms a very attractive and controllable activation approach has been increasingly used to degrade organic contaminants milh et al 2021 ulucan altuntas et al 2022 yin et al 2022 the unselective and strongly oxidizing radicals of so4 and ho are generated by the breakage of oo bond in pms structure with the activation of heat milh et al 2021 compared to the most widely used activation approaches with transition mentals i e cu2 and co2 heat activated pms can avoid the addition of toxic metals reduce the ineffective decomposition of oxidants and improve the effective utilization of pms milh et al 2021 in addition to being an activator of pms heat can also improve the solubility of organic pollutants and the temperature of the reaction process costanza et al 2010 wang et al 2014 conducive to increasing the reaction rate to shorten the treatment time liu et al 2017 xiao et al 2022 yang et al 2010 however because of the high energy of pms oo bond 140 213 3 kj mol 1 heat pms process would consume much more energy and cost to remove contaminants compared with the widely used heat activated peroxydisulfate pds system the energy of pds oo bond was 92 kj mol 1 cai et al 2022 up to date many efforts have been made to improve the oxidation capacity of heat pms process for instance the combination of microwave radiation and porous activated carbon with heat activated pms process significantly accelerated the generation of so4 and ho and the degradation of organic contaminants liu et al 2020 qi et al 2017 nevertheless the above enhanced heat pms processes still exist some intrinsic problems such as the sudden ph drop with the addition of strongly acidic pms solution the obvious suppression of actual water matrix on contaminants elimination and the excessive generation of chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water recently our research group found that the naoh enhanced heat pms process can significantly accelerate the degradation of organic contaminants and had a well adaptability to actual water matrix cai et al 2022 however naoh heat pms process had weak ph buffer capacity cai et al 2022 and would generate amounts of free chlorine for the treatment of cl containing water ahn et al 2021 and the generated free chlorine would further react with natural organic matter to produce the hazardous chlorinated by products the ideal approaches to improve the heat pms process should accelerate the degradation of contaminants and suppress the formation of chlorinated by products at the same time sodium tetraborate na2b4o7 the basic raw material to make boron compounds is commonly employed to buffer the solution ph in pms activation processes liu et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 2017 zhu et al 2019 the added na2b4o7 will be initially hydrolyzed to produce boric acid h3bo3 a lewis acid and h3bo3 can combine with oh to form its lewis base of b oh 4 chen et al 2021 the generated acid base pairs of h3bo3 b oh 4 pka 9 2 can act as the buffer to alleviate the sudden drop of ph caused by the addition of pms previous study reported that b oh 4 can also catalyze the self decomposition of pms to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 and accelerate the degradation of contaminants under room temperature chen et al 2021 monoperoxyborate hoob oh 3 an asymmetric peroxide containing oo bond will be generated from the reaction between b oh 4 and hso5 chen et al 2021 similar to pms the oo bond of hoob oh 3 may also be broken to produce free radicals under high temperature it was rational to speculate that the addition of na2b4o7 into heat pms process will help to generate the reactive oxygen species including the selective 1o2 and unselective radicals of ho and so4 resulting in the enhancement on contaminants degradation furthermore previous study reported that b oh 4 can react with free chlorine to produce b oh 3ocl bousher et al 1987 b oh 3ocl is a combined chlorine having weaker potential than free chlorine to produce the chlorinated by products hence the addition of na2b4o7 into heat pms process might suppress the formation of chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water nevertheless na2b4o7 enhanced heat pms process has still not yet been scientifically investigated acetaminophen act a typical pharmaceutical contaminant and frequently detected in aquatic environments was selected as the main targeted probe in this study to investigate the efficiency and mechanism of na2b4o7 enhanced heat pms process the study mainly focused on i the enhancing effect of na2b4o7 on act and other contaminants degradation ii the identification and possible generation mechanism of primary reactive oxygen species in na2b4o7 heat pms process iii the transformation pathway of act and the evolution of toxicity iv the effects of reaction parameters na2b4o7 dosage pms concentration initial ph and reaction temperature on act elimination v the effect of actual water matrix on act degradation and vi the formation of chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials trichloromethane tcm haloacetic acids haas i e monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa and their internal standards fluorobenzene for tcm and 1 2 dibromopropane for haas were obtained from sigma aldrich usa pms khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2hso4 and acetaminophen act were purchased from aladdin bio chem technology industrial corporation shanghai china disodium tetraborate decahydrate na2b4o7 10h2o was obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china other used materials were listed in text s1 lake water and ground water were adopted from the city of xiamen and their major indexes were shown in table s1 2 2 experimental procedures experiments for act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process were performed in magnetic stirring thermostatic bath desired dosages of 10 mm act stock solution and ultrapure water were added into flask subsequently the reaction solution was preheated to 75 c the initial reaction solution ph was adjusted to 9 0 as quickly as possible with 0 5 m naoh and then desired na2b4o7 and pms dosages were added at the same time into the solution to initiate the reaction at 0 0 5 1 2 3 5 7 10 15 min samples 900 μl were withdrawn and quenched immediately with the pre added 100 μl of 100 mm na2s2o3 solution the detailed experimental procedures for other degradation experiments quenching experiments degradation intermediates identification experiments toxicity assessment experiments chlorinated by products formation experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments were described in text s2 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of organic contaminants including act

quality indexes of actual water samples toxicity detection toc detection degradation intermediates identification detection were described in texts s4 and s8 and tables s3 and s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced degradation of act and other contaminants in na2b4o7 heat pms process as shown in fig 1 a the degradation efficiency of act in heat na2b4o7 process heat pms process na2b4o7 pms process and na2b4o7 heat pms process respectively as can be seen the act removal efficiency in heat na2b4o7 process heat pms process and na2b4o7 pms process were about 2 12 and 15 respectively comparatively act could be completely degraded by heat pms process with the addition of 10 mm na2b4o7 within 15 min the removal of act followed pseudo first order kinetics well r2 0 99 and the corresponding kobs values increased from 0 009 min 1 to 0 298 min 1 with the addition of na2b4o7 in heat pms process several studies have reported that ionic strength significantly affected the degradation of contaminants in pms activation processes ali et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 it was observed in fig s1 that the added 10 mm na2so4 and 30 mm nano3 having the same ionic strength with 10 mm na2b4o7 text s5 did not affect the degradation of act in heat pms process excluding the contribution of ionic strength on act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process fig s2 shows that the decomposition of pms was also accelerated with the addition of na2b4o7 in heat pms process suggesting that na2b4o7 might accelerate the heat activated pms process to generate more reactive oxygen species to further evaluate the applicability of na2b4o7 heat pms process experiments for degrading different organic contaminants including diclofenac dcf carbamazepine cbz ibuprofen ibu chloramphenicol cap bisphenol a bpa and act were conducted as displayed in figs 1 b and s3 the addition of na2b4o7 into heat pms process accelerated the elimination of all organic contaminants the corresponding kobs values for act bpa dcf cbz ibu and cap were calculated about 33 1 57 1 1 2 2 9 1 2 and 1 7 times higher than that in heat pms process respectively these phenomena further indicated that the addition of na2b4o7 into heat pms process should accelerate the generation of reactive oxygen species with strong oxidation capacity such as ho and so4 compared with the organic contaminants of dcf cbz ibu and cap bpa and act had higher kobs values in na2b4o7 heat pms process these phenomena indicated that amounts of selective reactive oxygen species for instance singlet oxygen 1o2 should be also generated in na2b4o7 heat pms process in other words na2b4o7 heat pms process might generate different kinds of reactive oxygen species such as ho so4 and 1o2 having the wide applicability for degrading organic contaminants 3 2 identification of primary reactive oxygen species and their generation mechanism 3 2 1 identification of primary reactive oxygen species amounts of literatures reported that pms self decomposition under alkaline ph conditions will produce 1o2 lou et al 2017 peng et al 2021 nie et al 2019 while the breakage of oo bond of hso5 under high temperature will generate ho and so4 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2022 hence different kinds of reactive oxygen species including 1o2 ho and so4 would be generated and involved in act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process tert butanol tba was selected as the scavenger of ho selectively because tba possesses much higher reaction rate constant with ho than so4 k tba ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and k tba so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 and does barely react with 1o2 considering that methanol and ethanol were prone to volatilize at 75 c cai et al 2022 the non volatile benzoic acid ba was selected as the scavenger of so4 and ho k ba ho 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 and k ba so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 furfuryl alcohol ffa was selected as the scavenger of 1o2 and the radicals due to the high reaction rate constants with 1o2 and the radicals k ffa 1o2 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 ahn et al 2021 k ffa ho 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 zhu et al 2019 and k ffa so4 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 text s7 and fig s4 according to the calculated ck values in text s6 and tables s5 and s6 10 mm tba was adopted for quenching ho 1 mm ba was applied for quenching ho and so4 and 2 5 mm ffa was adopted for quenching 1o2 and the radicals it is important to note that the extra consumption of pms via the direct reaction between ffa and pms was relatively low as shown in fig s2 and text s6 as shown in fig 2 a there was a significant inhibition on act elimination in presence of 10 mm tba with the corresponding kobs value of act elimination decreased from 0 298 min 1 to 0 180 min 1 fig 2 b the phenomenon revealed that ho made considerable contribution on act removal in na2b4o7 heat pms process the inhibitory effect of ba on act degradation was nearly same with tba fig 2 a and b suggesting that so4 made a negligible contribution on act degradation the added 2 5 mm ffa significantly inhibited the degradation of act fig 2 a with the corresponding kobs value of the degradation of act decreased from 0 298 min 1 to 0 025 min 1 fig 2 b the results indicated that 1o2 made a considerable contribution on act elimination in na2b4o7 heat pms process according to the obtained kobs values in fig 2 b the contribution percentages of ho so4 and 1o2 on act removal were respectively calculated as 33 2 and 57 as shown in fig s5 the results of quenching experiments clearly demonstrated that 1o2 and ho were the major reactive oxygen species responsible for act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process to further determine the reactive oxygen species electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments were carried out 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinone temp can selectively capture 1o2 to form tempo liang and fu 2021 han et al 2011 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrole n oxide dmpo can separately capture ho and so4 to produce dmpooh and dmpo so4 han et al 2011 yu et al 2020 the signal of tempo triplet peak with 1 1 1 intensity ratio was detected in na2b4o7 heat pms process fig 2 c demonstrating that 1o2 was generated the intensity of tempo signal in na2b4o7 heat pms process was much stronger than that in heat pms process indicating that the added na2b4o7 significantly accelerated the generation of 1o2 previous study reported that the degradation of contaminants could be accelerated in d2o because the lifetime of 1o2 in d2o was 18 times longer than that in h2o li et al 2022 as shown in fig s6 act degradation was accelerated in d2o solution 50 d2o and 50 h2o further confirming the production of 1o2 in na2b4o7 heat pms process as shown in fig 2 d the epr signals of dmpooh quadruplet peak with 1 2 2 1 intensity ratio and dmpo so4 sextuplet peak with 1 1 1 1 1 1 intensity ratio were also detected in na2b4o7 heat pms process demonstrating that ho and so4 were also generated of note the epr signal of dmpo so4 was rather weak which could be interpreted to the rapid transformation from dmpo so4 adduct to dmpooh adduct in water via nucleophilic substitution oh et al 2016 rao et al 2019 however fig s6 demonstrated that so4 made a negligible contribution on the elimination of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process fig s7 revealed that the reaction ph maintained near 9 0 during the act removal with na2b4o7 heat pms process therefore the negligible contribution of so4 on act elimination could be mainly due to the rapid transformation of so4 to ho via eqs 1 and 2 under alkaline ph conditions ma et al 2017 additionally fig s8 revealed that the addition of na2b4o7 in heat pms process significantly accelerated the degradation of nitrobenzene the indicator of ho and does barely react with 1o2 and so4 suggesting that the generation of ho was accelerated with the addition of na2b4o7 nevertheless the intensity of dmpooh signal in na2b4o7 heat pms process was much weaker than that obtained in heat pms process previous literatures reported that 1o2 will react with dmpo and interfere the trapping and determination of radicals bilski et al 1996 shoji et al 2007 therefore the weaker intensity of dmpooh signal in na2b4o7 heat pms process might be mainly attributed to the interference of the coexistent 1o2 on the trapping of ho 1 so 4 o h so 4 2 h o 2 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 h o h in addition several literatures reported that so5 2 will be transformed to ho2 under alkaline condition via eq 3 and ho2 could further react with so5 2 to form superoxide anion radical o2 via eq 4 jiang et al 2017 qi et al 2016 it was rational to infer that o2 might be generated and involved in the degradation of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process however fig 2 a revealed that superoxide dismutase sod had negligible effect on act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process excluding the involvement of o2 on act removal nitro blue tetrazolium nbt could be selectively reduced by o2 to generate methyl hydrazone with the characteristic absorption wavelength of 560 nm fig s9 revealed that there was no methyl hydrazone generated when 0 6 mm of nbt was added in na2b4o7 heat pms process suggesting the absence of o2 these results firmly demonstrated that o2 was not generated and involved in act degradation with na2b4o7 heat pms process 3 so 5 2 h 2 o o h ho 2 so 4 2 h 4 so 5 2 ho 2 so 4 2 h o 2 3 2 2 generation mechanism of reactive oxygen species according to the above results and discussion the main reactive oxygen species to degrade act were 1o2 and ho in na2b4o7 heat pms process scheme 1 proposed the possible generation mechanism of 1o2 and ho in na2b4o7 heat pms process there might be two different production pathways to generate 1o2 in na2b4o7 heat pms process the first pathway to generate 1o2 was the self decomposition of pms under alkaline ph conditions lou et al 2017 peng et al 2021 specifically partial hso5 was ionized to its deprotonated form of so5 2 at ph 9 0 eq 5 and fig s10 and then 1o2 was generated from the reaction of hso5 with so5 2 eq 6 of note the added na2b4o7 was initially hydrolyzed to produce h3bo3 and oh eq 7 and partial h3bo3 was then hydrolyzed to form its lewis base of b oh 4 eq 8 and fig s11 therefore the added na2b4o7 had strong buffering capacity and could maintain the reaction solution ph at around 9 0 fig s7 which was well beneficial to pms self decomposition with the pka of 9 4 the second pathway to generate 1o2 was the self decomposition of pms with b oh 4 as the catalyst chen et al 2021 to be more specific b oh 4 the hydrolysis product of na2b4o7 firstly reacted with hso5 so5 2 to generate hoob oh 3 eqs 9 and 10 and the generated hoob oh 3 further reacted with hso5 so5 2 to generate 1o2 and b oh 4 eqs 11 and 12 fig s12 showed the change of hoob oh 3 concentration in na2b4o7 heat pms process and hoob oh 3 concentration reached about 0 33 mm within 15 min likewise there might be three different production pathways to generate ho in na2b4o7 heat pms process the first pathway to generate ho was the direct breakage of oo bond of hso5 under high temperature via eq 14 of note the breakage of oo bond of hso5 under high temperature also generated so4 eq 14 and the reaction solution ph was kept under alkaline condition during the elimination of act fig s7 therefore the second pathway to generate ho was the reaction of the generated so4 with oh eq 1 the transformation of so4 to ho was also the main reason for the negligible contribution of so4 on act elimination fig s5 similar to pms and peracetic acid lin et al 2021 hoob oh 3 the product of the reactions between hso5 so5 2 and b oh 4 eqs 9 and 10 was also an asymmetric peroxide previous researches had reported that the asymmetric oo bond of peracetic acid and pms were prone to break to generate radicals under high temperature antoniou et al 2010 wang et al 2020 so the third one to generate ho was the breakage of oo bond of hoob oh 3 under high temperature eq 15 5 hso 5 h so 5 2 p k a 9 4 6 hso 5 so 5 2 2 so 4 2 h 1 o 2 7 b 4 o 7 2 7 h 2 o 4 h 3 b o 3 2 o h 8 h 3 b o 3 h 2 o b oh 4 h p k a 9 2 9 b oh 4 hso 5 hoob oh 3 so 4 2 h 10 b oh 4 so 5

transformation pathway of act and toxicity assessment to study the possible transformation pathways of act the lc q tof ms was used to identify the degradation intermediates of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process as displayed in table s7 nine kinds of intermediates were detected during the degradation of act including acetaminophen dimer tp1 4 aminophenol tp2 4 aminocatechol tp3 4 hydroperoxyamino phenol tp4 p nitrophenol tp5 maleic acid tp6 lactic acid tp7 glycolic acid tp8 and formic acid tp9 three possible transformation pathways of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process were then proposed and presented in scheme 2 in pathway i act was firstly attacked by oh to produce phenoxy radical cation act oh and its deprotonated form of phenoxy act o and then acetaminophen dimer tp1 was produced through covalent bonds between carbons at the hydroxyl ortho position of act o liang et al 2016 in pathway ii 1o2 and oh attacked the nh bond on act molecular structure to form 4 aminophenol tp2 ghanbari et al 2021 and an h atom on tp2 was replaced by oh to produce 4 aminocatechol tp3 in pathway ⅲ 1o2 and oh attacked the amino group on the benzene ring of tp2 to produce 4 hydroperoxyamino phenol tp4 and p nitrophenol tp5 fanaei et al 2019 moctezuma et al 2012 tp4 and tp5 were further oxidated to maleic acid tp6 via a series of procedures including the replacement of n contained group by oh the decomposition and hydroxylation of benzene ring and the elimination of h2o zhang et al 2015 subsequently lactic acid tp7 was generated by the cleavage of cc bond on tp6 molecular structure and glycolic acid tp8 and formic acid tp9 were generated by the further cleavage of cc bond of tp7 phong vo et al 2019 in fact although act was completely degraded within 15 min fig 1 the toc removal efficiency was less than 10 within 15 min in na2b4o7 heat pms process fig s13 these results revealed that most of act was transformed to the aforementioned intermediates and products only a small part was mineralized to co2 and h2o previous studies reported that several act degradation intermediates and products had even more toxicity to organisms than act itself resulting in the increase of biotoxicity after the degradation of act le et al 2017 thus the software of ecosar 2 0 u s environmental protection agency was employed to assess the acute and chronic toxicity of act and the aforementioned nine kinds of transformation intermediates toward fish daphnid and green algae as displayed in fig 3 and table s8 besides tp2 and tp4 the other seven transformation products of act possessed lower toxic toward fish daphnid and green algae than act itself especially tp7 tp8 and tp9 produced via pathway iii were even not harmful toward fish daphnid and green algae it was rational to infer that the toxicity of reaction solution should decrease along with the degradation of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process furthermore luminescent bacteria test using biofix lumi bacterium as the indicator was applied to evaluate the toxicity change during the elimination of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process fig s14 exhibited the inhibition rate of biofix lumi luminescent bacteria decreased significantly from about 67 2 to 46 1 after the complete degradation of act within 15 min the phenomenon indicated that the toxicity of reaction solution decreased along with the elimination of act which was consistent with the aforementioned conclusion that most of act transformation products possessed lower toxicity toward fish daphnid and green algae than act itself 3 4 effect of reaction parameters 3 4 1 effect of na2b4o7 dosage fig 4 a depicted the effect of na2b4o7 dosage on act elimination in na2b4o7 heat pms process as exhibited in fig 4 a an increase in na2b4o7 dosage below 20 mm resulted in a remarkable elevation of act degradation for instance the k obs value of act degradation with 20 mm na2b4o7 was 49 0 times higher than that obtained without na2b4o7 fig s15 a according to the aforementioned analysis and discussion in section 3 2 2 there were two major reasons for the elevation of act elimination with increasing na2b4o7 dosage firstly the increase of na2b4o7 dosage would increase the concentrations of the acid base pairs of h3bo3 b oh 4 which was helpful to maintain reaction solution under alkaline conditions as shown in table s9 when the initial reaction solution ph was set at 9 00 the final reaction solution ph at 15 min was increased from 2 60 to 9 06 with increasing na2b4o7 dosage from 0 mm to 20 mm the elevation of reaction solution ph below 9 4 the pka value of pms was conducive to producing 1o2 via the pathway of pms self decomposition lou et al 2017 peng et al 2021 and to generating ho via the breakage of oo bond of pms under high temperature secondly the increase of na2b4o7 dosage would increase the concentration of hoob oh 3 leading to more 1o2 generation via the reaction of hso5 so5 2 with hoob oh 3 betterton and hoffmann 1990 chen et al 2021 and more ho generation via the breakage of oo bond of hoob oh 3 under high temperature in summary the increase of na2b4o7 dosage was favorable for the generation of 1o2 and ho and the degradation of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process 3 4 2 effect of pms concentration amounts of studies involved in pms activation processes reported that increasing pms concentration could accelerate the generation of reactive oxygen species and the elimination of organic contaminants peng et al 2021 lou et al 2017 as exhibited in fig 4 b the act elimination was drastically accelerated with increasing the pms concentration over the range of 0 2 mm for instance the corresponding kobs values of act removal were improved from 0 001 min 1 to 0 298 min 1 and 0 423 min 1 when the concentration of pms increased from 0 mm to 1 5 mm and 2 0 mm respectively fig s15 b these phenomena suggested that increasing pms concentration had a favorable effect on act degradation of in na2b4o7 heat pms process according to the aforementioned analysis in section 3 2 2 increasing pms concentration could accelerate the self decomposition of pms and its reaction with hoob oh 3 to produce 1o2 and the breakage of oo bond of pms and hoob oh 3 to generate ho under high temperature hence increasing pms concentration was favorable to improve the reactive oxygen species production and act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process 3 4 3 effect of initial ph as for most of pms activation processes initial ph had a heavy impact on the elimination of organic contaminants liu et al 2020 qi et al 2017 nevertheless as displayed in fig 4 c there was no significant effect on act removal when initial ph varied in the range from 3 0 to 11 0 to be more specific the corresponding kobs value of act removal had a slight increase from 0 265 min 1 to 0 318 min 1 as initial ph was improved from 3 0 to 11 0 fig s15 c of note the added na2b4o7 would be hydrolyzed to the acid base pairs of h3bo3 b oh 4 having strong buffering capacity fig s16 demonstrated that reaction solution ph slightly rose with the increase of initial ph but was kept around 9 0 regardless of the change of initial ph over the range of 3 0 11 0 these results suggested that the insignificant effect of initial ph on the elimination of act could be attributed to the strong buffering capacity of h3bo3 b oh 4 in other words na2b4o7 heat pms process possessed the advantage of well ph adaptability 3 4 4 effect of reaction temperature reaction temperature was a crucial factor for affecting the elimination of organic contaminants with heat activated pms processes cai et al 2022 yin et al 2022 the effect of reaction temperature on act elimination was then investigated in na2b4o7 heat pms process fig 4 d revealed that the degradation of act was dramatically accelerated with increasing reaction temperature from 45 c to 85 c accordingly the kobs values continuously increased from 0 068 min 1 to 0 298 min 1 and 0 467 min 1 when reaction temperature was elevated from 45 c to 75 c and 85 c respectively fig s15 d these results demonstrated that raising reaction temperature was also beneficial to the removal of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process according to the aforementioned mechanism in section 3 2 2 and arrhenius formula the increase of reaction temperature could accelerate the self decomposition of pms and its reaction with hoob oh 3 to produce 1o2 and the breakage of oo bond of pms and hoob oh 3 to generate ho as shown in fig s17 the natural logarithm of kobs values for act elimination had a good linear correlation with reaction temperature the phenomenon demonstrated that the degradation of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process indeed obeyed arrhenius formula according to eq 16 the apparent activation energy ea of act elimination in na2b4o7 heat pms process was determined to be 46 30 kj mol 1 the ea value was much closer to that of the self decomposition of pms to produce 1o2 34 53 kj mol 1 qi et al 2016 and far lower than that of the breakage of pms oo bond to produce ho 105 60 kj mol 1 yin et al 2022 these results were consistent with the aforementioned result that the contribution of 1o2 on act removal was much higher than that of ho fig s5 16 ln k o b s lna e a rt 3 5 effect of actual water matrix natural organic matter and many anions are often contained in actual water bodies and have noticeable influence on the performance of heat activated pms processes cai et al 2022 yin et al 2022 the typical natural organic matter of humic acid and several common anions including cl so4 2 no3 and co3 2 were applied to assess the effect of natural water constituents on act removal in na2b4o7 heat pms process as exhibited in fig 5 a humic acid cl and co3 2 inhibited the degradation of act heavily while so4 2 and no3 had the negligible effects on act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process the corresponding kobs values decreased from 0 298 min 1 to 0 118 min 1 0 185 min 1 and 0 151 min 1 with the addition of 5 mg c l 1 humic acid 5 mm cl and 5 mm co3 2 respectively fig s18 the inhibition effect of humic acid on act elimination could be interpreted to the scavenging of reactive oxygen species in na2b4o7 heat pms process i e 1o2 ho and so4 cai et al 2022 considering that reaction ph was not influenced with the addition of co3 2 data not shown the inhibition of co3 2 on act removal could be mainly interpreted to the transformation from the strong radicals of ho and so4 to the secondary radical of co3 having lower reactivity towards organic contaminants sun et al 2020 the phenomenon that 5 mm cl had significant inhibition effect on act removal was very strange which was against with most of previous literatures cai et al 2022 peng et al 2021 it has been widely accepted that the presence of cl could promote the elimination of contaminants with pms activation processes because the reactive free chlorine could be generated by the reaction between cl and pms via eq 19 ahn et al 2021 the influence of cl concentration on act removal in heat pms process naoh heat pms process and na2b4o7 heat pms process were then comparatively investigated as shown in figs 5 b 5 c and s19 the act degradation in heat pms process and naoh heat pms process was progressively accelerated with increasing cl concentration below 30 mm nevertheless the elimination of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process was inhibited when increasing the cl concentration over the range of 0 10 mm but then was improved with further increasing cl concentration from 10 mm to 30 mm the corresponding k obs values declined from 0 298 min 1 to 0 147 min 1 with the cl concentration increasing over the range of 0 10 mm and then increased from 0 147 min 1 to 1 055 min 1 with the cl concentration further increasing from 10 mm to 30 mm in other words an obvious improvement on act removal was observed only when cl concentration was more than 25 mm in na2b4o7 heat pms process previous study reported that free chlorine could react with b oh 4 via eq 20 to produce the combined chlorine of b oh 3ocl having lower reactivity toward contaminants bousher et al 1987 hence the inhibition effect of low cl concentration on act elimination could be mainly ascribed to the transformation of free chlorine to the inert b oh 3ocl 17 co 3 2 h o o h co 3 18 co 3 2 so 4 so 4 2 co 3 19 hso 5 c l so 4 2 hclo 20 b oh 4 hclo cl o b oh 3 oc l h 2 o o h furthermore the influence of two different actual water backgrounds i e lake water and ground water on act elimination with na2b4o7 heat pms process were evaluated and displayed in fig 5 d similar with ultrapure water the degradation efficiency of act in lake water and ground water also reached 100 within 15 min the corresponding kobs values were 0 372 min 1 in lake water and 0 317 min 1 in ground water respectively fig s20 even higher than that in ultrapure water 0 298 min 1 there results indicated that actual water matrix had favorable effect on act removal combined with the effect of humic acid and common anions on act removal fig 5 and the water quality indexes of lake water and ground water table s1 the enhancement of actual water on act removal could be interpreted by the better buffer capacity of actual water compared with ultrapure water overall na2b4o7 heat pms process possessed well adaptability toward actual water matrix and had good application potential for degrading organic contaminants in water 3 6 formation of chlorinated by products owing to the formation of free chlorine hocl ocl via the reaction of cl with pms and the ubiquitous existence of natural organic matter in actual water there was great potential for the formation of chlorinated by products when pms activation processes were applied to treat cl containing water ahn et al 2021 cai et al 2022 especially for heat activated pms process high temperature was favorable for the generation of hocl ocl via the reaction of cl with pms and the formation of chlorinated by products via the reaction of natural organic matter with hocl ocl nevertheless it should be noted that b oh 4 the hydrolysis product of na2b4o7 could react with hocl ocl to the inert b oh 3ocl bousher et al 1987 table s11 further demonstrated that b oh 3ocl was nontoxic toward fish daphnid and green algae therefore it was speculated that the added na2b4o7 could inhibit the formation of chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water with na2b4o7 heat pms process fig 6 a revealed the formation potential of four representative chlorinated by products trichloromethane tcm monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa in heat pms process naoh heat pms process and na2b4o7 heat pms process there was no mcaa detected in three processes while the concentrations of tcm dcaa and tcaa followed the order heat pms process naoh heat pms process na2b4o7 heat pms process these results indicated that the added na2b4o7 in heat pms process significantly inhibited the formation of chlorinated by products as exhibited in fig 6 b hocl ocl concentration in three processes also followed the same order heat pms process naoh heat pms process na2b4o7 heat pms process confirming that the added na2b4o7 significantly inhibited the generation of hocl ocl therefore the low formation potential of chlorinated by products in na2b4o7 heat pms process could be ascribed to the inhibition effect of na2b4o7 on the generation of hocl ocl additionally the phenomenon that only slight tcm was detected in three processes could be interpreted that the reaction temperature 75 c was much higher than the boiling point of tcm suggesting that heat activation process was favorable to control the volatile by products in a word adding na2b4o7 into heat pms process can significantly improve the elimination of organic contaminants and inhibit the formation of chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water 4 conclusion in this study the widely used buffer agent of na2b4o7 was added into heat pms process to enhance the degradation of act the degradation of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process fitted the pseudo first order kinetics well r2 0 99 along with the corresponding kobs value in the presence of 10 mm na2b4o7 was 33 1 times higher than that in heat pms process 1o2 and ho were confirmed as the main reactive species responsible for act degradation according to the results of epr tests and quenching experiments the added na2b4o7 was hydrolyzed to b oh 4 and maintained solution ph value at near 9 0 and pms existed in forms of hso5 and so5 2 simultaneously hoob oh 3 was generated via the reactions of hso5 so5 2 with b oh 4 and played a vital role in producing 1o2 and ho 1o2 was mainly produced via the self decomposition of pms using b oh 4 as the catalyst while ho was mainly produced via the breakage of peroxide bond of hso5 and hoob oh 3 under high temperature act was degraded by 1o2 and ho via the pathways of nh bond breakage oh replacement nh2 oxidation and benzene ring cleavage and nine kinds of degradation intermediates were detected by lc q tof ms analysis ecosar 2 0 software and luminescent bacteria test demonstrated that the toxicity of reaction solution declined significantly with the degradation of act increasing na2b4o7 dosage 0 20 mm pms concentration 0 2 mm initial ph 3 0 11 0 and reaction temperature 45 85 c were conducive to accelerate the degradation of act humic acid cl and co3 2 heavily inhibited the degradation of act while so4 2 and no3 showed the negligible effects the proposed na2b4o7 heat pms process performed well for degrading act in lake water and ground water and possessed high performance in removing other organic pollutants including bpa dcf cbz ibu and cap additionally the addition of na2b4o7 into heat pms process could significantly suppress the formation of free chlorine and chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water overall na2b4o7 could improve the oxidation capacity of heat pms process and suppress the formation potential of chlorinated by products in cl containing water simultaneously and the findings might have important implications for using borate buffer in the studies of pms based advanced oxidation processes appendix a supporting information supporting information to this article can be found

15536,in this study sodium tetraborate na2b4o7 was introduced to enhance the degradation of acetaminophen act in heat activated peroxymonosulfate pms process the elimination of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process followed the pseudo first order kinetics the corresponding kobs value with 10 mm na2b4o7 was 33 1 times higher than that in heat pms process 1o2 and ho were identified as primary reactive species via quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance technology b oh 4 the hydrolysis product of na2b4o7 reacted with pms to generate hoob oh 3 1o2 was generated by the self decomposition of pms using b oh 4 as catalyst while ho was produced via the breakage of peroxide bond of pms and hoob oh 3 under high temperature act was degraded by reactive species via the pathways of nh bond breakage oh replacement nh2 oxidation and benzene ring cleavage nine transformation intermediates were detected by lc q tof ms and the toxicity of reaction solution decreased significantly with the elimination of act increasing na2b4o7 dosage pms concentration initial ph and reaction temperature were conducive to act elimination humic acid cl and co3 2 inhibited the degradation of act heavily while so4 2 and no3 had the negligible effects moreover b oh 4 could react with free chlorine to the inert b oh 3ocl and further significantly suppress the formation of chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water in na2b4o7 heat pms process this study provided an effective way to enhance the oxidation capacity of heat pms process and suppress the formation of chlorinated by products in chloride containing water and the findings had important implications for using borate buffer in the studies of pms based advanced oxidation processes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peroxymonosulfate heat activation sodium tetraborate monoperoxyborate chlorinated by products 1 introduction in recent years heat activated peroxymonosulfate pms a very attractive and controllable activation approach has been increasingly used to degrade organic contaminants milh et al 2021 ulucan altuntas et al 2022 yin et al 2022 the unselective and strongly oxidizing radicals of so4 and ho are generated by the breakage of oo bond in pms structure with the activation of heat milh et al 2021 compared to the most widely used activation approaches with transition mentals i e cu2 and co2 heat activated pms can avoid the addition of toxic metals reduce the ineffective decomposition of oxidants and improve the effective utilization of pms milh et al 2021 in addition to being an activator of pms heat can also improve the solubility of organic pollutants and the temperature of the reaction process costanza et al 2010 wang et al 2014 conducive to increasing the reaction rate to shorten the treatment time liu et al 2017 xiao et al 2022 yang et al 2010 however because of the high energy of pms oo bond 140 213 3 kj mol 1 heat pms process would consume much more energy and cost to remove contaminants compared with the widely used heat activated peroxydisulfate pds system the energy of pds oo bond was 92 kj mol 1 cai et al 2022 up to date many efforts have been made to improve the oxidation capacity of heat pms process for instance the combination of microwave radiation and porous activated carbon with heat activated pms process significantly accelerated the generation of so4 and ho and the degradation of organic contaminants liu et al 2020 qi et al 2017 nevertheless the above enhanced heat pms processes still exist some intrinsic problems such as the sudden ph drop with the addition of strongly acidic pms solution the obvious suppression of actual water matrix on contaminants elimination and the excessive generation of chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water recently our research group found that the naoh enhanced heat pms process can significantly accelerate the degradation of organic contaminants and had a well adaptability to actual water matrix cai et al 2022 however naoh heat pms process had weak ph buffer capacity cai et al 2022 and would generate amounts of free chlorine for the treatment of cl containing water ahn et al 2021 and the generated free chlorine would further react with natural organic matter to produce the hazardous chlorinated by products the ideal approaches to improve the heat pms process should accelerate the degradation of contaminants and suppress the formation of chlorinated by products at the same time sodium tetraborate na2b4o7 the basic raw material to make boron compounds is commonly employed to buffer the solution ph in pms activation processes liu et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 2017 zhu et al 2019 the added na2b4o7 will be initially hydrolyzed to produce boric acid h3bo3 a lewis acid and h3bo3 can combine with oh to form its lewis base of b oh 4 chen et al 2021 the generated acid base pairs of h3bo3 b oh 4 pka 9 2 can act as the buffer to alleviate the sudden drop of ph caused by the addition of pms previous study reported that b oh 4 can also catalyze the self decomposition of pms to produce singlet oxygen 1o2 and accelerate the degradation of contaminants under room temperature chen et al 2021 monoperoxyborate hoob oh 3 an asymmetric peroxide containing oo bond will be generated from the reaction between b oh 4 and hso5 chen et al 2021 similar to pms the oo bond of hoob oh 3 may also be broken to produce free radicals under high temperature it was rational to speculate that the addition of na2b4o7 into heat pms process will help to generate the reactive oxygen species including the selective 1o2 and unselective radicals of ho and so4 resulting in the enhancement on contaminants degradation furthermore previous study reported that b oh 4 can react with free chlorine to produce b oh 3ocl bousher et al 1987 b oh 3ocl is a combined chlorine having weaker potential than free chlorine to produce the chlorinated by products hence the addition of na2b4o7 into heat pms process might suppress the formation of chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water nevertheless na2b4o7 enhanced heat pms process has still not yet been scientifically investigated acetaminophen act a typical pharmaceutical contaminant and frequently detected in aquatic environments was selected as the main targeted probe in this study to investigate the efficiency and mechanism of na2b4o7 enhanced heat pms process the study mainly focused on i the enhancing effect of na2b4o7 on act and other contaminants degradation ii the identification and possible generation mechanism of primary reactive oxygen species in na2b4o7 heat pms process iii the transformation pathway of act and the evolution of toxicity iv the effects of reaction parameters na2b4o7 dosage pms concentration initial ph and reaction temperature on act elimination v the effect of actual water matrix on act degradation and vi the formation of chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials trichloromethane tcm haloacetic acids haas i e monochloroacetic acid mcaa

and acetaminophen act were purchased from aladdin bio chem technology industrial corporation shanghai china disodium tetraborate decahydrate na2b4o7 10h2o was obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china other used materials were listed in text s1 lake water and ground water were adopted from the city of xiamen and their major indexes were shown in table s1 2 2 experimental procedures experiments for act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process were performed in magnetic stirring thermostatic bath desired dosages of 10 mm act stock solution and ultrapure water were added into flask subsequently the reaction solution was preheated to 75 c the initial reaction solution ph was adjusted to 9 0 as quickly as possible with 0 5 m naoh and then desired na2b4o7 and pms dosages were added at the same time into the solution to initiate the reaction at 0 0 5 1 2 3 5 7 10 15 min samples 900 μl were withdrawn and quenched immediately with the pre added 100 μl of 100 mm na2s2o3

quality indexes of actual water samples toxicity detection toc detection degradation intermediates identification detection were described in texts s4 and s8 and tables s3 and s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced degradation of act and other contaminants in na2b4o7 heat pms process as shown in fig 1 a the degradation efficiency of act in heat na2b4o7 process heat pms process na2b4o7 pms process and na2b4o7 heat pms process respectively as can be seen the act removal efficiency in heat na2b4o7 process heat pms process and na2b4o7 pms process were about 2 12 and 15 respectively comparatively act could be completely degraded by heat pms process with the addition of 10 mm na2b4o7 within 15 min the removal of act followed pseudo first order kinetics well r2 0 99 and the corresponding kobs values increased from 0 009 min 1 to 0 298 min 1 with the addition of na2b4o7 in heat pms process several studies have reported that ionic strength significantly affected the degradation of contaminants in pms activation processes ali et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 it was observed in fig s1 that the added 10 mm na2so4 and 30 mm nano3 having the same ionic strength with 10 mm na2b4o7 text s5 did not affect the degradation of act in heat pms process excluding the contribution of ionic strength on act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process fig s2 shows that the decomposition of pms was also accelerated with the addition of na2b4o7 in heat pms process suggesting that na2b4o7 might accelerate the heat activated pms process to generate more reactive oxygen species to further evaluate the applicability of na2b4o7 heat pms process experiments for degrading different organic contaminants including diclofenac dcf carbamazepine cbz ibuprofen ibu chloramphenicol cap bisphenol a bpa and act were conducted as displayed in figs 1 b and s3 the addition of na2b4o7 into heat pms process accelerated the elimination of all organic contaminants the corresponding kobs values for act bpa dcf cbz ibu and cap were calculated about 33 1 57 1 1 2 2 9 1 2 and 1 7 times higher than that in heat pms process respectively these phenomena further indicated that the addition of na2b4o7 into heat pms process should accelerate the generation of reactive oxygen species with strong oxidation capacity such as ho and so4 compared with the organic contaminants of dcf cbz ibu and cap bpa and act had higher kobs values in na2b4o7 heat pms process these phenomena indicated that amounts of selective reactive oxygen species for instance singlet oxygen 1o2 should be also generated in na2b4o7 heat pms process in other words na2b4o7 heat pms process might generate different kinds of reactive oxygen species such as ho so4 and 1o2 having the wide applicability for degrading organic contaminants 3 2 identification of primary reactive oxygen species and their generation mechanism 3 2 1 identification of primary reactive oxygen species amounts of literatures reported that pms self decomposition under alkaline ph conditions will produce 1o2 lou et al 2017 peng et al 2021 nie et al 2019 while the breakage of oo bond of hso5 under high temperature will generate ho and so4 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2022 hence different kinds of reactive oxygen species including 1o2 ho and so4 would be generated and involved in act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process tert butanol tba was selected as the scavenger of ho selectively because tba possesses much higher reaction rate constant with ho than so4 k tba ho 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and k tba so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 and does barely react with 1o2 considering that methanol and ethanol were prone to volatilize at 75 c cai et al 2022 the non volatile benzoic acid ba was selected as the scavenger of so4 and ho k ba ho 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 and k ba so4 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 furfuryl alcohol ffa was selected as the scavenger of 1o2 and the radicals due to the high reaction rate constants with 1o2 and the radicals k ffa 1o2 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 ahn et al 2021 k ffa ho 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 zhu et al 2019 and k ffa so4 1 1 109 m 1 s 1 text s7 and fig s4 according to the calculated ck values in text s6 and tables s5 and s6 10 mm tba was adopted for quenching ho 1 mm ba was applied for quenching ho and so4 and 2 5 mm ffa was adopted for quenching 1o2 and the radicals it is important to note that the extra consumption of pms via the direct reaction between ffa and pms was relatively low as shown in fig s2 and text s6 as shown in fig 2 a there was a significant inhibition on act elimination in presence of 10 mm tba with the corresponding kobs value of act elimination decreased from 0 298 min 1 to 0 180 min 1 fig 2 b the phenomenon revealed that ho made considerable contribution on act removal in na2b4o7 heat pms process the inhibitory effect of ba on act degradation was nearly same with tba fig 2 a and b suggesting that so4 made a negligible contribution on act degradation the added 2 5 mm ffa significantly inhibited the degradation of act fig 2 a with the corresponding kobs value of the degradation of act decreased from 0 298 min 1 to 0 025 min 1 fig 2 b the results indicated that 1o2 made a considerable contribution on act elimination in na2b4o7 heat pms process according to the obtained kobs values in fig 2 b the contribution percentages of ho so4 and 1o2 on act removal were respectively calculated as 33 2 and 57 as shown in fig s5 the results of quenching experiments clearly demonstrated that 1o2 and ho were the major reactive oxygen species responsible for act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process to further determine the reactive oxygen species electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments were carried out 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinone temp can selectively capture 1o2 to form tempo liang and fu 2021 han et al 2011 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrole n oxide dmpo can separately capture ho and so4 to produce dmpooh and dmpo so4 han et al 2011 yu et al 2020 the signal of tempo triplet peak with 1 1 1 intensity ratio was detected in na2b4o7 heat pms process fig 2 c demonstrating that 1o2 was generated the intensity of tempo signal in na2b4o7 heat pms process was much stronger than that in heat pms process indicating that the added na2b4o7 significantly accelerated the generation of 1o2 previous study reported that the degradation of contaminants could be accelerated in d2o because the lifetime of 1o2 in d2o was 18 times longer than that in h2o li et al 2022 as shown in fig s6 act degradation was accelerated in d2o solution 50 d2o and 50 h2o further confirming the production of 1o2 in na2b4o7 heat pms process as shown in fig 2 d the epr signals of dmpooh quadruplet peak with 1 2 2 1 intensity ratio and dmpo so4 sextuplet peak with 1 1 1 1 1 1 intensity ratio were also detected in na2b4o7 heat pms process demonstrating that ho and so4 were also generated of note the epr signal of dmpo so4 was rather weak which could be interpreted to the rapid transformation from dmpo so4 adduct to dmpooh adduct in water via nucleophilic substitution oh et al 2016 rao et al 2019 however fig s6 demonstrated that so4 made a negligible contribution on the elimination of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process fig s7 revealed that the reaction ph maintained near 9 0 during the act removal with na2b4o7 heat pms process therefore the negligible contribution of so4 on act elimination could be mainly due to the rapid transformation of so4 to ho via eqs 1 and 2 under alkaline ph conditions ma et al 2017 additionally fig s8 revealed that the addition of na2b4o7 in heat pms process significantly accelerated the degradation of nitrobenzene the indicator of ho and does barely react with 1o2 and so4 suggesting that the generation of ho was accelerated with the addition of na2b4o7 nevertheless the intensity of dmpooh signal in na2b4o7 heat pms process was much weaker than that obtained in heat pms process previous literatures reported that 1o2 will react with dmpo and interfere the trapping and determination of radicals bilski et al 1996 shoji et al 2007 therefore the weaker intensity of dmpooh signal in na2b4o7 heat pms process might be mainly attributed to the interference of the coexistent 1o2 on the trapping of ho 1 so 4 o h so 4 2 h o 2 so 4 h 2 o so 4 2 h o h in addition several literatures reported that so5 2 will be transformed to ho2 under alkaline condition via eq 3 and ho2 could further react with so5 2 to form superoxide anion radical o2 via eq 4 jiang et al 2017 qi et al 2016 it was rational to infer that o2 might be generated and involved in the degradation of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process however fig 2 a revealed that superoxide dismutase sod had negligible effect on act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process excluding the involvement of o2 on act removal nitro blue tetrazolium nbt could be selectively reduced by o2 to generate methyl hydrazone with the characteristic absorption wavelength of 560 nm fig s9 revealed that there was no methyl hydrazone generated when 0 6 mm of nbt was added in na2b4o7 heat pms process suggesting the absence of o2 these results firmly demonstrated that o2 was not generated and involved in act degradation with na2b4o7 heat pms process 3 so 5 2 h 2 o o h ho 2 so 4 2 h 4 so 5 2 ho 2 so 4 2 h o 2 3 2 2 generation mechanism of reactive oxygen species according to the above results and discussion the main reactive oxygen species to degrade act were 1o2 and ho in na2b4o7 heat pms process scheme 1 proposed the possible generation mechanism of 1o2 and ho in na2b4o7 heat pms process there might be two different production pathways to generate 1o2 in na2b4o7 heat pms process the first pathway to generate 1o2 was the self decomposition of pms under alkaline ph conditions lou et al 2017 peng et al 2021 specifically partial hso5 was ionized to its deprotonated form of so5 2 at ph 9 0 eq 5 and fig s10 and then 1o2 was generated from the reaction of hso5 with so5 2 eq 6 of note the added na2b4o7 was initially hydrolyzed to produce h3bo3 and oh eq 7 and partial h3bo3 was then hydrolyzed to form its lewis base of b oh 4 eq 8 and fig s11 therefore the added na2b4o7 had strong buffering capacity and could maintain the reaction solution ph at around 9 0 fig s7 which was well beneficial to pms self decomposition with the pka of 9 4 the second pathway to generate 1o2 was the self decomposition of pms with b oh 4 as the catalyst chen et al 2021 to be more specific b oh 4 the hydrolysis product of na2b4o7 firstly reacted with hso5 so5 2 to generate hoob oh 3 eqs 9 and 10 and the generated hoob oh 3 further reacted with hso5 so5 2 to generate 1o2 and b oh 4 eqs 11 and 12 fig s12 showed the change of hoob oh 3 concentration in na2b4o7 heat pms process and hoob oh 3 concentration reached about 0 33 mm within 15 min likewise there might be three different production pathways to generate ho in na2b4o7 heat pms process the first pathway to generate ho was the direct breakage of oo bond of hso5 under high temperature via eq 14 of note the breakage of oo bond of hso5 under high temperature also generated so4 eq 14 and the reaction solution ph was kept under alkaline condition during the elimination of act fig s7 therefore the second pathway to generate ho was the reaction of the generated so4 with oh eq 1 the transformation of so4 to ho was also the main reason for the negligible contribution of so4 on act elimination fig s5 similar to pms and peracetic acid lin et al 2021 hoob oh 3 the product of the reactions between hso5 so5 2 and b oh 4 eqs 9 and 10 was also an asymmetric peroxide previous researches had reported that the asymmetric oo bond of peracetic acid and pms were prone to break to generate radicals under high temperature antoniou et al 2010 wang et al 2020 so the third one to generate ho was the breakage of oo bond of hoob oh 3 under high temperature eq 15 5 hso 5 h so 5 2 p k a 9 4 6 hso 5 so 5 2 2 so 4 2 h 1 o 2 7 b 4 o 7 2 7 h 2 o 4 h 3 b o 3 2 o h 8 h 3 b o 3 h 2 o b oh 4 h p k a 9 2 9 b oh 4 hso 5 hoob oh 3 so 4 2 h 10 b oh 4 so 5

transformation pathway of act and toxicity assessment to study the possible transformation pathways of act the lc q tof ms was used to identify the degradation intermediates of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process as displayed in table s7 nine kinds of intermediates were detected during the degradation of act including acetaminophen dimer tp1 4 aminophenol tp2 4 aminocatechol tp3 4 hydroperoxyamino phenol tp4 p nitrophenol tp5 maleic acid tp6 lactic acid tp7 glycolic acid tp8 and formic acid tp9 three possible transformation pathways of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process were then proposed and presented in scheme 2 in pathway i act was firstly attacked by oh to produce phenoxy radical cation act oh and its deprotonated form of phenoxy act o and then acetaminophen dimer tp1 was produced through covalent bonds between carbons at the hydroxyl ortho position of act o liang et al 2016 in pathway ii 1o2 and oh attacked the nh bond on act molecular structure to form 4 aminophenol tp2 ghanbari et al 2021 and an h atom on tp2 was replaced by oh to produce 4 aminocatechol tp3 in pathway ⅲ 1o2 and oh attacked the amino group on the benzene ring of tp2 to produce 4 hydroperoxyamino phenol tp4 and p nitrophenol tp5 fanaei et al 2019 moctezuma et al 2012 tp4 and tp5 were further oxidated to maleic acid tp6 via a series of procedures including the replacement of n contained group by oh the decomposition and hydroxylation of benzene ring and the elimination of h2o zhang et al 2015 subsequently lactic acid tp7 was generated by the cleavage of cc bond on tp6 molecular structure and glycolic acid tp8 and formic acid tp9 were generated by the further cleavage of cc bond of tp7 phong vo et al 2019 in fact although act was completely degraded within 15 min fig 1 the toc removal efficiency was less than 10 within 15 min in na2b4o7 heat pms process fig s13 these results revealed that most of act was transformed to the aforementioned intermediates and products only a small part was mineralized to co2 and h2o previous studies reported that several act degradation intermediates and products had even more toxicity to organisms than act itself resulting in the increase of biotoxicity after the degradation of act le et al 2017 thus the software of ecosar 2 0 u s environmental protection agency was employed to assess the acute and chronic toxicity of act and the aforementioned nine kinds of transformation intermediates toward fish daphnid and green algae as displayed in fig 3 and table s8 besides tp2 and tp4 the other seven transformation products of act possessed lower toxic toward fish daphnid and green algae than act itself especially tp7 tp8 and tp9 produced via pathway iii were even not harmful toward fish daphnid and green algae it was rational to infer that the toxicity of reaction solution should decrease along with the degradation of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process furthermore luminescent bacteria test using biofix lumi bacterium as the indicator was applied to evaluate the toxicity change during the elimination of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process fig s14 exhibited the inhibition rate of biofix lumi luminescent bacteria decreased significantly from about 67 2 to 46 1 after the complete degradation of act within 15 min the phenomenon indicated that the toxicity of reaction solution decreased along with the elimination of act which was consistent with the aforementioned conclusion that most of act transformation products possessed lower toxicity toward fish daphnid and green algae than act itself 3 4 effect of reaction parameters 3 4 1 effect of na2b4o7 dosage fig 4 a depicted the effect of na2b4o7 dosage on act elimination in na2b4o7 heat pms process as exhibited in fig 4 a an increase in na2b4o7 dosage below 20 mm resulted in a remarkable elevation of act degradation for instance the k obs value of act degradation with 20 mm na2b4o7 was 49 0 times higher than that obtained without na2b4o7 fig s15 a according to the aforementioned analysis and discussion in section 3 2 2 there were two major reasons for the elevation of act elimination with increasing na2b4o7 dosage firstly the increase of na2b4o7 dosage would increase the concentrations of the acid base pairs of h3bo3 b oh 4 which was helpful to maintain reaction solution under alkaline conditions as shown in table s9 when the initial reaction solution ph was set at 9 00 the final reaction solution ph at 15 min was increased from 2 60 to 9 06 with increasing na2b4o7 dosage from 0 mm to 20 mm the elevation of reaction solution ph below 9 4 the pka value of pms was conducive to producing 1o2 via the pathway of pms self decomposition lou et al 2017 peng et al 2021 and to generating ho via the breakage of oo bond of pms under high temperature secondly the increase of na2b4o7 dosage would increase the concentration of hoob oh 3 leading to more 1o2 generation via the reaction of hso5 so5 2 with hoob oh 3 betterton and hoffmann 1990 chen et al 2021 and more ho generation via the breakage of oo bond of hoob oh 3 under high temperature in summary the increase of na2b4o7 dosage was favorable for the generation of 1o2 and ho and the degradation of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process 3 4 2 effect of pms concentration amounts of studies involved in pms activation processes reported that increasing pms concentration could accelerate the generation of reactive oxygen species and the elimination of organic contaminants peng et al 2021 lou et al 2017 as exhibited in fig 4 b the act elimination was drastically accelerated with increasing the pms concentration over the range of 0 2 mm for instance the corresponding kobs values of act removal were improved from 0 001 min 1 to 0 298 min 1 and 0 423 min 1 when the concentration of pms increased from 0 mm to 1 5 mm and 2 0 mm respectively fig s15 b these phenomena suggested that increasing pms concentration had a favorable effect on act degradation of in na2b4o7 heat pms process according to the aforementioned analysis in section 3 2 2 increasing pms concentration could accelerate the self decomposition of pms and its reaction with hoob oh 3 to produce 1o2 and the breakage of oo bond of pms and hoob oh 3 to generate ho under high temperature hence increasing pms concentration was favorable to improve the reactive oxygen species production and act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process 3 4 3 effect of initial ph as for most of pms activation processes initial ph had a heavy impact on the elimination of organic contaminants liu et al 2020 qi et al 2017 nevertheless as displayed in fig 4 c there was no significant effect on act removal when initial ph varied in the range from 3 0 to 11 0 to be more specific the corresponding kobs value of act removal had a slight increase from 0 265 min 1 to 0 318 min 1 as initial ph was improved from 3 0 to 11 0 fig s15 c of note the added na2b4o7 would be hydrolyzed to the acid base pairs of h3bo3 b oh 4 having strong buffering capacity fig s16 demonstrated that reaction solution ph slightly rose with the increase of initial ph but was kept around 9 0 regardless of the change of initial ph over the range of 3 0 11 0 these results suggested that the insignificant effect of initial ph on the elimination of act could be attributed to the strong buffering capacity of h3bo3 b oh 4 in other words na2b4o7 heat pms process possessed the advantage of well ph adaptability 3 4 4 effect of reaction temperature reaction temperature was a crucial factor for affecting the elimination of organic contaminants with heat activated pms processes cai et al 2022 yin et al 2022 the effect of reaction temperature on act elimination was then investigated in na2b4o7 heat pms process fig 4 d revealed that the degradation of act was dramatically accelerated with increasing reaction temperature from 45 c to 85 c accordingly the kobs values continuously increased from 0 068 min 1 to 0 298 min 1 and 0 467 min 1 when reaction temperature was elevated from 45 c to 75 c and 85 c respectively fig s15 d these results demonstrated that raising reaction temperature was also beneficial to the removal of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process according to the aforementioned mechanism in section 3 2 2 and arrhenius formula the increase of reaction temperature could accelerate the self decomposition of pms and its reaction with hoob oh 3 to produce 1o2 and the breakage of oo bond of pms and hoob oh 3 to generate ho as shown in fig s17 the natural logarithm of kobs values for act elimination had a good linear correlation with reaction temperature the phenomenon demonstrated that the degradation of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process indeed obeyed arrhenius formula according to eq 16 the apparent activation energy ea of act elimination in na2b4o7 heat pms process was determined to be 46 30 kj mol 1 the ea value was much closer to that of the self decomposition of pms to produce 1o2 34 53 kj mol 1 qi et al 2016 and far lower than that of the breakage of pms oo bond to produce ho 105 60 kj mol 1 yin et al 2022 these results were consistent with the aforementioned result that the contribution of 1o2 on act removal was much higher than that of ho fig s5 16 ln k o b s lna e a rt 3 5 effect of actual water matrix natural organic matter and many anions are often contained in actual water bodies and have noticeable influence on the performance of heat activated pms processes cai et al 2022 yin et al 2022 the typical natural organic matter of humic acid and several common anions including cl so4 2 no3 and co3 2 were applied to assess the effect of natural water constituents on act removal in na2b4o7 heat pms process as exhibited in fig 5 a humic acid cl and co3 2 inhibited the degradation of act heavily while so4 2 and no3 had the negligible effects on act degradation in na2b4o7 heat pms process the corresponding kobs values decreased from 0 298 min 1 to 0 118 min 1 0 185 min 1 and 0 151 min 1 with the addition of 5 mg c l 1 humic acid 5 mm cl and 5 mm co3 2 respectively fig s18 the inhibition effect of humic acid on act elimination could be interpreted to the scavenging of reactive oxygen species in na2b4o7 heat pms process i e 1o2 ho and so4 cai et al 2022 considering that reaction ph was not influenced with the addition of co3 2 data not shown the inhibition of co3 2 on act removal could be mainly interpreted to the transformation from the strong radicals of ho and so4 to the secondary radical of co3 having lower reactivity towards organic contaminants sun et al 2020 the phenomenon that 5 mm cl had significant inhibition effect on act removal was very strange which was against with most of previous literatures cai et al 2022 peng et al 2021 it has been widely accepted that the presence of cl could promote the elimination of contaminants with pms activation processes because the reactive free chlorine could be generated by the reaction between cl and pms via eq 19 ahn et al 2021 the influence of cl concentration on act removal in heat pms process naoh heat pms process and na2b4o7 heat pms process were then comparatively investigated as shown in figs 5 b 5 c and s19 the act degradation in heat pms process and naoh heat pms process was progressively accelerated with increasing cl concentration below 30 mm nevertheless the elimination of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process was inhibited when increasing the cl concentration over the range of 0 10 mm but then was improved with further increasing cl concentration from 10 mm to 30 mm the corresponding k obs values declined from 0 298 min 1 to 0 147 min 1 with the cl concentration increasing over the range of 0 10 mm and then increased from 0 147 min 1 to 1 055 min 1 with the cl concentration further increasing from 10 mm to 30 mm in other words an obvious improvement on act removal was observed only when cl concentration was more than 25 mm in na2b4o7 heat pms process previous study reported that free chlorine could react with b oh 4 via eq 20 to produce the combined chlorine of b oh 3ocl having lower reactivity toward contaminants bousher et al 1987 hence the inhibition effect of low cl concentration on act elimination could be mainly ascribed to the transformation of free chlorine to the inert b oh 3ocl 17 co 3 2 h o o h co 3 18 co 3 2 so 4 so 4 2 co 3 19 hso 5 c l so 4 2 hclo 20 b oh 4 hclo cl o b oh 3 oc l h 2 o o h furthermore the influence of two different actual water backgrounds i e lake water and ground water on act elimination with na2b4o7 heat pms process were evaluated and displayed in fig 5 d similar with ultrapure water the degradation efficiency of act in lake water and ground water also reached 100 within 15 min the corresponding kobs values were 0 372 min 1 in lake water and 0 317 min 1 in ground water respectively fig s20 even higher than that in ultrapure water 0 298 min 1 there results indicated that actual water matrix had favorable effect on act removal combined with the effect of humic acid and common anions on act removal fig 5 and the water quality indexes of lake water and ground water table s1 the enhancement of actual water on act removal could be interpreted by the better buffer capacity of actual water compared with ultrapure water overall na2b4o7 heat pms process possessed well adaptability toward actual water matrix and had good application potential for degrading organic contaminants in water 3 6 formation of chlorinated by products owing to the formation of free chlorine hocl ocl via the reaction of cl with pms and the ubiquitous existence of natural organic matter in actual water there was great potential for the formation of chlorinated by products when pms activation processes were applied to treat cl containing water ahn et al 2021 cai et al 2022 especially for heat activated pms process high temperature was favorable for the generation of hocl ocl via the reaction of cl with pms and the formation of chlorinated by products via the reaction of natural organic matter with hocl ocl nevertheless it should be noted that b oh 4 the hydrolysis product of na2b4o7 could react with hocl ocl to the inert b oh 3ocl bousher et al 1987 table s11 further demonstrated that b oh 3ocl was nontoxic toward fish daphnid and green algae therefore it was speculated that the added na2b4o7 could inhibit the formation of chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water with na2b4o7 heat pms process fig 6 a revealed the formation potential of four representative chlorinated by products trichloromethane tcm monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa in heat pms process naoh heat pms process and na2b4o7 heat pms process there was no mcaa detected in three processes while the concentrations of tcm dcaa and tcaa followed the order heat pms process naoh heat pms process na2b4o7 heat pms process these results indicated that the added na2b4o7 in heat pms process significantly inhibited the formation of chlorinated by products as exhibited in fig 6 b hocl ocl concentration in three processes also followed the same order heat pms process naoh heat pms process na2b4o7 heat pms process confirming that the added na2b4o7 significantly inhibited the generation of hocl ocl therefore the low formation potential of chlorinated by products in na2b4o7 heat pms process could be ascribed to the inhibition effect of na2b4o7 on the generation of hocl ocl additionally the phenomenon that only slight tcm was detected in three processes could be interpreted that the reaction temperature 75 c was much higher than the boiling point of tcm suggesting that heat activation process was favorable to control the volatile by products in a word adding na2b4o7 into heat pms process can significantly improve the elimination of organic contaminants and inhibit the formation of chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water 4 conclusion in this study the widely used buffer agent of na2b4o7 was added into heat pms process to enhance the degradation of act the degradation of act in na2b4o7 heat pms process fitted the pseudo first order kinetics well r2 0 99 along with the corresponding kobs value in the presence of 10 mm na2b4o7 was 33 1 times higher than that in heat pms process 1o2 and ho were confirmed as the main reactive species responsible for act degradation according to the results of epr tests and quenching experiments the added na2b4o7 was hydrolyzed to b oh 4 and maintained solution ph value at near 9 0 and pms existed in forms of hso5 and so5 2 simultaneously hoob oh 3 was generated via the reactions of hso5 so5 2 with b oh 4 and played a vital role in producing 1o2 and ho 1o2 was mainly produced via the self decomposition of pms using b oh 4 as the catalyst while ho was mainly produced via the breakage of peroxide bond of hso5 and hoob oh 3 under high temperature act was degraded by 1o2 and ho via the pathways of nh bond breakage oh replacement nh2 oxidation and benzene ring cleavage and nine kinds of degradation intermediates were detected by lc q tof ms analysis ecosar 2 0 software and luminescent bacteria test demonstrated that the toxicity of reaction solution declined significantly with the degradation of act increasing na2b4o7 dosage 0 20 mm pms concentration 0 2 mm initial ph 3 0 11 0 and reaction temperature 45 85 c were conducive to accelerate the degradation of act humic acid cl and co3 2 heavily inhibited the degradation of act while so4 2 and no3 showed the negligible effects the proposed na2b4o7 heat pms process performed well for degrading act in lake water and ground water and possessed high performance in removing other organic pollutants including bpa dcf cbz ibu and cap additionally the addition of na2b4o7 into heat pms process could significantly suppress the formation of free chlorine and chlorinated by products for the treatment of cl containing water overall na2b4o7 could improve the oxidation capacity of heat pms process and suppress the formation potential of chlorinated by products in cl containing water simultaneously and the findings might have important implications for using borate buffer in the studies of pms based advanced oxidation processes appendix a supporting information supporting information to this article can be found

15537,effective water purification technologies are required to remove emerging contaminants ecs and prevent their extensive occurrence in rural areas in this work coupling gravity driven membrane gdm filtration with biogenic manganese oxides biomnox in the biofouling layer was utilized for treating water containing smx comparisons between biomnox gdm with biomnox and control gdm without biomnox indicated that biomnox could significantly promote the removal of doc nh4 n and fluorescent pollutants due to its strong oxidating capacity and high biological activity the formation of biomnox increased the abundance of smx degrading bacteria enriched the metabolic pathway and mineralization rate of smx and effectively promoted the remove of smx more importantly biomnox facilitated the removal of antibiotic resistance genes args in the gdm because it increased the link between microorganisms and reduced the concentration of smx thus reduced the expression of args lb eps played an important role in the membrane fouling compared with the control gdm the concentration of lb eps in biomnox gdm decreased which was beneficial to alleviate membrane fouling although a thicker biofouling layer 1774 88 μm vs 775 54 μm was formed in biomnox gdm the biofilm with higher porosity 64 93 vs 41 24 had a more positive effect on the flux overall biomnox could improve the pollutant removal and stable flux level of the gdm system biomnox gdm effectively avoided the risks brought by ecs and ensured water safety in rural areas graphical abstact image graphical abstract keywords biogenic manganes oxides biomnox gravity driven membrane gdm emerging contaminants ecs antibiotic resistance genes args biofouling layer data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction gravity driven membrane gdm filtration has been successfully utilized in rural areas to remove pathogens and microorganisms however in recent years the appearance of emerging contaminants ecs in surface water has gained increasing concern antibiotics which are used extensively to treat and prevent bacterial infections in humans and animals all over the world pose a great threat to human beings and the aquatic environment even at trace levels gu et al 2018 antibiotics entering the environment will lead to the enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes args which will bring new challenges to their removal he et al 2020 the development of multidrug resistant mdr pathogens aggregated by args is a challenge to life saving antibiotic therapies arias and murray 2009 once mdr bacteria are derived they show strong resistance to various antibiotics therefore many antibiotics become ineffective for infected patients posing a serious threat to people s health sulfamethoxazole smx as a common antibiotic is the most detected ecs in 139 rivers in the united states liang et al 2021 the frequently detected smx from various surface water bodies is related to the emission of wastewater from cultivation husbandry and municipal sources shang et al 2022 due to the seriousness of the crisis traditional gdm filtration of surface water in rural areas is challenged by various ecs this technology is necessary to increase the efficiency of pollutant removal and reduce the risk of ecs and args in recent years biogenic manganese oxides biomnox have shown great potential in removing ecs antibacterial and related compounds containing phenolic and fluoroquinolone groups aromatic n oxides tetracycline and estrogen compounds could be effectively removed from the system containing biomnox forrez et al 2011 there are two main reasons for the advantages of biomnox in removing ecs on the one hand compared with chemically produced manganese oxide mnox biologically produced mnox has high specific surface area and catalytic oxidation reactivity cai et al 2020 on the other hand the re oxidation ability of manganese oxidizing bacteria to the produced mn ii can improve the reaction activity of biomnox li et al 2021 research indicated that biomnox was 10 times more efficient at removing diclofenac than chemically produced mno2 forrez et al 2010 100 mg l phenol and 10 mg l 4 chlorophenol could be degraded within 24 h when biomnox exists in the bioreactor wang et al 2019a previous studies have shown that up to 97 43 of smx can be removed by achromobacter sp strain jl9 and in situ generated biomnox liang et al 2021 laboratory scale biofilters filled with natural biomnox and inoculated with manganese oxidizing bacteria mob strains were also studied to treat synthetic and real secondary effluent resulting in excellent removal of smx zhang et al 2015 these results show that biomnox can significantly improve the removal of ecs and it can be considered for membrane filtration systems during the long term filtration of mn ii containing water bacteria could oxidize mn ii to mn iii or mn iv oxides through the distinctive manganese oxidase on its cell surfaces therefore a certain amount of biomnox was produced on the membrane surface it was found that mn ii with a concentration of 1 71 2 28 mg l was effectively removed during the gdm filtration process and biomnox was produced simultaneously tang et al 2021c the generated biomnox does not affect the flux stability of the gdm system but it shows a positive influence on the stable flux due to the porosity and heterogeneity of biomnox in addition pre adding biomnox into gdm system could effectively increase the removal of mn ii in raw water and shorten the maturing time of biomnox tang et al 2021a it can be seen that a large amount of biomnox will produce in gdm system when filtration mn ii containing water however previous reports focused on the removal of mn ii from raw water but ignored the superiority of biomnox in ecs removal to the best of our knowledge there is no report about ecs removal by in situ generated biomnox in gdm moreover few studies have comprehensively investigated the degradation pathways and mechanism of ecs in gdm system explicit information about the contribution of in situ generated biomnox to the removal of pollutants especially for ecs and args needs to be explored in this study biomnox gdm and control gdm were investigated for treating water contaminated by ecs more specifically feed water containing smx was treated in lab scale gdm reactors the purpose of this study is as follows 1 characterize biomnox 2 examine the effect of in situ generated biomnox on pollutant removal especially for smx and produced args 3 characterize the structure and composition of the biofouling layer to better explain the influence of biomnox on system performance 4 analyze the microbial communities to illustrate the effect of biomnox on smx and args removal 5 propose the degradation pathways of smx in the two gdm systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water in this study smx was used as the target pollutant to evaluate the performance of gdm systems in removing ecs diluted domestic sewage was prepared at a dilution ratio of 20 and smx stock solution was added into the feed water to prepare a 500 μg l working solution in order to obtain in situ generated biomnox mncl2 4h2o was added into the feed water the characteristics of the feed water can be found in table 1 2 2 experimental setups as shown in fig 1 two water tanks were placed separately and the feed was pumped into the constant level storage tank with a float valve which was 60 cm higher than the gdm cell corresponding to a constant pressure of 60 mbar the reactor filtration with the mn ii containing water was recorded as biomnox gdm while the other one was the control gdm each filtration system had three membrane cells operated in parallel and the permeate was collected into clean plastic bottles for subsequent analysis a commercial polyethersulfone membrane pes 150 kda was used in this experiment and the effective filtration area was 0 00768 m2 in each cell before filtration the virgin membranes were soaked in ultrapure water for 24 h to remove impurities in this study the gdm filtration systems were operated continuously for 50 days without any interference 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality analytical measurements the doc and nh4 n concentrations in the feed and permeate were measured using a toc

of 4 00 2 50 mm were randomly selected from the membrane surface imagej and matlab were used to analyze oct images in line with the detailed operational processes mentioned in previous research derlon et al 2012 in addition confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leicasp5 wetzlar germany was used to study the biofouling layer on the membrane surface by staining proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acid dyeing operations are displayed in the supplementary materials 2 3 3 compositions of biofouling layer after long term filtration the biofouling layers were carefully removed from the membrane surface the collected layer sample was diluted to 30 ml with 0 9 sodium chloride solution after 10 min of vortex movement the mixture was ultrasonicated in ice water for 1 min the harvested solution was stored at 4 c for subsequent analysis the extraction of eps components could refer to previous literature wang et al 2019b in brief the samples were centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min and the sediments were extracted by vortexed treatment for 5 min followed by ultrasonic treatment in the ice bath for 1 min then loosely bound eps lb eps was collected by centrifugation at 5000 g for 15 min subsequently the deposited mixture was re suspended with 0 9 normal saline and heated at 80 c for 60 min the tightly bound eps tb eps fractions were collected by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 30 min

community in the biofouling layer were analyzed by amplification and sequencing of the 18s ribosomal rna using the primers euk 528f 5 gcggtaattccagctccaa 3 and euk 706r 5 aatccragaatttcacctct 3 then according to the standard protocol the paired end sequencing 2 250 of the amplicon library was carried out on an illumina miseq platform shanghai biozeron co ltd the sequencing results were analyzed by an operational taxonomic unit otu based approach using qiime software v1 9 0 and the rdp classifier version 2 2 2 3 5 quantification of args in order to quantify the effect of biomnox on the concentration of args at the end of the filtration the biofouling layers from biomnox gdm and control gdm were collected in triplicate the bacterial genomic dna was extracted by using the e z n a stool dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s the pcr primer used in this study includes two sulfonamides resistance genes sul1 sul2 and ⅰ integrase gene int1 and the corresponding sequences are shown

5 μl the pcr reaction parameters are as follows pre denaturation at 94 c for 5 min 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 c for 10 s annealing at 60 c for 12 s and extension at 72 c for 15 s the volume of args were determined according to the standard curves more information about qpcr is shown in the supplementary materials table s3 2 4 characterization of biomnox the characteristics of biomnox formed during gdm filtration were investigated in this study raman spectra jy hr800 were used to determine the composition of biomnox x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250 thermo corporation usa was used to determine the valence states of mn the measurements were carried out using a conventional al kα anode radiation source al ka hn 1486 7 ev and the xps raw data was calibrated by the c1s binding energy at 284 8 ev before the above test the samples were vacuum dried 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of biomnox raman spectroscopy can distinguish different types of biomnox because the different stretching modes of mn o lattice and the deformation modes of mn o mn metal oxygen chain in mno2 octahedral lattice can cause differences in raman shift zhou and fu 2020 raman spectra of the biofouling layer from biomnox gdm and control gdm can be found in fig s1a significant differences were observed between the two samples the raman spectra of biofouling layer in biomnox gdm showed a peak at around 635 cm 1 577 cm 1 515 cm 1 and 475 cm 1 respectively the positions of the peaks found in this study were consistent with the birnessite type structure bernardini et al 2019 liu et al 2018 and the sharpness of the band at 420 cm 1 indicates the crystalline order of the birnessite compound julien et al 2004 no peak related to biomnox was observed in the biofouling layer sample of control gdm in addition xps can reflect the chemical states of manganese in biomnox as shown in fig s1b the region and curve fitted xps spectra of mn 2p contained two peaks at 654 2 ev 2p1 2 and 642 8 ev 2p3 2 respectively the mn 2p1 2 spectra were fitted with two peaks at 655 30 ev and 653 20 ev which related to the presence of mn ⅵ and mn ⅲ xu et al 2022 mn ⅵ accounted for 10 24 while mn ⅲ accounted for 20 34 two peaks of mn 2p3 2 located at 644 19 ev and 641 17 ev are assigned to mn ⅵ 30 12 and mn ⅱ 39 30 respectively du et al 2019 it was worth noting that the mn 2p spectra were relatively weak possibly due to the interference of biofouling layer coated on the surface of biomnox wang et al 2019a 3 2 performance of gdm systems 3 2 1 pollutant removal performance the change of mn ii in the permeate could be used to indicate the generation of biomnox as shown in fig 2a with the maturity of the biomnox the concentration of mn ii in the permeate decreased after about 18 days and its removal rate increased steadily the adsorption and removal of mn ii was not observed during the initial stage mainly due to the limited content of the biofouling layer similar phenomena has also appeared in previous studies tang et al 2021b about one month later the concentration of mn ii in the permeate decreased to 0 078 mg l with a removal rate of 84 92 subsequently on the 50th day the concentration of mn ii further decreased from 0 078 mg l to 0 025 mg l corresponding to a removal rate of 95 09 biomnox showed a significantly effect on the removal of pollutants as shown in fig 2 b the concentration of smx began to decrease after biomnox was generated in the biomnox gdm system within 10 days the concentration of smx in the permeate had decreased from 497 41 μg l to 74 07 μg l and the corresponding removal rate had increased from 14 31 to 86 61 however until around 30 days no obvious smx removal was observed in the control gdm system the stable removal rates of smx were 97 80 and 87 16 in the biomnox gdm and control gdm units respectively fig 2c compared with the control gdm the removal rate of smx increased by 10 86 in biomnox gdm previous studies have confirmed that the removal of ecs was significantly improved with biomnox due to its strong oxidation capacities wang et al 2022 furthermore it was evident form fig 2c that the removal rates of nh4 n and doc rose by around 6 02 and 11 48 respectively following the production of biomnox the fluorescent pollutants in the feed and the permeate were characterized by parafac analysis as shown in fig s2 a three components model was established based on half split analysis comp1 and comp 2 had a bimodal distribution which respectively represent humic like substance and tyrosine tryptophan protein comp 3 which had a characteristic peak at ex em 275 340 was identified as protein like substances hambly et al 2010 li et al 2022b the removal efficiencies of three components are shown in fig 2d overall the gdm process showed limited removal efficiency on humic like substances only 8 48 was removed in biomnox gdm and the concentration of humic like substances in the permeate of control gdm was higher than that in the feed water the removal rates of tyrosine tryptophan protein and protein like substance were respectively 20 19 and 60 94 in biomnox gdm while they were 0 98 and 54 79 in control gdm respectively regardless of the components biomnox significantly increased the removal of fluorescent substances overall the results above showed that biomnox effectively improved the removal of pollutants in the gdm system including doc nh4 n fluorescent substances and smx this may be due to the strong oxidizing ability of biomnox which will be discussed later 3 2 2 flux development according to fig 3 a similar flux variation pattern was observed in the two reactors during the first 8 days the flux dropped obviously due to the interception of pollutants and the rapid formation of biofouling layers the period led to an 85 2 and 86 0 flux decrease in biomnox gdm and control gdm respectively after a short flux recovery the flux gradually decreased until approximately 30 days the stable flux for biomnox gdm and control gdm was 5 14 5 71 and 4 62 5 33 lm h respectively in this study the low temperature of domestic sewage in winter was the main reason for slow decrease of the flux predators are scarce and inactive in the raw water which leads to the limited grazing of the biofouling layer tang et al 2021c as shown in fig 3b compared with control gdm the stable flux of biomnox gdm increased by about 6 65 10 12 this could contribute to the formation of biomnox which was helpful to develop a looser biofilm and details will be discussed later in addition in this study the increase of the stable flux in biomnox gdm was less than that described in earlier literature tang et al 2021c this was primarily because low temperature had a negative influence on the development of biomnox and the biofouling layer the biofilm formed at low temperature was relatively dense which showed an adverse effect on the flux chen et al 2021 the above results indicated that the formation of biomnox was beneficial to the stable flux but the stable flux was also influenced by the properties of the biofouling layer which will be discussed later 3 3 characterization of the biofouling layer 3 3 1 eps concentration in the biofouling layer at the end of the experiment the concentrations of eps protein and eps polysaccharide in biofouling layers were extracted and analyzed to evaluate the influence of biomnox on the composition of the biofouling layer fig 4 compared with the control gdm unit the concentrations of lb eps protein and lb eps polysaccharide in biomnox gdm decreased by 28 89 and 23 15 respectively however the concentration of tb eps protein and tb eps polysaccharide increased by 25 19 and 13 02 respectively the main reason for the change of eps concentration was that lb eps was relatively loose located on the outer layer of tb eps and closely linked with pollutant biomnox could adsorb and degrade organic substances reducing the concentration of pollutants and resulting in decreased lb eps content and less pollution however the formation of biomnox also improved the living conditions for biological reproduction leading to higher biological activity as evidenced by the higher atp concentration in biomnox gdm fig 5 c therefore more microorganisms colonize within the biofouling layer causing more tb eps accumulation tang et al 2021c there were no obvious differences between the total eps contents of the biomnox gdm and control gdm which were 1 97 and 1 99 g m2 respectively however results indicated that lb eps located at the outermost layer contributing more to membrane fouling than tb eps wang et al 2009 therefore the significant reduction of lb eps in biomnox gdm could mitigate membrane fouling and promote flux improvement fig 3 moreover the eem diagram of the eps components is shown in fig 4c the main components of lb eps were tryptophan protein like substances ex em 275 325 nm and aromatic proteins ex em 225 325 nm for tb eps soluble microbial by product tryptophan protein like substances aromatic proteins and aromatic proteins were observed at ex em 275 300 nm ex em 275 350 nm ex em 225 300 nm and ex em 225 350 nm respectively xu et al 2020 it could be seen that protein like substances were the main components of lb eps and tb eps compared with the control gdm biomnox gdm produced lower fluorescence of lb eps and higher fluorescence of tb eps which were consistent with the results in fig 4a and fig 4b in addition the fluorescence intensity of in eps was obviously lower than that of lb eps and tb eps and there was no significant difference between the two reactors 3 3 2 biofouling layer structure and composition in the long term filtration process biomnox gradually accumulated on the membrane surface and this process was observed by oct and stereomicroscope after approximately a week of filtration there was no obvious difference between the biofouling layers of biomnox gdm and control gdm fig s3 after 25 days compared with the control gdm a thicker and looser biofouling layer was generated in biomnox gdm it can be seen that biomnox promoted the formation of aggregation structure which simultaneously produced numerous blank patches on the membrane surface this clustering structure increased the roughness of the biofouling layer which was beneficial to the improvement of flux klein et al 2016 as a result compared with the control gdm a higher stable flux was observed in biomnox gdm fig 3 in the presence of biomnox the biofouling layer was thicker and darker than that of the control gdm at about 50 days moreover the spatial heterogeneity of the biofouling layer including thickness and porosity could be obtained by oct images as shown in fig 5a the thickness of the biofilm in biomnox gdm and control gdm was about 1774 88 μm and 775 54 μm respectively biomnox could adsorbed more contaminants resulting in a thicker biofouling layer in biomnox gdm the porosity of the biofouling layer can be found in fig 5b and it was 64 93 and 41 24 in biomnox gdm and control gdm respectively even though a thicker layer formed in biomnox gdm the formation of biomnox significantly increased the porosity of the biofilm which led to a higher stable flux this indicated that compared with thickness porosity showed a more obvious influence on the flux an earlier study also found that biomnox increased the thickness of biofilm but a higher porosity resulted in a more heterogeneous biofouling layer which was beneficial to stable flux tang et al 2020 additionally the biological activity of the biofouling layer could be described by its atp concentration and the heterogeneity of the biofouling layer was also related to atp content peter varbanets et al 2010 as shown in fig 5c the concentration of atp was 8 30 and 6 96 µmol m2 in biomnox gdm and control gdm respectively biomnox provided a more favorable environment for the growth of microprograms therefore the biological activity in biomnox gdm increased which encouraged the development of a loose and heterogeneous biofouling layer and led to a higher stable flux fig 5d also showed that compared with the control gdm more organic and inorganic substances were adsorbed and accumulated in biomnox gdm overall biomnox could promote a thicker and looser biofouling layer and the increase of porosity had a positive effect on flux regardless of the thickness the high specific surface area of biomnox made it possible for a lot of pollutants to be adsorbed additionally it had high catalytic oxidation reactivity and could enhance the activity of microorganisms which effectively promoted the removal of pollutants in biomnox gdm 3 4 characterization of microbial community in gdm systems bacterial and eukaryotic communities play an important role in the development of biofouling layers as shown in fig 6 a proteobacteria verrucomicrobiota bacteroidota and actinobacteriota were commonly detected to be the major bacterial phyla proteobacteria accounted for the largest proportion at a rate of 52 01 and 48 98 in biomnox gdm and control gdm respectively and the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria in biomnox gdm and control gdm was 17 3 and 10 08 respectively fig s4 according to previous research proteobacteria played an important role in denitrification chang et al 2021 alphaproteobacteria belonging to proteobacteria was the most prevalent manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob yang et al 2022 the proportion of bacteroidota in biomnox gdm was also higher than that in the control gdm and they were also involved in the denitrification process sun and zhu 2022 actinobacteria was related to the degradation of smx sun et al 2019 and it was more abundant in biomnox gdm resulting in better removal of smx in biomnox gdm fig 2b more abundance bacteria related to pollutant removal were found in biomnox gdm which provided better purification results fig 2 the top abundant genera enriched in the biofouling layer could further illustrate the difference between the two reactors fig 6b the highest relative abundances were found in prosthecobacter polynucleobacter zoogloea edaphobaculum and aquicella in the two systems specifically with the formation of biomnox the proportion of prosthecobacter decreased from 20 21 to 12 24 and the abundance of polynucleobacter decreased from 14 89 and 8 56 respectively on the contrary zoogloea edaphobaculum and aquicella were more prevalent in biomnox gdm zoogloea had a relative abundance of 7 30 and 2 39 in biomnox gdm and control gdm respectively and it made an important contribution to the removal of nitrate mn ⅱ and antibiotics in the bioreactor chang et al 2021 an earlier study showed that the abundance of aquicella was obviously increased in the manganese ore filled constructed wetlands huo et al 2022 overall there are many mnob in biomnox gdm which were responsible for the production of biomnox more importantly biomnox provided favorable living conditions for nitrifying bacteria and smx degrading bacteria allowing better pollutant removal efficiency in biomnox gdm fig 2 in the eukaryote community apicomplexa 25 07 45 08 and eukaryota 18 24 43 17 were predominant phyla followed by cercozoa 5 60 8 17 porifera 3 91 9 61 and rotifera 5 41 5 49 apicomplexa has a unique machinery called the glideosome which leads to gliding motility and promotes its movement across biological barriers and cells frénal et al 2017 a higher abundance of apicomplexa promoted the modification of biofilm resulting in a looser and more open biofouling layer in biomnox gdm it was found that rotifera played a significant role in the formation of more heterogeneous biofouling layers chen et al 2021 furthermore dominant eukaryotes at the genus level were schellackia oblongichytrium goniomonas ircinia and philodina fig 6d in biomnox gdm schellackia ircinia and philodina were more prevalent while oblongichytrium and goniomonas were relatively less common the dominant eukaryotes were not affected by biomnox but their proportion within the biofouling layer was slightly changed fig 7 a shows the parameters chao ace simpson and shannon from high throughput sequencing to further characterize the difference and diversity of bacterial communities between the two groups with the formation of biomnox the ace and chao values increased indicating that biomnox increased the richness of bacterial communities meanwhile the larger shannon value and lower simpson value suggested that the bacterial community with biomnox was more diverse than that of the control gdm overall biomnox increased the richness and diversity of bacterial communities and the bacteria also processed high biological activity fig 5c in addition the cca analysis was undertaken to explain the relationship between bacterial community and the operational parameters including the concentration of mn ⅱ smx doc and nh4 n as shown in fig 7b cca1 and cca2 explained 99 97 and 0 02 respectively among the four factors mn ⅱ and doc were significantly correlated with the composition of the bacterial community p 0 05 while smx and nh4 n had no significant effect on bacterial community composition p 0 05 it could be clearly seen that the samples a1 a2 a3 and b1 b2 b3 were obviously affected by the concentration of mn ⅱ a1 a2 and a3 were in the area with high mn ⅱ concentration while b1 b2 and b3 located at the low mn ⅱ concentration region the distribution of samples from biomnox gdm was also more concentrated the length and direction of the vector indicated the influence of a given operational factor vector on the samples it was obvious to see that mn ⅱ dominated the samples from biomnox gdm there was a positive relationship between aquicella micropepsaceae zoogloea edaphobaculum leifsoniawere and mn ⅱ indicating that the distribution of these species was most likely affected by mn ⅱ this result was consistent with the composition of the bacterial community in fig 6 which showed that these species were closely related to the formation of biomnox overall according to the bacterial community composition and cca analysis biomnox had a significant impact on the microbial community in the biofouling layers the existence of biomnox was confirmed by a large number of mnob in biomnox gdm in the presence of biomnox the abundance of bacteria related to pollutant removal increased and it also had high biological activity the diversity and richness of bacterial communities also increased as biomnox provided better living conditions for biological reproduction therefore the pollutant removal efficiency of biomnox gdm was obviously improved 3 5 the occurrence of args in the biofouling layer long term filtration of water containing antibiotics will lead to the accumulation of args therefore it is necessary to investigate the concentration of args in the biofouling layers in order to assess the distribution of args in biomnox gdm and control gdm the absolute abundance of two sul genes sul1 sul2 and one integron genes inti1 were quantified in this study research indicated that the resistance of smx is primarily produced by obtaining selective dihydropteroate synthase dhps gene sul jiang et al 2019 integron is a mobile dna molecule with a unique structure which can capture and integrate exogenous genes and turn them into expression units of functional genes it makes multidrug args horizontal transmission in bacteria by transposon or conjugating plasmid as shown in table 2 inti1 was the most abundant agrs with concentrations of 1 796 983 067 57 and 2 784 003 716 53 copies μl in the biomnox gdm and control gdm respectively compared with the control gdm the concentration of inti1 in biomnox gdm decreased by 35 45 which indicated that biomnox could significantly reduce the risk of args transmission since class 1 can express and obtain multiple args through site specific recombination mediated by inti1 in addition after the formation of biomnox the concentration of sul1 decreased from 301 243 118 97 to 245 634 075 99 copies μl while the concentration of sul2 decreased from 733 927 092 44 to 454 057 135 20 copies μl corresponding to a decrease of 18 46 and 38 13 respectively sul1 and sul2 followed the same trend as inti1 which had also been observed in a previous study liu et al 2022 the results indicated that biomnox reduced the accumulation of sul1 sul2 and inti1 in the gdm reactor the reason can be inferred as follows during long term filtration of smx containing water args needed to express resistance to ensure the survival of the relevant strains in biomnox gdm the concentration of smx in the biofouling layer decreased fig 2b resulting in the reduced expression of args li et al 2022a on the other hand the diversity and activity of microorganisms in the biofouling layer were enhanced by biomnox which could increase the link between microorganisms as well as facilitating the removal of args guo et al 2020 3 6 smx degradation pathways uhplc qtof ms was used to identify the intermediate products of smx and reveal potential smx degradation pathways in gdm systems within the mass error of 5 ppm 12 candidate intermediate products were found in this study the mass spectrogram and detailed information of the products is displayed in fig s5 and table s4 based on the candidate products 4 possible degradation pathways were proposed in fig 8 it can be clearly seen that compared with control gdm two more metabolic pathways were found in biomnox gdm labeled as pathway ⅲ and pathway ⅳ respectively in addition more intermediate products p3 p8 were observed in pathway ⅰ and pathway ⅱ of biomnox gdm specifically in pathway ⅰ p1 and p2 formed by c s bond broke p1 had a m z value of 94 0651 and was further hydroxylated into p3 this transformation was only observed in biomnox gdm pathway ⅱ happened with the breaking of s n resulting in the formation of 3 amino 5 methyl isoxazole p4 m z 99 0553 and 4 aminobenzolsulfonate p5 m z 173 0141 further bond cleaving occurred in p5 which converted into p10 p4 was further transformed along three pathways in pathway ⅱ a amine group continue to be oxidized to generate p6 and p9 by removing a methyl group from p4 3 amino isoxazole was produced p7 m z 85 0396 in pathway ii b a ring opening product p8 m z 101 0709 was produced through pathway ⅱ c by cleavage of the no bond on the isoxazole and this only occurred in biomnox gdm in pathway ⅲ the amino group on the benzene ring was replaced by hydroxyl group and the product p11 was produced with the m z of 255 0534 in pathway ⅳ p12 was formed by first losing the isoxazole ring then conducting a dehydration condensation reaction according to the above proposed pathways the main intermediates of smx can be obtained via bond cleavage substitution reaction hydroxylation and the opening of the isoxazole ring among them hydroxylation and ring cleavage primarily occurred in biomnox gdm it can be seen that more metabolic pathways and metabolic products were produced in the presence of biomnox and more smx degrading bacteria with high biological activity were observed in biomnox gdm which enriched the smx degradation pathways it was worth noting that doc removal can be used to determine the degree of smx mineralization hu et al 2007 müller et al 2013 yan et al 2012 in this study the removal rates of doc in biomnox gdm and control gdm were 52 85 63 32 and 36 10 47 80 respectively this indicated that better smx mineralization occurred in biomnox gdm 4 conclusion biomnox assisted gdm system was proposed in this study for purifying water containing ecs in rural areas results indicated that biomnox gdm system was superior to conventional gdm in terms of pollutant removal and flux improvement the strong oxidation ability and high biological activity of biomnox led to a significant improvement in the removal efficiency of doc nh4 n fluorescent pollutants and smx in biomnox gdm the abundance and diversity of bacterial communities increased with biomnox the metabolic pathway and mineralization of smx also increased due to more smx degrading bacteria and biomnox in the biofouling layer biomnox could reduce the expression of agrs by strengthening the connection between organisms and reducing the concentration of smx porosity influenced gdm flux more significantly than biofouling layer thickness the formation of biomnox increased the porosity of the biofouling layer and reduced the concentration of lb eps in biomnox gdm which had a positive impact on flux credit authorship contribution statement rui chen conceptualization methodology writing original draft data curation writing review editing han zhang

15537,effective water purification technologies are required to remove emerging contaminants ecs and prevent their extensive occurrence in rural areas in this work coupling gravity driven membrane gdm filtration with biogenic manganese oxides biomnox in the biofouling layer was utilized for treating water containing smx comparisons between biomnox gdm with biomnox and control gdm without biomnox indicated that biomnox could significantly promote the removal of doc nh4 n and fluorescent pollutants due to its strong oxidating capacity and high biological activity the formation of biomnox increased the abundance of smx degrading bacteria enriched the metabolic pathway and mineralization rate of smx and effectively promoted the remove of smx more importantly biomnox facilitated the removal of antibiotic resistance genes args in the gdm because it increased the link between microorganisms and reduced the concentration of smx thus reduced the expression of args lb eps played an important role in the membrane fouling compared with the control gdm the concentration of lb eps in biomnox gdm decreased which was beneficial to alleviate membrane fouling although a thicker biofouling layer 1774 88 μm vs 775 54 μm was formed in biomnox gdm the biofilm with higher porosity 64 93 vs 41 24 had a more positive effect on the flux overall biomnox could improve the pollutant removal and stable flux level of the gdm system biomnox gdm effectively avoided the risks brought by ecs and ensured water safety in rural areas graphical abstact image graphical abstract keywords biogenic manganes oxides biomnox gravity driven membrane gdm emerging contaminants ecs antibiotic resistance genes args biofouling layer data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction gravity driven membrane gdm filtration has been successfully utilized in rural areas to remove pathogens and microorganisms however in recent years the appearance of emerging contaminants ecs in surface water has gained increasing concern antibiotics which are used extensively to treat and prevent bacterial infections in humans and animals all over the world pose a great threat to human beings and the aquatic environment even at trace levels gu et al 2018 antibiotics entering the environment will lead to the enrichment of antibiotic resistance genes args which will bring new challenges to their removal he et al 2020 the development of multidrug resistant mdr pathogens aggregated by args is a challenge to life saving antibiotic therapies arias and murray 2009 once mdr bacteria are derived they show strong resistance to various antibiotics therefore many antibiotics become ineffective for infected patients posing a serious threat to people s health sulfamethoxazole smx as a common antibiotic is the most detected ecs in 139 rivers in the united states liang et al 2021 the frequently detected smx from various surface water bodies is related to the emission of wastewater from cultivation husbandry and municipal sources shang et al 2022 due to the seriousness of the crisis traditional gdm filtration of surface water in rural areas is challenged by various ecs this technology is necessary to increase the efficiency of pollutant removal and reduce the risk of ecs and args in recent years biogenic manganese oxides biomnox have shown great potential in removing ecs antibacterial and related compounds containing phenolic and fluoroquinolone groups aromatic n oxides tetracycline and estrogen compounds could be effectively removed from the system containing biomnox forrez et al 2011 there are two main reasons for the advantages of biomnox in removing ecs on the one hand compared with chemically produced manganese oxide mnox biologically produced mnox has high specific surface area and catalytic oxidation reactivity cai et al 2020 on the other hand the re oxidation ability of manganese oxidizing bacteria to the produced mn ii can improve the reaction activity of biomnox li et al 2021 research indicated that biomnox was 10 times more efficient at removing diclofenac than chemically produced mno2 forrez et al 2010 100 mg l phenol and 10 mg l 4 chlorophenol could be degraded within 24 h when biomnox exists in the bioreactor wang et al 2019a previous studies have shown that up to 97 43 of smx can be removed by achromobacter sp strain jl9 and in situ generated biomnox liang et al 2021 laboratory scale biofilters filled with natural biomnox and inoculated with manganese oxidizing bacteria mob strains were also studied to treat synthetic and real secondary effluent resulting in excellent removal of smx zhang et al 2015 these results show that biomnox can significantly improve the removal of ecs and it can be considered for membrane filtration systems during the long term filtration of mn ii containing water bacteria could oxidize mn ii to mn iii or mn iv oxides through the distinctive manganese oxidase on its cell surfaces therefore a certain amount of biomnox was produced on the membrane surface it was found that mn ii with a concentration of 1 71 2 28 mg l was effectively removed during the gdm filtration process and biomnox was produced simultaneously tang et al 2021c the generated biomnox does not affect the flux stability of the gdm system but it shows a positive influence on the stable flux due to the porosity and heterogeneity of biomnox in addition pre adding biomnox into gdm system could effectively increase the removal of mn ii in raw water and shorten the maturing time of biomnox tang et al 2021a it can be seen that a large amount of biomnox will produce in gdm system when filtration mn ii containing water however previous reports focused on the removal of mn ii from raw water but ignored the superiority of biomnox in ecs removal to the best of our knowledge there is no report about ecs removal by in situ generated biomnox in gdm moreover few studies have comprehensively investigated the degradation pathways and mechanism of ecs in gdm system explicit information about the contribution of in situ generated biomnox to the removal of pollutants especially for ecs and args needs to be explored in this study biomnox gdm and control gdm were investigated for treating water contaminated by ecs more specifically feed water containing smx was treated in lab scale gdm reactors the purpose of this study is as follows 1 characterize biomnox 2 examine the effect of in situ generated biomnox on pollutant removal especially for smx and produced args 3 characterize the structure and composition of the biofouling layer to better explain the influence of biomnox on system performance 4 analyze the microbial communities to illustrate the effect of biomnox on smx and args removal 5 propose the degradation pathways of smx in the two gdm systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water in this study smx was used as the target pollutant to evaluate the performance of gdm systems in removing ecs diluted domestic sewage was prepared at a dilution ratio of 20 and smx stock solution was added into the feed water to prepare a 500 μg l working solution in order to obtain in situ generated biomnox mncl2 4h2o was added into the feed water the characteristics of the feed water can be found in table 1 2 2 experimental setups as shown in fig 1 two water tanks were placed separately and the feed was pumped into the constant level storage tank with a float valve which was 60 cm higher than the gdm cell corresponding to a constant pressure of 60 mbar the reactor filtration with the mn ii containing water was recorded as biomnox gdm while the other one was the control gdm each filtration system had three membrane cells operated in parallel and the permeate was collected into clean plastic bottles for subsequent analysis a commercial polyethersulfone membrane pes 150 kda was used in this experiment and the effective filtration area was 0 00768 m2 in each cell before filtration the virgin membranes were soaked in ultrapure water for 24 h to remove impurities in this study the gdm filtration systems were operated continuously for 50 days without any interference 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 water quality analytical measurements the doc and nh4 n concentrations in the feed and permeate were measured using a toc analyzer multi n c 2100s analytic jena germany and nessler s reagent spectrophotometry method respectively the fluorescence components were characterized by excitation emission eem spectrometry f7000 hitachi japan mn ii was analyzed with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes optima 5300dv perkinelmer before the detection of these indexes the samples were prefiltered through a 0 45 μm filter the concentration of smx was detected by a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc agilent 1200lc usa equipped with a spherisorb s5 ods2 c 18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 μm waters usa 0 1 methanoic acid and acetonitrile at a ratio of 70 30 was used as mobile phase with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and the detection wavelength was 270 nm to analyze the degradation products of smx uhplc qtof ms agilent usa was used in conjunction with an agilent eclipse plus c18 column 2 1 100 mm 1 8 μm gradient elution information of the mobile phase can be found in the supplementary materials table s1 2 3 2 morphology of biofouling layer the overall pictures of biofouling layer were recorded by an olympus c 7070 stereomicroscope olympus hamburg germany and the cross sectional profile was characterized by optical coherence tomography oct model 930 nm spectral domain thorlabs gmbh dachau germany in order to determine the thickness and porosity of biofouling layer 20 images with a size of 4 00 2 50 mm were randomly selected from the membrane surface imagej and matlab were used to analyze oct images in line with the detailed operational processes mentioned in previous research derlon et al 2012 in addition confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leicasp5 wetzlar germany was used to study the biofouling layer on the membrane surface by staining proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acid dyeing operations are displayed in the supplementary materials 2 3 3 compositions of biofouling layer after long term filtration the biofouling layers were carefully removed from the membrane surface the collected layer sample was diluted to 30 ml with 0 9 sodium chloride solution after 10 min of vortex movement the mixture was ultrasonicated in ice water for 1 min the harvested solution was stored at 4 c for subsequent analysis the extraction of eps components could refer to previous literature wang et al 2019b in brief the samples were centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min and the sediments were extracted by vortexed treatment for 5 min followed by ultrasonic treatment in the ice bath for 1 min then loosely bound eps lb eps was collected by centrifugation at 5000 g for 15 min subsequently the deposited mixture was re suspended with 0 9 normal saline and heated at 80 c for 60 min the tightly bound eps tb eps fractions were collected by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 30 min the concentration of protein in the eps solution was determined by lowry protein assay kit and the content of polysaccharides was analyzed by anthrone sulfuric method adenosine triphosphate atp content of the biofouling layer was measured with the bactiter glo promega corporation kit by a luminometer detector glomax turner biosystems sunnyvale usa based on our previous research chen et al 2021 2 3 4 microbial community of biofouling layer to identify the microbial community in gdm reactors biofouling layer samples were collected after long term filtration microbial dna was extracted

community in the biofouling layer were analyzed by amplification and sequencing of the 18s ribosomal rna using the primers euk 528f 5 gcggtaattccagctccaa 3 and euk 706r 5 aatccragaatttcacctct 3 then according to the standard protocol the paired end sequencing 2 250 of the amplicon library was carried out on an illumina miseq platform shanghai biozeron co ltd the sequencing results were analyzed by an operational taxonomic unit otu based approach using qiime software v1 9 0 and the rdp classifier version 2 2 2 3 5 quantification of args in order to quantify the effect of biomnox on the concentration of args at the end of the filtration the biofouling layers from biomnox gdm and control gdm were collected in triplicate the bacterial genomic dna was extracted by using the e z n a stool dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s the pcr primer used in this study includes two sulfonamides resistance genes sul1 sul2 and ⅰ integrase gene int1 and the corresponding sequences are shown

args were determined according to the standard curves more information about qpcr is shown in the supplementary materials table s3 2 4 characterization of biomnox the characteristics of biomnox formed during gdm filtration were investigated in this study raman spectra jy hr800 were used to determine the composition of biomnox x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250 thermo corporation usa was used to determine the valence states of mn the measurements were carried out using a conventional al kα anode radiation source al ka hn 1486 7 ev and the xps raw data was calibrated by the c1s binding energy at 284 8 ev before the above test the samples were vacuum dried 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of biomnox raman spectroscopy can distinguish different types of biomnox because the different stretching modes of mn o lattice and the deformation modes of mn o mn metal oxygen chain in mno2 octahedral lattice can cause differences in raman shift zhou and fu 2020 raman spectra of the biofouling layer from biomnox gdm and control gdm can be found in fig s1a significant differences were observed between the two samples the raman spectra of biofouling layer in biomnox gdm showed a peak at around 635 cm 1 577 cm 1 515 cm 1 and 475 cm 1 respectively the positions of the peaks found in this study were consistent with the birnessite type structure bernardini et al 2019 liu et al 2018 and the sharpness of the band at 420 cm 1 indicates the crystalline order of the birnessite compound julien et al 2004 no peak related to biomnox was observed in the biofouling layer sample of control gdm in addition xps can reflect the chemical states of manganese in biomnox as shown in fig s1b the region and curve fitted xps spectra of mn 2p contained two peaks at 654 2 ev 2p1 2 and 642 8 ev 2p3 2 respectively the mn 2p1 2 spectra were fitted with two peaks at 655 30 ev and 653 20 ev which related to the presence of mn ⅵ and mn ⅲ xu et al 2022 mn ⅵ accounted for 10 24 while mn ⅲ accounted for 20 34 two peaks of mn 2p3 2 located at 644 19 ev and 641 17 ev are assigned to mn ⅵ 30 12 and mn ⅱ 39 30 respectively du et al 2019 it was worth noting that the mn 2p spectra were relatively weak possibly due to the interference of biofouling layer coated on the surface of biomnox wang et al 2019a 3 2 performance of gdm systems 3 2 1 pollutant removal performance the change of mn ii in the permeate could be used to indicate the generation of biomnox as shown in fig 2a with the maturity of the biomnox the concentration of mn ii in the permeate decreased after about 18 days and its removal rate increased steadily the adsorption and removal of mn ii was not observed during the initial stage mainly due to the limited content of the biofouling layer similar phenomena has also appeared in previous studies tang et al 2021b about one month later the concentration of mn ii in the permeate decreased to 0 078 mg l with a removal rate of 84 92 subsequently on the 50th day the concentration of mn ii further decreased from 0 078 mg l to 0 025 mg l corresponding to a removal rate of 95 09 biomnox showed a significantly effect on the removal of pollutants as shown in fig 2 b the concentration of smx began to decrease after biomnox was generated in the biomnox gdm system within 10 days the concentration of smx in the permeate had decreased from 497 41 μg l to 74 07 μg l and the corresponding removal rate had increased from 14 31 to 86 61 however until around 30 days no obvious smx removal was observed in the control gdm system the stable removal rates of smx were 97 80 and 87 16 in the biomnox gdm and control gdm units respectively fig 2c compared with the control gdm the removal rate of smx increased by 10 86 in biomnox gdm previous studies have confirmed that the removal of ecs was significantly improved with biomnox due to its strong oxidation capacities wang et al 2022 furthermore it was evident form fig 2c that the removal rates of nh4 n and doc rose by around 6 02 and 11 48 respectively following the production of biomnox the fluorescent pollutants in the feed and the permeate were characterized by parafac analysis as shown in fig s2 a three components model was established based on half split analysis comp1 and comp 2 had a bimodal distribution which respectively represent humic like substance and tyrosine tryptophan protein comp 3 which had a characteristic peak at ex em 275 340 was identified as protein like substances hambly et al 2010 li et al 2022b the removal efficiencies of three components are shown in fig 2d overall the gdm process showed limited removal efficiency on humic like substances only 8 48 was removed in biomnox gdm and the concentration of humic like substances in the permeate of control gdm was higher than that in the feed water the removal rates of tyrosine tryptophan protein and protein like substance were respectively 20 19 and 60 94 in biomnox gdm while they were 0 98 and 54 79 in control gdm respectively regardless of the components biomnox significantly increased the removal of fluorescent substances overall the results above showed that biomnox effectively improved the removal of pollutants in the gdm system including doc nh4 n fluorescent substances and smx this may be due to the strong oxidizing ability of biomnox which will be discussed later 3 2 2 flux development according to fig 3 a similar flux variation pattern was observed in the two reactors during the first 8 days the flux dropped obviously due to the interception of pollutants and the rapid formation of biofouling layers the period led to an 85 2 and 86 0 flux decrease in biomnox gdm and control gdm respectively after a short flux recovery the flux gradually decreased until approximately 30 days the stable flux for biomnox gdm and control gdm was 5 14 5 71 and 4 62 5 33 lm h respectively in this study the low temperature of domestic sewage in winter was the main reason for slow decrease of the flux predators are scarce and inactive in the raw water which leads to the limited grazing of the biofouling layer tang et al 2021c as shown in fig 3b compared with control gdm the stable flux of biomnox gdm increased by about 6 65 10 12 this could contribute to the formation of biomnox which was helpful to develop a looser biofilm and details will be discussed later in addition in this study the increase of the stable flux in biomnox gdm was less than that described in earlier literature tang et al 2021c this was primarily because low temperature had a negative influence on the development of biomnox and the biofouling layer the biofilm formed at low temperature was relatively dense which showed an adverse effect on the flux chen et al 2021 the above results indicated that the formation of biomnox was beneficial to the stable flux but the stable flux was also influenced by the properties of the biofouling layer which will be discussed later 3 3 characterization of the biofouling layer 3 3 1 eps concentration in the biofouling layer at the end of the experiment the concentrations of eps protein and eps polysaccharide in biofouling layers were extracted and analyzed to evaluate the influence of biomnox on the composition of the biofouling layer fig 4 compared with the control gdm unit the concentrations of lb eps protein and lb eps polysaccharide in biomnox gdm decreased by 28 89 and 23 15 respectively however the concentration of tb eps protein and tb eps polysaccharide increased by 25 19 and 13 02 respectively the main reason for the change of eps concentration was that lb eps was relatively loose located on the outer layer of tb eps and closely linked with pollutant biomnox could adsorb and degrade organic substances reducing the concentration of pollutants and resulting in decreased lb eps content and less pollution however the formation of biomnox also improved the living conditions for biological reproduction leading to higher biological activity as evidenced by the higher atp concentration in biomnox gdm fig 5 c therefore more microorganisms colonize within the biofouling layer causing more tb eps accumulation tang et al 2021c there were no obvious differences between the total eps contents of the biomnox gdm and control gdm which were 1 97 and 1 99 g m2 respectively however results indicated that lb eps located at the outermost layer contributing more to membrane fouling than tb eps wang et al 2009 therefore the significant reduction of lb eps in biomnox gdm could mitigate membrane fouling and promote flux improvement fig 3 moreover the eem diagram of the eps components is shown in fig 4c the main components of lb eps were tryptophan protein like substances ex em 275 325 nm and aromatic proteins ex em 225 325 nm for tb eps soluble microbial by product tryptophan protein like substances aromatic proteins and aromatic proteins were observed at ex em 275 300 nm ex em 275 350 nm ex em 225 300 nm and ex em 225 350 nm respectively xu et al 2020 it could be seen that protein like substances were the main components of lb eps and tb eps compared with the control gdm biomnox gdm produced lower fluorescence of lb eps and higher fluorescence of tb eps which were consistent with the results in fig 4a and fig 4b in addition the fluorescence intensity of in eps was obviously lower than that of lb eps and tb eps and there was no significant difference between the two reactors 3 3 2 biofouling layer structure and composition in the long term filtration process biomnox gradually accumulated on the membrane surface and this process was observed by oct and stereomicroscope after approximately a week of filtration there was no obvious difference between the biofouling layers of biomnox gdm and control gdm fig s3 after 25 days compared with the control gdm a thicker and looser biofouling layer was generated in biomnox gdm it can be seen that biomnox promoted the formation of aggregation structure which simultaneously produced numerous blank patches on the membrane surface this clustering structure increased the roughness of the biofouling layer which was beneficial to the improvement of flux klein et al 2016 as a result compared with the control gdm a higher stable flux was observed in biomnox gdm fig 3 in the presence of biomnox the biofouling layer was thicker and darker than that of the control gdm at about 50 days moreover the spatial heterogeneity of the biofouling layer including thickness and porosity could be obtained by oct images as shown in fig 5a the thickness of the biofilm in biomnox gdm and control gdm was about 1774 88 μm and 775 54 μm respectively biomnox could adsorbed more contaminants resulting in a thicker biofouling layer in biomnox gdm the porosity of the biofouling layer can be found in fig 5b and it was 64 93 and 41 24 in biomnox gdm and control gdm respectively even though a thicker layer formed in biomnox gdm the formation of biomnox significantly increased the porosity of the biofilm which led to a higher stable flux this indicated that compared with thickness porosity showed a more obvious influence on the flux an earlier study also found that biomnox increased the thickness of biofilm but a higher porosity resulted in a more heterogeneous biofouling layer which was beneficial to stable flux tang et al 2020 additionally the biological activity of the biofouling layer could be described by its atp concentration and the heterogeneity of the biofouling layer was also related to atp content peter varbanets et al 2010 as shown in fig 5c the concentration of atp was 8 30 and 6 96 µmol m2 in biomnox gdm and control gdm respectively biomnox provided a more favorable environment for the growth of microprograms therefore the biological activity in biomnox gdm increased which encouraged the development of a loose and heterogeneous biofouling layer and led to a higher stable flux fig 5d also showed that compared with the control gdm more organic and inorganic substances were adsorbed and accumulated in biomnox gdm overall biomnox could promote a thicker and looser biofouling layer and the increase of porosity had a positive effect on flux regardless of the thickness the high specific surface area of biomnox made it possible for a lot of pollutants to be adsorbed additionally it had high catalytic oxidation reactivity and could enhance the activity of microorganisms which effectively promoted the removal of pollutants in biomnox gdm 3 4 characterization of microbial community in gdm systems bacterial and eukaryotic communities play an important role in the development of biofouling layers as shown in fig 6 a proteobacteria verrucomicrobiota bacteroidota and actinobacteriota were commonly detected to be the major bacterial phyla proteobacteria accounted for the largest proportion at a rate of 52 01 and 48 98 in biomnox gdm and control gdm respectively and the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria in biomnox gdm and control gdm was 17 3 and 10 08 respectively fig s4 according to previous research proteobacteria played an important role in denitrification chang et al 2021 alphaproteobacteria belonging to proteobacteria was the most prevalent manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob yang et al 2022 the proportion of bacteroidota in biomnox gdm was also higher than that in the control gdm and they were also involved in the denitrification process sun and zhu 2022 actinobacteria was related to the degradation of smx sun et al 2019 and it was more abundant in biomnox gdm resulting in better removal of smx in biomnox gdm fig 2b more abundance bacteria related to pollutant removal were found in biomnox gdm which provided better purification results fig 2 the top abundant genera enriched in the biofouling layer could further illustrate the difference between the two reactors fig 6b the highest relative abundances were found in prosthecobacter polynucleobacter zoogloea edaphobaculum and aquicella in the two systems specifically with the formation of biomnox the proportion of prosthecobacter decreased from 20 21 to 12 24 and the abundance of polynucleobacter decreased from 14 89 and 8 56 respectively on the contrary zoogloea edaphobaculum and aquicella were more prevalent in biomnox gdm zoogloea had a relative abundance of 7 30 and 2 39 in biomnox gdm and control gdm respectively and it made an important contribution to the removal of nitrate mn ⅱ and antibiotics in the bioreactor chang et al 2021 an earlier study showed that the abundance of aquicella was obviously increased in the manganese ore filled constructed wetlands huo et al 2022 overall there are many mnob in biomnox gdm which were responsible for the production of biomnox more importantly biomnox provided favorable living conditions for nitrifying bacteria and smx degrading bacteria allowing better pollutant removal efficiency in biomnox gdm fig 2 in the eukaryote community apicomplexa 25 07 45 08 and eukaryota 18 24 43 17 were predominant phyla followed by cercozoa 5 60 8 17 porifera 3 91 9 61 and rotifera 5 41 5 49 apicomplexa has a unique machinery called the glideosome which leads to gliding motility and promotes its movement across biological barriers and cells frénal et al 2017 a higher abundance of apicomplexa promoted the modification of biofilm resulting in a looser and more open biofouling layer in biomnox gdm it was found that rotifera played a significant role in the formation of more heterogeneous biofouling layers chen et al 2021 furthermore dominant eukaryotes at the genus level were schellackia oblongichytrium goniomonas ircinia and philodina fig 6d in biomnox gdm schellackia ircinia and philodina were more prevalent while oblongichytrium and goniomonas were relatively less common the dominant eukaryotes were not affected by biomnox but their proportion within the biofouling layer was slightly changed fig 7 a shows the parameters chao ace simpson and shannon from high throughput sequencing to further characterize the difference and diversity of bacterial communities between the two groups with the formation of biomnox the ace and chao values increased indicating that biomnox increased the richness of bacterial communities meanwhile the larger shannon value and lower simpson value suggested that the bacterial community with biomnox was more diverse than that of the control gdm overall biomnox increased the richness and diversity of bacterial communities and the bacteria also processed high biological activity fig 5c in addition the cca analysis was undertaken to explain the relationship between bacterial community and the operational parameters including the concentration of mn ⅱ smx doc and nh4 n as shown in fig 7b cca1 and cca2 explained 99 97 and 0 02 respectively among the four factors mn ⅱ and doc were significantly correlated with the composition of the bacterial community p 0 05 while smx and nh4 n had no significant effect on bacterial community composition p 0 05 it could be clearly seen that the samples a1 a2 a3 and b1 b2 b3 were obviously affected by the concentration of mn ⅱ a1 a2 and a3 were in the area with high mn ⅱ concentration while b1 b2 and b3 located at the low mn ⅱ concentration region the distribution of samples from biomnox gdm was also more concentrated the length and direction of the vector indicated the influence of a given operational factor vector on the samples it was obvious to see that mn ⅱ dominated the samples from biomnox gdm there was a positive relationship between aquicella micropepsaceae zoogloea edaphobaculum leifsoniawere and mn ⅱ indicating that the distribution of these species was most likely affected by mn ⅱ this result was consistent with the composition of the bacterial community in fig 6 which showed that these species were closely related to the formation of biomnox overall according to the bacterial community composition and cca analysis biomnox had a significant impact on the microbial community in the biofouling layers the existence of biomnox was confirmed by a large number of mnob in biomnox gdm in the presence of biomnox the abundance of bacteria related to pollutant removal increased and it also had high biological activity the diversity and richness of bacterial communities also increased as biomnox provided better living conditions for biological reproduction therefore the pollutant removal efficiency of biomnox gdm was obviously improved 3 5 the occurrence of args in the biofouling layer long term filtration of water containing antibiotics will lead to the accumulation of args therefore it is necessary to investigate the concentration of args in the biofouling layers in order to assess the distribution of args in biomnox gdm and control gdm the absolute abundance of two sul genes sul1 sul2 and one integron genes inti1 were quantified in this study research indicated that the resistance of smx is primarily produced by obtaining selective dihydropteroate synthase dhps gene sul jiang et al 2019 integron is a mobile dna molecule with a unique structure which can capture and integrate exogenous genes and turn them into expression units of functional genes it makes multidrug args horizontal transmission in bacteria by transposon or conjugating plasmid as shown in table 2 inti1 was the most abundant agrs with concentrations of 1 796 983 067 57 and 2 784 003 716 53 copies μl in the biomnox gdm and control gdm respectively compared with the control gdm the concentration of inti1 in biomnox gdm decreased by 35 45 which indicated that biomnox could significantly reduce the risk of args transmission since class 1 can express and obtain multiple args through site specific recombination mediated by inti1 in addition after the formation of biomnox the concentration of sul1 decreased from 301 243 118 97 to 245 634 075 99 copies μl while the concentration of sul2 decreased from 733 927 092 44 to 454 057 135 20 copies μl corresponding to a decrease of 18 46 and 38 13 respectively sul1 and sul2 followed the same trend as inti1 which had also been observed in a previous study liu et al 2022 the results indicated that biomnox reduced the accumulation of sul1 sul2 and inti1 in the gdm reactor the reason can be inferred as follows during long term filtration of smx containing water args needed to express resistance to ensure the survival of the relevant strains in biomnox gdm the concentration of smx in the biofouling layer decreased fig 2b resulting in the reduced expression of args li et al 2022a on the other hand the diversity and activity of microorganisms in the biofouling layer were enhanced by biomnox which could increase the link between microorganisms as well as facilitating the removal of args guo et al 2020 3 6 smx degradation pathways uhplc qtof ms was used to identify the intermediate products of smx and reveal potential smx degradation pathways in gdm systems within the mass error of 5 ppm 12 candidate intermediate products were found in this study the mass spectrogram and detailed information of the products is displayed in fig s5 and table s4 based on the candidate products 4 possible degradation pathways were proposed in fig 8 it can be clearly seen that compared with control gdm two more metabolic pathways were found in biomnox gdm labeled as pathway ⅲ and pathway ⅳ respectively in addition more intermediate products p3 p8 were observed in pathway ⅰ and pathway ⅱ of biomnox gdm specifically in pathway ⅰ p1 and p2 formed by c s bond broke p1 had a m z value of 94 0651 and was further hydroxylated into p3 this transformation was only observed in biomnox gdm pathway ⅱ happened with the breaking of s n resulting in the formation of 3 amino 5 methyl isoxazole p4 m z 99 0553 and 4 aminobenzolsulfonate p5 m z 173 0141 further bond cleaving occurred in p5 which converted into p10 p4 was further transformed along three pathways in pathway ⅱ a amine group continue to be oxidized to generate p6 and p9 by removing a methyl group from p4 3 amino isoxazole was produced p7 m z 85 0396 in pathway ii b a ring opening product p8 m z 101 0709 was produced through pathway ⅱ c by cleavage of the no bond on the isoxazole and this only occurred in biomnox gdm in pathway ⅲ the amino group on the benzene ring was replaced by hydroxyl group and the product p11 was produced with the m z of 255 0534 in pathway ⅳ p12 was formed by first losing the isoxazole ring then conducting a dehydration condensation reaction according to the above proposed pathways the main intermediates of smx can be obtained via bond cleavage substitution reaction hydroxylation and the opening of the isoxazole ring among them hydroxylation and ring cleavage primarily occurred in biomnox gdm it can be seen that more metabolic pathways and metabolic products were produced in the presence of biomnox and more smx degrading bacteria with high biological activity were observed in biomnox gdm which enriched the smx degradation pathways it was worth noting that doc removal can be used to determine the degree of smx mineralization hu et al 2007 müller et al 2013 yan et al 2012 in this study the removal rates of doc in biomnox gdm and control gdm were 52 85 63 32 and 36 10 47 80 respectively this indicated that better smx mineralization occurred in biomnox gdm 4 conclusion biomnox assisted gdm system was proposed in this study for purifying water containing ecs in rural areas results indicated that biomnox gdm system was superior to conventional gdm in terms of pollutant removal and flux improvement the strong oxidation ability and high biological activity of biomnox led to a significant improvement in the removal efficiency of doc nh4 n fluorescent pollutants and smx in biomnox gdm the abundance and diversity of bacterial communities increased with biomnox the metabolic pathway and mineralization of smx also increased due to more smx degrading bacteria and biomnox in the biofouling layer biomnox could reduce the expression of agrs by strengthening the connection between organisms and reducing the concentration of smx porosity influenced gdm flux more significantly than biofouling layer thickness the formation of biomnox increased the porosity of the biofouling layer and reduced the concentration of lb eps in biomnox gdm which had a positive impact on flux credit authorship contribution statement rui chen conceptualization methodology writing original draft data curation writing review editing han zhang

15538,in water treatment with membrane filtration process a lot of factors such as process design operation and fouling affect membrane flux but it is often neglected the flux decline which attribute to air resistance in this study it has been observed that air resistance caused by air trapped initially at startup as well as the release of air from the permeating liquid has an adverse effect on the membrane filtration and backwash process in water treatment in the study a new in situ monitoring method ultrasonic phased array upa was used to investigate the distribution of released air in the hollow fiber membrane module the operation parameters such as backwash interval duration and strength were investigated a strategy was also proposed to mitigate the adverse effects of air resistance the results showed that upa can successfully monitor the distribution of released air which has a good positive correlation with air sound pressure reflection r air the released air is mainly distributed far away from the outlet while as the backwash interval and strength increase the range of released air distribution gradually expands we also found the optimal operating parameters for the minimum released air volume that the backwash interval is 90 min and the backwash duration is 60 s besides the air resistance has a good positive correlation with released air moreover the released air migration results show that air dispersion and redissolution are beneficial to reduce the air resistance in the backwash process in summary the optimal operation can mitigate the air resistance in the variable membrane filtration mode in water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hollow fiber membrane upa technology air resistance released air distribution data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction with the application and development of membrane technology hollow fiber membrane has become ubiquitous due to their high membrane area and low manufacturing cost souza and basu 2013 ye et al 2010 however membrane fouling is still a ubiquitous challenge to the increased application of mf and uf membrane technologies in water treatment systems akhondi et al 2014 raffin et al 2012 which causes productivity decline and higher operational costs with the goal of further improving membrane flux and permeate quality fouling control strategies are required to avoid decline in permeability due to severe membrane fouling in submerged hollow fiber systems backwash provided effective removal of the fouling layer and prolonged the filtration process for submerged membrane systems especially at high imposed fluxes which has been widely used cui et al 2018 günther et al 2010 profio et al 2011 backwash process is conducted with a reversed flow pushed from the membrane permeate side to the feed side using a given type of medium periodic hydraulic backwashing is a necessity for the routine operation of uf mf membranes however excessive flux will accelerate membrane fouling which lead to higher backwash frequency and backwash pressure and over a series of filtration cycles the backwash pressure will quickly become too high resulting in irreversible fouling generation and even lead to membrane integrity problems xu et al 2017 therefore it is possible to minimize fouling by optimizing the operating conditions in the system such as backwash interval duration and strength which are important parameters in the fouling mitigation of submerged hf membranes akhondi et al 2017 habib et al 2017 hwang et al 2009 zsirai et al 2012 however in akhondi et al 2017 research they found that there was a point that the sudden decrease in backwash efficiency occurs when the pressure on the permeate side of the membrane at the end of a backwash cycle does not reach the atmospheric pressure maintained on the feed side which promotes the released air on the permeate side of the hollow fiber membrane due to the pressure drop across the membrane cui et al 2017 also investigated the effect of released air in membrane backwash system by exploring the effective backwash length it was found that it was more prone for longer 1 5 and 1 8 m fibers to have the air accumulated in the most distant membrane lumen while shorter 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m membrane fibers are not conducive to the release and air accumulation as it requires higher backwash pressure which would be much higher than the backwash pressure in actual operation process however previous studies are based on small membrane modules or the monitoring method is not suitable for pilot or industrial membrane modules which makes it difficult to further explain the influence of the air resistance caused by released air in practical applications air resistance will have a negative impact on the delivery efficiency or cause damage to the pipeline and pump and even cause the pipeline to rupture similarly air resistance in the membrane module will also have an adverse effect on the membrane filtration and backwash process therefore it is of great significance for optimizing the membrane process to explore the distribution of released air and its influence by discovering a new in situ monitoring method traditional monitoring technologies such as direct observation do technology marselina et al 2009 ye et al 2011 optical coherence tomography oct gao et al 2014 and magnetic resonance imaging mri simkins et al 2020 are unable or difficult to operate and monitor the air and water distribution in the membrane module ultrasonics technology especially ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr li et al 2014 2012 has been used to monitor the hollow fiber membranes fouling because it can easily and quickly obtain the fouling information however because utdr adopts more single point monitoring methods it is difficult to apply to pilot or industrial membrane modules as a mature technology kim et al 2020 latête et al 2021 xie et al 2021 upa technology has been applied in industrial non destructive testing especially in areas including medical nuclear power and materials evaluation because the ultrasonic beam can be steered and focused without the need to reconfigure the ultrasonic probes feng and qian 2020 scalea et al 2005 compared with the single point monitoring of the traditional ultrasonic technology the beam emitted by the upa probe can be focused and electronically scanned regionally without moving the probe which is fast and flexible and the error of monitoring information in time and space caused by moving the probe would be also reduced moreover because the ultrasonic signal reflects strongly on the air water interface it is easy to identify the state of the air water two phase in the hollow fiber membrane which makes it possible to use upa technology for in situ monitoring therefore in the study we applied upa technology to in situ monitoring of released air distribution in the outside in membrane process for the first time we firstly investigated the distribution of released air in the filtration process under different operation parameters backwash interval duration and strength and found an optimal operation parameter besides the correlation between released air volume and air resistance tmp was further explored in addition we investigated the air migration process in the backwash process and based on this we proposed a strategy to reduce the released air in the membrane module to achieve the optimization of the filtration and backwash process 2 methods and materials 2 1 formation of air resistance according to the momentum equation bernoulli equation and euler continuity equation as shown in fig 1 a when the fluid passes through the membrane pore the velocity and pressure of the fluid will change due to the stable flow field from the outside entering the narrow pores the velocity would increase at the membrane pore and part of the static pressure is converted into dynamic pressure resulting in a pressure drop on both sides of the membrane v 1 v 2 v 0 p 0 p 2 p 1 where v 0 and p 0 are the fluid velocity and pressure outside the membrane pores v 1 and p 1 are the fluid velocity and pressure in the membrane pores v 2 and p 2 are the fluid velocity and pressure in the membrane cavity respectively after the fluid passes through the membrane pores the partial pressure is lower than the corresponding saturated vapor pressure of the liquid at this time vapor and dissolved air in the fluid will escape in the form of air forming tiny bubbles this part of the air may adhere to the inner cavity of the membrane or be discharged with the flow of the filtrate fig 1 b shows the movement of air in the two processes of filtration and backwash filtrate can take away part of the released air but there will still be some attached to the membrane cavity and cannot be eliminated this is due to upward force generated by the flow of filtrate is less than the adhesion force of the bubble the transition from filtration to backwash will promote the released air accumulation and dissolution the air resistance due to the released air will reduce the local flux of the membrane causing the increase of tmp 2 2 the theory of ultrasound at the air water interface when there is no sound wave propagating in the air the pressure is the atmospheric pressure p 0 when there is a sound wave propagating in it the pressure of each point will be higher than p 0 in half a cycle and lower than p 0 in the other half cycle for pure tones the pressure varies as a sinusoidal wave the difference between the instantaneous value of pressure and the average pressure p 0 is called sound pressure the calculation results show that the sound pressure amplitude p is determined by the following equation 1 p a ω ρ c where a represents the amplitude ω represents the angular frequency of the vibration ρ represents the density of the medium and c represents the speed of the sound wave in the medium and because the amplitude of the vibration velocity of the medium particle is 2 v a ω divide eqs 1 and 2 3 ρ c z z is called the acoustic impedance of the medium acoustic impedance is an important physical quantity that describes the acoustic properties of the medium it depends on the density of the medium and the sound speed and the sound speed is only related to the nature of the medium at a certain temperature it can be concluded that the acoustic impedance is mainly determined by the medium when the ultrasonic wave enters the interface perpendicularly a reflected wave opposite to the incident direction and a transmitted wave in the same direction as the incident wave are generated the waveform does not change the subscripts i r and t are used to represent incidence reflection and refraction respectively when the sound waves are transmitted vertically the sound waves on both sides of the medium must meet two boundary conditions i the total sound pressure on one side is equal to the total sound pressure on the other side p i p r p t ii the particle velocity amplitudes on both sides are equal to maintain continuity v i v r v t 4 p i z 1 v i 5 p t z 2 v t 6 p r z 1 v r sound pressure reflection r can be got 7 p r p i z 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 r in the study when the ultrasonic wave is transmitted at the air water interface the interface sound pressure reflection r air water is 8 r air water z air z water z air z water where z air 0 0004 10 6 kg m 2 s z water 1 5 10 6 kg m 2 s r air water can be calculated 9 r air water 1 the result shows that at the air water interface ultrasonic wave will be totally reflected the results of a single upa scan can obtain n collection points then the average reflection of the air r air in the membrane module is 10 r air i 1 n p ri p i n 12 i 1 n x i 255 n 12 where x i and 255 are the output and input of upa image acquisition respectively and the total number of scans is 12 based on the theory upa technology can achieve the in suit monitoring of the distribution of air and water in the hollow fiber membrane module 2 3 the principal of upa technology the traditional ultrasonic single element probe as shown in fig 2 a realizes the transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves through a single ultrasonic array element due to the limitation of the number of array elements it is only suitable for the acquisition of single point information which limits the widespread use of single element probes compared with single element probe upa systems are relatively more complex the schematic diagram of ultrasonic pulse transmission and echo reception of upa is shown in fig 2 b the excitation module transmits a trigger signal of a certain amplitude to the delayer and calculates the delay time of the sound beam emission of each array element according to the emission focus law and integrates the pulse width of the trigger signal and the integrated pulse signal is loaded into each array element due to the delay the phases of the sound beams emitted by each array element are not the same and the sound beams are superimposed in space to form an incident wave front and focus at a certain distance to detect air water interface in the hollow fiber membrane the sound beam emitted by the array element will be reflected back when encountering the interface and the interface in the focus area will form a reflected wave front with larger amplitude due to the different spatial positions of the array elements of the probe the time for the reflected echo of the defect to reach each element will also be different the delayer calculates the receiving delay of each array element according to the receiving focus law superimposes the echo signal of each array element in turn and feeds it back to the signal receiving module 2 4 experiment instruments a lab scale hollow fiber membrane setup dimension of 0 73 0 1 1 3 m length width height is shown in fig 3 a b the pristine polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fiber membrane was provided by tianjin cnclear environmental protection technology co ltd the dimensions of these membranes were provided as follows pore size 0 22 µm the outer inner diameter 2000 1000 µm the membrane module is 0 5 m long and 0 5 m wide including 100 hollow fiber membranes with 0 1 m2 effective area of and 100 m2 m2 packing density two diaphragm pumps dy ssp075 a deng yuan water filtration machine co ltd china controlled the filtration and backwash processes separately the upa system cts pa322t guangdong shantou ultrasonic electronics co ltd china was used to receive the information obtained from the movement of the scanner and the probe on the membrane surface the scanner and the probe move synchronously to ensure the consistency of the obtained image and the position of the membrane surface the experiment was carried out under the conditions of atmospheric pressure of 101 325 kpa and water temperature of 20 2 c and the main air contents are oxygen and nitrogen which can be calculated to be 8 84 mg l and 6 83 mg l respectively the water characterization is shown in table 1 the main steps are as follows first the membrane module was immersed in deionized water for 24 h and subjected to several filtration and backwash cycles to ensure that the membrane module was fully wetted then the membrane module was immersed in tap water during the experiment the filtration process maintained a constant flux of 120 lmh and the filtration times backwash interval were 30 min 60 min 90 min 120 min and 150 min respectively the variation of tmp during the operation was recorded at the same time since the backwash process will affect the released air volume and migration we further set the backwash process and parameters according to previous studies the backwash durations were 30 s 60 s 90 s 120 s and 150 s and the backwash strengths backwash flux permeate flux were 1 1 2 1 and 3 1 respectively adjust filtration and backwash parameters and use upa to monitor the distribution of released air in membrane module as shown in fig 3 c the probe scanned the membrane modules in a top down manner where the membrane modules are equally divided into 12 groups and each scan width is 10 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of operating parameters on the released air distribution regarding operating conditions the parameters during filtration and backwash are significantly related to the filtration performance in order to explore the performance of released air we focused on some key parameters including the backwash interval backwash duration and backwash strength the backwash strength can be expressed as the ratio of the backwash flux to permeate flux jbw jfl under constant flux chang et al 2017 based on the backwash strength of 1 1 the backwash flux is 120 lmh the permeation flux is 120 lmh we have further enhanced it to 2 1 the backwash flux is 240 lmh and the permeation flux is 120 lmh and 3 1 backwash flux is 360 lmh permeation flux is 120 lmh as shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 b with the enhancement of backwash strength the volume of released air has increased significantly the distribution of the released air gradually spreads from the lower right to the upper right of the membrane module and further to the entire membrane module with backwash strength increasing this is because on the one hand the increase in backwash strength increases the pressure difference between filtration and backwash thereby promoting the increase of released air in the filtrate on the other hand the released air whether it is the air reintroduced by the backwash or the air bubbles originally adhering to the inner wall of the membrane is subjected to greater pressure making it easier to migrate with the filtrate the generation and adhesion of the released air in the membrane module leads to air resistance which reduces the filtration efficiency and further adversely affects the backwash process on the one hand excessive backwash strength cannot bring higher backwash efficiency on the other hand it will also cause the increase of released air which is not what we want however by monitoring the released air in the membrane module it can be found that there are some operating parameters that make there is no obvious released air in the membrane module such as 60 s backwash duration at low backwash strength 1 1 fig 5 further showed released air under different backwash duration and backwash interval at 1 1 backwash strength in the filtration process obviously as the backwash interval increases it helps to reduce the volume of released air as a whole the reason may be that continuous filtration makes the inside of the membrane module in a long term negative pressure which promotes the release of air as the backwash interval increases more air is released and the air volume increases which increases the possibility that air will escape with the filtrate moreover different combinations of backwash interval and backwash duration result in different released air clearly the results show that there are optimal operating parameters for the released air volume that is the backwash interval is 90 min and the backwash duration is 60 s fig 6 shows the results of phased array monitoring with the increase of the backwash interval at 1 1 backwash strength and 60 s backwash duration the lateral distribution of the released air in the membrane module is shown in fig 6 a the air distribution is not uniform but rises slowly in a tortuous manner with increasing distance from the outlet which may be caused by the difference in pressure distribution in the membrane module during the filtration process the pressure near the outlet is the highest and as the distance gradually increases the pressure gradually weakens which makes it difficult for the air near the end of the membrane module to flow out with the filtrate fig 6 b shows the reflection intensity and tmp in the membrane module at 60 s backwash duration in the early stage of filtration the released air shows an increasing trend until the backwash interval reaches 90 min with the further increase of the backwash interval the released air decreased significantly at 90 150 min tmp shows similar trend with released air fig 6 c shows upa imaging of air water distribution in the membrane module the backwash interval causes differences in the distribution of released air through the generation migration and accumulation of released air in the initial stage of filtration there is only a small amount of air in the membrane module with the increase of backwash interval a relatively obvious reflection signal is generated in the upper and middle sections of the membrane module because the pressure in the middle and upper sections is much greater than that at the bottom which makes the air easier to release as the backwash interval was increased to 90 min the released air volume was minimized due to the increased backwash interval resulting in the expulsion of air with the further increase of the backwash interval on the one hand the air distribution of gradually moves away from the outlet and on the other hand the air volume away from the outlet gradually increases this is because the air at the outlet is discharged as the backwash interval increases but the air far from the outlet cannot be discharged in time and accumulates gradually the pressure distribution is the main reason for the release air in the membrane module 3 2 the correlation analysis between released air and air resistance the drastic change in pressure caused by backwash and filtration results in the release of air which in turn causes a reduction in filtration efficiency air resistance caused by released air has an adverse effect on the filtration process in the study δtmp pressure from backwash to filtration was used to represent the contribution effect of pressure change on air release δ tmp tm p filtration tm p backwash fig 7 a shows the relationship between pressure change from backwash to filtration and released air volume at constant flux δ tmp also showed an upward trend with the increase of backwash strength obviously the released air volume is proportional to δ tmp however when δ tmp increases to about 110 kpa the air content rises sharply while δ tmp does not increase significantly this is because too much air will produce an invalid signal which is more likely to happen when the released air volume is at a high level during the filtration process we monitored tmp due to changes in released air which were affected by different backwash intervals durations and strengths fig 7 b shows the correlation analysis of released air and tmp in the filtration process the released air in the membrane module has a positive correlation with tmp that is r 2 0 943 moreover when the backwash strength is 1 1 the pressure change caused by the two stages of backwash and filtration is small which makes the air released in the membrane module at a lower level when the backwash strength was increased to 2 1 and 3 1 the pressure change was significantly higher than that of 1 1 because the drastic change in pressure caused more air to be released but some of the air does not adhere to the inner wall of the membrane which causes the pressure to increase but the increase rate slows down obviously stronger backwash strength is more likely to cause an increase in released air further resulting in pressure increase during filtration however there are other factors involved such as membrane fouling and water quality so the fit degree needs to be optimized 3 3 strategies in overcoming released air in filtration the generation of air in the membrane module is mainly due to the released air caused by pressure changes during constant flow filtration the negative pressure causes the air to be released the pressure rises due to the presence of air which in turn is further released due to the increase in pressure this vicious circle makes air control difficult to achieve during filtration during the backwash process the membrane module is in a positive pressure state which provides favorable conditions for reducing the impact of released air 3 3 1 released air migration fig 8 shows the four states in the backwash process namely the air entrance dispersion and accumulation and redissolution during the filtration process the membrane module is in a negative pressure which provides conditions for released air fig 8 a is a schematic diagram of the air migration process the upa probe moves from top to bottom to monitor the air migration in the membrane module during the backwash process part of the released air will be reentered and as the backwash duration and strength increase the air dispersion accumulation and redissolution occur in sequence fig 8 b shows the imaging results of the four stages using upa the four stages may not exist independently and be accompanied by other stages fig 8 c shows the tmp under the four conditions of air entrance dispersion and accumulation and redissolution in the backwash process respectively in the initial stage of backwash 0 45 s the pressure in the membrane module changes greatly due to the exchange of roles of filtration and backwash which promotes the release of air in the filtrate the released air caused the tmp rise in backwash process obviously it is detrimental to the backwash efficiency in the second stage 45 60 s namely air dispersion with continuous backwash the released air at the upper end of the membrane module is gradually washed away which makes the air migrate with the backwash liquid this part of the migrated air fails to adhere to the inner wall of the membrane module which is beneficial to reduce backwash pressure in the air accumulation stage 60 90 s the long term backwash promotes the accumulation of the original dispersed air at the bottom of the membrane module increases the ineffective backwash at the bottom of the fiber which increases the backwash pressure however as the filtration time increases the originally dispersed air eventually gathers at the bottom causing the tmp to stabilize 90 115 s in the air redissolution stage the tmp suddenly dropped at 115 s indicating that the accumulated air has entered the redissolution stage the occurrence of air redissolution indicates that the influence of released air on the backwash process can be effectively slowed down by adjusting the backwash parameters 3 3 2 strategies to promote air redissolution according to the migration process of the released air in the membrane module the influence of released air can be mitigated by means of air dispersion and redissolution fig 9 a b show the tmp changes and corresponding upa imaging for examples of two stages namely a backwash interval 120 min backwash duration 150 s and backwash intensity 2 1 b backwash interval 90 min backwash duration 150 s and backwash intensity 1 1 compared with the state before the occurrence of two stages the tmp in the two stages of air dispersion and redissolution decreased by 9 31 and 8 05 respectively also air migration in both stages is clearly shown by upa imaging the both stages are in the positive pressure and according to henry s law the equilibrium dissolved amount of air in water is proportional to the dissolved air pressure air dispersion is to use backwash liquid to disperse the originally accumulated air and move with the backwash liquid during this time the released air cannot be attached to the membrane inner wall and then it is discharged through filtration moreover there is also a small amount of air dissolution at this stage which further helps to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the released air but its disadvantage is that it is not easy to control because the air dispersion stage is a process in which the air is in the backwash and the uncertainty of the occurrence time will be caused by the change of the backwash parameters compared with the air dispersion stage the air redissolution is more convenient to control since air redissolution is in the final stage of air migration and mostly occurs at the end of the fiber it is feasible to increase the air redissolution efficiency by adjusting the operating parameters however long term backwash is not conducive to the long term operation of the membrane module since the two stages occur at different times in the actual operation process it is necessary to monitor the initial operation to achieve the purpose of controlling the backwash time and making it in the air dispersion and air redissolution stages 4 conclusion in the study the distribution of released air in the hollow fiber membrane module was monitored by using upa in situ technology by adjusting the backwash interval backwash duration and backwash strength the released air distribution under different operating parameters was monitored the correlation between air resistance and released air volume was further analyzed and we also proposed a strategy that is useful to reduce the released air by exploring the air migration process the core results and conclusion are summarized as follows the application of upa technology realizes the extensive monitoring of hollow fiber membrane modules by c scan which helps to understand the distribution of released air and its adverse effects the released air is mainly distributed far away from the outlet and as the backwash strength increases the distribution of the released air gradually diffuses from the lower right of the low backwash strength to the upper right and further diffuses to the entire membrane module the released air has an obvious relationship with backwash interval duration and strength the result shows that when the backwash strength is 1 1 the backwash duration is 60 s and the backwash interval is 90 min the released air volume is at the lowest level the air resistance has a good positive correlation with released air volume indicating that the presence of released air has an adverse effect on the filtration and backwash process the air migration in the backwash process includes four situations air entrance dispersion accumulation and redissolution air dispersion and redissolution can effectively reduce air resistance the mature application of upa technology in other fields and its advantages as shown in the study have laid the foundation for its application in the field of membranes besides in the application process of upa technology it is necessary to consider the influence of the operating environment such as the structure of the membrane reactor the water quality environment etc these factors will have special requirements on upa technology such as probe structure transmit and receive frequencies and the number of array elements therefore upa technology in the membrane field still needs to be paid more attention declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no financial and personal

fiber membrane due to the pressure drop across the membrane cui et al 2017 also investigated the effect of released air in membrane backwash system by exploring the effective backwash length it was found that it was more prone for longer 1 5 and 1 8 m fibers to have the air accumulated in the most distant membrane lumen while shorter 0 6 0 9 and 1 2 m membrane fibers are not conducive to the release and air accumulation as it requires higher backwash pressure which would be much higher than the backwash pressure in actual operation process however previous studies are based on small membrane modules or the monitoring method is not suitable for pilot or industrial membrane modules which makes it difficult to further explain the influence of the air resistance caused by released air in practical applications air resistance will have a negative impact on the delivery efficiency or cause damage to the pipeline and pump and even cause the pipeline to rupture similarly air resistance in the membrane module will also have an adverse effect on the membrane filtration and backwash process therefore it is of great significance for optimizing the membrane process to explore the distribution of released air and its influence by discovering a new in situ monitoring method traditional monitoring technologies such as direct observation do technology marselina et al 2009 ye et al 2011 optical coherence tomography oct gao et al 2014 and magnetic resonance imaging mri simkins et al 2020 are unable or difficult to operate and monitor the air and water distribution in the membrane module ultrasonics technology especially ultrasonic time domain reflectometry utdr li et al 2014 2012 has been used to monitor the hollow fiber membranes fouling because it can easily and quickly obtain the fouling information however because utdr adopts more single point monitoring methods it is difficult to apply to pilot or industrial membrane modules as a mature technology kim et al 2020 latête et al 2021 xie et al 2021 upa technology has been applied in industrial non destructive testing especially in areas including medical nuclear power and materials evaluation because the ultrasonic beam can be steered and focused without the need to reconfigure the ultrasonic probes feng and qian 2020 scalea et al 2005 compared with the single point monitoring of the traditional ultrasonic technology the beam emitted by the upa probe can be focused and electronically scanned regionally without moving the probe which is fast and flexible and the error of monitoring information in time and space caused by moving the probe would be also reduced moreover because the ultrasonic signal reflects strongly on the air water interface it is easy to identify the state of the air water two phase in the hollow fiber membrane which makes it possible to use upa technology for in situ monitoring therefore in the study we applied upa technology to in situ monitoring of released air distribution in the outside in membrane process for the first time we firstly investigated the distribution of released air in the filtration process under different operation parameters backwash interval duration and strength and found an optimal operation parameter besides the correlation between released air volume and air resistance tmp was further explored in addition we investigated the air migration process in the backwash process and based on this we proposed a strategy to reduce the released air in the membrane module to achieve the optimization of the filtration and backwash process 2 methods and materials 2 1 formation of air resistance according to the momentum equation bernoulli equation and euler continuity equation as shown in fig 1 a when the fluid passes through the membrane pore the velocity and pressure of the fluid will change due to the stable flow field from the outside entering the narrow pores the velocity would increase at the membrane pore and part of the static pressure is converted into dynamic pressure resulting in a pressure drop on both sides of the membrane v 1 v 2 v 0 p 0 p 2 p 1 where v 0 and p 0 are the fluid velocity and pressure outside the membrane pores v 1 and p 1 are the fluid velocity and pressure in the membrane pores v 2 and p 2 are the fluid velocity and pressure in the membrane cavity respectively after the fluid passes through the membrane pores the partial pressure is lower than the corresponding saturated vapor pressure of the liquid at this time vapor and dissolved air in the fluid will escape in the form of air forming tiny bubbles this part of the air may adhere to the inner cavity of the membrane or be discharged with the flow of the filtrate fig 1 b shows the movement of air in the two processes of filtration and backwash filtrate can take away part of the released air but there will still be some attached to the membrane cavity and cannot be eliminated this is due to upward force generated by the flow of filtrate is less than the adhesion force of the bubble the transition from filtration to backwash will promote the released air accumulation and dissolution the air resistance due to the released air will reduce the local flux of the membrane causing the increase of tmp 2 2 the theory of ultrasound at the air water interface when there is no sound wave propagating in the air the pressure is the atmospheric pressure p 0 when there is a sound wave propagating in it the pressure of each point will be higher than p 0 in half a cycle and lower than p 0 in the other half cycle for pure tones the pressure varies as a sinusoidal wave the difference between the instantaneous value of pressure and the average pressure p 0 is called sound pressure the calculation results show that the sound pressure amplitude p is determined by the following equation 1 p a ω ρ c where a represents the amplitude ω represents the angular frequency of the vibration ρ represents the density of the medium and c represents the speed of the sound wave in the medium and because the amplitude of the vibration velocity of the medium particle is 2 v a ω divide eqs 1 and 2 3 ρ c z z is called the acoustic impedance of the medium acoustic impedance is an important physical quantity that describes the acoustic properties of the medium it depends on the density of the medium and the sound speed and the sound speed is only related to the nature of the medium at a certain temperature it can be concluded that the acoustic impedance is mainly determined by the medium when the ultrasonic wave enters the interface perpendicularly a reflected wave opposite to the incident direction and a transmitted wave in the same direction as the incident wave are generated the waveform does not change the subscripts i r and t are used to represent incidence reflection and refraction respectively when the sound waves are transmitted vertically the sound waves on both sides of the medium must meet two boundary conditions i the total sound pressure on one side is equal to the total sound pressure on the other side p i p r p t ii the particle velocity amplitudes on both sides are equal to maintain continuity v i v r v t 4 p i z 1 v i 5 p t z 2 v t 6 p r z 1 v r sound pressure reflection r can be got 7 p r p i z 2 z 1 z 2 z 1 r in the study when the ultrasonic wave is transmitted at the air water interface the interface sound pressure reflection r air water is 8 r air water z air z water z air z water where z air 0 0004 10 6 kg m 2 s z water 1 5 10 6 kg m 2 s r air water can be calculated 9 r air water 1 the result shows that at the air water interface ultrasonic wave will be totally reflected the results of a single upa scan can obtain n collection points then the average reflection of the air r air in the membrane module is 10 r air i 1 n p ri p i n 12 i 1 n x i 255 n 12 where x i and 255 are the output and input of upa image acquisition respectively and the total number of scans is 12 based on the theory upa technology can achieve the in suit monitoring of the distribution of air and water in the hollow fiber membrane module 2 3 the principal of upa technology the traditional ultrasonic single element probe as shown in fig 2 a realizes the transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves through a single ultrasonic array element due to the limitation of the number of array elements it is only suitable for the acquisition of single point information which limits the widespread use of single element probes compared with single element probe upa systems are relatively more complex the schematic diagram of ultrasonic pulse transmission and echo reception of upa is shown in fig 2 b the excitation module transmits a trigger signal of a certain amplitude to the delayer and calculates the delay time of the sound beam emission of each array element according to the emission focus law and integrates the pulse width of the trigger signal and the integrated pulse signal is loaded into each array element due to the delay the phases of the sound beams emitted by each array element are not the same and the sound beams are superimposed in space to form an incident wave front and focus at a certain distance to detect air water interface in the hollow fiber membrane the sound beam emitted by the array element will be reflected back when encountering the interface and the interface in the focus area will form a reflected wave front with larger amplitude due to the different spatial positions of the array elements of the probe the time for the reflected echo of the defect to reach each element will also be different the delayer calculates the receiving delay of each array element according to the receiving focus law superimposes the echo signal of each array element in turn and feeds it back to the signal receiving module 2 4 experiment instruments a lab scale hollow fiber membrane setup dimension of 0 73 0 1 1 3 m length width height is shown in fig 3 a b the pristine polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fiber membrane was provided by tianjin cnclear environmental protection technology co ltd the dimensions of these membranes were provided as follows pore size 0 22 µm the outer inner diameter 2000 1000 µm the membrane module is 0 5 m long and 0 5 m wide including 100 hollow fiber membranes with 0 1 m2 effective area of and 100 m2 m2 packing density two diaphragm pumps dy ssp075 a deng yuan water filtration machine co ltd china controlled the filtration and backwash processes separately the upa system cts pa322t guangdong shantou ultrasonic electronics co ltd china was used to receive the information obtained from the movement of the scanner and the probe on the membrane surface the scanner and the probe move synchronously to ensure the consistency of the obtained image and the position of the membrane surface the experiment was carried out under the conditions of atmospheric pressure of 101 325 kpa and water temperature of 20 2 c and the main air contents are oxygen and nitrogen which can be calculated to be 8 84 mg l and 6 83 mg l respectively the water characterization is shown in table 1 the main steps are as follows first the membrane module was immersed in deionized water for 24 h and subjected to several filtration and backwash cycles to ensure that the membrane module was fully wetted then the membrane module was immersed in tap water during the experiment the filtration process maintained a constant flux of 120 lmh and the filtration times backwash interval were 30 min 60 min 90 min 120 min and 150 min respectively the variation of tmp during the operation was recorded at the same time since the backwash process will affect the released air volume and migration we further set the backwash process and parameters according to previous studies the backwash durations were 30 s 60 s 90 s 120 s and 150 s and the backwash strengths backwash flux permeate flux were 1 1 2 1 and 3 1 respectively adjust filtration and backwash parameters and use upa to monitor the distribution of released air in membrane module as shown in fig 3 c the probe scanned the membrane modules in a top down manner where the membrane modules are equally divided into 12 groups and each scan width is 10 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of operating parameters on the released air distribution regarding operating conditions the parameters during filtration and backwash are significantly related to the filtration performance in order to explore the performance of released air we focused on some key parameters including the backwash interval backwash duration and backwash strength the backwash strength can be expressed as the ratio of the backwash flux to permeate flux jbw jfl under constant flux chang et al 2017 based on the backwash strength of 1 1 the backwash flux is 120 lmh the permeation flux is 120 lmh we have further enhanced it to 2 1 the backwash flux is 240 lmh and the permeation flux is 120 lmh and 3 1 backwash flux is 360 lmh permeation flux is 120 lmh as shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 b with the enhancement of backwash strength the volume of released air has increased significantly the distribution of the released air gradually spreads from the lower right to the upper right of the membrane module and further to the entire membrane module with backwash strength increasing this is because on the one hand the increase in backwash strength increases the pressure difference between filtration and backwash thereby promoting the increase of released air in the filtrate on the other hand the released air whether it is the air reintroduced by the backwash or the air bubbles originally adhering to the inner wall of the membrane is subjected to greater pressure making it easier to migrate with the filtrate the generation and adhesion of the released air in the membrane module leads to air resistance which reduces the filtration efficiency and further adversely affects the backwash process on the one hand excessive backwash strength cannot bring higher backwash efficiency on the other hand it will also cause the increase of released air which is not what we want however by monitoring the released air in the membrane module it can be found that there are some operating parameters that make there is no obvious released air in the membrane module such as 60 s backwash duration at low backwash strength 1 1 fig 5 further showed released air under different backwash duration and backwash interval at 1 1 backwash strength in the filtration process obviously as the backwash interval increases it helps to reduce the volume of released air as a whole the reason may be that continuous filtration makes the inside of the membrane module in a long term negative pressure which promotes the release of air as the backwash interval increases more air is released and the air volume increases which increases the possibility that air will escape with the filtrate moreover different combinations of backwash interval and backwash duration result in different released air clearly the results show that there are optimal operating parameters for the released air volume that is the backwash interval is 90 min and the backwash duration is 60 s fig 6 shows the results of phased array monitoring with the increase of the backwash interval at 1 1 backwash strength and 60 s backwash duration the lateral distribution of the released air in the membrane module is shown in fig 6 a the air distribution is not uniform but rises slowly in a tortuous manner with increasing distance from the outlet which may be caused by the difference in pressure distribution in the membrane module during the filtration process the pressure near the outlet is the highest and as the distance gradually increases the pressure gradually weakens which makes it difficult for the air near the end of the membrane module to flow out with the filtrate fig 6 b shows the reflection intensity and tmp in the membrane module at 60 s backwash duration in the early stage of filtration the released air shows an increasing trend until the backwash interval reaches 90 min with the further increase of the backwash interval the released air decreased significantly at 90 150 min tmp shows similar trend with released air fig 6 c shows upa imaging of air water distribution in the membrane module the backwash interval causes differences in the distribution of released air through the generation migration and accumulation of released air in the initial stage of filtration there is only a small amount of air in the membrane module with the increase of backwash interval a relatively obvious reflection signal is generated in the upper and middle sections of the membrane module because the pressure in the middle and upper sections is much greater than that at the bottom which makes the air easier to release as the backwash interval was increased to 90 min the released air volume was minimized due to the increased backwash interval resulting in the expulsion of air with the further increase of the backwash interval on the one hand the air distribution of gradually moves away from the outlet and on the other hand the air volume away from the outlet gradually increases this is because the air at the outlet is discharged as the backwash interval increases but the air far from the outlet cannot be discharged in time and accumulates gradually the pressure distribution is the main reason for the release air in the membrane module 3 2 the correlation analysis between released air and air resistance the drastic change in pressure caused by backwash and filtration results in the release of air which in turn causes a reduction in filtration efficiency air resistance caused by released air has an adverse effect on the filtration process in the study δtmp pressure from backwash to filtration was used to represent the contribution effect of pressure change on air release δ tmp tm p filtration tm p backwash fig 7 a shows the relationship between pressure change from backwash to filtration and released air volume at constant flux δ tmp also showed an upward trend with the increase of backwash strength obviously the released air volume is proportional to δ tmp however when δ tmp increases to about 110 kpa the air content rises sharply while δ tmp does not increase significantly this is because too much air will produce an invalid signal which is more likely to happen when the released air volume is at a high level during the filtration process we monitored tmp due to changes in released air which were affected by different backwash intervals durations and strengths fig 7 b shows the correlation analysis of released air and tmp in the filtration process the released air in the membrane module has a positive correlation with tmp that is r 2 0 943 moreover when the backwash strength is 1 1 the pressure change caused by the two stages of backwash and filtration is small which makes the air released in the membrane module at a lower level when the backwash strength was increased to 2 1 and 3 1 the pressure change was significantly higher than that of 1 1 because the drastic change in pressure caused more air to be released but some of the air does not adhere to the inner wall of the membrane which causes the pressure to increase but the increase rate slows down obviously stronger backwash strength is more likely to cause an increase in released air further resulting in pressure increase during filtration however there are other factors involved such as membrane fouling and water quality so the fit degree needs to be optimized 3 3 strategies in overcoming released air in filtration the generation of air in the membrane module is mainly due to the released air caused by pressure changes during constant flow filtration the negative pressure causes the air to be released the pressure rises due to the presence of air which in turn is further released due to the increase in pressure this vicious circle makes air control difficult to achieve during filtration during the backwash process the membrane module is in a positive pressure state which provides favorable conditions for reducing the impact of released air 3 3 1 released air migration fig 8 shows the four states in the backwash process namely the air entrance dispersion and accumulation and redissolution during the filtration process the membrane module is in a negative pressure which provides conditions for released air fig 8 a is a schematic diagram of the air migration process the upa probe moves from top to bottom to monitor the air migration in the membrane module during the backwash process part of the released air will be reentered and as the backwash duration and strength increase the air dispersion accumulation and redissolution occur in sequence fig 8 b shows the imaging results of the four stages using upa the four stages may not exist independently and be accompanied by other stages fig 8 c shows the tmp under the four conditions of air entrance dispersion and accumulation and redissolution in the backwash process respectively in the initial stage of backwash 0 45 s the pressure in the membrane module changes greatly due to the exchange of roles of filtration and backwash which promotes the release of air in the filtrate the released air caused the tmp rise in backwash process obviously it is detrimental to the backwash efficiency in the second stage 45 60 s namely air dispersion with continuous backwash the released air at the upper end of the membrane module is gradually washed away which makes the air migrate with the backwash liquid this part of the migrated air fails to adhere to the inner wall of the membrane module which is beneficial to reduce backwash pressure in the air accumulation stage 60 90 s the long term backwash promotes the accumulation of the original dispersed air at the bottom of the membrane module increases the ineffective backwash at the bottom of the fiber which increases the backwash pressure however as the filtration time increases the originally dispersed air eventually gathers at the bottom causing the tmp to stabilize 90 115 s in the air redissolution stage the tmp suddenly dropped at 115 s indicating that the accumulated air has entered the redissolution stage the occurrence of air redissolution indicates that the influence of released air on the backwash process can be effectively slowed down by adjusting the backwash parameters 3 3 2 strategies to promote air redissolution according to the migration process of the released air in the membrane module the influence of released air can be mitigated by means of air dispersion and redissolution fig 9 a b show the tmp changes and corresponding upa imaging for examples of two stages namely a backwash interval 120 min backwash duration 150 s and backwash intensity 2 1 b backwash interval 90 min backwash duration 150 s and backwash intensity 1 1 compared with the state before the occurrence of two stages the tmp in the two stages of air dispersion and redissolution decreased by 9 31 and 8 05 respectively also air migration in both stages is clearly shown by upa imaging the both stages are in the positive pressure and according to henry s law the equilibrium dissolved amount of air in water is proportional to the dissolved air pressure air dispersion is to use backwash liquid to disperse the originally accumulated air and move with the backwash liquid during this time the released air cannot be attached to the membrane inner wall and then it is discharged through filtration moreover there is also a small amount of air dissolution at this stage which further helps to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the released air but its disadvantage is that it is not easy to control because the air dispersion stage is a process in which the air is in the backwash and the uncertainty of the occurrence time will be caused by the change of the backwash parameters compared with the air dispersion stage the air redissolution is more convenient to control since air redissolution is in the final stage of air migration and mostly occurs at the end of the fiber it is feasible to increase the air redissolution efficiency by adjusting the operating parameters however long term backwash is not conducive to the long term operation of the membrane module since the two stages occur at different times in the actual operation process it is necessary to monitor the initial operation to achieve the purpose of controlling the backwash time and making it in the air dispersion and air redissolution stages 4 conclusion in the study the distribution of released air in the hollow fiber membrane module was monitored by using upa in situ technology by adjusting the backwash interval backwash duration and backwash strength the released air distribution under different operating parameters was monitored the correlation between air resistance and released air volume was further analyzed and we also proposed a strategy that is useful to reduce the released air by exploring the air migration process the core results and conclusion are summarized as follows the application of upa technology realizes the extensive monitoring of hollow fiber membrane modules by c scan which helps to understand the distribution of released air and its adverse effects the released air is mainly distributed far away from the outlet and as the backwash strength increases the distribution of the released air gradually diffuses from the lower right of the low backwash strength to the upper right and further diffuses to the entire membrane module the released air has an obvious relationship with backwash interval duration and strength the result shows that when the backwash strength is 1 1 the backwash duration is 60 s and the backwash interval is 90 min the released air volume is at the lowest level the air resistance has a good positive correlation with released air volume indicating that the presence of released air has an adverse effect on the filtration and backwash process the air migration in the backwash process includes four situations air entrance dispersion accumulation and redissolution air dispersion and redissolution can effectively reduce air resistance the mature application of upa technology in other fields and its advantages as shown in the study have laid the foundation for its application in the field of membranes besides in the application process of upa technology it is necessary to consider the influence of the operating environment such as the structure of the membrane reactor the water quality environment etc these factors will have special requirements on upa technology such as probe structure transmit and receive frequencies and the number of array elements therefore upa technology in the membrane field still needs to be paid more attention declaration of competing interest we declare that we have no financial and personal

introduction humans depend on ocean ecosystems for important and valuable goods and services but they have increasingly altered the oceans through direct and indirect means halpern et al 2008 halpern et al 2012 virdin et al 2021 land based activities contribute to the riverine runoff of pollutants such as heavy metals and pesticides hmps into coastal waters halpern et al 2008 köhler and triebskorn 2013 dong et al 2016 karimian et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 elevated levels of inorganic and organic pollutants such as hmps co exist in aquatic ecosystems resulting in a combined toxicity to aquatic biota however there is no information on the combined toxicity of inorganic and organic pollutants in aquatic biota in natural aquatic ecosystems therefore in this study hmps were combined as double pollutants to evaluate the combined risk of inorganic and organic pollutants in selected aquatic biota hmps are of global concern to both the scientific and general communities due to their toxicity persistence and irreversibility jaishankar et al 2014 gu et al 2022 hojjati najafabadi et al 2022a hojjati najafabadi et al 2022b un 2022 zhang et al 2022 whenever hmps enter the coastal ecosystem they are incorporated into complexes and ultimately accumulate in sediments gu et al 2012 gu and gao 2019 ouyang et al 2020 when the aquatic environmental conditions change e g ph redox etc the hmps stored in the sediments can be released back into the waterbody which may adversely affect the aquatic ecosystems and harm human health via the food chain gu and gao 2019 cui et al 2020 miranda et al 2021 rao et al 2022 nevertheless no study to date has been performed on the integrated toxic effects resulting from hmp mixtures on the aquatic biota of the entire aquatic ecosystem and particularly within the sediments as a sink of hmps the combined risk assessment of hmps to the aquatic biota is crucial for aquatic ecosystem management in order to make this risk assessment realistic to the natural aquatic condition knowing how to acquire bioavailable concentrations of hmps is a key step it is well recognized that traditional methods involving sediment total pollutant concentrations sequential extraction and simultaneously extracted metals sem acid volatile sulfide avs models cannot predict very precisely the bioavailability of inorganic organic pollutants in sediments amato et al 2014 gu et al 2020 gu 2021 in this sense more effective methods are in urgent demand recent years have witnessed the development of the passive sampling technique namely diffusive gradients in thin films dgt in measuring unstable concentrations types and distribution of solutes in soils sediments and water and this technique can be utilized to evaluate the bioavailability of inorganic organic pollutants zhang and davison 1995 zhang and davison 2015 chen et al 2018 gu et al 2020 therefore dgt plays an increasingly important role in the prediction of the toxicity and bioavailability of inorganic organic pollutants to the benthos zhang and davison 2015 gao et al 2020 over the past 20 years china has consistently produced more than 56 of the world s aquaculture products naylor et al 2021 as such it can be said that china plays a vital role in guiding the development of global aquatic culture furthermore china is also the world s largest consumer and exporter of fishery products the production environment directly affects the quality of chinese aquatic products and therefore has a major impact on consumer safety worldwide and needs to be closely monitored guangdong is an economically developed province and also the largest aquaculture area in china zhelin bay alone covers an area of about 70 square kilometers and is the largest area in the eastern part of the province fig 1 a marine aquaculture in zhelin bay has contributed a lot to the development of the local economy but it has also led to the rapid decline of the aquatic ecosystem in recent years gu 2018 previous studies have shown that the bay s sediments have been polluted by hmps polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and nutrients zhu et al 2005 gu et al 2014 gu et al 2016 gu and lin 2016 wei et al 2016 gu et al 2017 accordingly zhelin bay was selected as the case study site to assess the combined toxicity of hmps to the aquatic biota in the sediments an extensive literature review revealed that there have been no previous studies on the integrated toxicity of hmp mixtures in sediments using the dgt technique therefore the present study aims to 1 assess the concentrations of hmps in the surface sediments of zhelin bay through dgt 2 depict the distributions of hmps and 3 evaluate the risk of hmps and their mixtures in the hope that such a study can provide a new and extensive approach for assessing the risk of hmps in sediments 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and analysis of sediment characteristics in september 2021 surface sediment samples were obtained using a

more precisely three sequential steps 1 sediment preparation 2 dgt deployment and 3 dgt retrieval step 1 about 150 g of thawed sediment sample were weighed and placed in a 250 ml plastic beaker and then fully mixed next plastic plates were used to cover the above fully stirred sediments to minimize evaporation and to incubate them at 25 c for a whole day step 2 the dgt device was incubated at 25

relatively small risk while an rq value higher than 1 indicates a potential ecological risk and that the environmental risk posed should not be neglected gu 2021 lu et al 2022 a larger value indicates a greater potential risk gu et al 2020 2 4 2 hmp mixture risk assessment prior to establishing the risk of hmp mixtures the risk probability of a single hmp to aquatic biota was calculated based on the probabilistic risk assessment pra procedure gu et al 2022 usepa 2001 following this the eighteen single hmp risk probabilities were used to calculate the combined risk of hmp mixtures to aquatic biota based on the addition of probabilities gu et al 2020 steen et al 1999 as shown in eq 5 4 φ a 1 a 2 a n i 1 n φ a i i 1 i 2 φ a i 1 a i 2 1 r 1 i 1 i 2 i r φ a i 1 a i 2 a i r 1 n 1 φ a 1 a 2 a n

were performed using the spss v19 0 software package for windows the overlap areas between exposure data and toxicity data and nonmetric multidimensional scaling nms were calculated using the mass and vegan packages in r v 4 1 2 software respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 general sediment characteristics contents of om and caco3 and median grain size mz were measured to obtain the general characteristics of sediments in this study these are shown in fig 1b c the om content varied from 2 45 to 18 70 with a mean of 9 47 and the caco3 content was between 0 68 and 4 99 of the dry sediment weight with a mean of 2 73 the mz ranged between 5 48 and 9 65 phi φ with an average of 6 97 φ the om and grain size are thought to be the two crucial controlling factors that alter the natural metal content in sediments gu 2021 zhou et al 2020 in addition caco3 plays a role in influencing natural metal distribution gu 2018 sediment with a smaller grain diameter is prone to present relatively high metal contents due in part to the specific surface area this enrichment is primarily ascribed to surface adsorption and ionic attraction gu 2021 meanwhile om is frequently found on particles in smaller sediments and the biofilm binds a range of pollutants gu 2021 chen et al 2019 the unitary linear regression relationships between mz and om and caco3 are shown in fig 2 a c the om content increases with an increase of caco3 value fig 2a implying that the om and caco3 may reflect environmental behavior there are no unitary linear regression relationships between om and mz and mz and caco3 indicating that the om and mz and mz and caco3 may not be related to environmental behavior fig 2b and c 3 2 dgt labile concentrations of hmps the spatial distributions and concentrations of the studied metals in surface sediments using the dgt technique are shown in fig 3 a and table s4 the dgt labile concentrations of mehg atr cmz lin pir and thi were less than their corresponding detection

al 2022 the mean concentrations of mn co ni cu zn cd and pb were lower than the intertidal zone of the pearl river estuary china gu 2021 the highest values of v and ni were found at site z15 the highest values of cr and cu were located at site z14 the highest values of mn and as were detected at site z12 the highest values of co zn cd and pb were found at site z4 the highest values of se inhg mo w sb w clp diu and pyr were located at site z8 site z6 site z1 site z19 site z11 site z7 site z20 and site z2 respectively these results may be attributed to anthropogenic and natural influences in order to identify possible relationships between sediment property parameters and dgt labile metals nms was performed on the data with two groups found to represent 93 85 of the total variance in addition stress was implemented to examine the validity of the nms before interpreting the results the stress value was 3 83e 04 indicating an excellent dimensionality reduction lattin et al 2003 the variables were clearly separated into two groups by nms ordination fig 2d the nms1 was associated with v cr ni cu zn as se inhg mo cd sb w pb clp pyr nms1 90 87 of the total variance indicating that general sediment characteristics mainly influence these hmps nms2 was associated with co diu and mn nms2 2 98 of the total variance suggesting that no sediment property parameter influences the heavy metals 3 3 risks of hmps fig 3b and table s5 demonstrate each rq for heavy metals and pesticides in surface sediments of zhelin bay the ranked order for average rq values was as follows mn inhg diu cu clp mo zn pyr as sb pb v ni se cr co cd w the rq values of mn at all sites and cu inhg clp and diu at most sites exceeded 1 in terms of the one sample t test p 0 05 indicating the occurrence of ecological adverse effects and the heavy metal and pesticide mixture presents an ecological risk the rq values of the twelve remaining heavy metals and pesticides at all sites were less than the threshold value of 1 indicating the individual heavy metals and pesticides did not significantly present an ecological risk overall these results suggest that the ecotoxicological risk should not be ignored in the study area because the rq values for some heavy metals and pesticides at all most sites are higher than the threshold value of 1 fig 3b accordingly further studies are urgently needed according to current directives 3 4 risks of hmps mixtures in order to evaluate the integrated hmp biological effects the dgt labile concentration coupled with toxicity data species sensitivity distribution ssd was conducted to evaluate hmp probabilistic ecotoxicological risk gu et al 2020 tang et al 2021 by employing the k s test method the distribution of data for exposure concentrations and toxicological effects on sensitive species were tested and the results indicated that the transformed data for exposure and toxicity exhibited normal distributions p 0 05 table 2 the mean standard deviation sd and k s test results for fifteen heavy metals and three pesticides are shown in table 2 furthermore the transformed normal probability distribution curves for risk analysis were constructed with the means and standard deviations sds of exposure and toxic data for fifteen heavy metals and three pesticides fig 3 the overlap area was calculated between the exposure single hmp data distribution and the corresponding toxicity single hmp data distribution fig 3 results indicate that each hmp had less than 26 probability of toxic effects respectively in terms of the addition of probabilities gu 2021 steen et al 1999 the toxic effect probabilities of hmps were utilized to estimate the integral risk of hmp mixtures indicating that surface sediments of zhelin bay presented a 54 59 probability of having an integral toxic effect on aquatic organisms 4 conclusion for the first time we established the combined toxicity method of hmp mixtures for aquatic biota in sediments this novel method consists of three steps in the first step the bioaccessible dgt labile concentrations of hmps were obtained using the dgt technique in the second step the pra approach considering individual hmp toxicity to three different trophic level aquatic groups was established based on the ssd method and dgt labile concentrations in the last step the assessment combined toxicity of hmps was calculated based on the addition of probabilities coupled with the pra approach zhelin bay the largest mariculture base on the eastern guangdong coast of south china was chosen as a case study site the pra results show that inhg clp and mn present a 25 1 16 5 and 15 5 biological risk to the aquatic biota ranking as the first second and third most significant level of risk the results of this new method reveal that the surface sediments of zhelin bay had a 54 6 probability of inducing a toxic effect on aquatic organisms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

introduction humans depend on ocean ecosystems for important and valuable goods and services but they have increasingly altered the oceans through direct and indirect means halpern et al 2008 halpern et al 2012 virdin et al 2021 land based activities contribute to the riverine runoff of pollutants such as heavy metals and pesticides hmps into coastal waters halpern et al 2008 köhler and triebskorn 2013 dong et al 2016 karimian et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 elevated levels of inorganic and organic pollutants such as hmps co exist in aquatic ecosystems resulting in a combined toxicity to aquatic biota however there is no information on the combined toxicity of inorganic and organic pollutants in aquatic biota in natural aquatic ecosystems therefore in this study hmps were combined as double pollutants to evaluate the combined risk of inorganic and organic pollutants in selected aquatic biota hmps are of global concern to both the scientific and general communities due to their toxicity persistence and irreversibility jaishankar et al 2014 gu et al 2022 hojjati najafabadi et al 2022a hojjati najafabadi et al 2022b un 2022 zhang et al 2022 whenever hmps enter the coastal ecosystem they are incorporated into complexes and ultimately accumulate in sediments gu et al 2012 gu and gao 2019 ouyang et al 2020 when the aquatic environmental conditions change e g ph redox etc the hmps stored in the sediments can be released back into the waterbody which may adversely affect the aquatic ecosystems and harm human health via the food chain gu and gao 2019 cui et al 2020 miranda et al 2021 rao et al 2022 nevertheless no study to date has been performed on the integrated toxic effects resulting from hmp mixtures on the aquatic biota of the entire aquatic ecosystem and particularly within the sediments as a sink of hmps the combined risk assessment of hmps to the aquatic biota is crucial for aquatic ecosystem management in order to make this risk assessment realistic to the natural aquatic condition knowing how to acquire bioavailable concentrations of hmps is a key step it is well recognized that traditional methods involving sediment total pollutant concentrations sequential extraction and simultaneously extracted metals sem acid volatile sulfide avs models cannot predict very precisely the bioavailability of inorganic organic pollutants in sediments amato et al 2014 gu et al 2020 gu 2021 in this sense more effective methods are in urgent demand recent years have witnessed the development of the passive sampling technique namely diffusive gradients in thin films dgt in measuring unstable concentrations types and distribution of solutes in soils sediments and water and this technique can be utilized to evaluate the bioavailability of inorganic organic pollutants zhang and davison 1995 zhang and davison 2015 chen et al 2018 gu et al 2020 therefore dgt plays an increasingly important role in the prediction of the toxicity and bioavailability of inorganic organic pollutants to the benthos zhang and davison 2015 gao et al 2020 over the past 20 years china has consistently produced more than 56 of the world s aquaculture products naylor et al 2021 as such it can be said that china plays a vital role in guiding the development of global aquatic culture furthermore china is also the world s largest consumer and exporter of fishery products the production environment directly affects the quality of chinese aquatic products and therefore has a major impact on consumer safety worldwide and needs to be closely monitored guangdong is an economically developed province and also the largest aquaculture area in china zhelin bay alone covers an area of about 70 square kilometers and is the largest area in the eastern part of the province fig 1 a marine aquaculture in zhelin bay has contributed a lot to the development of the local economy but it has also led to the rapid decline of the aquatic ecosystem in recent years gu 2018 previous studies have shown that the bay s sediments have been polluted by hmps polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and nutrients zhu et al 2005 gu et al 2014 gu et al 2016 gu and lin 2016 wei et al 2016 gu et al 2017 accordingly zhelin bay was selected as the case study site to assess the combined toxicity of hmps to the aquatic biota in the sediments an extensive literature review revealed that there have been no previous studies on the integrated toxicity of hmp mixtures in sediments using the dgt technique therefore the present study aims to 1 assess the concentrations of hmps in the surface sediments of zhelin bay through dgt 2 depict the distributions of hmps and 3 evaluate the risk of hmps and their mixtures in the hope that such a study can provide a new and extensive approach for assessing the risk of hmps in sediments 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and analysis of sediment characteristics in september 2021 surface sediment samples were obtained using a stainless steel peterson grab sampler from twenty four sites in zhelin bay fig 1a the samples were collected with a plastic spatula and put into prepared polyethylene bags and placed in an ice cooler

analyzed caco3 and om were determined by the loss on ignition method gu et al 2018 gu 2021 the particles were pretreated in accordance with china national standards gb t12763 8 2007 and the granulometry of the sediment samples was measured using a malvern mastersizer 2000 laser diffractometer 2 2 dgt experiment 2 2 1 dgt deployment for heavy metals the dgt procedures for inorganic hg

dgt probe and then bathed and incubated in water at a temperature of 25 c for three weeks afterwards the dgt probe was inserted into the sediment sample vertically and then taken out after 24 h a cutter featuring stacked ceramic blades was used to slice the binding gel into 4 0 mm pieces which were eluted separately with a solution of 10 ml subsequently the eluents were combined to calculate the concentrations of mehg and inhg via cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry cv afs the dgt procedures for v cr mn co ni cu zn as se mo cd sb w and pb were also undertaken in accordance with the methods established by easysensor ltd nanjing china wang et al 2019 briefly a dual mode dgt holder with an exposure window of 2 cm in diameter was conducted in solution experiments ding et al 2016 a new flat type dgt holder was used in the sediment test the sediment sample was put on the new flat type dgt holder with zro ca binding gel for 24 h afterwards a cutter featuring stacked ceramic

more precisely three sequential steps 1 sediment preparation 2 dgt deployment and 3 dgt retrieval step 1 about 150 g of thawed sediment sample were weighed and placed in a 250 ml plastic beaker and then fully mixed next plastic plates were used to cover the above fully stirred sediments to minimize evaporation and to incubate them at 25 c for a whole day step 2 the dgt device was incubated at 25 c for 4 h a thin layer of the sediment was smeared onto the dgt filter surface using a clean spatula the dgt device was gently pressed onto the sediment surface and then a twisting motion was used to ensure there was a good contact between the dgt front membrane and the sediment the devices and sediments were covered loosely with a clean plastic plate to prevent evaporation and incubated at 25 c for 96 h step 3 after the dgt device was retrieved from the deployment environment it was thoroughly rinsed with ultrapure water the cap of the dgt device was broken using a screwdriver the broken cap was pulled off and the filter and diffusive gel layer were peeled off to reveal the binding gel layer at the bottom the resin gel was transferred to a 20 ml clean amber glass vial 10 ml methanol was

addition stress was implemented to examine the validity of the nms before interpreting the results the stress value was 3 83e 04 indicating an excellent dimensionality reduction lattin et al 2003 the variables were clearly separated into two groups by nms ordination fig 2d the nms1 was associated with v cr ni cu zn as se inhg mo cd sb w pb clp pyr nms1 90 87 of the total variance indicating that general sediment characteristics mainly influence these hmps nms2 was associated with co diu and mn nms2 2 98 of the total variance suggesting that no sediment property parameter influences the heavy metals 3 3 risks of hmps fig 3b and table s5 demonstrate each rq for heavy metals and pesticides in surface sediments of zhelin bay the ranked order for average rq values was as follows mn inhg diu cu clp mo zn pyr as sb pb v ni se cr co cd w the rq values of mn at all sites and cu inhg clp and diu at most sites exceeded 1 in terms of the one sample t test p 0 05 indicating the occurrence of ecological adverse effects and the heavy metal and pesticide mixture presents an ecological risk the rq values of the twelve remaining heavy metals and pesticides at all sites were less than the threshold value of 1 indicating the individual heavy metals and pesticides did not significantly present an ecological risk overall these results suggest that the ecotoxicological risk should not be ignored in the study area because the rq values for some heavy metals and pesticides at all most sites are higher than the threshold value of 1 fig 3b accordingly further studies are urgently needed according to current directives 3 4 risks of hmps mixtures in order to evaluate the integrated hmp biological effects the dgt labile concentration coupled with toxicity data species sensitivity distribution ssd was conducted to evaluate hmp probabilistic ecotoxicological risk gu et al 2020 tang et al 2021 by employing the k s test method the distribution of data for exposure concentrations and toxicological effects on sensitive species were tested and the results indicated that the transformed data for exposure and toxicity exhibited normal distributions p 0 05 table 2 the mean standard deviation sd and k s test results for fifteen heavy metals and three pesticides are shown in table 2 furthermore the transformed normal probability distribution curves for risk analysis were constructed with the means and standard deviations sds of exposure and toxic data for fifteen heavy metals and three pesticides fig 3 the overlap area was calculated between the exposure single hmp data distribution and the corresponding toxicity single hmp data distribution fig 3 results indicate that each hmp had less than 26 probability of toxic effects respectively in terms of the addition of probabilities gu 2021 steen et al 1999 the toxic effect probabilities of hmps were utilized to estimate the integral risk of hmp mixtures indicating that surface sediments of zhelin bay presented a 54 59 probability of having an integral toxic effect on aquatic organisms 4 conclusion for the first time we established the combined toxicity method of hmp mixtures for aquatic biota in sediments this novel method consists of three steps in the first step the bioaccessible dgt labile concentrations of hmps were obtained using the dgt technique in the second step the pra approach considering individual hmp toxicity to three different trophic level aquatic groups was established based on the ssd method and dgt labile concentrations in the last step the assessment combined toxicity of hmps was calculated based on the addition of probabilities coupled with the pra approach zhelin bay the largest mariculture base on the eastern guangdong coast of south china was chosen as a case study site the pra results show that inhg clp and mn present a 25 1 16 5 and 15 5 biological risk to the aquatic biota ranking as the first second and third most significant level of risk the results of this new method reveal that the surface sediments of zhelin bay had a 54 6 probability of inducing a toxic effect on aquatic organisms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
