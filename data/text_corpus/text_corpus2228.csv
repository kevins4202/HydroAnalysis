11140,drip irrigation applying surface water with high sand concentration leads to a higher risk of composite fouling which is the most complex material type of clogging thus understanding the dynamic variation and formation mechanism of composite fouling is the prerequisite for controlling clogging substance and establishing rational anti clogging method to promote high sand surface water for drip irrigation in this paper the components of the composite fouling were studied through the emitter composite fouling experiment under three drip irrigation frequencies the results indicated that the particulate fouling composition solid particle sp crystallization fouling composition caco3 and mgco3 precipitate c mp and biofouling composition extracellular polymeric substance eps and microbial activity ma grew as the system operated significant positive linear correlations were obtained among different compositions r2 0 82 p 0 01 and the microorganism attached on the surface of sp and continuously secreted eps mutually promoted the formation of biofouling and particulate fouling the condensation of microcrystals formed by c mp with sp promoted the formation of crystallization and particulate fouling and phosphorus anions enhanced flocculation and agglomeration between particles thus physical chemical biological reactions occurred to promote mutual growth which ultimately led to composite fouling formation meanwhile various components in the composite fouling increased gradually with higher operating frequency which could aggravate the emitter clogging and decrease the relative discharge of the drip irrigation emitters dra and the uniformity coefficient cu keywords drip irrigation emitter clogging high sediment surface water composite fouling operating frequency 1 introduction water resource shortage is a serious problem that restricts the sustainable development of economy and society oktem 2008 hadadin et al 2010 shu and ying 2011 drip irrigation system is regarded as one of the most efficient water saving techniques in the world using high sand surface water for drip irrigation system is an effective way to alleviate the shortage of agricultural water resource nakayama and bucks 1991 wei et al 2006 however the water quality characteristics of high sand surface water could result in the fouling formation in emitters due to the narrow flow path merely 0 5 1 2 mm which would directly affect irrigation uniformity and its service life or even disable the whole system capra and scicolone 2007 liu and huang 2009 pei et al 2014 biofouling particulate and crystallization fouling are three of the most typical fouling they have been investigated in the past boerlage et al 1999 albert et al 2011 tarchitzky et al 2013 oliver et al 2014 kuruneru et al 2016 zhou et al 2017 qian et al 2017 in fact as the significant interaction between inorganic substance particles calcium and magnesium etc and biofouling formation lowe 1988 geesey et al 2000 zan et al 2010 occurs the formation of each type of fouling is controlled by physical chemical and biological coupling reactions due to water quality characteristics one of the fouling types can occupy a dominant position and appear as a single fouling type however with a rapid growth of population more effluent sewage is discharged to surface water which makes water quality extremely complicated van der linden et al 2008 ferrar et al 2013 the water sources may contain large amounts of suspended particles dissolved salt chemical precipitation organic matter and microorganism especially for surface water when the sand concentration is high the complex water quality fertilizer fouling interactions occur inevitably inside emitter resulting in more serious composite fouling some studies proved that different operating frequencies could change the formation of fouling inside the emitters bishop 2007 zhou et al 2015 for example zhou et al 2015 used reclaimed water to study the effect of irrigation frequency on biofouling and reported that the increase in frequency increased the overall clogging degree of the system zhang 2016 found that the decrease in frequency would increase the formation of crystallization fouling in the emitter in the brackish water drip irrigation system and lead to an increase in clogging however these studies only focused on the influence of the frequency on the emitters single type fouling according to the specific water source characteristics to our knowledge the effect of operating frequency on the emitters composite fouling has not been reported yet more importantly how the dynamics among the main components of particulate fouling and crystallization fouling changes during composite fouling formation remains unknown it is not clear how the mutual influence between them ultimately leads to the formation of composite fouling the purposes of this paper were 1 to understand the dynamic variation process and formation mechanism of composite fouling inside drip emitters 2 to investigate the effects of different operating frequencies on the composite fouling formation and 3 to clarify the influence path of three fouling composition on the emitter composite fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 water quality characteristics of the water source the field experiment was conducted at an irrigation station located at ulanbuhe arid area in bayinaoer inner mongolia china n 40 24 32 e 107 02 19 which is situated at the western part of the hetao irrigation area with an altitude of 1072 m this area is in the arid semi arid and semi desert steppe zones and the climate is characterized as temperate plateau or temperate continental the experiment was performed from june 20 to october 10 2017 the average air temperature during the experiments ranged from 26 3 c to 38 7 c the water used in this study was obtained from the yellow river in the wushengan channel denoted by yrw hereafter the water quality parameters measured during the experiment are presented in table 1 the yrw contained high concentration of suspended solid and calcium and magnesium ions table 1 it also contained certain microorganisms organic matters nitrogen and phosphorus which are typical contributing factors for composite fouling in the emitter 2 2 experimental designs and system layout the testing system is a home designed composite fouling experimental platform with emitters attached to a fertigation drip system the detailed in site experiment layout is provided in fig 1 the sand and disc filters were applied as the filtration equipment the test platform had two sub units with each built in four layers in an individual layer each type of emitter was installed with eight replications the working pressure of each layer was maintained at 100 kpa using a two stage pressure regulating valve the pressure calibration was performed before operation on a daily basis the pointer word wheel water meter was used to monitor and record water and fertilizer quantity this system also contained a sink below the drip lateral to direct the outflow of emitters into the fertilizer pond or water pond while applying the yrw ball valve would be used to deliver the surface water to the water pond the phosphorus containing fertilizer water could be circulated into the fertilizer pond by adjusting the valve in addition stirring devices were used in each fertilizer tank to maintain the concentration of fertilizer solution at 0 15 g l 150 g m3 there were eight types of flat emitters labeled as fe1 fe8 selected for the composite fouling experiment the emitters flow channel and detailed parameters are provided in fig 2 and table 2 each drip irrigation lateral was 15 m in length with a 0 33 m spacing in between and thus altogether 45 emitters marked as 1 45 from the inlet to the outlet were used each dripline from inlet to the outlet was divided into three parts head middle and end and each part was 5 m in length following the local irrigation operating frequency schedule and experimental design of zhou et al 2015 three operating frequencies were set 1 once every day p1 1 2 once every 4 days p1 4 and 3 once every 7 days p1 7 potassium dihydrogen phosphate pdp was used as the fertilizer at 0 15 g l concentration according to the field fertilization practice the yrw fertilized water yrw sequence was employed in the experiment in yrw fertilized water yrw sequence the yrw was applied as drip irrigation water source to stabilize the system first then fertilizer solution was injected to the drip system followed by an additional yrw supply to guarantee the residual fertilizers were flushed out of the dripline system the total amount of water infusion evenly distributed into two yrw steps in order to ensure the same amount of water and fertilizer at the end of the experiment the water supply of three experimental frequency mode p1 1 p1 4 and p1 7 were 7 5 m3 30 m3 and 52 5 m3 respectively the amount of utilized pdp were 0 45 kg 1 8 kg and 3 15 kg so that the corresponding volume of required fertilizer solution were 3 12 and 21 m3 for each experiment by the end of the experiment the water consumption for each type of emitter was 840 m3 and the amount of phosphate fertilizer was 50 4 kg and the total amount of water and fertilizer usage were 6 72 103 m3 and 403 2 kg the pointer word wheel water meters were applied to record the amount of water and fertilizer entering the drip irrigation system at the end of the experiment the composite fouling formed at the outlet of the emitter which is shown in fig 3 2 3 emitter composite fouling extraction eight samples were collected during the experiment and every two runs of p1 7 modes were taken as a unit during the sampling time each drip irrigation lateral was destructively fetched and five samples out of the 15 emitters in the head middle and the tail which were close to the estimated relative discharge of the drip irrigation emitters dra were selected then these samples were placed and sealed in a ziplock bag and preserved in the refrigerator at 4 c in order to characterize the fouling material compositions and eliminate the influence of randomness of the clogging material growth a mixed sample from multiple samples was tested each time and the average value was used in this study the composition of the fouling under the physical chemical and biological inducements was quantified the particulate fouling composition mainly constituted the solid particle sp and the test method referred to xue 2016 similarly the crystallization fouling composition mainly considered the caco3 and mgco3 precipitate c mp and the test method referred to li et al 2019 and the biofouling composition mainly considered the extracellular polymeric substance eps and the test method referred to zhou et al 2013 due to the high experimental testing fees of c mp and eps the 2nd 4th 6th and 8th samples were selected for testing microbial activity ma is an important parameter in biofilm analysis that indicates the strength of the metabolic activity of attached microorganisms and growth in a unit carrier biofilm in this study ma was estimated based on the ratio of ceps csd ceps indicated the viscous eps content and csd indicated the solid particles content li et al 2015a song et al 2017 2 4 evaluation method of clogging degree the weighing method feng et al 2019 was adopted to calculate the emitters discharge at first the ribbons were attached to each emitter outlet along the entire dripline in order to make sure that the entire emitter outflow was collected then the pressure at each layer was maintained at 100 kpa the multi layer flow measuring trolley which had a four layer structure was used to measure flow of emitters by placing the small buckets internal diameter of 0 2 m underneath each emitter tested a stopwatch was used to record the time with the accuracy of 0 01 s the outflow of each emitter was collected for 5 min due to the limited length of flow measured trolley we tested each emitter three times from head to tail each time we tested 15 emitters and altogether 45 emitters were considered to determine dra and the uniformity coefficient cu finally weight measured by high precision electronic balances with the accuracy of 10 4 g and the time duration measured by the stopwatch was used to measure the emitter flow rate the emitter discharge ratio was modified according to the method described by pei et al 2014 to eliminate the effect of temperature on the emitter anti clogging performance test results dra cu emitter clogging degree ec were computed as per li et al 2015a to evaluate the anti clogging performance of the drip irrigation system emitters the equations of hydraulic performance indicators of the drip irrigation system are presented in eqs 1 3 the relative discharge of the drip irrigation emitters dra was calculated as follows 1 d r a i n q i t q i 0 n 100 where q0 i is initial flow rate for emitter i in l h qt i is flow at t hour for emitter i in l h and n is total number of emitter installed along the lateral the outflow uniformity of the drip irrigation emitters can be represented by the uniformity coefficient cu eq 2 2 c u 100 1 i 1 n q i t q t n q t 3 q t i 1 n q i t n where q t is average flow of each emitter along the lateral at t time in l h and other parameters are defined in eq 1 2 5 statistical analysis and path analysis the basic calculations were performed using microsoft excel and statistical tests were conducted using spss 17 0 software the difference was considered significant at the probability level of p 0 05 path analysis was used to describe the direct dependencies among a set of variables and the direct impact bi and indirect rijbj impact were used to describe the correlation coefficients between independent and the responsive variables in this study the total effect riy of each of sp x1 c mp x2 eps x3 and ma x4 on ec y was calculated as the sum of one predictor s direct effect and indirect effect bi represented the direct effect of each of sp x1 c mp x2 eps x3 and ma x4 on ec y the indirect effect of xi on y usually in form of rijbj was calculated as the product of the correlation between xi and xj rij and the direct effect of xj on y bj 3 results and analysis 3 1 operating frequencies influence on sp in composite fouling the dynamic variation of solid particulates sp in composite fouling within the emitters under three different operating frequencies modes p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 as well as their correlation are shown in fig 4 as observed in fig 4 the total quantities of sp in the emitter were clearly different under three operating frequencies as the operation time of system increased the eight types of emitters showed an increasing sp trend along with the decrease in the operating frequency until the end of system operation the sp content inside the emitters under p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 modes were 5 21 24 91 mg cm2 6 98 34 11 mg cm2 8 63 37 36 mg cm2 respectively meanwhile the sp content in p1 1 had a good correlation with the sp content in p1 4 and p1 7 r2 0 96 p 0 01 by comparing the growth slope from the correlation it could be concluded that the total amount of sp in the p1 4 and p1 7 emitter was higher than that of p1 1 by 32 13 and 76 25 respectively 3 2 operating frequencies influence on c mp in composite fouling the dynamic variations of caco3 and mgco3 precipitate c mp in composite fouling within the emitters under three different operating frequencies modes p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 as well as their correlation are shown in fig 5 under three operating frequencies the total quantities of c mp in the emitters composite fouling were significantly different fig 5 as the operation time of system increased the c mp content in the emitters gradually increased with the decrease of the operating frequency and the dynamic variations of c mp in each type of emitter exhibited good consistency until the end of the operation system the c mp content inside the emitters under p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 modes were 1 11 5 29 mg cm2 1 53 6 52 mg cm2 1 99 11 31 mg cm2 respectively at the same time the c mp content in p1 1 showed an excellent correlation with the c mp content in p1 4 and p1 7 r2 0 92 p 0 01 by comparing the growth slope from the correlations it could be concluded that the total amount of c mp in the p1 4 and p1 7 emitter was higher than that of p1 1 by 36 88 and 91 25 respectively 3 3 operating frequencies influence on eps in composite fouling the variation in extracellular polymeric substance eps in composite fouling within the emitters under three different operating frequencies p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 as well as their correlation are shown in fig 6 the total quantities of eps in the emitter were clearly different under three operating frequencies fig 6 as the system operation time increased the emitters showed an increasing eps trend with the decrease in the operating frequency until the end of the operation system the eps content inside the emitters under p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 modes were 0 45 0 73 mg cm2 0 47 0 78 mg cm2 0 51 0 87 mg cm2 respectively meanwhile the eps content in p1 1 showed an excellent correlation with the c mp contents in p1 4 and p1 7 r2 0 96 p 0 01 by comparing the growth slope from the correlations it could be concluded that the total amount of eps in the p1 4 and p1 7 emitter were higher than that of p1 1 by 17 63 and 35 63 respectively 4 discussion determining the dynamic variation formation mechanism of composite fouling is the premise for controlling clogging substance in emitter and establishing rational anti clogging method to promote high sand surface water for drip irrigation system in this research a series of emitter composite fouling experiments were carried out for an on site phosphate fertigation drip irrigation system to study the influence of operating frequencies on the emitters composite fouling meanwhile the dynamic variation in the major components of composite fouling and the effect of various components on the formation of fouling were also analyzed the results indicated that the growth and formation of the emitters composite fouling were different under three operating frequencies the total quantities of sp c mp eps inside the emitters showed a gradual increase with decreasing the operating frequency until the end of the operation system the total quantities of sp c mp eps under the p1 4 and p1 7 modes were 32 13 76 25 36 88 91 25 17 63 35 63 higher than did p1 1 mode respectively this can be attributed to the operation and stoppage of the system which will cause drip irrigation lateral and emitters to be in an environment of alternating wet and dry which was moist during operation and gradually became dry after that when the system operated the drip lateral and emitters were filled with phosphorus contained irrigation water which could continuously bring a large number of particles and microbial communities and provide adequate nutrients to form the biofilms inside the emitters bishop 2007 when the system stopped running the flow velocity in the system gradually slowed and eventually stagnated which provided an ideal condition for the formation and growth of fouling inside the emitters li et al 2006 when the amount of eps was relatively small the clogging substance had an unstable porous structure li et al 2012 the quiescence of water flow would allow microorganisms to obtain moisture and nutrients from water to maintain their growth and secret eps and to continuously adsorb small particles and microorganisms from water and rely on the cohesive force generated by eps this process made the biofouling maintain the stability effectively and its interior porous structure more stable than earlier vieira et al 1993 tsai 2005 this resulted in more stable fouling with longer system stoppage on the other hand when the system was shut down oxygen consumption and moisture evaporation would induce a reaction between particulate fouling surface and irrigation water this caused migration of moisture within the fouling and diffusion of water soluble substances meanwhile the water soluble salt content in emitters is affected by the long term gradual drying environment which makes the internal moisture of the fouling migrate to the fouling surface and further promote the formation and enrichment of fouling venterink et al 2002 therefore the content of sp c mp and eps appeared to increase gradually as the operating frequency decreased furthermore we also found that the difference of system operating frequencies could have a significant impact on the microorganism activity fig 7 all eight kinds of emitters showed a uniform pattern at the three operating frequencies with the decrease of working frequency the activity of microorganisms gradually increased the ma in the p1 1 showed an excellent correlation with the ma in p1 4 and p1 7 modes r2 0 83 p 0 01 the ma under the p1 4 and p1 7 modes were 21 88 and 44 75 higher than p1 1 mode the addition of phosphate fertilizer provides nutrients for the microbial activity to promote the proliferation of microorganisms and some of the organic phosphorus and mineralized inorganic phosphorus are assimilated into microbial biomass thereby increasing the microbial biomass phosphorus sharma et al 2013 alori et al 2017 although the total fertilizer quantity application in the three operating frequencies were consistent there was a difference in the duration of continuous application because these systems implemented an alternate operation mode of yrw fertilized water yrw the p1 1 mode continued to use yrw after applying fertilizer for a short period time compared with p1 4 and p1 7 modes p1 1 mode was equivalent to shortening the use of phosphate fertilizer therefore ma for p1 1 mode could be lower than that under p1 4 and p1 7 modes vrouwenvelder et al 2010 kim et al 2014 the finding indicated that the long term use of phosphate fertilizer was more likely to simulate microbial activity than the short term phosphate fertilizer injection due to map1 7 ma p1 4 map1 1 with higher ma the biofilms which were shed by hydraulic shear force from drip lateral han et al 2018 were more viscous and enabled them to more easily absorb microorganisms and particulate matter to form biofouling this could also be proven by analyzing the variation of the components sp eps under different operating frequencies therefore it can be deduced that a decrease in the operating frequencies will increase the formation of emitters composite fouling and increase the risk of system clogging the fertilizer on the one hand provided a large number of nutrients for microorganisms to promote the biofouling formation its dissolution and precipitation on the other hand promoted the chemical reaction in the irrigation water which could accelerate the precipitation of ions mainly ca2 mg2 hco 3 liu et al 2017 we also investigated how the various components interact with each other and ultimately result in the formation of composite fouling we analyzed the correlations among the sp c mp eps and ma in the eight types of emitters fig 8 moreover the path analysis was used to identify the effects of all composite fouling compositions on the clogging degree at the same frequency p1 1 table 3 it was also observed that the amount of sp c mp eps and ma gradually increased with the increase of another substance fig 8 which indicated that the four components which formed the composite fouling inside the emitter had a mutual reinforcement and growth r2 0 82 p 0 01 as seen in table 3 we analyzed the effects of various composite fouling characteristic compositions on the clogging degree it was observed that sp and c mp had significant effects with regard to the indirect effects of various composite fouling characteristic compositions on the clogging degree the degrees of indirect effects among various composite fouling characteristic compositions manifested as rijbj ma rijbj eps rijbj c mp rijbj sp while the indirect effect of eps mainly influenced sp 0 258 and c mp 0 202 that of ma influenced sp 0 413 and c mp 0 189 and that of c mp influenced sp 0 172 the decision making effects of all composite fouling characteristic compositions on clogging degree manifested as r i 2 sp r i 2 c mp r i 2 ma r i 2 eps among which sp and c mp played the main role in decision making on clogging and the indirect role of eps and ma could not be ignored based on the analysis above we found that the sp could carry microorganisms into the emitters flow channel and continuously deposition after that the microorganisms kept on growing between sp and channel and secreting the adhesive eps which could absorb more sp this process promoted the mutual formation of biofouling and particulate fouling meanwhile chemical ions mainly ca2 and mg2 preliminarily precipitated to form microcrystals liu et al 2003 the chemical precipitation affected the surface characteristics and gained high surface free energy to collide with sp the solid particles came close to each other and finally got together and the trace moisture would bond the particles through the hydrogen bond rittmann 1982 which further promoted the formation of crystallization fouling and particulate fouling previous literature showed that after phosphate fertilizer application the total amount of cations in the irrigation water gradually increased li et al 2015b since most of the fine particles have negative charges the electric double layer is compressed by electrostatic attraction and becomes thinner when the cations increase and zeta potential decreases wang et al 2005 this phenomenon leads to significant increase in the solid particulates flocculation and sedimentation strength liu et al 2017 at the same time the adsorption of phosphorus containing anions and suspended particles further enhances the flocculation and agglomeration of particles chen et al 2015 finally because of so many complicated water quality factors a series of biological physical chemical reaction occurred in the fouling formation the biofouling particulate fouling and crystallization fouling to be coupled to promote growth and ultimately resulted in the formation of composite fouling even extending to the emitters outlet with the increase in system run time both the working frequency and the growth of composite fouling would affect the clogging degree of the emitter analyzing the variation of emitter clogging degree under different operating frequencies figs 9 and 10 dra and cu of the three operating frequency emitters showed a decreasing trend as the operating frequency decreased the dra of emitters at p1 1 p1 4 and p1 7 were calculated to be 68 55 90 70 66 31 89 00 and 62 67 83 77 respectively the cu were 70 27 93 30 67 40 91 67 64 21 85 54 respectively the reduction of the system operating frequency would lead to an increase in the amount of the attached composite fouling in the emitter inner wall thereby increasing the degree of clogging of drip irrigation system therefore in the case of meeting actual crop growth requirements the increase in operating frequency will help to ease the formation of fouling and to improve the system s anti clogging performance in summary few meaningful findings were obtained in this study but there are still additional issue that need to be investigated in the future 1 the water source in this study was merely limited to applying yellow river water under phosphate fertilizer 0 15 g l and only three operating frequencies were set it is necessary to carry out further research on different types of fertilizers and different water quality and combine them with the actual crop irrigation and fertilization requirement to obtain a more comprehensive and in depth water and fertilizer integration suitable operating frequency theory 2 using high throughput sequencing and other testing methods a more comprehensive and detailed analysis of the distribution of microbial community structure need to be carried out 3 emitter geometry is an important factor to influence its anti clogging performance the effect of different emitter geometries on the clogging needs to be investigated further 5 conclusions the dynamic variation process of the particulate fouling composition sp crystallization fouling composition c mp and biofouling composition eps and ma had an overall accumulative growth trend as the system operated the increase of deposited sp continued to drive microorganisms attachment and microorganisms secreted the adhesive eps which mutually promoted the formation of biofouling and particulate fouling the condensation of microcrystals formed by c mp with sp promoted the formation of crystallization and particulate fouling and the addition of phosphorus containing anions enhanced flocculation and agglomeration between particles according to the path analysis sp and c mp had direct effects on the formation of composite fouling and eps and ma mainly affected the formation of biofouling by biochemical reaction a series of physical chemical and biological reactions that occurred in sp c mp eps and ma were coupled to promote common growth which ultimately led to the formation of composite fouling in emitters meanwhile the content of the various components in the composite fouling showed a gradual increase with the decrease of the operating frequency until the end of system operation the sp contents inside emitters under p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 modes were 5 21 25 9 mg cm2 6 98 34 11 mg cm2 8 63 37 36 mg cm2 respectively the c mp content were 1 11 5 29 mg cm2 1 53 6 52 mg cm2 1 99 11 31 mg cm2 respectively the eps content were 0 45 0 73 mg cm2 0 47 0 78 mg cm2 0 51 0 87 mg cm2 respectively moreover the ma in the p1 4 and p1 7 modes were 21 88 and 44 75 higher than in the p1 1 mode the increase in the fouling content aggravated the clogging of the emitter and caused emitters dra and cu to decrease as the frequency decreased in general the total quantity of sd c mp eps and ma under the p1 4 and p1 7 modes were 32 13 76 25 36 88 91 25 17 63 35 63 21 88 44 75 higher than the p1 1 mode respectively therefore in the case of meeting actual crop growth requirements the increase in operating frequency will help to ease the formation of fouling and improve the system s anti clogging performance acknowledgements we are

in addition stirring devices were used in each fertilizer tank to maintain the concentration of fertilizer solution at 0 15 g l 150 g m3 there were eight types of flat emitters labeled as fe1 fe8 selected for the composite fouling experiment the emitters flow channel and detailed parameters are provided in fig 2 and table 2 each drip irrigation lateral was 15 m in length with a 0 33 m spacing in between and thus altogether 45 emitters marked as 1 45 from the inlet to the outlet were used each dripline from inlet to the outlet was divided into three parts head middle and end and each part was 5 m in length following the local irrigation operating frequency schedule and experimental design of zhou et al 2015 three operating frequencies were set 1 once every day p1 1 2 once every 4 days p1 4 and 3 once every 7 days p1 7 potassium dihydrogen phosphate pdp was used as the fertilizer at 0 15 g l concentration according to the field fertilization practice the yrw fertilized water yrw sequence was employed in the experiment in yrw fertilized water yrw sequence the yrw was applied as drip irrigation water source to stabilize the system first then fertilizer solution was injected to the drip system followed by an additional yrw supply to guarantee the residual fertilizers were flushed out of the dripline system the total amount of water infusion evenly distributed into two yrw steps in order to ensure the same amount of water and fertilizer at the end of the experiment the water supply of three experimental frequency mode p1 1 p1 4 and p1 7 were 7 5 m3 30 m3 and 52 5 m3 respectively the amount of utilized pdp were 0 45 kg 1 8 kg and 3 15 kg so that the corresponding volume of required fertilizer solution were 3 12 and 21 m3 for each experiment by the end of the experiment the water consumption for each type of emitter was 840 m3 and the amount of phosphate fertilizer was 50 4 kg and the total amount of water and fertilizer usage were 6 72 103 m3 and 403 2 kg the pointer word wheel water meters were applied to record the amount of water and fertilizer entering the drip irrigation system at the end of the experiment the composite fouling formed at the outlet of the emitter which is shown in fig 3 2 3 emitter composite fouling extraction eight samples were collected during the experiment and every two runs of p1 7 modes were taken as a unit during the sampling time each drip irrigation lateral was destructively fetched and five samples out of the 15 emitters in the head middle and the tail which were close to the estimated relative discharge of the drip irrigation emitters dra were selected then these samples were placed and sealed in a ziplock bag and preserved in the refrigerator at 4 c in order to characterize the fouling material compositions and eliminate the influence of randomness of the clogging material growth a mixed sample from multiple samples was tested each time and the average value was used in this study the composition of the fouling under the physical chemical and biological inducements was quantified the particulate fouling composition mainly constituted the solid particle sp and the test method referred to xue 2016 similarly the crystallization fouling composition mainly considered the caco3 and mgco3 precipitate c mp and the test method referred to li et al 2019 and the biofouling composition mainly considered the extracellular polymeric substance eps and the test method referred to zhou et al 2013 due to the high experimental testing fees of c mp and eps the 2nd 4th 6th and 8th samples were selected for testing microbial activity ma is an important parameter in biofilm analysis that indicates the strength of the metabolic activity of attached microorganisms and growth in a unit carrier biofilm in this study ma was estimated based on the ratio of ceps csd ceps indicated the viscous eps content and csd indicated the solid particles content li et al 2015a song et al 2017 2 4 evaluation method of clogging degree the weighing method feng et al 2019 was adopted to calculate the emitters discharge at first the ribbons were attached to each emitter outlet along the entire dripline in order to make sure that the entire emitter outflow was collected then the pressure at each layer was maintained at 100 kpa the multi layer flow measuring trolley which had a four layer structure was used to measure flow of emitters by placing the small buckets internal diameter of 0 2 m underneath each emitter tested a stopwatch was used to record the time with the accuracy of 0 01 s the outflow of each emitter was collected for 5 min due to the limited length of flow measured trolley we tested each emitter three times from head to tail each time we tested 15 emitters and altogether 45 emitters were considered to determine dra and the uniformity coefficient cu finally weight measured by high precision electronic balances with the accuracy of 10 4 g and the time duration measured by the stopwatch was used to measure the emitter flow rate the emitter discharge ratio was modified according to the method described by pei et al 2014 to eliminate the effect of temperature on the emitter anti clogging performance test results dra cu emitter clogging degree ec were computed as per li et al 2015a to evaluate the anti clogging performance of the drip irrigation system emitters the equations of hydraulic performance indicators of the drip irrigation system are presented in eqs 1 3 the relative discharge of the drip irrigation emitters dra was calculated as follows 1 d r a i n q i t q i 0 n 100 where q0 i is initial flow rate for emitter i in l h qt i is flow at t hour for emitter i in l h and n is total number of emitter installed along the lateral the outflow uniformity of the drip irrigation emitters can be represented by the uniformity coefficient cu eq 2 2 c u 100 1 i 1 n q i t q t n q t 3 q t i 1 n q i t n where q t is average flow of each emitter along the lateral at t time in l h and other parameters are defined in eq 1 2 5 statistical analysis and path analysis the basic calculations were performed using microsoft excel and statistical tests were conducted using spss 17 0 software the difference was considered significant at the probability level of p 0 05 path analysis was used to describe the direct dependencies among a set of variables and the direct impact bi and indirect rijbj impact were used to describe the correlation coefficients between independent and the responsive variables in this study the total effect riy of each of sp x1 c mp x2 eps x3 and ma x4 on ec y was calculated as the sum of one predictor s direct effect and indirect effect bi represented the direct effect of each of sp x1 c mp x2 eps x3 and ma x4 on ec y the indirect effect of xi on y usually in form of rijbj was calculated as the product of the correlation between xi and xj rij and the direct effect of xj on y bj 3 results and analysis 3 1 operating frequencies influence on sp in composite fouling the dynamic variation of solid particulates sp in composite fouling within the emitters under three different operating frequencies modes p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 as well as their correlation are shown in fig 4 as observed in fig 4 the total quantities of sp in the emitter were clearly different under three operating frequencies as the operation time of system increased the eight types of emitters showed an increasing sp trend along with the decrease in the operating frequency until the end of system operation the sp content inside the emitters under p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 modes were 5 21 24 91 mg cm2 6 98 34 11 mg cm2 8 63 37 36 mg cm2 respectively meanwhile the sp content in p1 1 had a good correlation with the sp content in p1 4 and p1 7 r2 0 96 p 0 01 by comparing the growth slope from the correlation it could be concluded that the total amount of sp in the p1 4 and p1 7 emitter was higher than that of p1 1 by 32 13 and 76 25 respectively 3 2 operating frequencies influence on c mp in composite fouling the dynamic variations of caco3 and mgco3 precipitate c mp in composite fouling within the emitters under three different operating frequencies modes p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 as well as their correlation are shown in fig 5 under three operating frequencies the total quantities of c mp in the emitters composite fouling were significantly different fig 5 as the operation time of system increased the c mp content in the emitters gradually increased with the decrease of the operating frequency and the dynamic variations of c mp in each type of emitter exhibited good consistency until the end of the operation system the c mp content inside the emitters under p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 modes were 1 11 5 29 mg cm2 1 53 6 52 mg cm2 1 99 11 31 mg cm2 respectively at the same time the c mp content in p1 1 showed an excellent correlation with the c mp content in p1 4 and p1 7 r2 0 92 p 0 01 by comparing the growth slope from the correlations it could be concluded that the total amount of c mp in the p1 4 and p1 7 emitter was higher than that of p1 1 by 36 88 and 91 25 respectively 3 3 operating frequencies influence on eps in composite fouling the variation in extracellular polymeric substance eps in composite fouling within the emitters under three different operating frequencies p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 as well as their correlation are shown in fig 6 the total quantities of eps in the emitter were clearly different under three operating frequencies fig 6 as the system operation time increased the emitters showed an increasing eps trend with the decrease in the operating frequency until the end of the operation system the eps content inside the emitters under p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 modes were 0 45 0 73 mg cm2 0 47 0 78 mg cm2 0 51 0 87 mg cm2 respectively meanwhile the eps content in p1 1 showed an excellent correlation with the c mp contents in p1 4 and p1 7 r2 0 96 p 0 01 by comparing the growth slope from the correlations it could be concluded that the total amount of eps in the p1 4 and p1 7 emitter were higher than that of p1 1 by 17 63 and 35 63 respectively 4 discussion determining the dynamic variation formation mechanism of composite fouling is the premise for controlling clogging substance in emitter and establishing rational anti clogging method to promote high sand surface water for drip irrigation system in this research a series of emitter composite fouling experiments were carried out for an on site phosphate fertigation drip irrigation system to study the influence of operating frequencies on the emitters composite fouling meanwhile the dynamic variation in the major components of composite fouling and the effect of various components on the formation of fouling were also analyzed the results indicated that the growth and formation of the emitters composite fouling were different under three operating frequencies the total quantities of sp c mp eps inside the emitters showed a gradual increase with decreasing the operating frequency until the end of the operation system the total quantities of sp c mp eps under the p1 4 and p1 7 modes were 32 13 76 25 36 88 91 25 17 63 35 63 higher than did p1 1 mode respectively this can be attributed to the operation and stoppage of the system which will cause drip irrigation lateral and emitters to be in an environment of alternating wet and dry which was moist during operation and gradually became dry after that when the system operated the drip lateral and emitters were filled with phosphorus contained irrigation water which could continuously bring a large number of particles and microbial communities and provide adequate nutrients to form the biofilms inside the emitters bishop 2007 when the system stopped running the flow velocity in the system gradually slowed and eventually stagnated which provided an ideal condition for the formation and growth of fouling inside the emitters li et al 2006 when the amount of eps was relatively small the clogging substance had an unstable porous structure li et al 2012 the quiescence of water flow would allow microorganisms to obtain moisture and nutrients from water to maintain their growth and secret eps and to continuously adsorb small particles and microorganisms from water and rely on the cohesive force generated by eps this process made the biofouling maintain the stability effectively and its interior porous structure more stable than earlier vieira et al 1993 tsai 2005 this resulted in more stable fouling with longer system stoppage on the other hand when the system was shut down oxygen consumption and moisture evaporation would induce a reaction between particulate fouling surface and irrigation water this caused migration of moisture within the fouling and diffusion of water soluble substances meanwhile the water soluble salt content in emitters is affected by the long term gradual drying environment which makes the internal moisture of the fouling migrate to the fouling surface and further promote the formation and enrichment of fouling venterink et al 2002 therefore the content of sp c mp and eps appeared to increase gradually as the operating frequency decreased furthermore we also found that the difference of system operating frequencies could have a significant impact on the microorganism activity fig 7 all eight kinds of emitters showed a uniform pattern at the three operating frequencies with the decrease of working frequency the activity of microorganisms gradually increased the ma in the p1 1 showed an excellent correlation with the ma in p1 4 and p1 7 modes r2 0 83 p 0 01 the ma under the p1 4 and p1 7 modes were 21 88 and 44 75 higher than p1 1 mode the addition of phosphate fertilizer provides nutrients for the microbial activity to promote the proliferation of microorganisms and some of the organic phosphorus and mineralized inorganic phosphorus are assimilated into microbial biomass thereby increasing the microbial biomass phosphorus sharma et al 2013 alori et al 2017 although the total fertilizer quantity application in the three operating frequencies were consistent there was a difference in the duration of continuous application because these systems implemented an alternate operation mode of yrw fertilized water yrw the p1 1 mode continued to use yrw after applying fertilizer for a short period time compared with p1 4 and p1 7 modes p1 1 mode was equivalent to shortening the use of phosphate fertilizer therefore ma for p1 1 mode could be lower than that under p1 4 and p1 7 modes vrouwenvelder et al 2010 kim et al 2014 the finding indicated that the long term use of phosphate fertilizer was more likely to simulate microbial activity than the short term phosphate fertilizer injection due to map1 7 ma p1 4 map1 1 with higher ma the biofilms which were shed by hydraulic shear force from drip lateral han et al 2018 were more viscous and enabled them to more easily absorb microorganisms and particulate matter to form biofouling this could also be proven by analyzing the variation of the components sp eps under different operating frequencies therefore it can be deduced that a decrease in the operating frequencies will increase the formation of emitters composite fouling and increase the risk of system clogging the fertilizer on the one hand provided a large number of nutrients for microorganisms to promote the biofouling formation its dissolution and precipitation on the other hand promoted the chemical reaction in the irrigation water which could accelerate the precipitation of ions mainly ca2 mg2 hco 3 liu et al 2017 we also investigated how the various components interact with each other and ultimately result in the formation of composite fouling we analyzed the correlations among the sp c mp eps and ma in the eight types of emitters fig 8 moreover the path analysis was used to identify the effects of all composite fouling compositions on the clogging degree at the same frequency p1 1 table 3 it was also observed that the amount of sp c mp eps and ma gradually increased with the increase of another substance fig 8 which indicated that the four components which formed the composite fouling inside the emitter had a mutual reinforcement and growth r2 0 82 p 0 01 as seen in table 3 we analyzed the effects of various composite fouling characteristic compositions on the clogging degree it was observed that sp and c mp had significant effects with regard to the indirect effects of various composite fouling characteristic compositions on the clogging degree the degrees of indirect effects among various composite fouling characteristic compositions manifested as rijbj ma rijbj eps rijbj c mp rijbj sp while the indirect effect of eps mainly influenced sp 0 258 and c mp 0 202 that of ma influenced sp 0 413 and c mp 0 189 and that of c mp influenced sp 0 172 the decision making effects of all composite fouling characteristic compositions on clogging degree manifested as r i 2 sp r i 2 c mp r i 2 ma r i 2 eps among which sp and c mp played the main role in decision making on clogging and the indirect role of eps and ma could not be ignored based on the analysis above we found that the sp could carry microorganisms into the emitters flow channel and continuously deposition after that the microorganisms kept on growing between sp and channel and secreting the adhesive eps which could absorb more sp this process promoted the mutual formation of biofouling and particulate fouling meanwhile chemical ions mainly ca2 and mg2 preliminarily precipitated to form microcrystals liu et al 2003 the chemical precipitation affected the surface characteristics and gained high surface free energy to collide with sp the solid particles came close to each other and finally got together and the trace moisture would bond the particles through the hydrogen bond rittmann 1982 which further promoted the formation of crystallization fouling and particulate fouling previous literature showed that after phosphate fertilizer application the total amount of cations in the irrigation water gradually increased li et al 2015b since most of the fine particles have negative charges the electric double layer is compressed by electrostatic attraction and becomes thinner when the cations increase and zeta potential decreases wang et al 2005 this phenomenon leads to significant increase in the solid particulates flocculation and sedimentation strength liu et al 2017 at the same time the adsorption of phosphorus containing anions and suspended particles further enhances the flocculation and agglomeration of particles chen et al 2015 finally because of so many complicated water quality factors a series of biological physical chemical reaction occurred in the fouling formation the biofouling particulate fouling and crystallization fouling to be coupled to promote growth and ultimately resulted in the formation of composite fouling even extending to the emitters outlet with the increase in system run time both the working frequency and the growth of composite fouling would affect the clogging degree of the emitter analyzing the variation of emitter clogging degree under different operating frequencies figs 9 and 10 dra and cu of the three operating frequency emitters showed a decreasing trend as the operating frequency decreased the dra of emitters at p1 1 p1 4 and p1 7 were calculated to be 68 55 90 70 66 31 89 00 and 62 67 83 77 respectively the cu were 70 27 93 30 67 40 91 67 64 21 85 54 respectively the reduction of the system operating frequency would lead to an increase in the amount of the attached composite fouling in the emitter inner wall thereby increasing the degree of clogging of drip irrigation system therefore in the case of meeting actual crop growth requirements the increase in operating frequency will help to ease the formation of fouling and to improve the system s anti clogging performance in summary few meaningful findings were obtained in this study but there are still additional issue that need to be investigated in the future 1 the water source in this study was merely limited to applying yellow river water under phosphate fertilizer 0 15 g l and only three operating frequencies were set it is necessary to carry out further research on different types of fertilizers and different water quality and combine them with the actual crop irrigation and fertilization requirement to obtain a more comprehensive and in depth water and fertilizer integration suitable operating frequency theory 2 using high throughput sequencing and other testing methods a more comprehensive and detailed analysis of the distribution of microbial community structure need to be carried out 3 emitter geometry is an important factor to influence its anti clogging performance the effect of different emitter geometries on the clogging needs to be investigated further 5 conclusions the dynamic variation process of the particulate fouling composition sp crystallization fouling composition c mp and biofouling composition eps and ma had an overall accumulative growth trend as the system operated the increase of deposited sp continued to drive microorganisms attachment and microorganisms secreted the adhesive eps which mutually promoted the formation of biofouling and particulate fouling the condensation of microcrystals formed by c mp with sp promoted the formation of crystallization and particulate fouling and the addition of phosphorus containing anions enhanced flocculation and agglomeration between particles according to the path analysis sp and c mp had direct effects on the formation of composite fouling and eps and ma mainly affected the formation of biofouling by biochemical reaction a series of physical chemical and biological reactions that occurred in sp c mp eps and ma were coupled to promote common growth which ultimately led to the formation of composite fouling in emitters meanwhile the content of the various components in the composite fouling showed a gradual increase with the decrease of the operating frequency until the end of system operation the sp contents inside emitters under p1 1 p1 4 p1 7 modes were 5 21 25 9 mg cm2 6 98 34 11 mg cm2 8 63 37 36 mg cm2 respectively the c mp content were 1 11 5 29 mg cm2 1 53 6 52 mg cm2 1 99 11 31 mg cm2 respectively the eps content were 0 45 0 73 mg cm2 0 47 0 78 mg cm2 0 51 0 87 mg cm2 respectively moreover the ma in the p1 4 and p1 7 modes were 21 88 and 44 75 higher than in the p1 1 mode the increase in the fouling content aggravated the clogging of the emitter and caused emitters dra and cu to decrease as the frequency decreased in general the total quantity of sd c mp eps and ma under the p1 4 and p1 7 modes were 32 13 76 25 36 88 91 25 17 63 35 63 21 88 44 75 higher than the p1 1 mode respectively therefore in the case of meeting actual crop growth requirements the increase in operating frequency will help to ease the formation of fouling and improve the system s anti clogging performance acknowledgements we are

11141,the aim of the gredrip model part i is to provide centralized management of an irrigation network with a minimum energy cost at the pumping station based on irrigation scheduling to guarantee crop water requirements in the irrigation network in this paper the combined use of gredrip and mopeco models was used to improve water and energy consumption by applying regulated deficit irrigation rdi to crops in the soreta irrigation network albacete spain for crop distribution and weather conditions during irrigation seasons 2015 and 2016 the mopeco model was used to determine irrigation schedules and to estimate the relationship between irrigated crop yield and net water applied the aim of this paper was to validate the gredrip model under different water demand conditions and to study the financial impact on the irrigation network under drought conditions results show that gredrip is suitable for management of an irrigation network such as soreta reducing the energy cost by 32 in comparison with the current situation the financial analysis carried out shows that a 25 reduction in water consumption would have reduced the gross margin gm in soreta by 30 from 1199 to 839 ha 1 in 2015 and 16 from 914 to 771 ha 1 in 2016 when rdi is applied to all crops when rdi is only applied to less profitable crops extensive herbaceous but not horticultural crops such as onion or garlic a gm reduction of only 9 is obtained under 2015 and 2016 conditions respectively the water saved could be used for other purposes such as increasing the crop area with higher gm or simply to recharge the aquifer at risk of overexploitation which would greatly benefit the environment the combined use of gredrip and mopeco can help to improve water and energy management in irrigation networks through crop irrigation scheduling this can increase the profitability of agriculture by analyzing the financial effects of different irrigation management systems keywords optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi gross margin gredrip mopeco models energy costs 1 introduction the lack of water resources is one of the main handicaps for agriculture in semiarid regions which is one the most water demanding sectors the lack of water resources the progressive increase in energy prices as well as the low price of harvests in the international market are conditioning the profitability of farms located in these regions this situation may be exacerbated as a result of global warming therefore climate change will affect the production of crops which may decrease food security and agricultural income in certain areas and also generate excessive use of resources such as groundwater and energy to compensate for these shortages in short water scarcity will worsen in these regions which will see their growth rates decline due to water related impacts on agriculture health and incomes facing the challenges presented by this situation requires a combination of methodologies and technologies including improving efficiency in the use of natural resources enhancing the design and management of the means of production developing and transferring technology and knowledge to the producers analyzing scenarios for advising farmers and technicians about the most suitable strategies for facing extreme situations and providing decision makers with tools and reports for the development of policies that can improve the resilience of agricultural systems to these threats garcía vila and fereres 2012 huang et al 2012 jacobsen et al 2012 in this regard techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi english and raja 1996 which involves control of the water stress level for maximum crop yield can reduce production costs increasing water use efficiency and profitability per unit of water consumed fereres and soriano 2007 lópez urrea et al 2009 the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi strategy may be of interest to determine the water deficit at each phenological stage that reaches the highest yield for a certain overall objective of water deficit domínguez et al 2012a this methodology may be combined with models like mopeco economic optimization model for irrigation water management ortega et al 2004 to stimulate the effect of this strategy on final yield and gross margin gm and to study its use from the financial point of view the ordi strategy has been calibrated for the main extensive crops in castilla la mancha clm spain such as maize domínguez et al 2012b onion domínguez et al 2012c garlic domínguez et al 2013 and barley lópez urrea et al 2017 and in other countries such as brazil carvalho et al 2014 léllis et al 2017 or argentina garbero et al 2014 in on demand irrigation networks water and energy consumption and their temporal evolution depend on crop distribution the management of an irrigation network involves the use of tools to estimate and predict evolution of water consumption for each of the irrigated crops for managers of irrigation networks it is necessary to establish the hydraulic and energetic management characteristics in each network gestar aliod et al 1998 estrada et al 2009 and the relationship with the water applied to the crops several tools have been developed to improve efficiency of water and energy use in on demand pressurized irrigation networks jiménez bello et al 2011 navarro navajas et al 2012 rodríguez díaz et al 2012 most of these studies did not consider variation in pumping station efficiency at each combination of flow discharge and pressure head preferring to establish fixed pumping station efficiency other studies zaccaria et al 2013 gonzález perea et al 2016 considered the irrigation scheduling at plot scale or studied the interaction between the irrigation system and energy consumption at the pumping station khadra et al 2016 in these studies although the crop water demand is considered it is focused on average flow discharge in a peak period demand or taking into account the probability of opening each hydrant considering a fixed crop distribution hence these works do not consider crop water requirements over a complete irrigation season compared to the actual management of the irrigated plots in this respect for integrated management of the network it is necessary to use tools that consider several aspects such as the energy efficiency of the pumping stations and their work range moreno et al 2007 fernández garcía et al 2014 córcoles et al 2016 the influence of the variability of the energy tariffs on each day and at each hour of the day during the irrigation season fernández garcía et al 2016 as well as the crop water requirements at each plot based on crop irrigation scheduling gonzález perea et al 2016 centralized management of the network can be useful to improve water and energy efficiency considering not only pumping station management but also crop irrigation scheduling in this regard agrometeorological databases from meteorological stations networks such as the siar network in spain agroclimatic information service for irrigation http eportal magrama gob es websiar inicio aspx may serve as a complementary tool with telecontrol systems when the objective is to centralize the irrigation management in water associations the above also facilitates the implementation of complex management techniques such as rdi in the first part of this work lima et al 2018 the gredrip tool was presented to improve on demand irrigation networks with centralized management where the manager of the irrigation network satisfies the demand of farmers within a short period of time the electricity tariffs the variability of the energy efficiency and the crop water requirements at each plot included in the network area during the whole irrigation season are considered the aim of this study was to evaluate the energy and water saving in an irrigation network by using the gredrip and mopeco tools in centralized management for two crop irrigation strategies in the plots included in the irrigation network area one with full irrigation fi and the other with regulated deficit irrigation rdi the possible financial impact of the rdi application on crop profitability was also analyzed 2 material and methods 2 1 case study this study was conducted during 2015 and 2016 in the soreta irrigation network utm coordinates x 593 160 y 4 345 720 altitude 722 m above sea level located in the province of albacete in the region of castilla la mancha spain soreta is included in hydrogeological unit 08 29 eastern la mancha huem which covers 8500 km2 with 122 000 ha irrigated during the time of the study sprinkler and drip irrigation systems were the most common and 94 of the irrigable area was irrigated with groundwater resources the average availability of irrigation water was approximately 4760 m3 ha 1 year 1 although the hydrological authority determined the maximum volume of groundwater allowed to pump for irrigation according to the evolution of piezometric levels which could be heavily restricted in drought periods jcrmo 2017 soreta is an on demand irrigation network representative of the huem s standard conditions it covers an irrigable area of 550 ha with 323 hydrants where the predominant crops are herbaceous irrigated by sprinkler irrigation systems table 1 three submerged pumps installed at 150 m depth pumped water to a reservoir with a capacity of 23 000 m3 a pumping station composed of 9 pumps 103 kw each one one with variable frequency speed drive and the rest with soft starters delivered water to the irrigation network the pumping station was managed with a fixed pressure head of 52 m to guarantee 35 m at each open hydrant in 2015 and 2016 the average availability of irrigation water was 5000 m3 ha 1 year 1 although an increase in the irrigable area is planned for 2019 in this regard considering that the total amount of water will be the same the water availability per unit area will decrease although sat soreta was managed on demand farmers could irrigate whatever they wanted but only in the cheaper energy rate period p6 during which the price was 0 050 kwh 1 for all the irrigation season this energy rate period was maintained 24 h for the weekend and 8 h from 12 a m to 8 a m during weekdays except for august the days of which were included in p6 2 2 data acquisition in 2015 and 2016 the soreta managers provided the monthly water consumption of the network measured in cubic meters m3 based on water meter readings from each hydrant each hydrant consisted of a butterfly valve suction cup and a hydraulic valve with integrated flow meter equipped with a flow limiting pilot the flow meter was a woltmann type magnetic vertical turbine meter nine monitoring plots were selected 5 in 2015 year and 4 in 2016 for which the actual irrigation scheduling was known the selection criteria were based mainly on farmers willingness to collaborate and supply information the management of irrigation systems and crops was representative of the area the necessary sensors could be installed and evaluations of the on farm irrigation systems carried out on each plot a pressure transducer druck leicester uk previously calibrated over a range of 0 6 bar was installed to monitor irrigation events in one sector during the irrigation season the pressure transducer was installed in the sprinkler riser pipe with a height of 2 3 m which represented the average operating pressure on the plot the transducer was installed at a height of 1 m above the soil surface such that the upstream and downstream distances were greater than 10 times the riser pipe diameter iso 15886 3 2012 to provide stable pressure measurements pressure measurements were recorded at one minute intervals by a datalogger dickson addison in usa and permited the determination of the start and end of each irrigation event the pressure variation during each irrigation and the volume based on the pressure flow relationship determined from evaluations of this irrigation system merriam and keller 1978 in this regard a good approximation of the amount of net water applied in each irrigation event was carried out by using data from irrigation systems evaluated and estimated evaporation and drift losses ortiz et al 2010 it was necessary to estimate the applied gross and net irrigation depth and estimate the crop yield with the mopeco model as shown in the following sections in the nine monitoring plots sensors for monitoring the soil matric potential were installed watermark sensors irrometer corp riverside ca usa at 0 2 and 0 4 m depth these devices were connected to am 400 hansen integrators irrometer corp riverside ca usa to acquire values over eight hour intervals thus the evolution of the soil moisture measured could be compared with the mopeco estimation to check the yield estimated by mopeco depending on the irrigation scheduling used this yield could also be compared with that actually obtained by the farmer at plot level after harvest in 2015 and 2016 the soreta managers provided the monthly electricity consumed by the pumping station active energy kwh based on electricity bills an electricity power analyzer qna 412 model circutor spain was installed between the medium to low

and frequency hz were acquired over ten minute intervals furthermore for the normal operating point of each fixed speed pump the electrical and hydraulic pressure and flow parameters were acquired estimating the efficiency of each pump córcoles et al 2010 for the pump with variable frequency speed drive 8 working points were tested in the same way 2 3 irrigation strategies to analyze the irrigation network performance two irrigation strategies performed using the mopeco model domínguez et al 2011 were proposed a full irrigation fi in which all the water required by the crops could be applied and b deficit irrigation rdi in which a reduction approximately 25 of the fi was implemented this reduction corresponded to the criterion defined by the authority in charge of managing the water resources in the júcar river watershed in drought conditions phcj 2017 it was close to the reductions set for the scenarios of climate change in the júcar river basin proyecto edge 2017 in order to achieve a 25 saving of water reducing income loss it was necessary to determine the irrigation strategy that maximized the profitability for each crop with this aim several works in the huem area were taken as reference domínguez et al 2012a b domínguez et al 2013 2017 in these studies a limited amount of water was optimized under economic standards these authors recommend maximum deficits of up to 15 for the most profitable and or more stress sensitive crops such as horticultural crops and up to 30 for less profitable and or less stress sensitive such as winter cereals thus the eta etm ratios in this work were 0 70 for barley and wheat and 0 80 for garlic onion maize and green peas for the different crops irrigation management schedules were carried out with the mopeco model based on the fao methodology allen et al 1998 using the simplified water balance in the root depth method considering the actual evapotranspiration eta the irrigation water applied the effective rainfall pe estimated using usda curve number 2 methodology scs 1972 nrcs 2004 and water stored in the soil mopeco uses the model proposed by stewart et al 1977 to estimate the actual crop yield ya as a function

biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt and chemical industry bbch scale bleiholder et al 2001 allen et al 1998 doorenbos and kassam 1979 with regard to the vineyard a single irrigation scheduling was used to achieve the rdi strategy in which the eta target is lower than the etm siar clm 2015 table 2 the physical and chemical characteristics of the soils were measured taking samples in 8 monitoring plots which showed no problems for consideration in irrigation schedules the texture was loam sandy 35 sand 35 silt and 30 clay to 40 45 cm in depth and organic matter content was low with values of 1 2 1 5 the total carbonate average was 15 8 with a basic ph 8 4 the average water electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract at the beginning of each irrigation season ecei was 0 37 ds m 1 while the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water eciw was 0 65 ds m 1 these average values were used to perform the soil water balance the irrigation systems in the select plots were evaluated using the methodology proposed by merriam and keller 1978 taking into account the established standards iso 15886 3 2012 for sprinkler irrigation the results were a mean application rate between 5 8 and 6 5 mm h 1 for sprinkler systems with uniformity coefficient cu values between 84 2 and 84 6 for the evaluations in the drip irrigation system the mean application rate was 1 4 mm h 1 and the emission uniformity eu was 88 0 on each plot the average gross application rate based on sprinkler spacing and nozzles diameter was assigned for both defined irrigation strategies fi and rdi according to the irrigation scheduling the duration of each irrigation event was fixed between 0 5 4 0 h with a number of irrigation events per week every 1 3 days which is similar to the management used by farmers in the area thus several irrigation schedules were implemented as a function of the water availability using mopeco and applying ordi methodology for the rdi scenario for each treatment rdi and fi daily soil water balance was calculated for each crop to maximum yields using mopeco cu lópez mata et al 2010 which take into account the estimated soil water content uniformity in the irrigations established during the irrigation season ortiz et al 2010 for the fi strategy the eta etm target was 1 for each crop however for the ordi strategy eta etm were restricted following several studies conducted in the area domínguez et al 2012a b 2013 2017 to achieve an irrigation water saving of approximately 25 lower stress levels were proposed during phenological stages with higher response in yield table 2 these stages were the flowering period in cereals and yield formation in garlic and onion 2 4 daily distribution of open hydrants the gredrip tool lima et al 2018 considered the irrigation time required and the number of irrigation events per week at each plot in order to determine the most appropriate day to irrigate taking into account the energy consumed ew at the pumping station this model facilitated the irrigation network management determining the open hydrants and the starting time of the irrigation event in each week this model required information related to weekly irrigation scheduling which was provided by the mopeco model section 2 3 for fi and rdi strategies the gredrip tool was developed in matlab pratap 2010 in combination with epanet toolkit rossman 2001 the data entered in gredrip were a plot characteristics number of irrigation events 1 3 per week and irrigation time at each one 0 5 h 4 h section 2 3 b irrigation network flow discharged at each hydrant 0 0010 0 0044 m3 s 1 based on the number of sprinkler heads and the number of sectors per plot according to the data collected during the evaluations sections 2 2 and 2 3 head losses in the pipelines were also taken into account considering the hazen williams c roughness coefficient of the pipes based on previous works performed by the authors in this network such as moreno et al 2008 and córcoles et al 2016 all the analyzed cases were managed with a fixed pressure head of 52 m at the pumping station to guarantee 35 m at each open hydrant lima et al 2018 c pumping station considering flow rates required at each hydrant gredrip calculates the flow rate in the main pipe at the pumping station outlet in order to determine the energy efficiency in the pumping station maeeb model for analysis of energy efficiency in pumping stations was utilized moreno et al 2007 using the hydraulic and electric data measured section 2 2 once it was implemented the energy consumption kwh and cost kwh 1 at the pumping station were calculated d energy costs it was necessary to identify the hourly energy costs in soreta every attempt was made for the irrigation events to be conducted in the cheaper energy rate period p6 0 050 kwh section 2 1 2 5 financial impact at plot level mopeco maximized the gross margin gm for each crop for a given volume of irrigation water gredrip obtained the lowest energy cost for the irrigation network by using both tools the financial impact of the reduction in water available for irrigation approximately 25 on the irrigation network performance was analyzed the main crops at soreta were evaluated table 1 representing approximately 92 2015 and 87 2016 of the irrigated area and 90 2015 and 84 2016 of the total water

cap common agricultural policy of the european union subsidies ha 1 which for soreta is about 300 ha 1 in extensive herbaceous crops barley wheat pea and maize and zero in horticultural and trees onion garlic and vineyard the fixed costs those related to the infrastructure are considered in water cost where the energy and investment annuity costs are also considered 3 results 3 1 actual water consumption fig 1 shows the monthly irrigation water applied m3 based on data provided by soreta managers and monthly effective rainfall accumulated mm in the 2015 and 2016 irrigation seasons although the total volume of water irrigation and rainfall was similar in both years 1 43 hm3 in 2015 and 1 32 hm3 in 2016 the monthly irrigation water distribution was very different may in 2015 and july in 2016 presented the highest application of irrigation water representing 27 and 29 of the annual irrigation water applied respectively therefore to make management efficient in irrigation networks information related to the annual crop distribution and rainfall are required because together they define the total irrigation water consumption the water applied by the farmers to each crop m3 ha 1 is highly variable table 3 for example for barley or green peas a variation coefficient cv of 54 6 and 157 6 are obtained for horticultural crops which have high production costs and gross margins gms the variability was reduced with cv ranging from 17 2 to 34 3 for onion and garlic respectively regarding soil moisture monitoring tests at each of the 9 monitoring plots data recorded by the sensors were compared to the soil moisture simulated by the mopeco model finding a similar trend between the amount of water in the soil mopeco and the soil matric potential watermark sensors 3 2 actual energy consumed by the pumping system the monthly energy consumed ew by the pumping station kwh fig 2 in both irrigation seasons was very similar to the irrigation water applied fig 1 with may in 2015 and july in 2016 as the months with the highest ew representing approximately 30 and 29 of the total annual ew in addition the daily and hourly energy consumption at the pumping station was analyzed for each irrigation season which conditions the energy costs energy consumption variability is shown in fig 3 representing the ew distribution for two weeks with low and high irrigation water demand for a low water demand week in april fig 3a the actual ew was concentrated during the weekend from 0 to 24 h and could have been enough to supply the crop water requirements on the other hand during a high demand week in july fig 3b ew was recorded on each day of the week during the p6 period rate from 0 to 8 00 h from monday to friday and during the weekend the highest ew period was from 4 00 to 5 00 h during the week the rest of the time 8 00 to 24 h little energy was required in order to maintain the pressure in the network 3 3 irrigation schedules rdi and fi strategies the stage duration ranged from 161 days for barley year 2015 to 215 days for green peas 2015 year and total irrigation water requirements were estimated between 1458 m3 ha 1 di for green peas in 2016 and 9444 m3 ha 1 fi for onion in 2016 as an example table 4 shows the irrigation schedule for onion in 2016 by applying ordi methodology the actual eta etm ratio could exceed the eta etm target if unexpected rainfalls occur this is because in some cases the actual eta etm ratio is about 5 higher than the eta etm target ratio the number of irrigation events recommended during the week is obtained from mopeco simulation table 4 and the hourly starting time for irrigation at each open hydrant is obtained from gredrip lima et al 2018 3 4 irrigation network perfomance using gredrip for rdi and fi strategies 3 4 1 water volume distribution each week gredrip determined the starting time combination at each hydrant considering the number of irrigation events calculated by mopeco e g table 4 table 5 shows the simulated accumulated water volume m3 distribution for each day of the week in the two proposed strategies fi and rdi the rdi strategy proposed reduced irrigation water consumption for all crops in the network by approximately 25 on average compared to the fi strategy table 5 in both strategies and irrigation seasons approximately 60 of the water was applied during weekends the actual irrigation water applied 1 32 and 1 43 hm3 in 2015 and 2016 respectively table 5 was 30 lower than simulated irrigation water volumes for the fi strategy the comparison between irrigation water applied per unit irrigated area in 2015 and 2016 is shown in table 6 for each irrigation strategy in 2015 the simulated irrigation water applied was 8 higher than in 2016 this is mainly related to the difference between crop distribution and climate conditions on the other hand the actual irrigation water applied was 9 lower in 2015 than in 2016 3 4 2 energy consumed in 2016 actual energy consumed per unit irrigated area ea table 7 and water applied table 5 were 2 and 8 higher respectively than in 2015 in both irrigation seasons simulated ea in rdi strategy was 25 lower than fi strategy similar to the reduction of water applied comparing both irrigation strategies table 5 in 2015 actual ea was very similar to the fi strategy but the actual water applied was 35 lower than in fi table 5 however the actual ea was 24 higher than in rdi strategy although the actual water applied was 13 lower than in rdi tables 5 and 7 in 2016 the actual ea was 11 higher than in fi strategy even though the actual water applied was 22 lower than in fi for rdi the actual ea and water applied were 46 and 4 higher than that simulated the energy consumed ew per irrigation water pumped and its cost ecw are shown in table 8 although water and ea in the fi and rdi strategies were different in each irrigation season table 7 the energy consumed per irrigation water pumped and its cost reached similar values in both cases table 8 hence gredrip succesfully reduced the energy cost of the pumping station for different operating conditions in both irrigation seasons the ew and ecw values obtained using gredrip were 30 and 35 lower respectively than the current management in soreta table 8 these results demonstrate the gredrip tool s adaptability to different water demands in the network 3 5 financial impact of centralized management of the irrigation network the financial impact related to the reduction of the total water available in an irrigation network may be estimated by calculating gm of crops with this aim table 9 summarizes variable costs and incomes for the main crops in soreta by simulating rdi and fi strategies in 2015 and 2016 as the actual energy costs were similar to those simulated for the fi strategy and higher than in the rdi strategy it is expected that in both irrigation management strategies greater gms would be obtained than those actually obtained by the farmers since the expected crop yields would be higher and the energy costs would be lower in the irrigable area extensive herbaceous crops represented more than 50 of the total irrigated area table 1 most of these crops barley wheat or green peas generated limited incomes resulting in low gms table 9 however the possible gm reduction when deficit irrigation is applied to those crops might be negligible because the reduction of incomes can be made up for by the possible reduction in the crop production costs in this study rdi strategy simulation was associated with financial losses of between 6 ha 1 peas in 2016 and 200 ha 1 barley in 2015 in comparison with fi although this could vary mainly depending on the climatic conditions of the irrrigation season and the sale price of crops exceptionally a low sale price of crops together with very unfavorable environmental conditions might cause gm in rdi strategy to be greater than fi e g pea in 2015 for other herbaceous crops such as maize with higher gm than barley or wheat deficit irrigation strategies involve higher loss of gm in fact the simulation of rdi strategy in maize reduced gm by about 60 in comparison with the fi strategy accounting for 350 and 380 ha 1 loss in 2015 and 2016 respectively horticultural crops onion and garlic represented between 10 and 12 of the irrigated area but the financial impact on the network income was very high moreover these crops are subjected to high changes in harvest sale price because of this any reduction of water available rdi strategies would cause a high loss of gm in this work gm simulation was reduced by about 500 ha 1 for onion and 2000 ha 1 for garlic table 9 by applying rdi in comparison with fi in the vineyard just the deficit irrigation strategy simulation was considered so the variation of gm in 2015 and 2016 was due to the grape sale price and the variability in the climatic conditions especially rainfall once the effect that reduction of available irrigation water might have on yields and gm of each crop table 9 was simulated the financial impact over all the irrigable area was analyzed hence for fi and rdi besides gm for each crop the total gm that would be obtained in soreta considering the actual crops distribution table 1 in 2015 and 2016 was simulated table 10 summarized overall crop gm in soreta by using gredrip and mopeco for the two irrigation managements at plot scale m1 m2 which were established depending on the available water a regarding the proposed irrigation m1 management without water restriction when applying fi strategy to the main crops in soreta gm was 482 851 1199 ha 1 and 339 007 914 ha 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively interannual difference was mainly due to garlic only cultivated in 2015 whose financial impact in 2015 was 240 386 50 of total gm in 2015 b the second management system considered a reduction of 25 m2 in the total water used in m1 applying rdi in the main crops in comparison to m1 the energy savings using m2 management were 26 table 7 being 6243 in 2015 15 5 ha 1 and 5461 14 7 ha 1 in 2016 in addition with m2 management crops yields also decreased where gm loss was 30 in 2015 and 16 in 2016 with respect to m1 total gm lost in soreta was 144 999 360 ha 1 in 2015 and 53 152 143 ha 1 in 2016 therefore rdi strategies generate substantial financial losses so if water is available in soreta the application of these strategies is not recommended c a third irrigation management system was proposed no water restriction for horticultural crops to reduce the high gm losses in the irrigation network applying rdi to all the crops m3 management in this way the recommendations of other authors in the area domínguez et al 2017 and the general management trend followed by farmers in soreta were considered regarding m1 m3 management would save about 17 of water while with m2 the saving is 25 hence gm in soreta would decrease about 9 with financial losses of 45 058 112 ha 1 and 31 594 85 ha 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively 3 6 discussion gredrip reduces the energy costs at the pumping station lima et al 2018 and is adapted to different crop managements and water requirements while the mopeco model may optimize the financial distribution of the irrigation water available for each crop which would increase the water productivity yields and gm of crops domínguez et al 2012a the actual water volume consumed in the soreta case study is similar to the simulated rdi strategy and lower than that simulated in fi strategy so deficit irrigation strategies were generally applied in soreta but without proper irrigation planning table 5 the high variability in the water applied to most crops is related to the fact that farmers follow different irrigation strategies associated with their production objectives as well as the lack of information on applying adequate irrigation scheduling the most important reason for farmers to apply deficit irrigation strategies is the high water costs in the irrigable area 0 12 m 3 including the water extraction from the aquifer water pumped to the network and management and maintenance costs moreover in the irrigable area energy costs have increased considerably which is impacting on irrigation management for example in 2007 and 2008 the water cost was about 0 07 m 3 moreno et al 2010 with actual irrigation water applied in soreta of 3 10 hm3 2007 and 2 65 hm3 2008 in this regard by using the actual water volume consumed the irrigation scheduling calculated by mopeco would increase the crop yields in the irrigation network area the financial results obtained in this study were similar to those of others carried out in the area such as that by domínguez et al 2017 who recommended limiting the use of deficit irrigation techniques in herbaceous crops so when irrigation water availability is limited ordi strategy can help improve the overall profitability on farms by reducing water applied in herbaceous crops with low gm while not reducing it in horticultural crops with high gm generally deficit irrigation is used by the farmers in the soreta case study for example in spring crops actual average irrigation water supplied by farmers was 10 lower than the rdi strategy on the other hand in maize and onion actual average irrigation water supplied was similar to the fi strategy in garlic which is a high profit crop where the total cost of water represents about 12 of total crop costs the irrigation water applied significantly exceeded the water required by fi strategy 40 higher in the case study the actual water volume applied showed that farmers follow a rdi strategy but it cannot be considered as optimized the strategy proposed with the mopeco model using optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi however is optimized and can help farmers improve the use of this technology increasing the agronomic and financial productivity of irrigation water in this regard although the farmers achieved water savings in comparison to the simulated results this did not result in energy cost savings at the pumping station because the start times of the irrigation events were not properly distributed using gredrip however this distribution is possible 4 conclusions to achieve efficient management in an irrigation network annual planning is required considering crop distribution and climatic conditions which will determine the temporal and spatial distribution of the irrigation water to be applied one of the main novelties of the gredrip tool is to simulate the behavior of an on demand irrigation network considering the actual irrigation scheduling of crops included in the network area during the whole irrigation season for this integrated management the energy efficiency of the pumping stations and the variability of the energy tariffs on each day and at each hour of the day during the irrigation season as well as the crop water requirements at each plot based on optimized crop irrigation scheduling need to be considered in this study by applying regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies water consumed per unit irrigated area was 15 higher and 3 lower with respect to the actual irrigation water applied in 2015 and 2016 respectively nevertheless energy consumed per unit of irrigated area ea was 24 2015 and 32 2016 lower when applying rdi strategies and gredrip thus the energy irrigation water volume ratio was reduced from 0 33 0 35 kw h m 3 in actual consumption to 0 23 kw h m 3 32 lower by applying gredrip the gredrip tool can be used as a decision support system dss for collective irrigation networks to reduce the energy consumed and costs at the pumping station for several water demand conditions according to the crop irrigation scheduling in the irrigated area analyzed the use of gredrip and mopeco tools indicate that it may be interesting to apply rdi to crops such as winter cereals but it is not beneficial for horticultural crops onion and garlic where a significant drop in gross margin can be generated under arid and semiarid climatic conditions with scarce water resources the use of models such as mopeco and gredrip can help improve management and increase efficiency in the use of water and energy improving the profitability of agriculture in addition both tools can be useful for centralized network management and irrigation scheduling

11141,the aim of the gredrip model part i is to provide centralized management of an irrigation network with a minimum energy cost at the pumping station based on irrigation scheduling to guarantee crop water requirements in the irrigation network in this paper the combined use of gredrip and mopeco models was used to improve water and energy consumption by applying regulated deficit irrigation rdi to crops in the soreta irrigation network albacete spain for crop distribution and weather conditions during irrigation seasons 2015 and 2016 the mopeco model was used to determine irrigation schedules and to estimate the relationship between irrigated crop yield and net water applied the aim of this paper was to validate the gredrip model under different water demand conditions and to study the financial impact on the irrigation network under drought conditions results show that gredrip is suitable for management of an irrigation network such as soreta reducing the energy cost by 32 in comparison with the current situation the financial analysis carried out shows that a 25 reduction in water consumption would have reduced the gross margin gm in soreta by 30 from 1199 to 839 ha 1 in 2015 and 16 from 914 to 771 ha 1 in 2016 when rdi is applied to all crops when rdi is only applied to less profitable crops extensive herbaceous but not horticultural crops such as onion or garlic a gm reduction of only 9 is obtained under 2015 and 2016 conditions respectively the water saved could be used for other purposes such as increasing the crop area with higher gm or simply to recharge the aquifer at risk of overexploitation which would greatly benefit the environment the combined use of gredrip and mopeco can help to improve water and energy management in irrigation networks through crop irrigation scheduling this can increase the profitability of agriculture by analyzing the financial effects of different irrigation management systems keywords optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi gross margin gredrip mopeco models energy costs 1 introduction the lack of water resources is one of the main handicaps for agriculture in semiarid regions which is one the most water demanding sectors the lack of water resources the progressive increase in energy prices as well as the low price of harvests in the international market are conditioning the profitability of farms located in these regions this situation may be exacerbated as a result of global warming therefore climate change will affect the production of crops which may decrease food security and agricultural income in certain areas and also generate excessive use of resources such as groundwater and energy to compensate for these shortages in short water scarcity will worsen in these regions which will see their growth rates decline due to water related impacts on agriculture health and incomes facing the challenges presented by this situation requires a combination of methodologies and technologies including improving efficiency in the use of natural resources enhancing the design and management of the means of production developing and transferring technology and knowledge to the producers analyzing scenarios for advising farmers and technicians about the most suitable strategies for facing extreme situations and providing decision makers with tools and reports for the development of policies that can improve the resilience of agricultural systems to these threats garcía vila and fereres 2012 huang et al 2012 jacobsen et al 2012 in this regard techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi english and raja 1996 which involves control of the water stress level for maximum crop yield can reduce production costs increasing water use efficiency and profitability per unit of water consumed fereres and soriano 2007 lópez urrea et al 2009 the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi strategy may be of interest to determine the water deficit at each phenological stage that reaches the highest yield for a certain overall objective of water deficit domínguez et al 2012a this methodology may be combined with models like mopeco economic optimization model for irrigation water management ortega et al 2004 to stimulate the effect of this strategy on final yield and gross margin gm and to study its use from the financial point of view the ordi strategy has been calibrated for the main extensive crops in castilla la mancha clm spain such as maize domínguez et al 2012b onion domínguez et al 2012c garlic domínguez et al 2013 and barley lópez urrea et al 2017 and in other countries such as brazil carvalho et al 2014 léllis et al 2017 or argentina garbero et al 2014 in on demand irrigation networks water and energy consumption and their temporal evolution depend on crop distribution the management of an irrigation network involves the use of tools to estimate and predict evolution of water consumption for each of the irrigated crops for managers of irrigation networks it is necessary to establish the hydraulic and energetic management characteristics in each network gestar aliod et al 1998 estrada et al 2009 and the relationship with the water applied to the crops several tools have been developed to improve efficiency of water and energy use in on demand pressurized irrigation networks jiménez bello et al 2011 navarro navajas et al 2012 rodríguez díaz et al 2012 most of these studies did not consider variation in pumping station efficiency at each combination of flow discharge and pressure head preferring to establish fixed pumping station efficiency other studies zaccaria et al 2013 gonzález perea et al 2016 considered the irrigation scheduling at plot scale or studied the interaction between the irrigation system and energy consumption at the pumping station khadra et al 2016 in these studies although the crop water demand is considered it is focused on average flow discharge in a peak period demand or taking into account the probability of opening each hydrant considering a fixed crop distribution hence these works do not consider crop water requirements over a complete irrigation season compared to the actual management of the irrigated plots in this respect for integrated management of the network it is necessary to use tools that consider several aspects such as the energy efficiency of the pumping stations and their work range moreno et al 2007 fernández garcía et al 2014 córcoles et al 2016 the influence of the variability of the energy tariffs on each day and at each hour of the day during the irrigation season fernández garcía et al 2016 as well as the crop water requirements at each plot based on crop irrigation scheduling gonzález perea et al 2016 centralized management of the network can be useful to improve water and energy efficiency considering not only pumping station management but also crop irrigation scheduling in this regard agrometeorological databases from meteorological stations networks such as the siar network in spain agroclimatic information service for irrigation http eportal magrama gob es websiar inicio aspx may serve as a complementary tool with telecontrol systems when the objective is to centralize the irrigation management in water associations the above also facilitates the implementation of complex management techniques such as rdi in the first part of this work lima et al 2018 the gredrip tool was presented to improve on demand irrigation networks with centralized management where the manager of the irrigation network satisfies the demand of farmers within a short period of time the electricity tariffs the variability of the energy efficiency and the crop water requirements at each plot included in the network area during the whole irrigation season are considered the aim of this study was to evaluate the energy and water saving in an irrigation network by using the gredrip and mopeco tools in centralized management for two crop irrigation strategies in the plots included in the irrigation network area one with full irrigation fi and the other with regulated deficit irrigation rdi the possible financial impact of the rdi application on crop profitability was also analyzed 2 material and methods 2 1 case study this study was conducted during 2015 and 2016 in the

drive and the rest with soft starters delivered water to the irrigation network the pumping station was managed with a fixed pressure head of 52 m to guarantee 35 m at each open hydrant in 2015 and 2016 the average availability of irrigation water was 5000 m3 ha 1 year 1 although an increase in the irrigable area is planned for 2019 in this regard considering that the total amount of water will be the same the water availability per unit area will decrease although sat soreta was managed on demand farmers could irrigate whatever they wanted but only in the cheaper energy rate period p6 during which the price was 0 050 kwh 1 for all the irrigation season this energy rate period was maintained 24 h for the weekend and 8 h from 12 a m to 8 a m during weekdays except for august the days of which were included in p6 2 2 data acquisition in 2015 and 2016 the soreta managers provided the monthly water consumption of the network measured in cubic meters m3 based on water meter readings from each hydrant each hydrant consisted of a butterfly valve suction cup and a hydraulic valve with integrated flow meter equipped with a flow limiting pilot the flow meter was a woltmann type magnetic vertical turbine meter nine monitoring plots were selected 5 in 2015 year and 4 in 2016 for which the actual irrigation scheduling was known the selection criteria were based mainly on farmers willingness to collaborate and supply information the management of irrigation systems and crops was representative of the area the necessary sensors could be installed and evaluations of the on farm irrigation systems carried out on each plot a pressure transducer druck leicester uk previously calibrated over a range of 0 6 bar was installed to monitor irrigation events in one sector during the irrigation season the pressure transducer was installed in the sprinkler riser pipe with a height of 2 3 m which represented the average operating pressure on the plot the transducer was installed at a height of 1 m above the soil surface such that the upstream and downstream distances were greater than 10 times the riser pipe diameter iso 15886 3 2012 to provide stable pressure measurements pressure measurements were recorded at one minute intervals by a datalogger dickson addison in usa and permited the determination of the start and end of each irrigation event the pressure variation during each irrigation and the volume based on the pressure flow relationship determined from evaluations of this irrigation system merriam and keller 1978 in this regard a good approximation of the amount of net water applied in each irrigation event was carried out by using data from irrigation systems evaluated and estimated evaporation and drift losses ortiz et al 2010 it was necessary to estimate the applied gross and net irrigation depth and estimate the crop yield with the mopeco model as shown in the following sections in the nine monitoring plots sensors for monitoring the soil matric potential were installed watermark sensors irrometer corp riverside ca usa at 0 2 and 0 4 m depth these devices were connected to am 400 hansen integrators irrometer corp riverside ca usa to acquire values over eight hour intervals thus the evolution of the soil moisture measured could be compared with the mopeco estimation to check the yield estimated by mopeco depending on the irrigation scheduling used this yield could also be compared with that actually obtained by the farmer at plot level after harvest in 2015 and 2016 the soreta managers provided the monthly electricity consumed by the pumping station active energy kwh based on electricity bills an electricity power analyzer qna 412 model circutor spain was installed between the medium to low voltage transformer and the start of the pumping station thus the values of the main electrical parameters voltage v electrical current a active and reactive power kw active and reactive energy kwh and frequency hz were acquired over ten minute intervals furthermore for the normal operating point of each fixed speed pump the electrical and hydraulic pressure and flow parameters were acquired estimating the efficiency of each pump córcoles et al 2010 for the pump with variable frequency speed drive 8 working points were tested in the same way 2 3 irrigation strategies to analyze the irrigation network performance two irrigation strategies performed using the mopeco model domínguez et al 2011 were proposed a full irrigation fi in which all the water required by the crops could be applied and b deficit irrigation rdi in which a reduction approximately 25 of the fi was implemented this reduction corresponded to the criterion defined by the authority in charge of managing the water resources in the júcar river watershed in drought conditions phcj 2017 it was close to the reductions set for the scenarios of climate change in the júcar river basin proyecto edge 2017 in order to achieve a 25 saving of water reducing income loss it was necessary to determine the irrigation strategy that maximized the profitability for each crop with this aim several works in the huem area were taken as reference domínguez et al 2012a b domínguez et al 2013 2017 in these studies a limited amount of water was optimized under economic standards these authors recommend maximum deficits of up to 15 for the most profitable and or more stress sensitive crops such as horticultural crops and up to 30 for less profitable and or less stress sensitive such as winter cereals thus the eta etm ratios in this work were 0 70 for barley and wheat and 0 80 for garlic onion maize and green peas for the different crops irrigation management schedules were carried out with the mopeco model based on the fao methodology allen et al 1998 using the simplified water balance in the root depth method considering the actual evapotranspiration eta the irrigation water applied the effective rainfall pe estimated using usda curve number 2 methodology scs 1972 nrcs 2004 and water stored in the soil mopeco uses the model proposed by stewart et al 1977 to estimate the actual crop yield ya as a function

fao allen et al 1998 doorenbos and kassam 1979 adapted to local studies domínguez et al 2012b 2013 siar clm 2015 table 2 both coefficients were related to the phenological stages of crops by using the biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt and chemical industry bbch scale bleiholder et al 2001 allen et al 1998 doorenbos and kassam 1979 with regard to the vineyard a single irrigation scheduling was used to achieve the rdi strategy in which the eta target is lower than the etm siar clm 2015 table 2 the physical and chemical characteristics of the soils were measured taking samples in 8 monitoring plots which showed no problems for consideration in irrigation schedules the texture was loam sandy 35 sand 35 silt and 30 clay to 40 45 cm in depth and organic matter content was low with values of 1 2 1 5 the total carbonate average was 15 8 with a basic ph 8 4 the average water electrical conductivity of the saturated soil extract at the beginning of each irrigation season ecei was 0 37 ds m 1 while the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water eciw was 0 65 ds m 1 these average values were used to perform the soil water balance the irrigation systems in the select plots were evaluated using the methodology proposed by merriam and keller 1978 taking into account the established standards iso 15886 3 2012 for sprinkler irrigation the results were a mean application rate between 5 8 and 6 5 mm h 1 for sprinkler systems with uniformity coefficient cu values between 84 2 and 84 6 for the evaluations in the drip irrigation system the mean application rate was 1 4 mm h 1 and the emission uniformity eu was 88 0 on each plot the average gross application rate based on sprinkler spacing and nozzles diameter was assigned for both defined irrigation strategies fi and rdi according to the irrigation scheduling the duration of each irrigation event was fixed between 0 5 4 0 h with a number of irrigation events per week every 1 3 days which is similar to the management used by farmers in the area thus several irrigation schedules were implemented as a function of the water availability using mopeco and applying ordi methodology for the rdi scenario for each treatment rdi and fi daily soil water balance was calculated for each crop to maximum yields using mopeco cu lópez mata et al 2010 which take into account the estimated soil water content uniformity in the irrigations established during the irrigation season ortiz et al 2010 for the fi strategy the eta etm target was 1 for each crop however for the ordi strategy eta etm were restricted following several studies conducted in the area domínguez et al 2012a b 2013 2017 to achieve an irrigation water saving of approximately 25 lower stress levels were proposed during phenological stages with higher response in yield table 2 these stages were the flowering period in cereals and yield formation in garlic and onion 2 4 daily distribution of open hydrants the gredrip tool lima et al 2018 considered the irrigation time required and the number of irrigation events per week at each plot in order to determine the most appropriate day to irrigate taking into account the energy consumed ew at the pumping station this model facilitated the irrigation network management determining the open hydrants and the starting time of the irrigation event in each week this model required information related to weekly irrigation scheduling which was provided by the mopeco model section 2 3 for fi and rdi strategies the gredrip tool was developed in matlab pratap 2010 in combination with epanet toolkit rossman 2001 the data entered in gredrip were a plot characteristics number of irrigation events 1 3 per week and irrigation time at each one 0 5 h 4 h section 2 3 b irrigation network flow discharged at each hydrant 0 0010 0 0044 m3 s 1 based on the number of sprinkler heads and the number of sectors per plot according to the data collected during the evaluations sections 2 2 and 2 3 head losses in the pipelines were also taken into account considering the hazen williams c roughness coefficient of the pipes based on previous works performed by the authors in this network such as moreno et al 2008 and córcoles et al 2016 all the analyzed cases were managed with a fixed pressure head of 52 m at the pumping station to guarantee 35 m at each open hydrant lima et al 2018 c pumping station considering flow rates required at each hydrant gredrip calculates the flow rate in the main pipe at the pumping station outlet in order to determine the energy efficiency in the pumping station maeeb model for analysis of energy efficiency in pumping stations was utilized moreno et al 2007 using the hydraulic and electric data measured section 2 2 once it was implemented the energy consumption kwh and cost kwh 1 at the pumping station were calculated d energy costs it was necessary to identify the hourly energy costs in soreta every attempt was made for the irrigation events to be conducted in the cheaper energy rate period p6 0 050 kwh section 2 1 2 5 financial impact at plot level mopeco maximized the gross margin gm for each crop for a given volume of irrigation water gredrip obtained the lowest energy cost for the irrigation network by using both tools the financial impact of the reduction in water available for irrigation approximately 25 on the irrigation network performance was analyzed the main crops at soreta were evaluated table 1 representing approximately 92 2015 and 87 2016 of the irrigated area and 90 2015 and 84 2016 of the total water

cap common agricultural policy of the european union subsidies ha 1 which for soreta is about 300 ha 1 in extensive herbaceous crops barley wheat pea and maize and zero in horticultural and trees onion garlic and vineyard the fixed costs those related to the infrastructure are considered in water cost where the energy and investment annuity costs are also considered 3 results 3 1 actual water consumption fig 1 shows the monthly irrigation water applied m3 based on data provided by soreta managers and monthly effective rainfall accumulated mm in the 2015 and 2016 irrigation seasons although the total volume of water irrigation and rainfall was similar in both years 1 43 hm3 in 2015 and 1 32 hm3 in 2016 the monthly irrigation water distribution was very different may in 2015 and july in 2016 presented the highest application of irrigation water representing 27 and 29 of the annual irrigation water applied respectively therefore to make management efficient in irrigation networks information related to the annual crop distribution and rainfall are required because together they define the total irrigation water consumption the water applied by the farmers to each crop m3 ha 1 is highly variable table 3 for example for barley or green peas a variation coefficient cv of 54 6 and 157 6 are obtained for horticultural crops which have high production costs and gross margins gms the variability was reduced with cv ranging from 17 2 to 34 3 for onion and garlic respectively regarding soil moisture monitoring tests at each of the 9 monitoring plots data recorded by the sensors were compared to the soil moisture simulated by the mopeco model finding a similar trend between the amount of water in the soil mopeco and the soil matric potential watermark sensors 3 2 actual energy consumed by the pumping system the monthly energy consumed ew by the pumping station kwh fig 2 in both irrigation seasons was very similar to the irrigation water applied fig 1 with may in 2015 and july in 2016 as the months with the highest ew representing approximately 30 and 29 of the total annual ew in addition the daily and hourly energy consumption at the pumping station was analyzed for each irrigation season which conditions the energy costs energy consumption variability is shown in fig 3 representing the ew distribution for two weeks with low and high irrigation water demand for a low water demand week in april fig 3a the actual ew was concentrated during the weekend from 0 to 24 h and could have been enough to supply the crop water requirements on the other hand during a high demand week in july fig 3b ew was recorded on each day of the week during the p6 period rate from 0 to 8 00 h from monday to friday and during the weekend the highest ew period was from 4 00 to 5 00 h during the week the rest of the time 8 00 to 24 h little energy was required in order to maintain the pressure in the network 3 3 irrigation schedules rdi and fi strategies the stage duration ranged from 161 days for barley year 2015 to 215 days for green peas 2015 year and total irrigation water requirements were estimated between 1458 m3 ha 1 di for green peas in 2016 and 9444 m3 ha 1 fi for onion in 2016 as an example table 4 shows the irrigation schedule for onion in 2016 by applying ordi methodology the actual eta etm ratio could exceed the eta etm target if unexpected rainfalls occur this is because in some cases the actual eta etm ratio is about 5 higher than the eta etm target ratio the number of irrigation events recommended during the week is obtained from mopeco simulation table 4 and the hourly starting time for irrigation at each open hydrant is obtained from gredrip lima et al 2018 3 4 irrigation network perfomance using gredrip for rdi and fi strategies 3 4 1 water volume distribution each week gredrip determined the starting time combination at each hydrant considering the number of irrigation events calculated by mopeco e g table 4 table 5 shows the simulated accumulated water volume m3 distribution for each day of the week in the two proposed strategies fi and rdi the rdi strategy proposed reduced irrigation water consumption for all crops in the network by approximately 25 on average compared to the fi strategy table 5 in both strategies and irrigation seasons approximately 60 of the water was applied during weekends the actual irrigation water applied 1 32 and 1 43 hm3 in 2015 and 2016 respectively table 5 was 30 lower than simulated irrigation water volumes for the fi strategy the comparison between irrigation water applied per unit irrigated area in 2015 and 2016 is shown in table 6 for each irrigation strategy in 2015 the simulated irrigation water applied was 8 higher than in 2016 this is mainly related to the difference between crop distribution and climate conditions on the other hand the actual irrigation water applied was 9 lower in 2015 than in 2016 3 4 2 energy consumed in 2016 actual energy consumed per unit irrigated area ea table 7 and water applied table 5 were 2 and 8 higher respectively than in 2015 in both irrigation seasons simulated ea in rdi strategy was 25 lower than fi strategy similar to the reduction of water applied comparing both irrigation strategies table 5 in 2015 actual ea was very similar to the fi strategy but the actual water applied was 35 lower than in fi table 5 however the actual ea was 24 higher than in rdi strategy although the actual water applied was 13 lower than in rdi tables 5 and 7 in 2016 the actual ea was 11 higher than in fi strategy even though the actual water applied was 22 lower than in fi for rdi the actual ea and water applied were 46 and 4 higher than that simulated the energy consumed ew per irrigation water pumped and its cost ecw are shown in table 8 although water and ea in the fi and rdi strategies were different in each irrigation season table 7 the energy consumed per irrigation water pumped and its cost reached similar values in both cases table 8 hence gredrip succesfully reduced the energy cost of the pumping station for different operating conditions in both irrigation seasons the ew and ecw values obtained using gredrip were 30 and 35 lower respectively than the current management in soreta table 8 these results demonstrate the gredrip tool s adaptability to different water demands in the network 3 5 financial impact of centralized management of the irrigation network the financial impact related to the reduction of the total water available in an irrigation network may be estimated by calculating gm of crops with this aim table 9 summarizes variable costs and incomes for the main crops in soreta by simulating rdi and fi strategies in 2015 and 2016 as the actual energy costs were similar to those simulated for the fi strategy and higher than in the rdi strategy it is expected that in both irrigation management strategies greater gms would be obtained than those actually obtained by the farmers since the expected crop yields would be higher and the energy costs would be lower in the irrigable area extensive herbaceous crops represented more than 50 of the total irrigated area table 1 most of these crops barley wheat or green peas generated limited incomes resulting in low gms table 9 however the possible gm reduction when deficit irrigation is applied to those crops might be negligible because the reduction of incomes can be made up for by the possible reduction in the crop production costs in this study rdi strategy simulation was associated with financial losses of between 6 ha 1 peas in 2016 and 200 ha 1 barley in 2015 in comparison with fi although this could vary mainly depending on the climatic conditions of the irrrigation season and the sale price of crops exceptionally a low sale price of crops together with very unfavorable environmental conditions might cause gm in rdi strategy to be greater than fi e g pea in 2015 for other herbaceous crops such as maize with higher gm than barley or wheat deficit irrigation strategies involve higher loss of gm in fact the simulation of rdi strategy in maize reduced gm by about 60 in comparison with the fi strategy accounting for 350 and 380 ha 1 loss in 2015 and 2016 respectively horticultural crops onion and garlic represented between 10 and 12 of the irrigated area but the financial impact on the network income was very high moreover these crops are subjected to high changes in harvest sale price because of this any reduction of water available rdi strategies would cause a high loss of gm in this work gm simulation was reduced by about 500 ha 1 for onion and 2000 ha 1 for garlic table 9 by applying rdi in comparison with fi in the vineyard just the deficit irrigation strategy simulation was considered so the variation of gm in 2015 and 2016 was due to the grape sale price and the variability in the climatic conditions especially rainfall once the effect that reduction of available irrigation water might have on yields and gm of each crop table 9 was simulated the financial impact over all the irrigable area was analyzed hence for fi and rdi besides gm for each crop the total gm that would be obtained in soreta considering the actual crops distribution table 1 in 2015 and 2016 was simulated table 10 summarized overall crop gm in soreta by using gredrip and mopeco for the two irrigation managements at plot scale m1 m2 which were established depending on the available water a regarding the proposed irrigation m1 management without water restriction when applying fi strategy to the main crops in soreta gm was 482 851 1199 ha 1 and 339 007 914 ha 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively interannual difference was mainly due to garlic only cultivated in 2015 whose financial impact in 2015 was 240 386 50 of total gm in 2015 b the second management system considered a reduction of 25 m2 in the total water used in m1 applying rdi in the main crops in comparison to m1 the energy savings using m2 management were 26 table 7 being 6243 in 2015 15 5 ha 1 and 5461 14 7 ha 1 in 2016 in addition with m2 management crops yields also decreased where gm loss was 30 in 2015 and 16 in 2016 with respect to m1 total gm lost in soreta was 144 999 360 ha 1 in 2015 and 53 152 143 ha 1 in 2016 therefore rdi strategies generate substantial financial losses so if water is available in soreta the application of these strategies is not recommended c a third irrigation management system was proposed no water restriction for horticultural crops to reduce the high gm losses in the irrigation network applying rdi to all the crops m3 management in this way the recommendations of other authors in the area domínguez et al 2017 and the general management trend followed by farmers in soreta were considered regarding m1 m3 management would save about 17 of water while with m2 the saving is 25 hence gm in soreta would decrease about 9 with financial losses of 45 058 112 ha 1 and 31 594 85 ha 1 in 2015 and 2016 respectively 3 6 discussion gredrip reduces the energy costs at the pumping station lima et al 2018 and is adapted to different crop managements and water requirements while the mopeco model may optimize the financial distribution of the irrigation water available for each crop which would increase the water productivity yields and gm of crops domínguez et al 2012a the actual water volume consumed in the soreta case study is similar to the simulated rdi strategy and lower than that simulated in fi strategy so deficit irrigation strategies were generally applied in soreta but without proper irrigation planning table 5 the high variability in the water applied to most crops is related to the fact that farmers follow different irrigation strategies associated with their production objectives as well as the lack of information on applying adequate irrigation scheduling the most important reason for farmers to apply deficit irrigation strategies is the high water costs in the irrigable area 0 12 m 3 including the water extraction from the aquifer water pumped to the network and management and maintenance costs moreover in the irrigable area energy costs have increased considerably which is impacting on irrigation management for example in 2007 and 2008 the water cost was about 0 07 m 3 moreno et al 2010 with actual irrigation water applied in soreta of 3 10 hm3 2007 and 2 65 hm3 2008 in this regard by using the actual water volume consumed the irrigation scheduling calculated by mopeco would increase the crop yields in the irrigation network area the financial results obtained in this study were similar to those of others carried out in the area such as that by domínguez et al 2017 who recommended limiting the use of deficit irrigation techniques in herbaceous crops so when irrigation water availability is limited ordi strategy can help improve the overall profitability on farms by reducing water applied in herbaceous crops with low gm while not reducing it in horticultural crops with high gm generally deficit irrigation is used by the farmers in the soreta case study for example in spring crops actual average irrigation water supplied by farmers was 10 lower than the rdi strategy on the other hand in maize and onion actual average irrigation water supplied was similar to the fi strategy in garlic which is a high profit crop where the total cost of water represents about 12 of total crop costs the irrigation water applied significantly exceeded the water required by fi strategy 40 higher in the case study the actual water volume applied showed that farmers follow a rdi strategy but it cannot be considered as optimized the strategy proposed with the mopeco model using optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi however is optimized and can help farmers improve the use of this technology increasing the agronomic and financial productivity of irrigation water in this regard although the farmers achieved water savings in comparison to the simulated results this did not result in energy cost savings at the pumping station because the start times of the irrigation events were not properly distributed using gredrip however this distribution is possible 4 conclusions to achieve efficient management in an irrigation network annual planning is required considering crop distribution and climatic conditions which will determine the temporal and spatial distribution of the irrigation water to be applied one of the main novelties of the gredrip tool is to simulate the behavior of an on demand irrigation network considering the actual irrigation scheduling of crops included in the network area during the whole irrigation season for this integrated management the energy efficiency of the pumping stations and the variability of the energy tariffs on each day and at each hour of the day during the irrigation season as well as the crop water requirements at each plot based on optimized crop irrigation scheduling need to be considered in this study by applying regulated deficit irrigation rdi strategies water consumed per unit irrigated area was 15 higher and 3 lower with respect to the actual irrigation water applied in 2015 and 2016 respectively nevertheless energy consumed per unit of irrigated area ea was 24 2015 and 32 2016 lower when applying rdi strategies and gredrip thus the energy irrigation water volume ratio was reduced from 0 33 0 35 kw h m 3 in actual consumption to 0 23 kw h m 3 32 lower by applying gredrip the gredrip tool can be used as a decision support system dss for collective irrigation networks to reduce the energy consumed and costs at the pumping station for several water demand conditions according to the crop irrigation scheduling in the irrigated area analyzed the use of gredrip and mopeco tools indicate that it may be interesting to apply rdi to crops such as winter cereals but it is not beneficial for horticultural crops onion and garlic where a significant drop in gross margin can be generated under arid and semiarid climatic conditions with scarce water resources the use of models such as mopeco and gredrip can help improve management and increase efficiency in the use of water and energy improving the profitability of agriculture in addition both tools can be useful for centralized network management and irrigation scheduling

environmentally sustainable this study therefore investigated nitrogen n and phosphorus p dynamics in soil irrigated with dewats effluent a field study with banana and taro in a randomised complete block design with three blocks and two irrigation treatments dewats effluent without fertiliser vs tap water fertiliser was carried out over a period of 992 days at the newlands mashu research site

groundwater gradient of 0 035 m m 1 2 2 experimental design and trial management a field experiment was laid out in a randomised complete block design with three blocks replicates and two irrigation treatments i e dewats effluent with no fertiliser applied vs tap water plus fertiliser application as recommended by the soil fertility section cedara department of agriculture and rural development kzn the fertilisers were applied at a rate of 250 kg n ha 1 annum 1 as urea 46 n and 269 kg k ha 1 annum 1 as kcl 52 k urea was applied in eight split applications per each year while kcl was applied in three split applications the soil p test was greater than the target soil test and so no p fertiliser was applied the test crops used in the study were banana musa paradisiaca with taro colacasia esculentum grown as an intercrop the experiment was conducted over two growing seasons which totalled 992 days for both crops the crops were planted on 13 november 2013 and during the first 201 days effluent could not be used for irrigation due to technical problems and so all treatments during that period were watered with tap water two types of dewats effluent were used during the study i e hfcw effluent dewats effluent after the second of the constructed wetlands at the study site was used from 201 to 504 days after planting first harvest during the second cropping cycle irrigation was switched to af effluent dewats effluent after the af but before the wetlands irrigation with af effluent was done from 504 to 992 days an esp me drip irrigation controller was used for irrigation scheduling the effluent was pumped from the dewats to a 10 l capacity jojo tank where it passed through a rainbird irrigation system comprised of automatic self cleaning screen filters which prevented clogging of drippers and pipes the effluent was further pumped to the field netafim drippers were calibrated to deliver 2 l of effluent per cycle a fixed amount of 5 5 mm irrigation depth was applied

natal according to standard methods the non affiliated soil analysis work committee and soil science society of south africa 1990 2 5 nitrogen and phosphorus leaching nutrient leaching during the study period was monitored using the wfds leachates were collected from the wfds from 295 days after planting after heavy rainfall events and when the wfds were full as signalled by their visual indicator samples from the wfds were collected by extracting water through a 2 mm diameter pipe connected to the below ground water collector using a 60 ml syringe leachates were analysed for inorganic n and p p o 4 3 p using a nova 60 merck spectroquant merck millipore german following standard methods apha 2005 2 6 groundwater monitoring six piezometers 1 m deep were installed in different locations fig 1 installation of piezometers was done according to methods described by rasiah et al 2005 polyvinyl chloride pipes 50 mm diameter and 1 2 m long were perforated and the bottom of the pipe covered with 250 μm polyester cloth to filter the water entering they were then inserted into holes bored with a bucket auger 50 mm diameter the water levels were monitored during heavy rainfall periods using a homemade electric sounding device water level meter the device responded to water by emitting light and sound the depth from the ground surface to the end of the device sensor was measured using a measuring tape and recorded as water level below the ground surface water samples collected from the piezometers at random intervals during the experimental period were analysed for inorganic n and p as described for the wfd samples apha 2005 2 7 crop nutrient uptake banana plant tissue analysis was done after each harvest 504 and 992 days after planting banana leaf tissues were collected from the third upper fully developed leaves on the centre of the lamina blade at flowering stage taro tissue samples were collected from the corms after the first crop harvest taro tissue samples were not collected during the second season since they failed to establish well the collected samples were bulked to form a composite sample for each plot and oven dried at 70 c for 72

information at newlands mashu over the 992 days experimental period is presented in fig 2 evapotranspiration was higher than rainfall throughout the whole experimental period except for july 2015 and 2016 when it was very low very high rainfall was reported in may and july 2016 compared to other months 3 2 effluent characterisation the af effluent was much higher in n h 4 n and p compared to the hfcw effluent but lower in no3 n table 2 in common with other domestic wastewaters the effluents used contain very low quantities of heavy metals bame et al 2013 2014 musazura et al 2015 and thus these were not considered further within the scope of this investigation 3 3 soil chemical properties mean squares for soil chemical properties at two different depths 0 3 and 0 6 m over three sampling periods showed significant differences at different soil depths for organic c p 0 01 and extractable p p 0 001 soil ph significantly differed between irrigation treatments p 0 01 there was a significant difference in total n p 0 01 and n o 3 n p 0 001 over the three sampling periods significant interactions between soil depth and time were observed with regards to total inorganic n p 0 05 and n h 4 n p 0 01 all other comparisons were non significant the concentrations of extractable p and organic c at different depths combined for all irrigation treatments and different sampling times are given in table 3 higher concentrations of extractable p and organic c were observed in the 0 3 m depth compared to 0 6 m depth the soil ph values for the two irrigation treatments combined for all soil depths and sampling intervals are shown in fig 3 the soil ph was higher in the dewats treatments than in tap water fertiliser treatments concentrations of total n and n o 3 n over three sampling times combined for all irrigation treatments and soil depths are reported in table 4 high concentrations of total n were found 504 days after planting and the values were not significantly different before planting and at 992 days after planting the concentrations of n o 3 n significantly decreased from planting to 504 days after planting later n o 3 n significantly increased and attained a very high value at 992 days after planting fig 4 describes the soil total inorganic n and n h 4 n contents between the two soil depths over different sampling periods the soil n h 4 n content increased with time the highest increase was attained in the 0 3 m soil depth at 992 days after planting 3 4 nitrogen and phosphorus leaching there was a significant interaction between irrigation treatment depth and time p 0 05 on the concentrations of n leached from 295 to 331 days after planting there were generally high n concentrations in leachates from all treatments and depths fig 5 as the growing period progressed concentrations stabilised in all treatments until 853 days after planting the n concentrations in the dewats treatment at 0 3 m began to rise at 899 days after planting reaching a significantly high value of 244 mg l 1 at 992 days after planting fig 5 significant differences p 0 001 over time were found with respect to p leaching the average concentrations of inorganic p in soil leachates monitored between 295 and 992 days after planting are shown in fig 6 phosphorus increased from 0 1 mg l 1 295 days after planting to reach a maximum concentration of 9 97 mg l 1 702 days after planting which later declined to a concentration of 2 5 mg l 1 3 5 groundwater monitoring the average water levels were generally lower in piezometers p1 and p2 0 7 m and 0 59 m below ground level respectively compared to the field plots piezometers p3 0 35 m p4 0 37 m p5 0 36 m table 5 the water levels monitored between december 2015 and august 2016 varied in the different piezometers i e p1 0 4 0 81 m below ground level p2 0 44 0 70 m below ground level p3 0 1 0 49 m below ground level p4 0 12 0 53 m below ground level and p5 0 13 0 46 m below ground level no water was detected in the piezometer p6 outside and below the field plots throughout the period studied the means for n concentrations from the different treatments are shown in fig 7 the n o 3 n concentrations in samples from the wfds were very high in the dewats treatment at 0 3 m 36 3 mg l 1 compared to the dewats treatment at 0 5 m 13 3 mg l 1 and tap water fertiliser at 0 5 m 12 2 mg l 1 the water table had the lowest concentration of n o 3 n 3 4 mg l 1 3 6 crop nutrient uptake the mean values for n and p taken up by banana were n dewats 553 kg ha 1 tap water fertiliser 533 kg ha 1 and p dewats 35 kg ha 1 tap water fertiliser 34 kg ha 1 in the taro crop 250 kg n ha 1 were taken up in the dewats treatment and 173 kg n ha 1 in the tap water fertiliser treatment taro p uptake was 55 kg ha 1 dewats treatment and 46 kg ha 1 tap water fertiliser treatment there were no significant differences p 0 05 in n and p uptake and dry biomass between the irrigation treatments for both banana and taro results not shown 4 discussion 4 1 soil chemical properties a significantly higher soil ph in soil fertigated with dewats effluent fig 3 could have been due to basic cations supplied by the effluent as reported by several authors bame et al 2014 mulidzi et al 2016 singh et al 2012 however the soil ph did not significantly differ p 0 05 over time results not shown this could have been due to the short experimental period as slight changes have been reported over long term studies al omron et al 2012 rattan et al 2005 xu et al 2010 organic carbon decreased with soil depth regardless of irrigation treatments table 3 and this is expected in all soils fink et al 2016 souza et al 2014 non significant differences in organic c between irrigation treatments shows that the effluent did not add much dissolved organic matter due to dewats treatment which removes dissolved organic matter reynaud and buckley 2016 soil extractable p decreased with soil depth table 3 due to precipitation and adsorption processes within the upper soil layers these processes are driven by different factors including soil ph barrow 2016 mineralogy and management practices fink et al 2016 the soil at newlands mashu has a clay loam topsoil musazura et al 2015 which has a high p sorption capacity due to p retention in the top 0 3 m of the soil its movement to deeper soil layers was low as reported by bame et al 2013 the n o 3 n concentrations increased significantly in the 0 3 m depth table 4 this could be attributed to the low hydraulic conductivity of the soil musazura et al 2015 allowing nutrients to accumulate in the upper layers a decrease in n o 3 n concentrations from planting to 554 days after planting table 4 showed that the hfcw effluent did not provide excess n the large increase from 504 to 992 days after planting was attributed to fertigation using af effluent furthermore af effluent could have supplied more dissolved organic matter which stimulated microbial activity and thus increased the nitrification process the ability of treated wastewater to increase soil n o 3 n is well documented bame et al 2013 darwesh 2015 sahrawat 2008 soil total n organic inorganic n content significantly increased 504 days after planting compared to before planting initial and 992 days after planting table 4 considering the experimental time frame such changes were not expected over such a short period brady and weil 2016 and the causes remain to be investigated increased soil n h 4 n and total inorganic n over time in all irrigation treatments were found fig 4 the concentrations were significantly higher in the dewats treatment 0 3 m after the second season 992 days after planting application of urea tap water fertiliser and increased irrigation with af effluent which contained high n h 4 n content dewats treatment table 2 were the main causes the sepane soil at newlands mashu has a high cation exchange capacity and hence retains positively charged cations such as n h 4 bame et al 2013 allowing its accumulation in the upper layer 0 3 m of the soil profile 4 2 nitrogen and phosphorus leaching irrigation using dewats effluent commenced from 201 days after planting and leachates were collected from 295 days after planting high n concentrations in all treatments were observed fig 4 during the period between 295 and 331 days after planting this is attributed to mineralisation and nitrification after soil disturbance around the wfds and low uptake by plants as described by fessehazion et al 2011 as the growing period progressed concentrations stabilised in all treatments until 853 days after planting when they began to increase especially in dewats effluent plots 0 3 m depth heavy rainfall events in july and august 2016 coupled with the applied irrigation did not increase n concentrations in leachates collected at lower soil depths 0 5 m depth indicating restricted deep percolation these findings are consistent with results for residual no3 n fig 4 a high soil n concentration that exceeds crop requirements is a potential environmental pollutant and can be leached to lower depths depending on irrigation and rainfall brady and weil 2016 pescod 1992 usepa 2012 it is therefore important to consider on farm practices such as use of high efficiency irrigation systems drip irrigation efficiently supplies water to meet crop water requirements without loading excess nutrients if a correct scheduling is done variations in leachate p concentrations over time fig 6 were probably driven by p desorption from the soil colloids souza et al 2014 associated p desorption rates with concentrations of organic acids especially citrate which compete with p for sorption sites on the soil colloids the formation of organic acids is driven by several factors including temperatures which vary seasonally brady and weil 2016 however this is not the case with the durban climate therefore soil p dynamics were driven by precipitation and adsorption processes while its increase in soil solution were due to dissolution and desorption leading to subsequent uptake by crops 4 3 groundwater monitoring water levels table 5 ranged between 0 1 and 0 8 m below ground being deeper in piezometers p1 and p2 upslope from the experimental site than those within the field p3 p5 this was attributed to the continuous irrigation within the field the high clay content of the subsoil and the presence of 2 1 expanding clays bame et al 2013 resulting in accumulation of water the soil at the site has low saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat especially in layers between 0 3 1 m some negligible ksat values have been reported musazura et al 2015 and this coupled with the continuous irrigation which prevented shrinking of the 2 1 clay implies that pollutant movement towards the groundwater was less likely to occur the restricted deep percolation of water provides adequate time for losses through evapotranspiration and increased uptake of n and p by the crops as well as other losses through denitrification the average n o 3 n concentration 3 mg l 1 found in the piezometers fig 7 was below the who 2017 minimum standard for drinking water of 10 mg l 1 however this may be affected in other instances by the area of the irrigated land and the volume of irrigation applied the leaching of n o 3 is aggravated by high rainfall it is therefore of utmost importance to consider irrigation management practices such as leaving room for rain as well as installation of subsurface drainage systems to harvest the drained water and nutrients for recycling by irrigation pescod 1992 high concentrations of pathogens coliforms in the effluent table 2 are of environmental concern their attenuation in the soil depends on residence time in the soil adsorption and deactivation rate which are affected by transport processes as well as their concentration in the effluent therefore the potential for surface water and groundwater contamination is influenced by factors that affect soil water infiltration and erosion i e soil texture structure and erodibility topography slope surface roughness rainfall amount and intensity vegetation cover and management practices tillage residue management the impact on surface water bodies will be greater in areas prone to erosion due to high soil erodibility poor vegetation cover steep slope and poor agricultural management practices when exposed to high rainfall intensity the effect of these factors will be compounded if the surface water bodies are close to the site of irrigation on the other hand areas dominated by sandy soils and receiving high rainfall are prone to groundwater contamination from wastewater irrigation with high pathogen concentrations the effluent after the hfcw had a significantly reduced microbial load table 2 to close to but still above the who 2006 irrigation water quality guideline for unrestricted use 1000 cfu 100 ml 1 category a storage of effluent can further influence significant pathogen reduction who 2006 therefore it would currently be categorized as category b where the usage of such water should employ special management practices such as crop selection not for use for vegetables consumed raw wastewater application measures such as drip irrigation systems and human exposure control wearing protective clothing although the presence of heavy metals in dewats effluents has been shown to be negligible bame et al 2013 and thus were not considered in this study they may pose health risks when wastewater in general is used for irrigation on agricultural lands heavy metals are usually prevalent when domestic wastewater is mixed with industrial wastewater elgallal et al 2016 a review by elgallal et al 2016 reported that based on information from several studies treated or partially treated domestic wastewater can be used safely for up to a century without negative impacts to crops groundwater or the food chain from heavy metal contamination despite this the use of treated domestic wastewater having heavy metal concentrations within the fao acceptable limits for irrigation may gradually accumulate within the soil in the long term balkhair and ashraf 2016 such gradual accumulation may compromise human health food production and the environment in general it is therefore of utmost importance to set rules and regulations which provide systematic heavy metal monitoring mechanisms on soils irrigated with wastewater 4 4 crop nutrient analysis the lack of significant differences in plant tissue n and p and dry biomass between the irrigation treatments for both banana and taro showed that the dewats effluent supplied adequate nutrients for these crops these field results confirm the findings of bame et al 2014 who used a similar effluent in pot experiments with maize and musazura et al 2015 in a field trial with swiss chard 5 conclusions there were no significant differences in n and p uptake by the two crops banana and taro regardless of the irrigation treatment irrigation with dewats effluent significantly increased inorganic n and p especially in the 0 3 m depth of the soil phosphorus leaching did not significantly differ between the two irrigation treatments during the growing seasons very high concentrations of inorganic n were found in leachates from the dewats treatment within the 0 3 m soil depth the soil water level within the field could reach up to 0 1 m below ground level showing presence of an impervious layer at the site based on a field scale investigation fertigation using dewats effluent did not pose any groundwater contamination risk as the deep percolation was low in the clay soil however low drainage could cause pollution to nearby rivers through surface runoff hence management practices such as irrigation to meet crop water requirements with room for rainfall and installation of surface and subsurface drainage can be employed with the drained water recycled for irrigation health risks from microbial contamination of near surface water and food especially vegetables consumed raw may be a concern as the effluent used was category b according to who 2006 hence improvement of the effluent from the hfcw is warranted to reduce the microbial count to an acceptable level for its unrestricted agricultural use the study has provided reference information that can be used for modelling studies in the development of robust environmentally safe practical guidelines for the use of dewats effluent for irrigation of agricultural crops furthermore there is room for further investigations on potential for groundwater and surface water contamination at catchment and regional scale using models such as drastic acknowledgements the study was conducted as

11142,municipalities in south africa face problems in providing sanitation to unserved informal settlements in peri urban areas and rural nodes the decentralised wastewater treatment system dewats connected to community ablution blocks can be an option with the treated effluent then applied to agricultural land however the management of treated wastewater through irrigation of crops must be environmentally sustainable this study therefore investigated nitrogen n and phosphorus p dynamics in soil irrigated with dewats effluent a field study with banana and taro in a randomised complete block design with three blocks and two irrigation treatments dewats effluent without fertiliser vs tap water fertiliser was carried out over a period of 992 days at the newlands mashu research site durban south africa data were collected on crop n and p uptake soil chemical properties and nutrient leaching together with groundwater monitoring nitrogen and p uptake was not significantly different p 0 05 between the two irrigation treatments irrigation with dewats effluent increased soil n and p concentrations within the upper 0 3 m implying its importance as a fertiliser source leaching of n and p from dewats effluent treated plots was comparable to that from the tap water fertiliser treatments however to manage excess water in the soil practices such as irrigation to meet crop water requirements with room for rainfall and installation of subsurface drainage when possible can be employed keywords groundwater monitoring nitrate leaching orthophosphate treated wastewater 1 introduction due to rapid urbanization south african municipalities face challenges to provide water and sanitation to residents in informal settlements on city peripheries ashipala and armitage 2011

environment pescod 1992 must be considered this is particularly important considering that the effluent will be produced throughout the year questions that arise include a can agricultural systems with high water and nutrient n and p demanding crops such as banana and taro intercropped be used to utilise water and nutrients from effluent fertigation and b if the crops can remove nutrients what are the impacts on nutrient retention in the soil and deep percolation towards the groundwater by understanding n and p dynamics in a soil planted to banana and taro this investigation aimed to provide information that can be used to produce future practical guidelines for the use of dewats effluent for fertigation the specific objectives were to investigate the effects of dewats effluent on

treatments i e dewats effluent with no fertiliser applied vs tap water plus fertiliser application as recommended by the soil fertility section cedara department of agriculture and rural development kzn the fertilisers were applied at a rate of 250 kg n ha 1 annum 1 as urea 46 n and 269 kg k ha 1 annum 1 as kcl 52 k urea was applied in eight split applications per each year while kcl was applied in three split applications the soil p test was greater than the target soil test and so no p fertiliser was applied the test crops used in the study were banana musa paradisiaca with taro colacasia esculentum grown as an intercrop the experiment was conducted over two growing seasons which totalled 992 days for both crops the crops were planted on 13 november 2013 and during the first 201 days

information at newlands mashu over the 992 days experimental period is presented in fig 2 evapotranspiration was higher than rainfall throughout the whole experimental period except for july 2015 and

hfcw effluent but lower in no3 n table 2 in common with other domestic wastewaters the effluents used contain very low quantities of heavy metals bame et al 2013 2014 musazura et al 2015 and thus these were not considered further within the scope of this investigation 3 3 soil chemical properties mean squares for soil chemical properties at two different depths 0 3 and 0 6 m over three sampling periods showed significant differences at different soil depths for organic c p 0 01 and extractable p p 0 001 soil ph significantly differed between irrigation treatments p 0 01 there was a significant difference in total n p 0 01 and n o 3 n p 0 001 over the three sampling periods significant interactions between soil depth and time were observed with regards to total inorganic n p 0 05 and n h 4 n p 0 01 all other comparisons were non significant the concentrations of extractable p and organic c at different depths combined for all irrigation treatments and different sampling times are given in table 3 higher concentrations of extractable p and organic c were observed in the 0 3 m depth compared to 0 6 m depth the soil ph values for the two irrigation treatments combined for all soil depths and sampling intervals are shown in fig 3 the soil ph was higher in the dewats treatments than in tap water fertiliser treatments concentrations of total n and n o 3 n over three sampling times combined for all irrigation treatments and soil depths are reported in table 4 high concentrations of total n were found 504 days after planting and the values were not significantly different before planting and at 992 days after planting the concentrations of n o 3 n significantly decreased from planting to 504 days after planting later n o 3 n significantly increased and attained a very high value at 992 days after planting fig 4 describes the soil total inorganic n and n h 4 n contents between the two soil depths over different sampling periods the soil n h 4 n content increased with time the highest increase was attained in the 0 3 m soil depth at 992 days after planting 3 4 nitrogen and phosphorus leaching there was a significant interaction between irrigation treatment depth and time p 0 05 on the concentrations of n leached from 295 to 331 days after planting there were generally high n concentrations in leachates from all treatments and depths fig 5 as the growing period progressed concentrations stabilised in all treatments until 853 days after planting the n concentrations in the dewats treatment at 0 3 m began to rise at 899 days after planting reaching a significantly high value of 244 mg l 1 at 992 days after planting fig 5 significant differences p 0 001 over time were found with respect to p leaching the average concentrations of inorganic p in soil leachates monitored between 295 and 992 days after planting are shown in fig 6 phosphorus increased from 0 1 mg l 1 295 days after planting to reach a maximum concentration of 9 97 mg l 1 702 days after planting which later declined to a concentration of 2 5 mg l 1 3 5 groundwater monitoring the average water levels were generally lower in piezometers p1 and p2 0 7 m and 0 59 m below ground level respectively compared to the field plots piezometers p3 0 35 m p4 0 37 m p5 0 36 m table 5 the water levels monitored between december 2015 and august 2016 varied in the different piezometers i e p1 0 4 0 81 m below ground level p2 0 44 0 70 m below ground level p3 0 1 0 49 m below ground level p4 0 12 0 53 m below ground level and p5 0 13 0 46 m below ground level no water was detected in the piezometer p6 outside and below the field plots throughout the period studied the means for n concentrations from the different treatments are shown in fig 7 the n o 3 n concentrations in samples from the wfds were very high in the dewats treatment at 0 3 m 36 3 mg l 1 compared to the dewats treatment at 0 5 m 13 3 mg l 1 and tap water fertiliser at 0 5 m 12 2 mg l 1 the water table had the lowest concentration of n o 3 n 3 4 mg l 1 3 6 crop nutrient uptake the mean values for n and p taken up by banana were n dewats 553 kg ha 1 tap water fertiliser 533 kg ha 1 and p dewats 35 kg

treatment and 46 kg ha 1 tap water fertiliser treatment there were no significant differences p 0 05 in n and p uptake and dry biomass between the irrigation treatments for both banana and taro results not shown 4 discussion 4 1 soil chemical properties a significantly higher soil ph in soil fertigated with dewats effluent fig 3 could have been due to basic cations supplied by the effluent as reported by several authors bame et al 2014 mulidzi et al 2016 singh et al 2012 however the soil ph did not significantly differ p 0 05 over time results not shown this could have been due to the short experimental period as slight changes have been reported over long term studies al omron et al 2012 rattan et al 2005 xu et al 2010 organic carbon decreased with soil depth regardless of irrigation treatments table 3 and this is expected in all soils fink et al 2016 souza et al 2014 non significant differences in organic c between irrigation treatments shows that the effluent did not add much dissolved organic matter due to dewats treatment which removes dissolved organic matter reynaud and buckley 2016 soil extractable p decreased with soil depth table 3 due to precipitation and adsorption processes within the upper soil layers these processes are driven by different factors including soil ph barrow 2016 mineralogy and management practices fink et al 2016 the soil at newlands mashu has a clay loam topsoil musazura et al 2015 which has a high p sorption capacity due to p retention in the top 0 3 m of the soil its movement to deeper soil layers was low as reported by bame et al 2013 the n o 3 n concentrations increased significantly in the 0 3 m depth table 4 this could be attributed to the low hydraulic conductivity of the soil musazura et al 2015 allowing nutrients to accumulate in the upper layers a decrease in n o 3 n concentrations from planting to 554 days after planting table 4 showed that the hfcw effluent did not provide excess n the large increase from 504 to 992 days after planting was attributed to fertigation using af effluent furthermore af effluent could have supplied more dissolved organic matter which stimulated microbial activity and thus increased the nitrification process the ability of treated wastewater to increase soil n o 3 n is well documented bame et al 2013 darwesh 2015 sahrawat 2008 soil total n organic inorganic n content significantly increased 504 days after planting compared to before planting initial and 992 days after planting table 4 considering the experimental time frame such changes were not expected over such a short period brady and weil 2016 and the causes remain to be investigated increased soil n h 4 n and total inorganic n over time in all irrigation treatments were found fig 4 the concentrations were significantly higher in the dewats treatment 0 3 m after the second season 992 days after planting application of urea tap water fertiliser and increased irrigation with af effluent which contained high n h 4 n content dewats treatment table 2 were the main causes the sepane soil at newlands mashu has a high cation exchange capacity and hence retains positively charged cations such as n h 4 bame et al 2013 allowing its accumulation in the upper layer 0 3 m of the soil profile 4 2 nitrogen and phosphorus leaching irrigation using dewats effluent commenced from 201 days after planting and leachates were collected from 295 days after planting high n concentrations in all treatments were observed fig 4 during the period between 295 and 331 days after planting this is attributed to mineralisation and nitrification after soil disturbance around the wfds and low uptake by plants as described by fessehazion et al 2011 as the growing period progressed concentrations stabilised in all treatments until 853 days after planting when they began to increase especially in dewats effluent plots 0 3 m depth heavy rainfall events in july and august 2016 coupled with the applied irrigation did not increase n concentrations in leachates collected at lower soil depths 0 5 m depth indicating restricted deep percolation these findings are consistent with results for residual no3 n fig 4 a high soil n concentration that exceeds crop requirements is a potential environmental pollutant and can be leached to lower depths depending on irrigation and rainfall brady and weil 2016 pescod 1992 usepa 2012 it is therefore important to consider on farm practices such as use of high efficiency irrigation systems drip irrigation efficiently supplies water to meet crop water requirements without loading excess nutrients if a correct scheduling is done variations in leachate p concentrations over time fig 6 were probably driven by p desorption from the soil colloids souza et al 2014 associated p desorption rates with concentrations of organic acids especially citrate which compete with p for sorption sites on the soil colloids the formation of organic acids is driven by several factors including temperatures which vary seasonally brady and weil 2016 however this is not the case with the durban climate therefore soil p dynamics were driven by precipitation and adsorption processes while its increase in soil solution were due to dissolution and desorption leading to subsequent uptake by crops 4 3 groundwater monitoring water levels table 5 ranged between 0 1 and 0 8 m below ground being deeper in piezometers p1 and p2 upslope from the experimental site than those within the field p3 p5 this was attributed to the continuous irrigation within the field the high clay content of the subsoil and the presence of 2 1 expanding clays bame et al 2013 resulting in accumulation of water the soil at the site has low saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat especially in layers between 0 3 1 m some negligible ksat values have been reported musazura et al 2015 and this coupled with the continuous irrigation which prevented shrinking of the 2 1 clay implies that pollutant movement towards the groundwater was less likely to occur the restricted deep percolation of water provides adequate time for losses through evapotranspiration and increased uptake of n and p by the crops as well as other losses through denitrification the average n o 3 n concentration 3 mg l 1 found in the piezometers fig 7 was below the who 2017 minimum standard for drinking water of 10 mg l 1 however this may be affected in other instances by the area of the irrigated land and the volume of irrigation applied the leaching of n o 3 is aggravated by high rainfall it is therefore of utmost importance to consider irrigation management practices such as leaving room for rain as well as installation of subsurface drainage systems to harvest the drained water and nutrients for recycling by irrigation pescod 1992 high concentrations of pathogens coliforms in the effluent table 2 are of environmental concern their attenuation in the soil depends on residence time in the soil adsorption and deactivation rate which are affected by transport processes as well as their concentration in the effluent therefore the potential for surface water and groundwater contamination is influenced by factors that affect soil water infiltration and erosion i e soil texture structure and erodibility topography slope surface roughness rainfall amount and intensity vegetation cover and management practices tillage residue management the impact on surface water bodies will be greater in areas prone to erosion due to high soil erodibility poor vegetation cover steep slope and poor agricultural management practices when exposed to high rainfall intensity the effect of these factors will be compounded if the surface water bodies are close to the site of irrigation on the other hand areas dominated by sandy soils and receiving high rainfall are prone to groundwater contamination from wastewater irrigation with high pathogen concentrations the effluent after the hfcw had a significantly reduced microbial load table 2 to close to but still above the who 2006 irrigation water quality guideline for unrestricted use 1000 cfu 100 ml 1 category a storage of effluent can further influence significant pathogen reduction who 2006 therefore it would currently be categorized as category b where the usage of such water should employ special management practices such as crop selection not for use for vegetables consumed raw wastewater application measures such as drip irrigation systems and human exposure control wearing protective clothing although the presence of heavy metals in dewats effluents has been shown to be negligible bame et al 2013 and thus were not considered in this study they may pose health risks when wastewater in general is used for irrigation on agricultural lands heavy metals are usually prevalent when domestic wastewater is mixed with industrial wastewater elgallal et al 2016 a review by elgallal et al 2016 reported that based on information from several studies treated or partially treated domestic wastewater can be used safely for up to a century without negative impacts to crops groundwater or the food chain from heavy metal contamination despite this the use of treated domestic wastewater having heavy metal concentrations within the fao acceptable limits for irrigation may gradually accumulate within the soil in the long term balkhair and ashraf 2016 such gradual accumulation may compromise human health food production and the environment in general it is therefore of utmost importance to set rules and regulations which provide systematic heavy metal monitoring mechanisms on soils irrigated with wastewater 4 4 crop nutrient analysis the lack of significant differences in plant tissue n and p and dry biomass between the irrigation treatments for both banana and taro showed that the dewats effluent supplied adequate nutrients for these crops these field results confirm the findings of bame et al 2014 who used a similar effluent in pot experiments with maize and musazura et al 2015 in a field trial with swiss chard 5 conclusions there were no significant differences in n and p uptake by the two crops banana and taro regardless of the irrigation treatment irrigation with dewats effluent significantly increased inorganic n and p especially in the 0 3 m depth of the soil phosphorus leaching did not significantly differ between the two irrigation treatments during the growing seasons very high concentrations of inorganic n were found in leachates from the dewats treatment within the 0 3 m soil depth the soil water level within the field could reach up to 0 1 m below ground level showing presence of an impervious layer at the site based on a field scale investigation fertigation using dewats effluent did not pose any groundwater contamination risk as the deep percolation was low in the clay soil however low drainage could cause pollution to nearby rivers through surface runoff hence management practices such as irrigation to meet crop water requirements with room for rainfall and installation of surface and subsurface drainage can be employed with the drained water recycled for irrigation health risks from microbial contamination of near surface water and food especially vegetables consumed raw may be a concern as the effluent used was category b according to who 2006 hence improvement of the effluent from the hfcw is warranted to reduce the microbial count to an acceptable level for its unrestricted agricultural use the study has provided reference information that can be used for modelling studies in the development of robust environmentally safe practical guidelines for the use of dewats effluent for irrigation of agricultural crops furthermore there is room for further investigations on potential for groundwater and surface water contamination at catchment and regional scale using models such as drastic acknowledgements the study was conducted as

11143,the coefficient of uniformity cu an important parameter in design of irrigation systems affects the quality and return of investment in irrigation projects significantly and is a good indicator of water losses in this paper a single model was proposed to obtain the cu values in four sprinkler types of zk30 zm22 ambo and luxor average wind speed coarseness index large and small nozzle

and semi arid regions where the development of new water resources is costly talebnejad and sepaskhah 2015 high uniformity of water distribution can increase the water use efficiency as well as the optimal use of existing water resources li 1998 in addition it may increase the quality and quantity of the agricultural products bai and li 2003 dechmi et al 2003 li and rao 2000 mateos et al 1997 seginer 1983 stern and bresler 1983 varlev 1976 many studies have reported the negative effects of non uniformity of water distribution on the product s yield and the water use efficiency letey et al 1984 mantovani et al 1995 warrick and gardner 1983 therefore the uniformity of water distribution is often used to evaluate the performance of sprinkler irrigation systems christiansen 1942 various criteria including wilcox and swailes solomon uniformity coefficient hart and reynolds coefficient and criddle et al s coefficient might be used to determine the uniformity of water distribution in sprinkler irrigation systems quantitatively among others the christiansen s uniformity coefficient is commonly used in irrigation systems maroufpoor et al 2010 nevertheless many hydraulic and atmospheric parameters may affect the uniformity of water distribution at farm scale these parameters include the structure of the sprinkler the spray angle the nozzle diameter operating pressure raiser height the sprinkler spacing and the average wind speed value fukui et al 1980 keller and bliesner 1990 montero et al 2003 playán et al 2006 nonetheless the combined effects of these parameters on each other may increase the complexity of estimating the water distribution uniformity in the farm one of the most important issues with operating sprinkler irrigation systems is investigating the effect of water distribution uniformity on product s yield the common method is to adopt a constant value for uniformity of water distribution at all stages of plant growth de juan et al 1996 li 1998 mantovani et al 1995 orgaz et al 1992 which might contradict the real conditions on the other hand some computer based models have been already utilized for estimation of water distribution uniformity despite they have not comprised comprehensive scopes playán et al 2006 these models may be classified into three groups namely ballistic semi empirical and statistical models granier et al 2003 sayyadi et al 2012 ballistic models are based on the falling droplets from sprinkler and their impact on the soil surface and the vector of involved forces carrión et al 2001 de wrachien and lorenzini 2006 dechmi et al 2004 playán et al 2006 sayyadi et al 2012 yan et al 2010 semi empirical models estimate the water distribution uniformity by processing the initial distribution pattern of the droplets and the effect of wind speed on them han et al 1994 molle and gat 2000 richards and weatherhead 1993 seginer et al 1991 finally the statistical models address the spatial changes of water distribution and the estimation of water distribution uniformity in the farm based on probability distributions molle and gat 2000 sayyadi et al 2012 however these models consider some assumptions and neglect some effective variables and or require a lot of hydraulic and atmospheric data therefore application of these models is difficult for designing managing and operating the irrigation systems dechmi et al 2004 li et al 2015 montero et al 2001 playán et al 2006 yacoubi et al 2010 the measurement of coefficient of uniformity cu for movable sprinkler solid set systems is time consuming the coarseness index ci in eq 1 has been proposed for calculating the wind drift and evaporation losses in sprinkler irrigation systems under different hydraulic conditions keller and bliesner 1990 1 c i 0 032 p 1 3 d in which p is operating pressure of the sprinkler kpa and d is the nozzle diameter mm the distribution pattern of the droplets in each sprinkler is affected by the operating pressure and nozzle diameter kohl 1974 therefore droplet coarseness index can be a proper representative of the droplet sizes that affect the water distribution uniformity so far no attempt has been made about using the coarseness index to estimate the water distribution uniformity in irrigation systems this index can reveal the role of important parameters of operating pressure of the sprinkler as well as the role of nozzle diameter on the droplet size and uniformity in addition due to the high variations in operating pressure and or nozzle diameter in sprinkler irrigation systems large data bases would be needed for modeling the cu values accurately this necessity will be resolved in a desirable manner with application of the coarseness index finally it is necessary to use an appropriate method to estimate the values of cu with an acceptable accuracy and less computational costs in a shorter time period under different operating pressures wind speed and sprinkler spacing values as an alternative to the mentioned methods artificial intelligence ai techniques might be applied for estimating cu values with acceptable performance accuracy in the recent years different artificial

landeras et al 2018 and estimating the friction factor in irrigation pipes najafzadeh et al 2018 the literature review by the authors showed that there are a few studies about the validation of ai models in estimating the water distribution uniformity in the farm hinnell et al 2010 lazarovitch et al 2009 sayyadi et al 2012 the present study focused on the application of ann nf gp nf sc ls svm and gep models to determine the water distribution uniformity for movable sprinkler solid set systems in iran by using the average wind speed coarseness index and sprinkler lateral spacing as input parameters the ability of the studied models in estimating the christiansen s uniformity coefficient cu for different sprinkler spacing using the mentioned variables without considering the type and structure of the sprinkler and other atmospheric parameters is a significant progress in designing and managing the movable sprinkler solid set systems the main objectives of the present study were to investigate 1 the possibility of providing an unique model to estimate the cu values of sprinklers in movable sprinkler solid set systems 2 the capability of coarseness index as a representative of the technical and hydraulic characteristics of the sprinkler in estimating the amount of cu values in movable sprinkler solid set systems the applied models were evaluated using the k fold testing cross validation assessment tool 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments the conducted experiments were carried out at the research farm of the university of kurdistan located at doshan village of sanandaj city i r iran four sprinklers were utilized for modeling the cu values as listed in table 1 the spray angles of the sprinklers were in the range of 22 to 30 which were in the usual range of the produced sprinklers for movable sprinkler solid set systems three sprinkler risers of 100 165 and 200 cm height were used for all the experiments the experiments were typically carried out at four operating pressures of 300 350 400 and 450 kpa in accordance with manufacturer s recommendations and within the minimum and maximum operating pressures of the solid set systems robles et al 2017 four wind speed values domains 0 1 8 1 8 4 5 4 5 6 7 and 6 7 9 m s that were measured every 15 min during the study were considered in this research fig 1 shows the schematic view of the studied system the experimental set up included the water tank high pressure electro pump main pipe bypass pipe volumetric flow measurement device regulator valves barometers sprinkler sprinkler holder and containers to collect samples the experiments were carried out by single sprinkler method and based on iso 7749 1 and iso 7749 2 standards merriam and keller 1978 the single sprinkler method can perfectly reveal the water distribution uniformity in the farm similar to the several sprinklers applied in actual conditions carrión et al 2001 the surrounded area of all the sprinklers was a 100 100 m2 network the standard containers for sampling were used to measure the volume of outlet water from the sprinkler on the vertices of all squares at intervals of 3 m fig 1 each sprinkler was monitored for about 2 h according to the sprinkler throw diameter the numbers of used cylindrical containers with a height of 120 mm and an inner diameter of 96 mm merriam and keller 1978 for tests were in the range of 306 to 552 the mouths of these containers were set at a standard elevation of 0 35 m which was increased as needed to prevent the interference with the crop canopy in order to estimate the evaporation rate during the experiments three containers were utilized the amount of water expected to be collected was approximately equal to the initial water depth in the containers these containers were installed away from the sprinklers under similar conditions to the experiment for measuring the evaporation rate at the end of the experiment the water volume inside the containers was measured 2 2 christiansen s uniformity coefficient in this study the uniformity of water distribution was studied through the christiansen s uniformity coefficient cu as a reference method recommended by the previous studies dechmi et al 2003 li et al 2015 this coefficient can be calculated as follows 2 cu 1 i 1 n x i x n x 100 where xi is the water depth in each container x is the mean value of water depth in the containers and n is the number of measuring containers cu values were calculated after constructing the overlapping network for the various sprinklers spacing in the common ranges 2 3 artificial neural network ann each neural network consists of input hidden and output layers in such a way that these layers are connected by connections of different weights in mathematical modeling of the neurons a data set is used as an input neuron which may be the outputs of other neurons each input is multiplied by its corresponding weight all weighted inputs are then summed up to determine the neuron activity let s assume a problem where there are three different inputs as x1 x2 x3 which are entered the input layer each input neuron is belonged to one of the input signals in addition each signal is multiplied by the corresponding communicational weight consisting of w1 w2 w3 which is briefly represented by the w vector defined as follows eq 3 3 net x w the obtained amounts are collected inside the neuron and the output value is calculated as 4 net x 1 w 1 x 2 w 2 x 3 w 3 i 1 n x i w i the calculated value for the mentioned summation is evaluated by the activity function to determine the neuron s output the shape and manner of the connection of nerve cells in different layers leads to different structures in artificial neural networks shiri and kişi 2011 in this research three layered neural networks with back propagation algorithm tangent sigmoid and linear transfer functions in hidden and output layers respectively were used levenberg marquardt gradient descent gradient descent with adaptive learning rate gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate back propagation gradient descent with momentum and scaled conjugate gradient algorithms were utilized as back propagation algorithms here the trial and error procedure was used to determine the number of hidden layer neurons at each stage of model running fig 2 illustrates the schematic view of the applied ann models 2 4 neural fuzzy system nf nf was firstly introduced by jang 1993 this system is a comprehensive tool for estimating real continuous functions in a limited domain which can be used for any degree of accuracy the fuzzy part of nf model establishes the relationship between the input and output variables called membership functions the parameters of the membership functions are determined using the ann training algorithm based on the following methods 1 backward propagation of errors is used for all parameters of the membership functions 2 a combined method comprising the error post propagation for the parameters of the input membership functions and least squares method for the parameters of the output membership functions more information on nf can be found in jang 1993 and jang et al 1997 there are several methods for establishing the nf structure e g grid partitioning gp and sub clustering sc methods in this study both methods were used membership functions have usually different types e g triangular trimf gaussian gaussmf trapezoidal trapmf pi shaped pimf and di shaped dimf for each membership function various numbers of 2 3 and 4 were tested and the best membership function was finally determined based on the lowest root mean square error rmse values russell and campbell 1996 similarly in the nf sc model different amounts of the radius of influence 0 1 were investigated and the best model was determined based on the lowest rmse a representation of the applied nf model has been illustrated in fig 3 2 5 ls svm model svm is an efficient learning system based on the optimization theory which uses the principles of inductive minimization of structural error and leads to a general optimal solution cortes and vapnik 1995 in svm dual programming is used to solve the equations therefore solving large scale problems using svm may result in high computational cost and complexity of the algorithm in order to solve this problem suykens and osipov 2008 presented the least squares support vector machine ls svm method unlike the svm this method uses linear equations instead of quadratic programming which effectively reduces the complexity of the algorithm therefore there will be a higher computational accuracy than the classical support vector machine chang and lin 2008 the svm regression model can be written as 5 y x i w t q x i b where q xi is the nonlinear transfer function that maps the input vectors into a high dimensional feature space w and b are respectively the weights and the bias of the regression function which is determined by minimizing the objective function as follows 6 min w e b j w e 1 2 w t w γ 2 i 1 n e i 2 subject to 7 y x i w t q x i b e i i 1 2 2 n where γ is the error section regulating parameter and ei is the training data error finally the estimation function of the ls svm model is defined as 8 y x i 1 n a i k x i x j b where k xi xj is the kernel function defined by generating interior product in the feature space suykens and osipov 2008 for sensitivity analysis of the ls svm model the linear polynomial and radial basis function kernels were evaluated 2 6 gene expression programming gep gep was developed by ferreira 2001 in gep linear and simple constant length chromosomes similar to those used in the genetic algorithm and branched structures with different sizes and shapes similar to decomposition trees in genetic programming are combined in this model the first step is to generate the initial population of solutions this can be performed by a random process or using some information about the problem the chromosomes are then expressed as tree expressions which are also evaluated according to a fitness function to determine the suitability of a solution in the problem domain usually the fitness function is evaluated by processing a number of examples of the target problem called fitness attributions if a satisfactory solution is found or the generations reach a certain number the evolution process is stopped and the best solution found is reported on the other hand if the stopping conditions are not found the best solution is kept from the current generation i e elite selection ferreira 2006 in this method various phenomena are modeled using the fitness function linking function mathematical functions and a set of terminals in this study the model was first developed to provide a simple and explicit equation of total data 10 folds according to kisi et al 2013a s recommendation the root relative squared error rrse was selected for the fitness function among the linking functions the addition function was selected by trial and error procedure based on the minimum rmse value a set of mathematical functions usually consists of the main accounting functions of trigonometric functions or any other mathematical functions x2 exp log sin cos or user defined functions which the user believes that they could be suitable for the interpretation of the model in this study five sets of the functions were defined terminal sets were composed of independent variables of the problem ferreira 2001 table 2 summarizes the parameters used in the gep model 2 7 data splitting strategy in the present study cu was simulated as a dependent variable by using average wind speed w the coarseness index large cil and small cis nozzle diameters and sprinkler and lateral spacing ss ls respectively as independent parameters totally 294 data sets were considered for modeling according to different amounts of the coarseness index large and small nozzle diameters average wind speed sprinkler and lateral spacing the common way to evaluate the performance of a model is to divide the data set into two subsets of training and testing an estimation model will be then created with the training data set and evaluated with the testing data set pour ali baba et al 2013 however two questions will be raised including how do the distribution patterns fall into training and testing data sets and what should be the size of the mentioned sub sets to reduce the amount of bias to reduce the bias the k fold cross validation technique was adopted in this study cios et al 2007 shiri et al 2015 in this technique the data set is divided into k sub sections the training data set includes k 1 sections and the testing data set will be the remained section this training and testing processes are repeated k times in such a way that each k section is selected once as a test finally the overall accuracy is calculated from the mean value of k section in this study k was considered as 10 2 8 performance criteria to evaluate the performance of the models three statistical indices including the scatter index si the coefficient of determination r2 and the mean absolute error mae were used as follows 9 si rmse c u o 1 n i 1 n c u oi c u ei 2 c u o 10 mae 1 n i 1 n c u oi c u ei 11 r 2 i 1 n c u oi cu o c u ei cu e i 1 n c u oi cu o 2 i 1 n c u ei cu e 2 2 where cuoi and cuei are the observed and simulated values of the uniformity coefficient respectively c u o and c u e denote the mean of the observed and simulated values of the uniformity coefficient respectively and n is the number of records the perfect values for si mae and r2 are 0 0 and 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 models assessment global error statistics of the applied models have been presented in table 3 the simulations of each k fold stage were pooled together and a global estimation vector was built then the performance evaluation indices were computed for this global matrix therefore the presented statistical indices for each model were referred to the complete data set for modeling the cu with ann technique the input target values were normalized through the following equation 12 x n i a x i x min x max x min b where xni shows the normalized pattern at time i x min and x max stand for the minimum and maximum of the data set and xi is the observed x value at time i the values of a and b coefficients were considered as 0 8 and 0 2 respectively according to kisi et al 2013b the optimum number of hidden neurons of each ann model was selected using a trial and error process by taking into consideration the lowest rmse values at each training process 100 networks were examined the minimum and maximum values of weight decay in hidden layers were 0 0001 and 0 002 respectively fig 4 shows the number of optimal neurons for each algorithm in each test stage the minimum and maximum numbers of selected neurons were 4 and 20 respectively with the exception of gradient descent with momentum gdm and gradient descent gd algorithms the rest of the evaluated ann algorithms gave accurate results the most improvement of the results accuracy was related to levenberg marquardt lm s algorithm with the r2 increase of 13 7 and 18 7 with respect to gdm and gd algorithms respectively further it reduced the mae and si of values by 58 2 and 52 2 against gdm and by 56 and 52 5 against gd the performance improvement by using the scaled conjugate gradient scg with respect to the gdm algorithm was 12 increase in r2 and 57 8 and 53 reductions in mae and si values respectively similar monotonously fluctuating performance improvements could be seen by using gradient descent with adaptive learning rate gda and gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate gdx algorithms however it should be noted that the presented outcomes about different ann configurations have been obtained only for the present case because they have been determined through a trial and error process the global performance indices of the nf models have been also presented in table 3 as can be clearly seen from the table in case of nf gp models the triangular membership function trimf presented the most accurate results among other nf gp models with the lowest si 0 08 and mae 3 662 and the highest r2 0 867 values the optimum nf gp model had 2 3 3 2 and 2 triangular membership functions for the average wind speed coarseness index large and small nozzle diameters sprinkler and lateral spacing respectively as previously mentioned different nf gp structures were evaluated using different membership functions and the number of these functions in order to select the best architecture among others psig membership function gave the worst results with the highest error values by using the nf gp models it was tried to keep the number of nf functions at the minimum 2 3 or 4 to reduce the computational time and cost based on the existence literature kisi and shiri 2012 kisi et al 2013b a trial and error procedure was used to identify the radius of influence for the nf sc model fig 5 shows the different radiuses of anfis sc evaluated in each test stage it is seen that the values of radiuses are generally higher than 0 7 choosing a low value for the radius reduces the categories in the data space too much and consequently increases the rules therefore the proper selection of radius of influence would be essential attending to the ls svm results it might be stated that the polynomial kernel function with the lowest si and mae 0 072 and 3 572 respectively and the highest r2 0 891 values gave the most accurate results as compared with the rbf and linear kernel functions however the rbf results are also comparable to polynomial results with slight differences in the value of indices table 4 sums up the global statistical indices of the gep models different function set of gep technique was examined using the basic operators and other functions according to koza 1994 the primitives functions are the basic mathematical operators i e which can be used nonetheless some other operators can be utilized along with those functions as discussed by shiri et al 2012 and shiri 2017 in this study the f5 function set with the addition linking function gave the most accurate results nevertheless gep has an ability to produce a mathematical expression of the studied phenomenon based on the input and target variables the gep based equation was produced using the all available data set as 13 cu 6 736 cos l s 3 106 2 2 cos 0 739 w 29 776 7 673 2 6 301 cos c i s 2 l s s s w where ss ls w cis and cu denote the sprinkler and lateral spacing average wind speed the coarseness index small nozzle diameter and the uniformity coefficient percentage respectively this might show the lower degree of importance for large nozzle diameter related coarseness index when applying gep although other models might have used it for modeling however those models are black box approaches and such explicit expressions couldn t be obtained by them nevertheless as gep develops the structure and constants of the formulas at the same time the expanse that the site specific constants are implanted in the formulation will determine the transferability of the functions deschaine 2014 although the equation might not be assessed from statistical viewpoint scanning the data through k fold testing technique for assessing the gep model has demonstrated its capability to be adopted and used in the present problem so it would be assumed that the presented expression would stand for all data range similar to the studied case the corresponded gep based expression tree is shown in fig 6 3 2 comparison of the applied models comparing the five applied models for the optimum cases of each model showed that the ann model surpasses the rest of the models with slight differences table 5 sums up the error statistics of the best architectures algorithms used per run for the applied models the maximum difference in the performance accuracy of the applied models was related to gep differences with δsi 0 068 and δmae 3 485 although the value of mae difference seems to be high it should be taken into consideration that this index has the same units as the studied parameter cu therefore higher values in the target observed domain of the data would produce higher mae values moreover analysis of the si difference revealed that gep model has slight difference with ann outcomes therefore it could be concluded that all the evaluated models could be used for modeling the cu based on the obtained statistical indices finally it should be noted that the statistical indices presented in tables 3 5 would be only useful to provide the average optimum performance accuracy which could be obtained for the studied patterns moreover the architectures selected through the average performance accuracy of the test set provided assessing the generalizability of the employed methodologies table 6 presents the statistical indices of the applied models tested per studied sprinkler given that these results are corresponded to specified sprinkler the effect of amalgamated using the data from all sprinkler has been omitted here providing a more detailed analysis of the results per sprinkler separately from the table it is clearly seen that all the applied models have had good ability to simulate the cu values in all types of sprinklers where ann surpassed the other models in all types 3 3 breakdown of models assessment fig 7 illustrates the performance criteria of the applied models for each test stage there are obvious oscillations for the magnitudes of statistical indices of the applied models among the test stages e g per stage of the 10 fold testing it can be observed that the ann model gave the r2 values more than 0 8 or even more than 0 9 in all the cases except for the test sets no 1 to 4 nf gp gives r2 values more than 0 8 while for nf sc this index was higher than 0 8 except for the test sets no 1 3 and 4 in addition except for test sets no 3 and 4 ls svm gives r2 values more than 0 8 finally fluctuations in r2 values for gep model are more obvious than the rest with values around 0 5 for test sets no 1 and 3 regarding the mae score ann always gives the minimum values for this indicator while gep presents the maximum values except for the test sets no 1 4 and 5 the mae values of the rest models are fluctuating through the test stages similar to the r2 variations considering the values of si which takes into account the order of magnitudes of the target parameter it can be found that the ann has the minimum si values but the trend of these variations for the other models is not the same as the variations in mae however it should be noted that the range of changes among the models is less and compared to the real values of the target parameter such differences might be assumed as slight oscillations from the practical viewpoint these observations clearly show the necessity of adopting a complete data scanning strategy here k fold testing for assessing the models otherwise the presented outcomes might be partially valid as the part of data have been ignored from both training and testing stages fig 8 presents the scatter plot and the cu estimation error of the ann model it is clear that the observed estimated values are distributed almost symmetrically around the 1 1 line identity function revealing the promising performance of the model according to the results it was finally found that the ann model is more efficient than the other models and has a good capability for estimating the values of cu which is in agreement with the results obtained by lazarovitch et al 2009 who introduced the ann model as a suitable tool for estimating the water distribution however the present paper uses a complete data set scanning procedure that makes a complete and through partitioning of the available patters to feed the model so not pattern will be unseen by the models when using this data management scenario nonetheless as mentioned before there are slight differences between the applied models so all the used techniques would be of utility for obtaining the values of cu fig 9 shows the scatterplot as well as error variations related to gep model alike to ann model fig 8 obvious overestimations of cu values can be detected from the scatterplots for lower cu magnitudes while there are good matches between the observed and simulated values for higher cu values in summary the use of robust k fold testing data assignment approach seems to be essential by using such models of cu estimations as could be seen from the variations of the statistical indicators this is an important point that the model will be performed each time using a part of data set allowing a through model learning using all available patterns as discussed by martí et al 2013 4 conclusion in this paper the capabilities of ann nf gp nf sc gep and ls svm models were evaluated to simulate the uniformity of water distribution for impact and turbine sprinklers the ability of the studied models to estimate the water distribution uniformity cu regardless of the type and structure of the sprinkler can be a reason for the reliability of the results in other atmospheric conditions for the proper evaluation of the performance of the models the k fold test was used according to the obtained results the ann model with levenberg marquardt algorithm gave the most accurate results also the results of cu modeling in per studied sprinkler showed that all models had the good ability for cu estimation but it was obvious that the ann was surpassed to other models providing an explicit equation for cu by the gep model is one of the main results of this study which can estimate cu values for four sprinkler types and because of its simple application can be used by farmers also the findings of this study can be useful in achieving cu at all stages of plant growth and therefore better product performance the cu estimation by using artificial intelligence techniques without considering the type and structure of the sprinkler and other atmospheric parameters will save time and money for field operations 
11143,the coefficient of uniformity cu an important parameter in design of irrigation systems affects the quality and return of investment in irrigation projects significantly and is a good indicator of water losses in this paper a single model was proposed to obtain the cu values in four sprinkler types of zk30 zm22 ambo and luxor average wind speed coarseness index large and small nozzle diameters and sprinkler lateral spacing were used as input parameters to obtain the cu values through employing the artificial neural networks ann neuro fuzzy grid partitioning nf gp neuro fuzzy sub clustering nf sc least square support vector machine ls svm and gene expression programming gep techniques the available data set consisted of 294 samples that were used to evaluate the proposed methodology the applied techniques were assessed through the robust k fold testing data assignment mode based on the results all the applied models presented good capability in estimating cu the obtained results revealed that the coarseness index large nozzle diameter had the lowest impact on modeling cu is sprinkler irrigation systems keywords coefficient of uniformity gene expression programming k fold testing support vector machines neural networks neuro fuzzy sprinkler irrigation 1 introduction water shortage is a serious problem for agricultural production especially in arid and semi arid regions where the development of new water resources is costly talebnejad and sepaskhah 2015 high uniformity of water distribution can increase the water use efficiency as well as the optimal use of existing water resources li 1998 in addition it may increase the quality and quantity of the agricultural products bai and li 2003 dechmi et al 2003 li and rao 2000 mateos et al 1997 seginer 1983 stern and bresler 1983 varlev 1976 many studies have reported the negative effects of non uniformity of water distribution on the product s yield and the water use efficiency letey et al 1984 mantovani et al 1995 warrick and gardner 1983 therefore the uniformity of water distribution is often used to evaluate the performance of sprinkler irrigation systems christiansen 1942 various criteria including wilcox and swailes solomon uniformity coefficient hart and reynolds coefficient and criddle et al s coefficient might be used to determine the uniformity of water distribution in sprinkler irrigation systems quantitatively among others the christiansen s uniformity coefficient is commonly used in irrigation systems maroufpoor et al 2010 nevertheless many hydraulic and atmospheric parameters may affect the uniformity of water distribution at farm scale these parameters include the structure of the sprinkler the spray angle the nozzle diameter operating pressure raiser height the sprinkler spacing and the average wind speed value fukui et al 1980 keller and bliesner 1990 montero et al 2003 playán et al 2006 nonetheless the combined effects of these parameters on each other may increase the complexity of estimating the water distribution uniformity in the farm one of the most important issues with operating sprinkler irrigation systems is investigating the effect of water distribution uniformity on product s yield the common method is to adopt a constant value for uniformity of water distribution at all stages of plant growth de juan et al 1996 li 1998 mantovani et al 1995 orgaz et al 1992 which might contradict the real conditions on the other hand some computer based models have been already utilized for estimation of water distribution uniformity despite they have not comprised comprehensive scopes playán et al 2006 these models may be classified into three groups namely ballistic semi empirical and statistical models granier et al 2003 sayyadi et al 2012 ballistic models are based on the falling droplets from sprinkler and their impact on the soil surface and the vector of involved forces carrión et al 2001 de wrachien and lorenzini 2006 dechmi et al 2004 playán et al 2006 sayyadi et al 2012 yan et al 2010 semi empirical models estimate the water distribution uniformity by processing the initial distribution pattern of the droplets and the effect of wind speed on them han et al 1994 molle and gat 2000 richards and weatherhead 1993 seginer et al 1991 finally the statistical models address the spatial changes of water distribution and the estimation of water distribution uniformity in the farm based on probability distributions molle and gat 2000 sayyadi et al 2012 however these models consider some assumptions and neglect some effective variables and or require a lot of hydraulic and atmospheric data therefore application of these models is difficult for designing managing and operating the irrigation systems dechmi et al 2004 li et al 2015 montero et al 2001 playán et al 2006 yacoubi et al 2010 the measurement of coefficient of uniformity cu for movable sprinkler solid set systems is time consuming the coarseness index ci in eq 1 has been proposed for calculating the wind drift and evaporation losses in sprinkler irrigation systems under different hydraulic conditions keller and bliesner 1990 1 c i 0 032 p 1 3 d in which p is operating pressure of the sprinkler kpa and d is the nozzle diameter mm the distribution pattern of the droplets in each sprinkler is affected by the operating pressure and nozzle diameter kohl 1974 therefore droplet coarseness index can be a proper representative of the droplet sizes that affect the water distribution uniformity so far no attempt has been made about using the coarseness index to estimate the water distribution uniformity in irrigation systems this index can reveal the role of important parameters of operating pressure of the sprinkler as well as the role of nozzle diameter on the droplet size and uniformity in addition due to the high variations in operating pressure and or nozzle diameter in sprinkler irrigation systems large data bases would be needed for modeling the cu values accurately this necessity will be resolved in a desirable manner with application of the coarseness index finally it is necessary to use an appropriate method to estimate the values of cu with an acceptable accuracy and less computational costs in a shorter time period under different operating pressures wind speed and sprinkler spacing values as an alternative to the mentioned methods artificial intelligence ai techniques might be applied for estimating cu values with acceptable performance accuracy in the recent years different artificial intelligence based approaches e g artificial neural networks ann neuro fuzzy system with grid partition nf gp neuro fuzzy system with subtractive clustering nf sc least squares support vector machine ls svm and gene expression programming gep have been fairly well developed as alternatives to traditional methods in different water resources engineering disciplines different applications of these techniques have been reported in this context including pan evaporation modeling kim et al 2015 modeling the micro irrigation filters martí et al 2013 simulating the surface water groundwater qualitative parameters kisi et al 2013a 2017 estimating dew point temperature shiri et al 2014 modeling soil parameters in the irrigated lands shiri et al 2017a b modeling crop water requirement landeras et al 2018 and estimating the friction factor in irrigation pipes najafzadeh et al 2018 the literature review by the authors showed that there are a few studies about the validation of ai models in estimating the water distribution uniformity in the farm hinnell et al 2010 lazarovitch et al 2009 sayyadi et al 2012 the present study focused on the application of ann nf gp nf sc ls svm and gep models to determine the water distribution uniformity for movable sprinkler solid set systems in iran by using the average wind speed coarseness index and sprinkler lateral spacing as input parameters the ability of the studied models in estimating the christiansen s uniformity coefficient cu for different sprinkler spacing using the mentioned variables without considering the type and structure of the sprinkler and other atmospheric parameters is a significant progress in designing and managing the movable sprinkler solid set systems the main objectives of the present study were to investigate 1 the possibility of providing an unique model to estimate the cu values of sprinklers in movable sprinkler solid set systems 2 the capability of coarseness index as a representative of the technical and hydraulic characteristics of the sprinkler in estimating the amount of cu values in movable sprinkler solid set systems the applied models were evaluated using the k fold testing cross validation assessment tool 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiments the conducted experiments were carried out at the research farm of the university of kurdistan located at doshan village of sanandaj city i r iran four sprinklers were utilized for modeling the cu values as listed in table 1 the spray angles of the sprinklers were in the range of 22 to 30 which were in the usual range of the produced sprinklers for movable sprinkler solid set systems three sprinkler risers of 100 165 and 200 cm height were used for all the experiments the experiments were typically carried out at four operating pressures of 300 350 400 and 450 kpa in accordance with manufacturer s recommendations and within the minimum and maximum operating pressures of the solid set systems robles et al 2017 four wind speed values domains 0 1 8 1 8 4 5 4 5 6 7 and 6 7 9 m s that were measured every 15 min during the study were considered in this research fig 1 shows the schematic view of the studied system the experimental set up included the water tank high pressure electro pump main pipe bypass pipe volumetric flow measurement device regulator valves barometers sprinkler sprinkler holder and containers to collect samples the experiments were carried out by single sprinkler method and based on iso 7749 1 and iso 7749 2 standards merriam and keller 1978 the single sprinkler method can perfectly reveal the water distribution uniformity in the farm similar to the several sprinklers applied in actual conditions carrión et al 2001 the surrounded area of all the sprinklers was a 100 100 m2 network the standard containers for sampling were used to measure the volume of outlet water from the sprinkler on the vertices of all squares at intervals of 3 m fig 1 each sprinkler was monitored for about 2 h according to the sprinkler throw diameter the numbers of used cylindrical containers with a height of 120 mm and an inner diameter of 96 mm merriam and keller 1978 for tests were in the range of 306 to 552 the mouths of these containers were set at a standard elevation of 0 35 m which was increased as needed to prevent the interference with the crop canopy in order to estimate the evaporation rate during the experiments three containers were utilized the amount of water expected to be collected was approximately equal to the initial water depth in the containers these containers were installed away from the sprinklers under similar conditions to the experiment for measuring the evaporation rate at the end of the experiment the water volume inside the containers was measured 2 2 christiansen s uniformity coefficient in this study the uniformity of water distribution was studied through the christiansen s uniformity coefficient cu as a reference method recommended by the previous studies dechmi et al 2003 li et al 2015 this coefficient can be calculated as follows 2 cu 1 i 1 n x i x n x 100 where xi is the water depth in each container x is the mean value of water depth in the containers and n is the number of measuring containers cu values were calculated after constructing the overlapping network for the various sprinklers spacing in the common ranges 2 3 artificial neural network ann each neural network consists of input hidden and output layers in such a way that these layers are connected by connections of different weights in mathematical modeling of the neurons a data set is used as an input neuron which may be the outputs of other neurons each input is multiplied by its corresponding weight all weighted inputs are then summed up to determine the neuron activity let s assume a problem where there are three different inputs as x1 x2 x3 which are entered the input layer each input neuron is belonged to one of the input signals in addition each signal is multiplied by the corresponding communicational weight consisting of w1 w2 w3 which is briefly represented by the w vector defined as follows eq 3 3 net x w the obtained amounts are collected inside the neuron and the output value is calculated as 4 net x 1 w 1 x 2 w 2 x 3 w 3 i 1 n x i w i the calculated value for the mentioned summation is evaluated by the activity function to determine the neuron s output the shape and manner of the connection of nerve cells in different layers leads to different structures in artificial neural networks shiri and kişi 2011 in this research three layered neural networks with back propagation algorithm tangent sigmoid and linear transfer functions in hidden and output layers respectively were used levenberg marquardt gradient descent gradient descent with adaptive learning rate gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate back propagation gradient descent with momentum and scaled conjugate gradient algorithms were utilized as back propagation algorithms here the trial and error procedure was used to determine the number of hidden layer neurons at each stage of model running fig 2 illustrates the schematic view of the applied ann models 2 4 neural fuzzy system nf nf was firstly introduced by jang 1993 this system is a comprehensive tool for estimating real continuous functions in a limited domain which can be used for any degree of accuracy the fuzzy part of nf model establishes the relationship between the input and output variables called membership functions the parameters of the membership functions are determined using the ann training algorithm based on the following methods 1 backward propagation of errors is used for all parameters of the membership functions 2 a combined method comprising the error post propagation for the parameters of the input membership functions and least squares method for the parameters of the output membership functions more information on nf can be found in jang 1993 and jang et al 1997 there are several methods for establishing the nf structure e g grid partitioning gp and sub clustering sc methods in this study both methods were used membership functions have usually different types e g triangular trimf gaussian gaussmf trapezoidal trapmf pi shaped pimf and di shaped dimf for each membership function various numbers of 2 3 and 4 were tested and the best membership function was finally determined based on the lowest root mean square error rmse values russell and campbell 1996 similarly in the nf sc model different amounts of the radius of influence 0 1 were investigated and the best model was determined based on the lowest rmse a representation of the applied nf model has been illustrated in fig 3 2 5 ls svm model svm is an efficient learning system based on the optimization theory which uses the principles of inductive minimization of structural error and leads to a general optimal solution cortes and vapnik 1995 in svm dual programming is used to solve the equations therefore solving large scale problems using svm may result in high computational cost and complexity of the algorithm in order to solve this problem suykens and osipov 2008 presented the least squares support vector machine ls svm method unlike the svm this method uses linear equations instead of quadratic programming which effectively reduces the complexity of the algorithm therefore there will be a higher computational accuracy than the classical support vector machine chang and lin 2008 the svm regression model can be written as 5 y x i w t q x i b where q xi is the nonlinear transfer function that maps the input vectors into a high dimensional feature space w and b are respectively the weights and the bias of the regression function which is determined by minimizing the objective function as follows 6 min w e b j w e 1 2 w t w γ 2 i 1 n e i 2 subject to 7 y x i w t q x i b e i i 1 2 2 n where γ is the error section regulating parameter and ei is the training data error finally the estimation function of the ls svm model is defined as 8 y x i 1 n a i k x i x j b where k xi xj is the kernel function defined by generating interior product in the feature space suykens and osipov 2008 for sensitivity analysis of the ls svm model the linear polynomial and radial basis function kernels were evaluated 2 6 gene expression programming gep gep was developed by ferreira 2001 in gep linear and simple constant length chromosomes similar to those used in the genetic algorithm and branched structures with different sizes and shapes similar to decomposition trees in genetic programming are combined in this model the first step is to generate the initial population of solutions this can be performed by a random process or using some information about the problem the chromosomes are then expressed as tree expressions which are also evaluated according to a fitness function to determine the suitability of a solution in the problem domain usually the fitness function is evaluated by processing a number of examples of the target problem called fitness attributions if a satisfactory solution is found or the generations reach a certain number the evolution process is stopped and the best solution found is reported on the other hand if the stopping conditions are not found the best solution is kept from the current generation i e elite selection ferreira 2006 in this method various phenomena are modeled using the fitness function linking function mathematical functions and a set of terminals in this study the model was first developed to provide a simple and explicit equation of total data 10 folds according to kisi et al 2013a s recommendation the root relative squared error rrse was selected for the fitness function among the linking functions the addition function was selected by trial and error procedure based on the minimum rmse value a set of mathematical functions usually consists of the main accounting functions of trigonometric functions or any other mathematical functions x2 exp log sin cos or user defined functions which the user believes that they could be suitable for the interpretation of the model in this study five sets of the functions were defined terminal sets were composed of independent variables of the problem ferreira 2001 table 2 summarizes the parameters used in the gep model 2 7 data splitting strategy in the present study cu was simulated as a dependent variable by using average wind speed w the coarseness index large cil and small cis nozzle diameters and sprinkler and lateral spacing ss ls respectively as independent parameters totally 294 data sets were considered for modeling according to different amounts of the coarseness index large and small nozzle diameters average wind speed sprinkler and lateral spacing the common way to evaluate the performance of a model is to divide the data set into two subsets of training and testing an estimation model will be then created with the training data set and evaluated with the testing data set pour ali baba et al 2013 however two questions will be raised including how do the distribution patterns fall into training and testing data sets and what should be the size of the mentioned sub sets to reduce the amount of bias to reduce the bias the k fold cross validation technique was adopted in this study cios et al 2007 shiri et al 2015 in this technique the data set is divided into k sub sections the training data set includes k 1 sections and the testing data set will be the remained section this training and testing processes are repeated k times in such a way that each k section is selected once as a test finally the overall accuracy is calculated from the mean value of k section in this study k was considered as 10 2 8 performance criteria to evaluate the performance of the models three statistical indices including the scatter index si the coefficient of determination r2 and the mean absolute error mae were used as follows 9 si rmse c u o 1 n i 1 n c u oi c u ei 2 c u o 10 mae 1 n i 1 n c u oi c u ei 11 r 2 i 1 n c u oi cu o c u ei cu e i 1 n c u oi cu o 2 i 1 n c u ei cu e 2 2 where cuoi and cuei are the observed and simulated values of the uniformity coefficient respectively c u o and c u e denote the mean of the observed and simulated values of the uniformity coefficient respectively and n is the number of records the perfect values for si mae and r2 are 0 0 and 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 models assessment global error statistics of the applied models have been presented in table 3 the simulations of each k fold stage were pooled together and a global estimation vector was built then the performance evaluation indices were computed for this global matrix therefore the presented statistical indices for each model were referred to the complete data set for modeling the cu with ann technique the input target values were normalized through the following equation 12 x n i a x i x min x max x min b where xni shows the normalized pattern at time i x min and x max stand for the minimum and maximum of the data set and xi is the observed x value at time i the values of a and b coefficients were considered as 0 8 and 0 2 respectively according to kisi et al 2013b the optimum number of hidden neurons of each ann model was selected using a trial and error process by taking into consideration the lowest rmse values at each training process 100 networks were examined the minimum and maximum values of weight decay in hidden layers were 0 0001 and 0 002 respectively fig 4 shows the number of optimal neurons for each algorithm in each test stage the minimum and maximum numbers of selected neurons were 4 and 20 respectively with the exception of gradient descent with momentum gdm and gradient descent gd algorithms the rest of the evaluated ann algorithms gave accurate results the most improvement of the results accuracy was related to levenberg marquardt lm s algorithm with the r2 increase of 13 7 and 18 7 with respect to gdm and gd algorithms respectively further it reduced the mae and si of values by 58 2 and 52 2 against gdm and by 56 and 52 5 against gd the performance improvement by using the scaled conjugate gradient scg with respect to the gdm algorithm was 12 increase in r2 and 57 8 and 53 reductions in mae and si values respectively similar monotonously fluctuating performance improvements could be seen by using gradient descent with adaptive learning rate gda and gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate gdx algorithms however it should be noted that the presented outcomes about different ann configurations have been obtained only for the present case because they have been determined through a trial and error process the global performance indices of the nf models have been also presented in table 3 as can be clearly seen from the table in case of nf gp models the triangular membership function trimf presented the most accurate results among other nf gp models with the lowest si 0 08 and mae 3 662 and the highest r2 0 867 values the optimum nf gp model had 2 3 3 2 and 2 triangular membership functions for the average wind speed coarseness index large and small nozzle diameters sprinkler and lateral spacing respectively as previously mentioned different nf gp structures were evaluated using different membership functions and the number of these functions in order to select the best architecture among others psig membership function gave the worst results with the highest error values by using the nf gp models it was tried to keep the number of nf functions at the minimum 2 3 or 4 to reduce the computational time and cost based on the existence literature kisi and shiri 2012 kisi et al 2013b a trial and error procedure was used to identify the radius of influence for the nf sc model fig 5 shows the different radiuses of anfis sc evaluated in each test stage it is seen that the values of radiuses are generally higher than 0 7 choosing a low value for the radius reduces the categories in the data space too much and consequently increases the rules therefore the proper selection of radius of influence would be essential attending to the ls svm results it might be stated that the polynomial kernel function with the lowest si and mae 0 072 and 3 572 respectively and the highest r2 0 891 values gave the most accurate results as compared with the rbf and linear kernel functions however the rbf results are also comparable to polynomial results with slight differences in the value of indices table 4 sums up the global statistical indices of the gep models different function set of gep technique was examined using the basic operators and other functions according to koza 1994 the primitives functions are the basic mathematical operators i e which can be used nonetheless some other operators can be utilized along with those functions as discussed by shiri et al 2012 and shiri 2017 in this study the f5 function set with the addition linking function gave the most accurate results nevertheless gep has an ability to produce a mathematical expression of the studied phenomenon based on the input and target variables the gep based equation was produced using the all available data set as 13 cu 6 736 cos l s 3 106 2 2 cos 0 739 w 29 776 7 673 2 6 301 cos c i s 2 l s s s w where ss ls w cis and cu denote the sprinkler and lateral spacing average wind speed the coarseness index small nozzle diameter and the uniformity coefficient percentage respectively this might show the lower degree of importance for large nozzle diameter related coarseness index when applying gep although other models might have used it for modeling however those models are black box approaches and such explicit expressions couldn t be obtained by them nevertheless as gep develops the structure and constants of the formulas at the same time the expanse that the site specific constants are implanted in the formulation will determine the transferability of the functions deschaine 2014 although the equation might not be assessed from statistical viewpoint scanning the data through k fold testing technique for assessing the gep model has demonstrated its capability to be adopted and used in the present problem so it would be assumed that the presented expression would stand for all data range similar to the studied case the corresponded gep based expression tree is shown in fig 6 3 2 comparison of the applied models comparing the five applied models for the optimum cases of each model showed that the ann model surpasses the rest of the models with slight differences table 5 sums up the error statistics of the best architectures algorithms used per run for the applied models the maximum difference in the performance accuracy of the applied models was related to gep differences with δsi 0 068 and δmae 3 485 although the value of mae difference seems to be high it should be taken into consideration that this index has the same units as the studied parameter cu therefore higher values in the target observed domain of the data would produce higher mae values moreover analysis of the si difference revealed that gep model has slight difference with ann outcomes therefore it could be concluded that all the evaluated models could be used for modeling the cu based on the obtained statistical indices finally it should be noted that the statistical indices presented in tables 3 5 would be only useful to provide the average optimum performance accuracy which could be obtained for the studied patterns moreover the architectures selected through the average performance accuracy of the test set provided assessing the generalizability of the employed methodologies table 6 presents the statistical indices of the applied models tested per studied sprinkler given that these results are corresponded to specified sprinkler the effect of amalgamated using the data from all sprinkler has been omitted here providing a more detailed analysis of the results per sprinkler separately from the table it is clearly seen that all the applied models have had good ability to simulate the cu values in all types of sprinklers where ann surpassed the other models in all types 3 3 breakdown of models assessment fig 7 illustrates the performance criteria of the applied models for each test stage there are obvious oscillations for the magnitudes of statistical indices of the applied models among the test stages e g per stage of the 10 fold testing it can be observed that the ann model gave the r2 values more than 0 8 or even more than 0 9 in all the cases except for the test sets no 1 to 4 nf gp gives r2 values more than 0 8 while for nf sc this index was higher than 0 8 except for the test sets no 1 3 and 4 in addition except for test sets no 3 and 4 ls svm gives r2 values more than 0 8 finally fluctuations in r2 values for gep model are more obvious than the rest with values around 0 5 for test sets no 1 and 3 regarding the mae score ann always gives the minimum values for this indicator while gep presents the maximum values except for the test sets no 1 4 and 5 the mae values of the rest models are fluctuating through the test stages similar to the r2 variations considering the values of si which takes into account the order of magnitudes of the target parameter it can be found that the ann has the minimum si values but the trend of these variations for the other models is not the same as the variations in mae however it should be noted that the range of changes among the models is less and compared to the real values of the target parameter such differences might be assumed as slight oscillations from the practical viewpoint these observations clearly show the necessity of adopting a complete data scanning strategy here k fold testing for assessing the models otherwise the presented outcomes might be partially valid as the part of data have been ignored from both training and testing stages fig 8 presents the scatter plot and the cu estimation error of the ann model it is clear that the observed estimated values are distributed almost symmetrically around the 1 1 line identity function revealing the promising performance of the model according to the results it was finally found that the ann model is more efficient than the other models and has a good capability for estimating the values of cu which is in agreement with the results obtained by lazarovitch et al 2009 who introduced the ann model as a suitable tool for estimating the water distribution however the present paper uses a complete data set scanning procedure that makes a complete and through partitioning of the available patters to feed the model so not pattern will be unseen by the models when using this data management scenario nonetheless as mentioned before there are slight differences between the applied models so all the used techniques would be of utility for obtaining the values of cu fig 9 shows the scatterplot as well as error variations related to gep model alike to ann model fig 8 obvious overestimations of cu values can be detected from the scatterplots for lower cu magnitudes while there are good matches between the observed and simulated values for higher cu values in summary the use of robust k fold testing data assignment approach seems to be essential by using such models of cu estimations as could be seen from the variations of the statistical indicators this is an important point that the model will be performed each time using a part of data set allowing a through model learning using all available patterns as discussed by martí et al 2013 4 conclusion in this paper the capabilities of ann nf gp nf sc gep and ls svm models were evaluated to simulate the uniformity of water distribution for impact and turbine sprinklers the ability of the studied models to estimate the water distribution uniformity cu regardless of the type and structure of the sprinkler can be a reason for the reliability of the results in other atmospheric conditions for the proper evaluation of the performance of the models the k fold test was used according to the obtained results the ann model with levenberg marquardt algorithm gave the most accurate results also the results of cu modeling in per studied sprinkler showed that all models had the good ability for cu estimation but it was obvious that the ann was surpassed to other models providing an explicit equation for cu by the gep model is one of the main results of this study which can estimate cu values for four sprinkler types and because of its simple application can be used by farmers also the findings of this study can be useful in achieving cu at all stages of plant growth and therefore better product performance the cu estimation by using artificial intelligence techniques without considering the type and structure of the sprinkler and other atmospheric parameters will save time and money for field operations 
11144,the continuous surge in irrigation particularly using groundwater for sustaining food security in many developing countries has necessitated the utilization of low quality waters especially in water scarce arid and semi arid regions inappropriate irrigation with these waters results in land and environment degradation produced by associated salts sodium and other toxic elements generally the soil s sodification process is insidious and build up of exchangeable na is initially gradual it stabilises at levels governed by sodicity indices of irrigation water soil type cropping sequences and agro climatic conditions as the soils become sodic crop productivity declines and ultimately soils can become unsuitable for cropping as a result cultivators are forced to opt for tolerant crops which are typically of less economic value to minimize harmful effects of sodicity remedial measures have been developed at the crop root zone farm and district basin levels these include water quality driven conjunctive uses chemical amelioration of soils and irrigation waters mobilising native calcite through phyto remediation growing tolerant crops and other specialised tillage fertiliser use and irrigation practices this review seeks to critically analyse the role of these measures and the crop water and soil factors defining the sodification vis à vis infiltration problems the conclusions provided here are expected to be helpful for a range of stakeholders to promote irrigation with sodic alkali waters thereby partly alleviating the forecasted scarcities in water for agriculture keywords alkali water sodic water soil amendments conjunctive use sodic soils infiltration problems 1 introduction globally the aquifer withdrawals for irrigation have witnessed a boom during the last few decades particularly in drought prone regions world over almost 43 of the irrigated area is groundwater dependent shah 2014 mainly in the agro economies of south asia using groundwater at 262 km3 yr 1 km3 billion m3 middle east north africa 87 km3 and east asia 57 km3 in terms of ground coverage the largest groundwater use areas are in india 39 m ha followed by china 19 m ha and usa 17 m ha since groundwater provides for a reliable source of water that can be used in a flexible manner farmers mostly utilize it to support intensive land cultivation and high value agriculture however a typical scenario has emerged in groundwater irrigated areas revealing the poor quality of underlying aquifers in water scarce areas nevertheless the priorities for high agricultural production and intensification are pushing cultivators to increasingly pump lower quality groundwater for irrigation the extensive use of saline and alkali ground waters for irrigating food grain fodder and fuel crops are widespread particularly in countries such as bangladesh china egypt india iran pakistan syria and the united states tanwar 2003 there is a trade off associated with extensive pumping of poor quality groundwater the better quality aquifers may be at risk from contamination stemming from adjoining poor water quality zones due to their overexploitation and the resultant fall of groundwater levels irrigation with poor quality groundwater without following the recommended soil water crop management strategies has severe impacts on soil health and the environment rhoades et al 1992 minhas and gupta 1992 minhas and samra 2003 the build up of salts sodium and other toxic ions in soils leads to a decline in both agricultural productivity and produce quality generally the sodification process is insidious and the build up of exchangeable na is initially gradual it stabilises at levels governed by sodicity indices of irrigation water soil type cropping sequences and agro climatic conditions when soil s sodicity levels exceed the tolerance thresholds of the prevalent crops their productivity declines and cultivators are left with no alternative but to opt for less profitable tolerant crops ultimately soils may become unsuitable for cropping the remedial measures and irrigation strategies that are required at crop root zone and farm level when using sodicity inducing waters are different from those using saline waters therefore specialised methods and remedial techniques are advocated to create a favourable soil environment for maximising agriculture productivity at the lowest cost hillel 2000 moreover their effective use should be tailored to local hydro geological and socio ecological realities while the issues related to sustainable use of saline drainage water are almost global these have been extensively investigated under field conditions and several critical reviews and comprehensive recommendations are available to overcome salinity problems minhas 1996 2012 rhoades 1999 tanwar 2003 grattan et al 2015 however sodic alkali ground waters exist mainly in the indian sub continent and there has been a lack of such an analysis on the impacts of irrigation with these waters on soils and crops this review highlights the importance of achieving sustainability of agricultural productivity through augmenting the use of sodicity inducing groundwater this information is expected to enhance the possibilities of sustained irrigation with lower quality waters by offering opening to overcome water shortages for agriculture 2 impacts of alkali sodic irrigation waters on soils and crops 2 1 chemical impacts soil sodification irrigation water quality is assessed based on the potential of water to cause salinity sodicity alkalinity and toxicity hazards the parameters used for their soluble salt contents are total dissolved salts tds and electrical conductivity ec alkalinity ph and sodium na saturation esp exchangeable sodium percent in soils is a consequence of a higher proportion of na relative to ca and mg and that of carbonates co3 and hco3 in irrigation waters various indices to determine the sodicity and alkalinity potential of irrigation waters are sodium adsorption ratio sar adjusted sar adj rna and residual sodium carbonate rsc these are calculated as sar na ca mg 2 0 5 adj rna na cax mg 2 0 5 rsc co3 hco3 ca mg where concentrations are expressed in milli equivalent per litre meq l 1 cax represents the modified concentration of ca due to salinity ionic strength and hco3 ca ratio suarez 1981 ayers and westcot 1985 hence the notations of saline sodic and alkali are used here for irrigation waters with ec 2 0 ds m 1 sar 10 and rsc 2 5 meq l 1 respectively considering no precipitation early water quality criteria considered that the irrigated soils accumulated sodium on exchange complex in proportion of sar in long term studies chauhan et al 1991 though the sare sar of saturation paste extract even approached 2 sariw after the irrigation of dry season winter crops these declined considerably following rains received during monsoon season therefore the overall increase in esp is considerably less than sariw especially at high levels sariw 20 the factors like soil texture and its salt release characteristics e g calcite content quantities of applied irrigation water and episodic events of rainfall associated anions e g so4 2 further modify the final esp build up in soils manchanda et al 1989 chauhan et al 1991 singh et al 1992 minhas and gupta 1992 a number of systematic agronomic investigations have evaluated the long term sodification of soils occurring with sodic alkali irrigation waters especially in north west india bajwa et al 1983 1986 1992 1993 bajwa and josan 1989a b sharma and mondal 1981 sharma and minhas 1997a 2004 minhas et al 2007a b choudhary et al 2011a with exchange of divalent cations and their release from the inherent calcite and other soil minerals the initial rates of sodification were found to be slow however the chances of soil solutions to concentrate in surface soil get augmented through a distilling out effect of evapo transpiration when the water infiltration rates are slowed with increase in sodicity relative infiltration rate rir 0 3 at an esp 20 such conditions further increase the sodicity and thereby steady state conditions as were the basis for earlier sodicity indices e g adj sar by bower et al 1968 and rhoades 1968 are not attained in shorter intervals rather field observations on esp are usually contrary to those predicted with adj sar indices which state that sodification should be lower with increased leaching fractions lf higher quantities of irrigation water to the rice wheat cropping system lf 0 6 0 8 resulted in faster sodification especially of surface soil esp 2 4 sar when compared with upland crops such as cotton maize and pearl millet in rotation with wheat minhas and gupta 1992 minhas and bjwa 2001 thus rather than 1 lf that has been most commonly used to define the concentration factors the general experience is that stabilisation of ph and esp do occur when a quasi equilibrium is achieved after alkali water irrigation for about four five years and their levels usually depend upon cropping sequence and other agro climatic conditions fig 1 thereafter the further sodification slows down minhas and sharma 2006 analysed a large number of agronomic experiments n 100 where irrigation waters in the range of ec 0 4 10 ds m 1 sar 0 6 43 adj sar 0 6 102 adj rna 0 6 57 and rsc 0 15 meq l 1 were applied for longer term 5 years on light textured soils loamy sand to silt loam for fallow wheat cotton wheat maize millet wheat and rice wheat rotations the coefficient of determination for predicting esp with different indices of sodicity like sar adj sar adj rna were only r2 0 20 0 32 the predictability improved considerably fig 2 r2 0 69 when the concentration and dilution factors were included in terms of the annual quantities of alkali waters applied diw as irrigation the rainfall drw at the site and the evapo transpiration demands of the crops grown in sequence et as esp diw drw 1 drw et adj rna considering the diversified situations of agro climate and soil types from which the data sets were obtained the overall predictability seems quite satisfactory it should however be mentioned that adj rna considers the precipitation of calcite caco3 only since ground waters with residual alkalinity also have appreciable contents of chloride and sulphate ions cl so4 hco3 0 3 5 7 these also affect ca concentrations of soil solutions firstly in the case of calcite gypsum controlled system competition for ca would allow more hco3 to stay in solution gypsum precipitation would remove ca and so4 and thus calcite precipitation may be overestimated additionally relatively higher dissolution of gypsum with rainwater during monsoon season than that of calcite should add more ca to solution in fact a critical re look at the predicted and reported sodicity esp values brought out that the over predictions were mainly for alkali waters that contained considerable neutral salts cl so4 along with residual alkalinity the presence of neutral salts is also reported to result in the enhanced dissolution of calcite and ca primary minerals dubey et al 1988 nadler and magaritz 1991 since neutral salts are first to be dissolved and displaced with rainwater the above processes would lead to decline of na in soil solution and thus cause a decrease in sar of the soil solution vis à vis sodicity in soils relatively reduced sodification when so4 was the dominant anion following hco3 as compared with cl dominance in alkali waters was reported by minhas et al 2007b 2 2 physical impacts soil infiltration problems the sodification leads to soil structure deterioration and consequently in manifestation of physical stresses for example the formation of surface crust impacts the emergence of seedlings water stagnation with reduced infiltration causes anoxic conditions causes impaired root growth with hard setting and induces dispersion and swelling of clays these factors ultimately affect water storage and its movement to roots tillage and sowing operations also become more difficult with soil structural deterioration oster and jaywardane 1998 and restricted water movement into and through soils can induce additional surface retention of salts minhas et al 2004 several studies since the 1950s have demonstrated the tendency for swelling aggregate failures and increase in dispersion rates with an increase in esp and a decline in salinity even non sodic soils with esp 3 may behave like sodic soils at very low electrolyte concentrations oster and schroer 1979 shainberg and letey 1984 minhas and sharma 1986 sumner et al 1998 oster et al 1999 there is a salinity sodicity continuum and highly sodic soils require high salinities for soil stabilization soil water intake in terms of infiltration permeability values should decline in most of the soils when concentration of electrolytes in permeating water is inadequate to compensate for high na effects this formed the basis of the earlier water quality criteria which included combinations of ec and sar to maintain infiltration rates of soils ayers and westcot 1985 analogous to sar a ratio namely cross cation ratio of soil structural stability was put forward by rengasamy and marchuk 2011 where flocculation value of mg for soil clays is 0 69 to that of ca under field situations rainfall and irrigation water infiltration alternate especially during the monsoon season generally upland crops suffer the most due to water stagnation problems during the rainy season and soil crusts may form due to beating action of raindrops after simulating monsoonal rainwater infiltration conditions using de ionised water drastic reductions in hydraulic conductivity were observed even at sar esp around 5 and such reductions were irreversible minhas and sharma 1986 field observations n 19 further corroborated this where infiltration rates of sandy loam soils irrigated with saline sodic waters ssw ec 2 3 11 0 ds m 1 sar 10 28 were monitored to be 8 7 2 6 cm h 1 with ssw and were reduced to 4 4 1 6 cm h 1 when deionised water simulating rainwater srw followed ssw while the values were 2 7 0 8 cm h 1 with srw and improved only to 3 3 1 0 cm h 1 when ssw followed srw aicrp ssw 1972 2016 slaking upon wetting and thereafter translocation of dispersed clay particles was also reported to be the main cause of limiting infiltration of rainfall water shainberg and letey 1984 oster et al 1999 sumner et al 1998 in a field experiment where wheat pearl millet crop rotation was irrigated on a sandy loam soil with various ec 6 and 12 ds m 1 and sar 10 20 30 and 40 waters for 8 years its steady infiltration rates ir declined to 5 10 of the normal soil minhas et al 1994 the recoupment in ir with saline waters was only 22 28 even though the flocculation values of clays for such illitic soils are 30 40 meq l 1 this finding established that in the monsoonal climate dispersed colloidal clays get transported with the traction of infiltrating rainwater and the process over the longer periods leads to the formation of subsoil zone which gets enriched with illuviated clays this zone is below the plow layer where remixing of move in clay does not occur with tillage operations the deposited clays lead to development of relatively finer pore sizes and more dead end pores lowering the overall porosity ultimately this zone becomes a sort of permanent throttle for downward movement of water and thus controls steady state infiltration rates minhas et al 1999 confirmed this with six cycles of alterations of saline 80 meq l 1 sar 10 20 and 30 and simulated rain waters deionised ec 0 02 ds m 1 where the washed in subsoil as evidenced from depth distributions of hydraulic head and dispersible clay became restrictive and had major control over k values fig 3 the calcium released in highly calcareous soil calcite 9 7 showed some effects in alleviating the impacts of high sar waters the quantum of clays that can undergo translocation and their settling depth should depend upon the soil texture and its mineralogy which define their inherent infiltration characteristics and the modifying factors like sodicity level of the soil its salt release characteristics among others for this consequent measurements of k values with sodic water and followed by de ionised water simulating rainwater should serve as a better diagnostic criterion for infiltration hazards minhas 2010 with simultaneous rising of ph alkali waters prove more deleterious than those with neutral salts sharma and minhas 1997b reported that in an illitic sandy loam soil the effect of sar for waters with neutral salts cl so4 and adj sar for water with residual alkalinity on infiltration rates were negative and similar in magnitude the heavy textured soils surapaneni and olsson 2002 and those put under rice wheat systems are even more prone to an infiltration problem when irrigated with sodic alkali waters bajwa et al 1983 minhas and gupta 1992 although the primary concern has mostly been shown for the water movement into the soils sodicity also influences the movement of water through the soils impinging upon salt dynamics a reduced drainage co efficient of subsurface soil enriched with moved in dispersed clays may lead to low anoxic conditions with reduced odrs oxygen diffusion rates while the reduced unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ relations would restrict the water movement vis à vis the root water uptake minhas et al 1994 moreover the dispersion and movement of clay induces flow through finer pores and results in dead end pores these conditions lower the leaching efficiency by holding back salts lowering of salts upon leaching in soils irrigated with sodic waters singh et al 1992 and with residual alkalinity sharma and khosla 1984 often leads to an increase in ph vulnerability to clay dispersion and a sharp decline in infiltration rates therefore these soils required almost double the water 0 9 1 3 cm cm 1 soil for accomplishing the same amount of leaching 80 removal of initial salt compared with structurally stable saline soils 0 4 1 0 cm cm 1 studies reveal that the leaching efficiency improved by adding gypsum to the soils irrigated with saline sodic waters singh et al 1992 but not in soils irrigated with alkali water sharma and khosla 1984 2 3 impacts on crops productivity plant growth and development in soils irrigated with sodic alkali waters depends on several complex factors like ion toxicities e g na hco3 etc ca deficiency with its precipitation as calcite nutritional imbalance dispersive behaviour leading to lesser salt leaching and other soil physical constraints rhoades et al 1992 stated that in case ca in soil solution is 2 mmol l 1 high sar will not show adverse effect on most crops as distinguishable from salinity usually the adverse effects of highly saline sodic water ec 4 ds m 1 sar 20 on soil structure lead to lesser quantities of monsoon rains to infiltrate into soils thereby rendering soils saline due to poor leaching of winter season accumulated salts therefore elevated levels of salinity as induced by high sar 30 and 40 mmol l 1 waters was reported as the main reason for yield decline in pearl millet wheat rotation when irrigated with waters of various combinations of ec 6 and 12 ds m 1 and sar 10 20 30 and 40 mmol l 1 for 8 years singh et al 1992 rainfall received during monsoon season further defined the yields of pearl millet fig 4 as expected the dilution and salt leaching were reduced during low rainfall years while simultaneous water stagnation problems during higher rainfall years affected pearl millet yields and the decline was more at higher sar of irrigation water the impacts of high sar were also more pronounced on black clay loam soil minhas and gupta 1992 and a shift to water logging and salinity tolerant crop like sesbania sesbania sesbans was a promising alternative during monsoon rains bhu dayal et al 2009 earlier examples for viability of alkali water usage were i the soils to be irrigated should be deep have adequate drainage and loamy sand to sandy loam in texture ii only winter semi tolerant crops such as wheat and barley should be grown and iii monsoon rainfall during fallow kharif summer monsoon season should be at least 400 mm for adequate dissolution of precipitated calcite manchanda et al 1989 however alkali ground waters are more prevalent in the annual rainfall zone of 500 750 mm where double cropping is regular practice several reports have subsequently emerged where the ability of different crops to perform under alkali water irrigated conditions has been evaluated in different agro ecosystems that are typical to north western parts of india table 1 maize productivity declined with sodification of a sandy loam soil with irrigation waters of ec 1 15 4 5 ds m 1 rsc 2 and 8 meq

were not affected bajwa et al 1983 in a similar study with alkali irrigation waters ec 1 4 1 6 ds m 1 sar 11 4 19 2 adj sar 20 5 41 0 bajwa and josan 1989c reported sustained crop yields during the initial two years in rice wheat and pearl millet wheat rotation using quadratic relations between adj sar and rice wheat yields the estimated values of adj sar values for obtaining 90 75 and 50 of the relative yields were estimated to be 23 28 and 32 respectively while the counter values were 10 28 and 36 for pearl millet wheat rotation for another high water requiring crop sugarcane after one year of irrigation with alkali water ec 1 2 ds m 1 rsc 10 meq l 1 and saline alkali water ec 3 ds m 1 rsc 10 meq l 1 the sugar yield was reduced to 10 2 and 8 3 mg ha 1 respectively while it was 12 2 mg ha

irrigation minhas et al 2007b relative yields of rice and wheat averaged 56 74 and 81 88 of good quality water ec 0 5 ds m 1 rsc nil during the initial four years indicating that the former is more sensitive to irrigation with alkali water when crops were protected by rain shelters almost complete mortality of rice crop after two years signified the contribution of monsoonal rainfall in sustaining irrigation with alkali waters production functions further brought out that in addition to the sodicity esp salinity simultaneously inhibited growth and defined crop performance especially for salt sensitive rice crops threshold ec 1 4 ds m 1 the impacts of residual alkalinity were comparatively lower when so4 was the dominant anion in the irrigation water rather than cl the consensus that emerges from the above evidences is that degradation of soils and productivity losses are aggravated when alkali water is used for rice wheat systems since the viability of this system was questionable earlier water quality guidelines recommend avoiding rice in crop rotations minhas and gupta 1992 minhas and sharma 2006 while evaluating a large dataset available on the use of waters with residual alkalinity predicted that crop yields could be sustained with water of adj rna ranging from 14 27 mmol l 1in fallow millet maize cotton wheat rotation while the values were about half 6 14 mmol l 1 for a rice wheat rotation still the farmers of the afflicted areas prefer the cultivation of rice wheat while evaluating the causes of persistence among farmers relying on rice wheat rotation minhas et al 2004 concluded that in addition to economics the rice wheat are prevalent because i the establishment of upland crops during kharif is usually difficult because of water stagnation vis à vis root aeration problems on these structurally unstable sodified soils ii the demand for continuous submergence in rice helps in better and uniform salt leaching than the upland crops where rain water is usually drained off to avoid its stagnation iii rice helps in conjunctive use with canal water since it can be adjusted as and when available due to submergence requirement of rice while its use for upland crops is possible only during dry periods between episodic rain events and iv if groundwater contain sufficient ca i e up to 2 mmol l 1 thus soils are less responsive to gypsum application 3 management options for sustaining crop production the management options leading to sustainable crop productivity with saline sodic alkali irrigation waters should aim at practices that do not allow build up of root zone sodicity to levels that impair soil productivity and also those options that help in alleviation of sodicity impacts to promote crop growth attempts have therefore been made through conjunctive use of water resources chemical amelioration of alkali waters soils mobilising the native calcite through phyto remediation growing sodicity tolerant crops and other agronomic measures minhas and samra 2003 minhas et al 2004 sharma and minhas 2005 qadir and oster 2004 2007 choudhary et al 2011b minhas 2012 since these measures may not control sodicity of irrigated soils when executed in isolation integration of the available crop irrigation soils chemical and other agronomic practices is desirable 3 1 use of amendments 3 1 1 soil applied amendments the degradation of soils with sodification can be alleviated with extraneous input of amendments which either contains ca e g gypsum or those that on reaction with calcite release ca in soil solutions e g sulphur sulphuric acid pyrites etc the viability of these amendments should be judged from alleviation in soil constraints to improve crop yields versus the cost involved since the application of amendments is a recurring need under alkali water irrigated conditions the effects of various amendments their doses modes and frequency of application have been studied at large table 2 early observations suggested that wheat may not respond to applied gypsum when rsc of irrigation water is below 10 meq l 1 soils are light textured loamy sand sandy loam fields are kept fallow during kharif

millet could be cultivated successfully by maintaining esp between 15 and 20 with application of gypsum sharma and manchanda 1989 the site was semi arid with annual rainfall 500 mm similarly after two

waters rsc 7 2 8 9 meq l 1 under an arid climate joshi and dhir 1991 however the gypsum 50 gr sufficed for cultivating kharif crops like pearl millet urd bean mung bean cowpea and pigeon pea on a soil

gypsum than wheat and barley later reports from the same site singh et al 2008 showed that application of gypsum to neutralise rsc above 2 8 meq l 1 increased wheat yield by 53 pearl millet 88 mustard

potato tomato brinjal and cluster bean grown in sequence using an alkali water rsc 11 6 meq l 1 sar 14 0 on a long term basis 15 years and a sandy loam soil averaged 3 years each only 13 41 1 65 0 30 and 0 06 mg ha 1 phogat et al 2010 these improved to 21 0 23 6 16 7 and 9 6 mg ha 1 respectively with additions of gypsum 50 neutralisation of rsc and further to 21 3 31 6 22 9 10 5 mg ha 1 with gypsum equalling 100 rsc neutralisation under rice wheat cropping system irrigated with alkali water ec 2 6 ds m 1 sar 20 5 rsc 9 5 meq l 1 sharma and mondal 1982 observed wheat productivity to improve with gypsum application while no response was initially observed in rice gypsum to neutralise rsc equivalent of 2 5 and 5 0 meq l 1could sustain yields of wheat and rice receiving irrigation with waters of rsc 8 4 and 13 2 meq l 1 respectively bajwa and josan 1989a similarly the sustainable yield index syi with application of gypsum 50 and 100 gr ranged between 0 57 0 65 and 0 54 0 65 in rice and wheat respectively indicating that 50 gr is sufficient sharma et al 2001 more pronounced benefits of gypsum rsc 2 5 meq l 1 neutralization were observed in cane yield of sugarcane 30 increase that was irrigated with alkali water rsc 10 meq l 1 sar 19 8 ec 1 43 ds m 1 as compared with saline alkali water rsc 10 meq l 1 sar 31 2 ec 2 90 ds m 1 where the improvement was about 13 choudhary et al 2004 the effects of gypsum were complemented by fym farmyard manure especially when alkali water was used while working with different crop rotations sharma et al 2001 concluded that i growth of wheat cultivated after rice mainly depends upon soil ph and its sodicity and therefore it usually respond to gypsum when rsc is 5 meq l 1 ii when fields are kept fallow during kharif the carried over soil salinity also governs growth of wheat and therefore its response to gypsum remains variable and iii when wheat is grown after sorghum the interactive effects of ece ph and sare of soils govern its response to gypsum e g at a given ph as sare rises ece should be lower higher yields of rice and wheat were also observed in a saline sodic soil when treated with gypsum and irrigated with alkali water in cyclic mode with good water murtaza et al 2013 therefore it emerges that gypsum applications are required on a recurring basis to minimise impacts of irrigation water having high residual alkalinity especially in high water demanding rotations like rice wheat saline sodic soils developed with high sar saline water irrigation are also prone to reduced infiltration and thereby temporary water logging especially during monsoonal season therefore small additions of gypsum may help maintain structural stability and thus avoid water stagnations vis à vis aeration problems during rainy season application of phospho gypsum helped in preventing surface crusts and maintained the yields of cotton 5 mg ha 1 in a soil that was irrigated with saline sodic water ec 4 6 ds m 1 sar 26 for 16 years in negev region of israel keren et al 1990 in pearl millet wheat irrigated with waters of varying sar 10 40 mmol l 1 but similar salinity ec 8 ds m 1 gypsum application at 25 gr improved the average yields 1999 2002 of pearl millet by 5 23 aicrp ssw 1972 2016 response to gypsum was observed mainly during the years when episodic events of rainfall and consequent water stagnation problems occurred during its initial stages and the overall effects of applied gypsum were higher at sar of 30 and 40 mmol l 1 the yields of pearl millet further improved 5 11 by draining out the stagnating rainwater after heavy rainfall events however the long term consequences of removing rain stagnated water needs to be further examined since such a practice could reduce the volume of rainwater for salt leaching 3 1 2 mode and time of amendment application smaller doses of gypsum to neutralise the rsc 8 meq l 1 of each irrigation was reported to be better in improving the crop yields in maize wheat system rather than an annual application bajwa et al 1989a however in a later experiment with rice wheat system irrigated with alkali water rsc 6 8 meq l 1 sar 8 4 the response to gypsum was at par when applied either annually before rice crop or with each irrigation while application of gypsum before transplanting was better in rice irrigated with alkali water rsc 10 3 meq l 1 sar 13 5 this was ascribed to appreciable sodification during rice growth because of its high irrigation water requirements similarly in pearl millet wheat crops the application of gypsum before the onset of monsoons was more effective as compared with its application either before wheat crop or with each irrigation yadav and kumar 1994 when pyrite was applied to amend the deleterious effects of high rsc waters chauhan et al 1986 reported that application before wheat was better than its mixing with irrigation water or its small doses before each irrigation longer term performance of rice and wheat was better when gypsum pyrite was applied every year compared with its application every 3 years minhas et al 2004 recently murtaza et al 2015 has reported that a coarse textured salt affected soil could be reclaimed with saline sodic water ec 3 94 ds m 1 sar 18 2 rsc nil in combination with gypsum the grain yield of wheat improved by 9 42 and 75 when gypsum applied was 50 and 100 gr and to neutralise 100 rsc of irrigation water respectively 3 1 3 water amelioration techniques responses to gypsum application in general show that application at each irrigation was superior or at least as effective in mitigation of the sodicity effects of alkali water irrigation therefore efforts have been made to devise mechanisms for dissolving gypsum in alkali water itself in terms of specially designed gypsum beds passing of alkali waters through these beds further eliminates the expense of grinding bagging and storing mined gypsum before field usage the beds are designed for specific dissolution of ca from gypsum and their dimensions depend upon factors like surface area as defined by the distribution of different sized fragments the reaction time driven by the velocity with which water would pass through the bed and the ion chemistry of irrigation water pal and poonia 1979 pal and poonia 1979 singh et al 1986 for practical purposes the ca2 dissolution through gypsum beds can be as high as 8 meq l 1 when similar doses of gypsum were applied either by ameliorating the alkali water rsc 9 meq l 1 with gypsum beds or its soil application the 5 year average crop yields were superior in sorghum mustard rotations while these were similar in rice wheat minhas et al 2004 in a similar 5 year field experiment with sorghum wheat the pyrite bed was more effective in reducing residual alkalinity 14 2 to 8 9 meq l 1 than the gypsum bed 11 2 meq l 1 as indicated by higher crop yields aicrp ssw 1972 2016 the wheat grain yield averaged 4 years 1 58 mg ha 1 with alkali water and improved to 2 56 2 98 mg ha 1 when soil was amended with gypsum 50 150 gr and 2 46 3 02 mg ha 1 with pyrite 50 150 gr the yield was 2 68 and 2 72 mg ha 1 when irrigation water was passed through gypsum and pyrite beds respectively however the highest dry forage production of sorghum 11 78 mg ha 1 was monitored with pyrite beds whereas production was 5 66 8 64 11 54 8 5 11 06 and 10 00 mg ha 1 with alkali water as such soil applied gypsum 50 150 gr pyrite 50 150 gr and gypsum bed respectively these results reveal that amelioration of water itself can help in efficient utilization of amendments like gypsum and pyrite though the availability and economics of the pyrite remains uncertain viability of gypsum beds is further evident from many field trials with wheat mustard and gram on farmer s fields where the bcr benefit cost ratio and irr internal rate of return of these beds was computed to be 2 04 and 40 2 respectively aicrp ssw 1972 2016 an alternative to beds is to keep the clods of gypsum in water courses channels used for irrigation qadir et al 2007 aicrp ssw 1972 2016 treatment of irrigation water with acid leads to its reaction with hco3 and co3 to form co2 gas plus water as well as it lowers the ph of water which allows for more ca and mg to remain in the soil solution and displace na from exchange sites rather than its precipitation as calcite therefore sulphurous acid generators sag have been developed for producing sulphur dioxide gas so2 through the burning of sulphur in specially designed chambers so2 is later dissolved in 10 15 of irrigation water to produce sulphurous acid h2so3 the ameliorated waters are then mixed with original alkali water for irrigating the degraded soils qadir et al 2001 kahlown and gill 2003 studies suggest that rsc of saline sodic water was decreased from 5 4 to 3 6 meq l 1 after sag treatment whilst having no impact on sar ec zia et al 2006 it was also reported that sag sulphuric acid and gypsum were at par in improving rice yields but the costs involved in sag and sulphuric acid treatment were about six times greater than gypsum therefore because of economic considerations sag s are not becoming popular 3 1 4 use of organic green manures the beneficial effects of organic green manure as a source of nutrients and on improvement of soil structure and permeability are well established in addition to their nutritional benefits these have multiple benefits in term of bioremediation under sodic soil environments qadir et al 2006 organic acids produced during their decomposition and the increased pco2 in soils help to mobilise the inherent ca from calcite and other minerals moreover the ca and other cationic contents of these organic materials also get released on their decomposition green manure crops like sesbania also release protons h during n2 ﬁxation to lower soil ph and thus help in dissolving calcite qadir and oster 2004 the solubilised ca during above processes thereby replaces a part of exchangeable na the long term effects of additions of organic green manures on lowering of sodicity in soils have been well recognised nevertheless these may rather lead to enhanced dispersion of sodic soils on a short term basis and therefore caution is placed on their application to soils undergoing sodication in an already deteriorated soil with the use of alkali water ec 4 ds m 1 sar 26 rsc 15 meq l 1 wheat yield and soil permeability further declined when fym was applied alone but the performance of pearl millet and sorghum improved markedly with combined use of fym and gypsum sharma and manchanda 1989 dhankar et al 1990 later reported that longer term additions of fym improved ph infiltration rate and wheat yield to 9 7 8 1 mm h 1 and 3 14 mg ha 1 respectively while the corresponding values were 10 3 5 3 mm h 1 and 2 7 mg ha 1 under alkali water irrigation rsc 2 4 16 meq l 1 alone the response to fym however declined at higher rsc 16 meq l 1 therefore to overcome short term enhancement in dispersion with fym the upland kharif crops should be preceded with gypsum whilst the rice crop which requires submergence may benefit from reduced infiltration rates minhas et al 1995 reported rice and wheat yields to improve by 8 10 by additions of fym in alkali water ec 3 2 ds m 1 rsc 5 6 meq l 1 sar 11 3 irrigated soils through improved soil ph sodicity and fertility synergetic effects of adding fym and gypsum for improving sugar yield were later observed by choudhary et al 2004 the productivity 8 6 12 3 mg ha 1 was higher with alkali water irrigation as compared with saline sodic water 7 4 10 7 mg ha 1 in the case of saline sodic water sugar yield 10 8 mg ha 1 with fym additions was higher as compared with gypsum 9 1 mg ha 1 and was at par with combined use of gypsum plus fym murtaza et al 2013 also recorded marked improvements in yields of rice and wheat when these received fym and gypsum and were irrigated alternatively with fresh and sodic water sekhon and bajwa 1993 reported the potential of the organic materials to decrease the precipitation of ca and hco3 cause removal of na decrease soil ph and esp under rice wheat maize system irrigated with alkali waters rsc 6 0 and 10 6 meq l 1 the improvement in crop yields was the maximum with rice straw followed by green manuring and fym choudhary et al 2011b after monitoring the long term 15 year impacts of fym and green manuring gm concluded that improvements in soil ph and esp were on par while the performance of both rice and wheat was better with fym the yields of rice and wheat were increased by 38 and 26 with fym respectively over those obtained with sodic water without amendment application rsc 10 12 5 meq l 1 the corresponding increase with gypsum applied 50 gr was 18 and 19 similarly the gm and wheat straw ws resulted in 22 and 17 higher yields of rice while the impacts on wheat were similar 20 even in a long term experiment with vegetables rsc 11 6 meq l 1 the addition of gypsum 50 and 100 neutralisation of rsc along with organic amendments fym 10 20 mg ha 1 triggered the process of amelioration of these waters and consequently enhanced the yields of crops phogat et al 2010 other reports yaduvanshi and swarup 2005 murtaza et al 2009 buttar et al 2017 further support the above results whereby synergetic effects of organic and inorganic amendments were reported for improvements in crop productivity the trade off of organic materials is that it can help in reducing the gypsum demands required to off set the impacts of alkali waters and thus their use should be promoted for better crop productivity 3 2 conjunctive use of water under many situations supplies of good quality canal waters may be available to a limited extent and farmers may need to use these waters along with poor quality ground waters for meeting the crop demands the strategies usually adopted for the combined use of the two sources are either to apply these in cyclic mode where canal water irrigation coincides with sensitive growth stages or after mixing the two waters to attain water of acceptable quality by dilution most efforts thus far have been directed towards combining canal water with saline water for irrigation since soluble salts are mobile and relatively easier to displace the strategies include either the use of non saline canal water for pre plant irrigation and early crop growth to control salinity of the seed zone and prospective root zone during initial stages or for salt sensitive crops and switching over to saline water irrigation at tolerant growth stages crops minhas and gupta 1992 rhoades et al 1992 minhas 1996 nevertheless the strategy that minimises the sodification either reducing ca precipitation as calcite or increasing its release through calcite dissolution should be better minhas and bajwa 2001 groundwaters in aquifers are in equilibrium with soil minerals like calcite dolomite etc at a higher pco2 while surface canal waters with low ca are in a state of unsaturation with respect to calcite therefore irrigation with the latter and their blends should have a tendency to solubilise inherent ca which would decline with proportions of alkali groundwater in the blend the effect of the cyclic uses either inter intra seasonally or blending the two water supplies has been evaluated on longer term basis bajwa and josan 1989c minhas et al 2007a chauhan et al 2007 choudhary et al 2011b the crop productivity data under different modes of application of good quality gw and alkali aw waters for various cropping rotations have been included in table 3 it is evident that even when using waters with residual alkalinity the better intra seasonal cyclic use option is to start with good quality water gw and if opting for inter seasonal cyclic use using alkali water aw during monsoon rains would help sustain higher crop yields crops irrigated under a cyclic regime also tended to out perform those that are irrigated with blended waters while revisiting data it emerged that because of the number of irrigations required to raise crops in the different sequences the fractions of alkali waters aw were lower when good quality water gw was used to start with as compared to those in blended waters and some times also when alkali waters were applied initially therefore based upon the relations between relative crop yields ry and the fractions of alkali water aw applied under blending the ry s were estimated for same fractions of aw used under different cyclic use modes and are plotted in fig 5 the cyclic use still showed a marginal advantage when gw was used initially over blending the yields matched each other when aw was used for the initial one or two irrigations while these were less when the initial four irrigations were with aw similar advantages were earlier reported for equal salt input when saline and non saline waters were applied in cyclic or mixing mode minhas and gupta 1992 1993 rhoades 1999 also proposed that more crop consumable water is lost under blending and therefore for similar supplies of water the sequential use of non saline and saline water performs better the alterations in precipitation with alkali water irrigation and dissolution of freshly precipitated calcite with good quality canal water under cyclic uses seem to retain more ca in solution phase as compared with continued precipitation vis à vis sodication phase under blending though it occurs at a slower pace than original alkali water this was substantiated from ph sare and esp build up in soils monitored after 6 years of combined use either cyclic or blends with same proportions of gw ec 0 5 ds m 1 rsc nil and aw ec 2 3 ds m 1 rsc 11 3 meq l 1 sar 15 in rice wheat system minhas et al 2007a on the whole the cyclic use of surface canal and alkali water a strategy that shows higher yield potential and also more flexibility in its implementation can be considered as practical way to alleviate sodicity problems 3 3 choice of crops and varieties crops vary a lot in their tolerance of sodicity in soils in addition the ability of crops to perform under sodic irrigation is also defined by their tolerance to excessive soil moisture in rhizosphere or surface water logging permissible limits of esp surface 0 15 m soil tolerance of crops have been established from alkali sites undergoing reclamation with additions of gypsum and were compiled by gupta and abrol 1990 under these conditions rice with esp limit of 60 70 was the most tolerant followed by beets barley and sesbania esp 50 60 oats mustard cotton wheat and tomatoes esp 30 50 clover groundnut cowpea onion pearl millet linseed garlic and cluster bean esp 20 30 and chickpea soybean black gram peas lentil and pigeon pea esp 10 20 however the tolerance to sodicity espt in soils undergoing sodication with water having residual alkalinity is comparatively lower than the sodic soil under reclamation with gypsum minhas and sharma 2006 the obvious reasons seem to be the differential availability of ca in soil solution ca precipitates out as calcite in soils irrigated with alkali waters whereas dissolution of applied gypsum improves ca in the soil solution of alkali soils under reclamation moreover the concentration of soil solutions after the cessation of monsoon rains when the most kharif crops are at critical flowering and grain filling stages affects crop performance e g rice with threshold salinity level as 1 4 ds m 1 in addition to their sodicity salinity tolerance the choice of crops is governed by their water demands and the agro climatic conditions rice being a high water requiring crop also results in the maximum sodification of soils as compared to other upland crops and is also more sensitive under sodic irrigation the permissible limits for sustaining yields in the cropping sequences prevalent in north west india have been established table 4 in terms of adj rna of alkali waters for different rainfall zones minhas and sharma 2006 rice wheat with permissible limits of adj rna being almost half compared with millet wheat rotations is the most unsustainable cropping sequence therefore a general recommendation is to avoid rice with sodic waters the importance of rainfall is also evident e g in areas with annual rainfall more than 600 mm the permissible limit of adj sar is almost two fold 1 8 times as compared to sites where annual rainfall less than 400 mm the crop cultivars also show variability in their tolerance to sodicity maintenance of low na k ratio in shoot either through avoidance of na uptake or its exclusion sharma et al 2015 and the profuse rooting choudhary et al 2012 are the preferred characters for their better sodicity tolerance the cultivars with high yield potential were earlier preferred even for higher sodicity conditions but with later breeding efforts crop varieties e g csr 30 in rice and krl 219 in wheat which are both high yielding and tolerant to sodicity are now available these varieties are becoming an attractive option for the poor farmers lacking resources for affording costly amendments marker assisted and genomics based approaches are further being employed to accelerate the pace of genetic improvement for developing high yielding and multiple stress e g salt sodicity drought and water logging tolerant cultivars 3 4 fertiliser use practices in most situations the alkali sodic water irrigation is usually initiated on soils which are already under cultivation sodification affects the availability of nutrients by changing their form in which these are present is soils e g phosphorus and their losses e g aggravation of nitrogen losses through nh3 volatilization and their interactions with modified ionic constituents in soil solution to compensate for n losses the recommended doses of fertiliser n are about 25 more for sodified soils than those for normal soils practices to increase n use efficiency include its splitting as per crop demand deeper placement shift to slow release fertilizer and additions of organic n sources splitting of n in three equal doses at planting basal three and six weeks after planting resulted in highest productivity of both rice and wheat yaduvanshi and swarup 2005 deeper placement of fertilizers in soils has the requirements for relevant machines however a simple method to redistribute the fertilizer in soils is to apply before the pre plant irrigations this practice especially when combined with deep tillage chiseling on alkali water irrigated soil saved upon 30 40 kg n ha 1 minhas and bajwa 2001 organic materials temporarily immobilize the nh4 n subsequently release it slowly with decomposition during crop season therefore combining the inorganic fertiliser n with additions the organic green manures reduced n doses by 50 in rabi winter season and by 25 in kharif crops minhas et al 2004 yaduvanshi and swarup 2005 also concluded that fertilizer use efficiency improved considerably in rice and wheat crops when gypsum was combined with fym or spm sugarcane press mud in a soil irrigated with alkali water rsc 8 5 meq l 1 sar 8 8 therefore for judicious use of fertilizers in sodic water irrigated soils extraneous application of organic amendments seems a helpful strategy 3 5 irrigation scheduling steady state conditions have been traditionally assumed to exist in the long run when irrigating with brackish water and therefore a concept of leaching requirement lr was put forward to control salt balances in the root zone ussl 1954 rhoades et al 1992 since the alterations of cycles of salt sodicity build up with irrigation to winter season crops and their dilution leaching with monsoon rains do not allow for steady state conditions the lr s do not work under the monsoonal climate any effort to attain lr s during winter crops rather results in higher input of salts to mix with or push the carried over rainwater in soils and thereby reducing its availability to crops minhas 1996 similarly various indices like adj sar also predict reduced sodification if higher levels of leaching fraction lf are attained nevertheless as presented earlier the esp build up is the maximum 2 4 x adj rna under rice wheat cropping system with lf of almost 0 6 0 8 where as it is about 1 1 times in maize millet wheat system minhas and sharma 2006 moreover attempts to achieve leaching requirement lf 0 5 with additional amount of saline sodic water ec 3 2 ds m 1 sar 21 rsc 4 meq l 1 rather resulted in 1 3 1 5 fold higher salinity to reduce crop yields in both rice wheat and maize pearl millet wheat sequence bajwa et al 1983 light and frequent irrigations have also been tried to overcome the effects of lower water transmission with build up of sodicity bajwa et al 1993 salinity and esp remained at par with different irrigation frequencies created by variable quantities for each irrigation event 4 6 7 10 cm while the total applied alkali water ec 1 2 and 2 9 ds m 1 sar 12 2 and 29 4 rsc 9 5 was kept the same the fodder maize and wheat grown during monsoon and winter season also did not respond to smaller intervals of irrigation while its effects were monitored in terms of bringing down the supra optimal soil temperature that improved the yields of summer maize similar treatments were also tried for 7 years with alkali water rsc 12 meq l 1 on wheat where application of 6 cm water at each irrigation with sprinklers improved its grain yield by 12 8 and 4 2 over the treatment when irrigation amount was kept as 4 and 5 cm respectively this was in spite of higher ph being observed in the former yadav et al 2013 since the na k increased remarkably in leaves of wheat its toxicity did not allow for attainment of potential yields even with increased quantities of sprinkled alkali water singh et al 2009 3 6 tillage practices the progressive infilling with the dispersed and displaced surface clays increases the possibilities of development of dense subsoil plow sole in sodified soils this induces perched water table and restricts salt displacement to sub soil layers moreover the sodified surface soils are prone to crusting and becoming very hard and dense hard setting soils on drying all these factors impede root proliferation and thus impact crop growth to overcome these constraints deep ploughing chiselling offers a short term measure e g deep chiselling before planting of wheat resulted in about 10 improvement in wheat yield over conventional tillage minhas and bajwa 2001 singh et al 2013 reported that deep tillage during alternate years in combination with gypsum 50 gr could sustain the yields of cluster bean wheat in alkali water rsc 8 5 meq l 1 sar 14 7 the other alternative to improve surface soil drainage is to adapt furrow irrigation and raised bed planting firb system aicrp ssw 1972 2016 its comparison with conventional planting for 3 years showed an overall improvement in yields of pearl millet and wheat by 16 and 22 respectively in addition to few water logging effects during monsoon the advantage of such a system was low irrigation water requirements during rabi season nevertheless during the deficit rainfall years more salt accumulated toward the centre of the beds thus affecting the growth of the central row conservation tillage systems which are now becoming popular with rice wheat have also been tried in alkali water irrigated soils malik et al 2000 the practice of zero tillage in a soil irrigated with alkali water ec 2 8 ds m 1 rsc 8 5 meq l 1 sar 8 8 either with or without application of gypsum or fym before rice decreased soil ph sare sustained higher yields of wheat and saved irrigation water yaduvanshi and sharma 2008 as an alternative a practice popular with the farmers of the alkali water irrigated areas is to spread the wheat seed at the time of last irrigation to rice which is later harvested by combines that leave stubble at the soil surface such a practice not only helps in timely seeding of wheat the straw mulch improves thermal regimes and checks evaporation losses such that the crop matures with only two three post plant irrigations as compared with normal recommendation of four five irrigations singh et al 2010 4 conclusions and future directions ground waters which induce sodicity build up in soils and thereby diminish the benefits of irrigation exist in many parts of arid and semiarid regions sustained irrigations with these waters will possibly off set impacts of future scarcity of water resources and thus help in maintaining food security of especially the developing nations with concerted efforts at various research centers state of the art technologies are now available for controlling the sodification impacts on crop productivity and fragility of environment the recommended practices target the maintenance of soil structure vis à vis infiltration rates through chemical bio remediation means conjunctive use improved irrigation techniques enhanced organic carbon nutrient use efficiencies and other agronomic practices like proper crop selection deep tillage etc the integrated use of these component technologies is recommended for their economic viability under site specific conditions issues that require further attention include the utility of resource conservation technologies simulation models to perceive their long term impacts based upon ion chemistry of irrigation waters for typical agro ecosystems role of deficit irrigation micro irrigation

for their implementation taking clues from success stories on reclamation of naturally occurring sodic lands cook 2014 similar impetus is desired for sustenance of agricultural productivity on soils irrigated with sodic alkali waters for achieving desired success and economic returns based on specific conditions and resource mobilization future investments should be on comprehensive programs at the river basin or national level by taking into consideration a range of factors such as water availability and quality land use options and strategy and national strategies for climate change management and national water and food security priorities community mobilization and preparatory activities are essential for successful implementation of large scale projects based on sound economic analysis initially some pilot studies should provide insights into subsequent implementation of large scale projects in addition consistent and independent monitoring and evaluation of large scale projects is important to identify and address challenges in a timely and efficient manner in addition to socio economic benefits in terms of food security the environmental benefits from these waters would help mitigate climate change impacts by enhancing soil carbon sequestration this would contribute to the 2030 sustainable development agenda by addressing sdg 13 on combating climate change and sdg 15 on reversing land degradation eradicating extreme poverty and meeting the sdgs without adequately addressing underperforming land and water resources is highly unlikely 
11144,the continuous surge in irrigation particularly using groundwater for sustaining food security in many developing countries has necessitated the utilization of low quality waters especially in water scarce arid and semi arid regions inappropriate irrigation with these waters results in land and environment degradation produced by associated salts sodium and other toxic elements generally the soil s sodification process is insidious and build up of exchangeable na is initially gradual it stabilises at levels governed by sodicity indices of irrigation water soil type cropping sequences and agro climatic conditions as the soils become sodic crop productivity declines and ultimately soils can become unsuitable for cropping as a result cultivators are forced to opt for tolerant crops which are typically of less economic value to minimize harmful effects of sodicity remedial measures have been developed at the crop root zone farm and district basin levels these include water quality driven conjunctive uses chemical amelioration of soils and irrigation waters mobilising native calcite through phyto remediation growing tolerant crops and other specialised tillage fertiliser use and irrigation practices this review seeks to critically analyse the role of these measures and the crop water and soil factors defining the sodification vis à vis infiltration problems the conclusions provided here are expected to be helpful for a range of stakeholders to promote irrigation with sodic alkali waters thereby partly alleviating the forecasted scarcities in water for agriculture keywords alkali water sodic water soil amendments conjunctive use sodic soils infiltration problems 1 introduction globally the aquifer withdrawals for irrigation have witnessed a boom during the last few decades particularly in drought prone regions world over almost 43 of the irrigated area is groundwater dependent shah 2014 mainly in the agro economies of south asia using groundwater at 262 km3 yr 1 km3 billion m3 middle east north africa 87 km3 and east asia 57 km3 in terms of ground coverage the largest groundwater use areas are in india 39 m ha followed by china 19 m ha and usa 17 m ha since groundwater provides for a reliable source of water that can be used in a flexible manner farmers mostly utilize it to support intensive land cultivation and high value agriculture however a typical scenario has emerged in groundwater irrigated areas revealing the poor quality of underlying aquifers in water scarce areas nevertheless the priorities for high agricultural production and intensification are pushing cultivators to increasingly pump lower quality groundwater for irrigation the extensive use of saline and alkali ground waters for irrigating food grain fodder and fuel crops are widespread particularly in countries such as bangladesh china egypt india iran pakistan syria and the united states tanwar 2003 there is a trade off associated with extensive pumping of poor quality groundwater the better quality aquifers may be at risk from contamination stemming from adjoining poor water quality zones due to their overexploitation and the resultant fall of groundwater levels irrigation with poor quality groundwater without following the recommended soil water crop management strategies has severe impacts on soil health and the environment rhoades et al 1992 minhas and gupta 1992 minhas and samra 2003 the build up of salts sodium and other toxic ions in soils leads to a decline in both agricultural productivity and produce quality generally the sodification process is insidious and the build up of exchangeable na is initially gradual it stabilises at levels governed by sodicity indices of irrigation water soil type cropping sequences and agro climatic conditions when soil s sodicity levels exceed the tolerance thresholds of the prevalent crops their productivity declines and cultivators are left with no alternative but to opt for less profitable tolerant crops ultimately soils may become unsuitable for cropping the remedial measures and irrigation strategies that are required at crop root zone and farm level when using sodicity inducing waters are different from those using saline waters therefore specialised methods and remedial techniques are advocated to create a favourable soil environment for maximising agriculture productivity at the lowest cost hillel 2000 moreover their effective use should be tailored to local hydro geological and socio ecological realities while the issues related to sustainable use of saline drainage water are almost global these have been extensively investigated under field conditions and several critical reviews and comprehensive recommendations are available to overcome salinity problems minhas 1996 2012 rhoades 1999 tanwar 2003 grattan et al 2015 however sodic alkali ground waters exist mainly in the indian sub continent and there has been a lack of such an analysis on the impacts of irrigation with these waters on soils and crops this review highlights the importance of achieving sustainability of agricultural productivity through augmenting the use of sodicity inducing groundwater this information is expected to enhance the possibilities of sustained irrigation with lower quality waters by offering opening to overcome water shortages for agriculture 2 impacts of alkali sodic irrigation waters on soils and crops 2 1 chemical impacts soil sodification irrigation water quality is assessed based on the potential of water to cause salinity sodicity alkalinity and toxicity hazards the parameters used for their soluble salt contents are total dissolved salts tds and electrical conductivity ec alkalinity ph and sodium na saturation esp exchangeable sodium percent in soils is a consequence of a higher proportion of na relative to ca and mg and that of carbonates co3 and hco3 in irrigation waters various indices to determine the sodicity and alkalinity potential of irrigation waters are sodium adsorption ratio sar adjusted sar adj rna and residual sodium carbonate rsc these are calculated as sar na ca mg 2 0 5 adj rna na cax mg 2 0 5 rsc co3 hco3 ca mg where concentrations are expressed in milli equivalent per litre meq l 1 cax represents the modified concentration of ca due to salinity ionic strength and hco3 ca ratio suarez 1981 ayers and westcot 1985 hence the notations of saline sodic and alkali are used here for irrigation waters with ec 2 0 ds m 1 sar 10 and rsc 2 5 meq l 1 respectively considering no precipitation early water quality criteria considered that the irrigated soils accumulated sodium on exchange complex in proportion of sar in long term studies chauhan et al 1991 though the sare sar of saturation paste extract even approached 2 sariw after the irrigation of dry season winter crops these declined considerably following rains received during monsoon season therefore the overall increase in esp is considerably less than sariw especially at high levels sariw 20 the factors like soil texture and its salt release characteristics e g calcite content quantities of applied irrigation water and episodic events of rainfall associated anions e g so4 2 further modify the final esp build up in soils manchanda et al 1989 chauhan et al 1991 singh et al 1992 minhas and gupta 1992 a number of systematic agronomic investigations have evaluated the long term sodification of soils occurring with sodic alkali irrigation waters especially in north west india bajwa et al 1983 1986 1992 1993 bajwa and josan 1989a b sharma and mondal 1981 sharma and minhas 1997a 2004 minhas et al 2007a b choudhary et al 2011a with exchange of divalent cations and their release from the inherent calcite and other soil minerals the initial rates of sodification were found to be slow however the chances of soil solutions to concentrate in surface soil get augmented through a distilling out effect of evapo transpiration when the water infiltration rates are slowed with increase in sodicity relative infiltration rate rir 0 3 at an esp 20 such conditions further increase the sodicity and thereby steady state conditions as were the basis for earlier sodicity indices e g adj sar by bower et al 1968 and rhoades 1968 are not attained in shorter intervals rather field observations on esp are usually contrary to those predicted with adj sar indices which state that sodification should be lower with increased leaching fractions lf higher quantities of irrigation water to the rice wheat cropping system lf 0 6 0 8 resulted in faster sodification especially of surface soil esp 2 4 sar when compared with upland crops such as cotton maize and pearl millet in rotation with wheat minhas and gupta 1992 minhas and bjwa 2001 thus rather than 1 lf that has been most commonly used to define the concentration factors the general experience is that stabilisation of ph and esp do occur when a quasi equilibrium is achieved after alkali water irrigation for about four five years and their levels usually depend upon cropping sequence and other agro climatic conditions fig 1 thereafter the further sodification slows down minhas and sharma 2006 analysed a large number of agronomic experiments n 100 where irrigation waters in the range of ec 0 4 10 ds m 1 sar 0 6 43 adj sar 0 6 102 adj rna 0 6 57 and rsc 0 15 meq l 1 were applied for longer term 5 years on light textured soils loamy sand to silt loam for fallow wheat cotton wheat maize millet wheat and rice wheat rotations the coefficient of determination for predicting esp with different indices of sodicity like sar adj sar adj rna were only r2 0 20 0 32 the predictability improved considerably fig 2 r2 0 69 when the concentration and dilution factors were included in terms of the annual quantities of alkali waters applied diw as irrigation the rainfall drw at the site and the evapo transpiration demands of the crops grown in sequence et as esp diw drw 1 drw et adj rna considering the diversified situations of agro climate and soil types from which the data sets were obtained the overall predictability seems quite satisfactory it should however be mentioned that adj rna considers the precipitation of calcite caco3 only since ground waters with residual alkalinity also have appreciable contents of chloride and sulphate ions cl so4 hco3 0 3 5 7 these also affect ca concentrations of soil solutions firstly in the case of calcite gypsum controlled system competition for ca would allow more hco3 to stay in solution gypsum precipitation would remove ca and so4 and thus calcite precipitation may be overestimated additionally relatively higher dissolution of gypsum with rainwater during monsoon season than that of calcite should add more ca to solution in fact a critical re look at the predicted and reported sodicity esp values brought out that the over predictions were mainly for alkali waters that contained considerable neutral salts cl so4 along with residual alkalinity the presence of neutral salts is also reported to result in the enhanced dissolution of calcite and ca primary minerals dubey et al 1988 nadler and magaritz 1991 since neutral salts are first to be dissolved and displaced with rainwater the above processes would lead to decline of na in soil solution and thus cause a decrease in sar of the soil solution vis à vis sodicity in soils relatively reduced sodification when so4 was the dominant anion following hco3 as compared with cl dominance in alkali waters was reported by minhas et al 2007b 2 2 physical impacts soil infiltration problems the sodification leads to soil structure deterioration and consequently in manifestation of physical stresses for example the formation of surface crust impacts the emergence of seedlings water stagnation with reduced infiltration causes anoxic conditions causes impaired root growth with hard setting and induces dispersion and swelling of clays these factors ultimately affect water storage and its movement to roots tillage and sowing operations also become more difficult with soil structural deterioration oster and jaywardane 1998 and restricted water movement into and through soils can induce additional surface retention of salts minhas et al 2004 several studies since the 1950s have demonstrated the tendency for swelling aggregate failures and increase in dispersion rates with an increase in esp and a decline in salinity even non sodic soils with esp 3 may behave like sodic soils at very low electrolyte concentrations oster and schroer 1979 shainberg and letey 1984 minhas and sharma 1986 sumner et al 1998 oster et al 1999 there is a salinity sodicity continuum and highly sodic soils require high salinities for soil stabilization soil water intake in terms of infiltration permeability values should decline in most of the soils when concentration of electrolytes in permeating water is inadequate to compensate for high na effects this formed the basis of the earlier water quality criteria which included combinations of ec and sar to maintain infiltration rates of soils ayers and westcot 1985 analogous to sar a ratio namely cross cation ratio of soil structural stability was put forward by rengasamy and marchuk 2011 where flocculation value of mg for soil clays is 0 69 to that of ca under field situations rainfall and irrigation water infiltration alternate especially during the monsoon season generally upland crops suffer the most due to water stagnation problems during the rainy season and soil crusts may form due to beating action of raindrops after simulating monsoonal rainwater infiltration conditions using de ionised water drastic reductions in hydraulic conductivity were observed even at sar esp around 5 and such reductions were irreversible minhas and sharma 1986 field observations n 19 further corroborated this where infiltration rates of sandy loam soils irrigated with saline sodic waters ssw ec 2 3 11 0 ds m 1 sar 10 28 were monitored to be 8 7 2 6 cm h 1 with ssw and were reduced to 4 4 1 6 cm h 1 when deionised water simulating rainwater srw followed ssw while the values were 2 7 0 8 cm h 1 with srw and improved only to 3 3 1 0 cm h 1 when ssw followed srw aicrp ssw 1972 2016 slaking upon wetting and thereafter translocation of dispersed clay particles was also reported to be the main cause of limiting infiltration of rainfall water shainberg and letey 1984 oster et al 1999 sumner et al 1998 in a field experiment where wheat pearl millet crop rotation was irrigated on a sandy loam soil with various ec 6 and 12 ds m 1 and sar 10 20 30 and 40 waters for 8 years its steady infiltration rates ir declined to 5 10 of the normal soil minhas et al 1994 the recoupment in ir with saline waters was only 22 28 even though the flocculation values of clays for such illitic soils are 30 40 meq l 1 this finding established that in the monsoonal climate dispersed colloidal clays get transported with the traction of infiltrating rainwater and the process over the longer periods leads to the formation of subsoil zone which gets enriched with illuviated clays this zone is below the plow layer where remixing of move in clay does not occur with tillage operations the deposited clays lead to development of relatively finer pore sizes and more dead end pores lowering the overall porosity ultimately this zone becomes a sort of permanent throttle for downward movement of water and thus controls steady state infiltration rates minhas et al 1999 confirmed this with six cycles of alterations of saline 80 meq l 1 sar 10 20 and 30 and simulated rain waters deionised ec 0 02 ds m 1 where the washed in subsoil as evidenced from depth distributions of hydraulic head and dispersible clay became restrictive and had major control over k values fig 3 the calcium released in highly calcareous soil calcite 9 7 showed some effects in alleviating the impacts of high sar waters the quantum of clays that can undergo translocation and their settling depth should depend upon the soil texture and its mineralogy which define their inherent infiltration characteristics and the modifying factors like sodicity level of the soil its salt release characteristics among others for this consequent measurements of k values with sodic water and followed by de ionised water simulating rainwater should serve as a better diagnostic criterion for infiltration hazards minhas 2010 with simultaneous rising of ph alkali waters prove more deleterious than those with neutral salts sharma and minhas 1997b reported that in an illitic sandy loam soil the effect of sar for waters with neutral salts cl so4 and adj sar for water with residual alkalinity on infiltration rates were negative and similar in magnitude the heavy textured soils surapaneni and olsson 2002 and those put under rice wheat systems are even more prone to an infiltration problem when irrigated with sodic alkali waters bajwa et al 1983 minhas and gupta 1992 although the primary concern has mostly been shown for the water movement into the soils sodicity also influences the movement of water through the soils impinging upon salt dynamics a reduced drainage co efficient of subsurface soil enriched with moved in dispersed clays may lead to low anoxic conditions with reduced odrs oxygen diffusion rates while the reduced unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ relations would restrict the water movement vis à vis the root water uptake minhas et al 1994 moreover the dispersion and movement of clay induces flow through finer pores and results in dead end pores these conditions lower the leaching efficiency by holding back salts lowering of salts upon leaching in soils irrigated with sodic waters singh et al 1992 and with residual alkalinity sharma and khosla 1984 often leads to an increase in ph vulnerability to clay dispersion and a sharp decline in infiltration rates therefore these soils required almost double the water 0 9 1 3 cm cm 1 soil for accomplishing the same amount of leaching 80 removal of initial salt compared with structurally stable saline soils 0 4 1 0 cm cm 1 studies reveal that the leaching efficiency improved by adding gypsum to the soils irrigated with saline sodic waters singh et al 1992 but not in soils irrigated with alkali water sharma and khosla 1984 2 3 impacts on crops productivity plant growth and development in soils irrigated with sodic alkali waters depends on several complex factors like ion toxicities e g na hco3 etc ca deficiency with its precipitation as calcite nutritional imbalance dispersive behaviour leading to lesser salt leaching and other soil physical constraints rhoades et al 1992 stated that in case ca in soil solution is 2 mmol l 1 high sar will not show adverse effect on most crops as distinguishable from salinity usually the adverse effects of highly saline sodic water ec 4 ds m 1 sar 20 on soil structure lead to lesser quantities of monsoon rains to infiltrate into soils thereby rendering soils saline due to poor leaching of winter season accumulated salts therefore elevated levels of salinity as induced by high sar 30 and 40 mmol l 1 waters was reported as the main reason for yield decline in pearl millet wheat rotation when irrigated with waters of various combinations of ec 6 and 12 ds m 1 and sar 10 20 30 and 40 mmol l 1 for 8 years singh et al 1992 rainfall received during monsoon season further defined the yields of pearl millet fig 4 as expected the dilution and salt leaching were reduced during low rainfall years while simultaneous water stagnation problems during higher rainfall years affected pearl millet yields and the decline was more at higher sar of irrigation water the impacts of high sar were also more pronounced on black clay loam soil minhas and gupta 1992 and a shift to water logging and salinity tolerant crop like sesbania sesbania sesbans was a promising alternative during monsoon rains bhu dayal et al 2009 earlier examples for viability of alkali water usage were i the soils to be irrigated should be deep have adequate drainage and loamy sand to sandy loam in texture ii only winter semi tolerant crops such as wheat and barley should be grown and iii monsoon rainfall during fallow kharif summer monsoon season should be at least 400 mm for adequate dissolution of precipitated calcite manchanda et al 1989 however alkali ground waters are more prevalent in the annual rainfall zone of 500 750 mm where double cropping is regular practice several reports have subsequently emerged where the ability of different crops to perform under alkali water irrigated conditions has been evaluated in different agro ecosystems that are typical to north western parts of india table 1 maize productivity declined with sodification of a sandy loam soil with irrigation waters of ec 1 15 4 5 ds m 1 rsc 2 and 8 meq l 1 and sar 11 6 38 5 for 5 years relative yield ry of maize could be described by the relation ry 109 4 1 95 esp however the highest esp 30 5 was within tolerance limits of wheat and thus its yields were not affected bajwa et al 1983 in a similar study with alkali irrigation waters ec 1 4 1 6 ds m 1 sar 11 4 19 2 adj sar 20 5 41 0 bajwa and josan 1989c reported sustained crop yields during the initial two years in rice wheat and pearl millet wheat rotation using quadratic relations between adj sar and rice wheat yields the estimated values of adj sar values for obtaining 90 75 and 50 of the relative yields were estimated to be 23 28 and 32 respectively while the counter values were 10 28 and 36 for pearl millet wheat rotation for another high water requiring crop sugarcane after one year of irrigation with alkali water ec 1 2 ds m 1 rsc 10 meq l 1 and saline alkali water ec 3 ds m 1 rsc 10 meq l 1 the sugar yield was reduced to 10 2 and 8 3 mg ha 1 respectively while it was 12 2 mg ha 1under canal water irrigation the yields continued to decline further to 0 29 and 0 18 mg ha 1towards the end of the 10 year experimentation period choudhary et al 2004 when cotton wheat 4 years and following pearl wheat 7 years were irrigated with waters of varying residual alkalinity 5 and 10 meq l 1 salinity 2 and 4 ds m 1 and sodicity sar 10 20 and 30 yields of kharif crops cotton pearl millet were reduced by 9 36 with the effects being more in pearl millet sharma and minhas 2004 overall wheat yields could be sustained ry 90 with waters having ec 4 ds m 1 sar 30 and rsc 10 and cotton pearl millet ry 80 with waters of ec ds m 1 sar 20 and rsc 5 the first cotton crop remained unaffected but the yields declined in subsequent crops of wheat and cotton when a sandy loam soil was irrigated with a saline sodic water ec 3 32 ds m 1 sar 16 3 sar adj 18 2 rsc 5 2 meq l 1 in the indus basin murtaza et al 2006 rainfall plays an important role in areas irrigated with sodic alkali waters not only as a substitute for irrigation water and to achieve salt balances but by being unsaturated with ca it also helps in dissolving calcite and other soil minerals impacts of rainfall were isolated in rice wheat rotation when alkali waters of varying rsc 5 and 10 meq l 1 sar adj rna 13 6 and 29 2 and cl so4 4 1 and 1 4 combinations but with similar total salts 30 meq l 1 were used for irrigation minhas et al 2007b relative yields of rice and wheat averaged 56 74 and 81 88 of good quality water ec 0 5 ds m 1 rsc nil during the initial four years indicating that the former is more sensitive to irrigation with alkali water when crops were protected by rain shelters almost complete mortality of rice crop after two years signified the contribution of monsoonal rainfall in sustaining irrigation with alkali waters production functions further brought out that in addition to the sodicity esp salinity simultaneously inhibited growth and defined crop performance especially for salt sensitive rice crops threshold ec 1 4 ds m 1 the impacts of residual alkalinity were comparatively lower when so4 was the dominant anion in the irrigation water rather than cl the consensus that emerges from the above evidences is that degradation of soils and productivity losses are aggravated when alkali water is used for rice wheat systems since the viability of this system was questionable earlier water quality guidelines recommend avoiding rice in crop rotations minhas and gupta 1992 minhas and sharma 2006 while evaluating a large dataset available on the use of waters with residual alkalinity predicted that crop yields could be sustained with water of adj rna ranging from 14 27 mmol l 1in fallow millet maize cotton wheat rotation while the values were about half 6 14 mmol l 1 for a rice wheat rotation still the farmers of the afflicted areas prefer the cultivation of rice wheat while evaluating the causes of persistence among farmers relying on rice wheat rotation minhas et al 2004 concluded that in addition to economics the rice wheat are prevalent because i the establishment of upland crops during kharif is usually difficult because of water stagnation vis à vis root aeration problems on these structurally unstable sodified soils ii the demand for continuous submergence in rice helps in better and uniform salt leaching than the upland crops where rain water is usually drained off to avoid its stagnation iii rice helps in conjunctive use with canal water since it can be adjusted as and when available due to submergence requirement of rice while its use for upland crops is possible only during dry periods between episodic rain events and iv if groundwater contain sufficient ca i e up to 2 mmol l 1 thus soils are less responsive to gypsum application 3 management options for sustaining crop production the management options leading to sustainable crop productivity with saline sodic alkali irrigation waters should aim at practices that do not allow build up of root zone sodicity to levels that impair soil productivity and also those options that help in alleviation of sodicity impacts to promote crop growth attempts have therefore been made through conjunctive use of water resources chemical amelioration of alkali waters soils mobilising the native calcite through phyto remediation growing sodicity tolerant crops and other agronomic measures minhas and samra 2003 minhas et al 2004 sharma and minhas 2005 qadir and oster 2004 2007 choudhary et al 2011b minhas 2012 since these measures may not control sodicity of irrigated soils when executed in isolation integration of the available crop irrigation soils chemical and other agronomic practices is desirable 3 1 use of amendments 3 1 1 soil applied amendments the degradation of soils with sodification can be alleviated with extraneous input of amendments which either contains ca e g gypsum or those that on reaction with calcite release ca in soil solutions e g sulphur sulphuric acid pyrites etc the viability of these amendments should be judged from alleviation in soil constraints to improve crop yields versus the cost involved since the application of amendments is a recurring need under alkali water irrigated conditions the effects of various amendments their doses modes and frequency of application have been studied at large table 2 early observations suggested that wheat may not respond to applied gypsum when rsc of irrigation water is below 10 meq l 1 soils are light textured loamy sand sandy loam fields are kept fallow during kharif

millet could be cultivated successfully by maintaining esp between 15 and 20 with application of gypsum sharma and manchanda 1989 the site was semi arid with annual rainfall 500 mm similarly after two years with gypsum application 100 gr of both soil and alkali waters moderate yields of wheat 2 61 mg ha 1 and mustard 2 0 mg ha 1 were harvested on an abandoned soil because of irrigation with alkali waters rsc 7 2 8 9 meq l 1 under an arid climate joshi and dhir 1991 however the gypsum 50 gr sufficed for cultivating kharif crops like pearl millet urd bean mung bean cowpea and pigeon pea on a soil

gypsum than wheat and barley later reports from the same site singh et al 2008 showed that application of gypsum to neutralise rsc above 2 8 meq l 1 increased wheat yield by 53 pearl millet 88 mustard

potato tomato brinjal and cluster bean grown in sequence using an alkali water rsc 11 6 meq l 1 sar 14 0 on a long term basis 15 years and a sandy loam soil averaged 3 years each only 13 41 1 65 0 30

gypsum equalling 100 rsc neutralisation under rice wheat cropping system irrigated with alkali water ec 2 6 ds m 1 sar 20 5 rsc 9 5 meq l 1 sharma and mondal 1982 observed wheat productivity to improve with gypsum application while no response was initially observed in rice gypsum to neutralise rsc equivalent of 2 5 and 5 0 meq l 1could sustain yields of wheat and rice receiving irrigation with waters of rsc 8 4 and 13 2 meq l 1 respectively bajwa and josan 1989a similarly the sustainable yield index syi with application of gypsum 50 and 100 gr ranged between 0 57 0 65 and 0 54 0 65 in rice and wheat respectively indicating that 50 gr is sufficient sharma et al 2001 more pronounced benefits of gypsum rsc 2 5 meq l 1 neutralization were observed in cane yield of sugarcane 30 increase that was irrigated with alkali water rsc 10 meq l 1 sar 19 8 ec 1 43 ds m 1 as compared with saline alkali water rsc 10 meq l 1 sar 31 2 ec 2 90 ds m 1 where the improvement was about 13 choudhary et al 2004 the effects of gypsum were complemented by fym farmyard manure especially when alkali water was used while working with different crop rotations sharma et al 2001 concluded that i growth of wheat cultivated after rice mainly depends upon soil ph and its sodicity and therefore it usually respond to gypsum when rsc is 5 meq l 1 ii when fields are kept fallow during kharif the carried over soil salinity also governs growth of wheat and therefore its response to gypsum remains variable and iii when wheat is grown after sorghum the interactive effects of ece ph and sare of soils govern its response to gypsum e g at a given ph as sare rises ece should be lower higher yields of rice and wheat were also observed in a saline sodic soil when treated with gypsum and irrigated with alkali water in cyclic mode with good water murtaza et al 2013 therefore it emerges that gypsum applications are required on a recurring basis to minimise impacts of irrigation water having high residual alkalinity especially in high water demanding rotations like rice wheat saline sodic soils developed with high sar saline water irrigation are also prone to reduced infiltration and thereby temporary water logging especially during monsoonal season therefore small additions of gypsum may help maintain structural stability and thus avoid water stagnations vis à vis aeration problems during rainy season application of phospho gypsum helped in preventing surface crusts and maintained the yields of cotton 5 mg ha 1 in a soil that was irrigated with saline sodic water ec 4 6 ds m 1 sar 26 for 16 years in negev region of israel keren et al 1990 in pearl millet wheat irrigated with waters of varying sar 10 40 mmol l 1 but similar salinity ec 8 ds m 1 gypsum application at 25 gr improved the average yields 1999 2002 of pearl millet by 5 23 aicrp ssw 1972 2016 response to gypsum was observed mainly during the years when episodic events of rainfall and consequent water stagnation problems occurred during its initial stages and the overall effects of applied gypsum were higher at sar of 30 and 40 mmol l 1 the yields of pearl millet further improved 5 11 by draining out the stagnating rainwater after heavy rainfall events however the long term consequences of removing rain stagnated water needs to be further examined since such a practice could reduce the volume of rainwater for salt leaching 3 1 2 mode and time of amendment application smaller doses of gypsum to neutralise the rsc 8 meq l 1 of each irrigation was reported to be better in improving the crop yields in maize wheat system rather than an annual application bajwa et al 1989a however in a later experiment with rice wheat system irrigated with alkali water rsc 6 8 meq l 1 sar 8 4 the response to gypsum was at par when applied either annually before rice crop or with each irrigation while application of gypsum before transplanting was better in rice irrigated with alkali water rsc 10 3 meq l 1 sar 13 5 this was ascribed to appreciable sodification during rice growth because of its high irrigation water requirements similarly in pearl millet wheat crops the application of gypsum before the onset of monsoons was more effective as compared with its application either before wheat crop or with each irrigation yadav and kumar 1994 when pyrite was applied to amend the deleterious effects of high rsc waters chauhan et al 1986 reported that application before wheat was better than its mixing with irrigation water or its small doses before each irrigation longer term performance of rice and wheat was better when gypsum pyrite was applied every year compared with its application every 3 years minhas et al 2004 recently murtaza et al 2015 has reported that a coarse textured salt affected soil could be reclaimed with saline sodic water ec 3 94 ds m 1 sar 18 2 rsc nil in combination with gypsum the grain yield of wheat improved by 9 42 and 75 when gypsum applied was 50 and 100 gr and to neutralise 100 rsc of irrigation water respectively 3 1 3 water amelioration techniques responses to gypsum application in general show that application at each irrigation was superior or at least as effective in mitigation of the sodicity effects of alkali water irrigation therefore efforts have been made to devise mechanisms for dissolving gypsum in alkali water itself in terms of specially designed gypsum beds passing of alkali waters through these beds further eliminates the expense of grinding bagging and storing mined gypsum before field usage the beds are designed for specific dissolution of ca from gypsum and their dimensions depend upon factors like surface area as defined by the distribution of different sized fragments the reaction time driven by the velocity with which water would pass through the bed and the ion chemistry of irrigation water pal and poonia 1979 pal and poonia 1979 singh et al 1986 for practical purposes the ca2 dissolution through gypsum beds can be as high as 8 meq l 1 when similar doses of gypsum were applied either by ameliorating the alkali water rsc 9 meq l 1 with gypsum beds or its soil application the 5 year average crop yields were superior in sorghum mustard rotations while these were similar in rice wheat minhas et al 2004 in a similar 5 year field experiment with sorghum wheat the pyrite bed was more effective in reducing residual alkalinity 14 2 to 8 9 meq l 1 than the gypsum bed 11 2 meq l 1 as indicated by higher crop yields aicrp ssw 1972 2016 the wheat grain yield averaged 4 years 1 58 mg ha 1 with alkali water and improved to 2 56 2 98 mg ha 1 when soil was amended with gypsum 50 150 gr and 2 46 3 02 mg ha 1 with pyrite 50 150 gr the yield was 2 68 and 2 72 mg ha 1 when irrigation water was passed through gypsum and pyrite beds respectively however the highest dry forage production of sorghum 11 78 mg ha 1 was monitored with pyrite beds whereas production was 5 66 8 64 11 54 8 5 11 06 and 10 00 mg ha 1 with alkali water as such soil applied gypsum 50 150 gr pyrite 50 150 gr and gypsum bed respectively these results reveal that amelioration of water itself can help in efficient utilization of amendments like gypsum and pyrite though the availability and economics of the pyrite remains uncertain viability of gypsum beds is further evident from many field trials with wheat mustard and gram on farmer s fields where the bcr benefit cost ratio and irr internal rate of return of these beds was computed to be 2 04 and 40 2 respectively aicrp ssw 1972 2016 an alternative to beds is to keep the clods of gypsum in water courses channels used for irrigation qadir et al 2007 aicrp ssw 1972 2016 treatment of irrigation water with acid leads to its reaction with hco3 and co3 to form co2 gas plus water as well as it lowers the ph of water which allows for more ca and mg to remain in the soil solution and displace na from exchange sites rather than its precipitation as calcite therefore sulphurous acid generators sag have been developed for producing sulphur dioxide gas so2 through the burning of sulphur in specially designed chambers so2 is later dissolved in 10 15 of irrigation water to produce sulphurous acid h2so3 the ameliorated waters are then mixed with original alkali water for irrigating the degraded soils qadir et al 2001 kahlown and gill 2003 studies suggest that rsc of saline sodic water was decreased from 5 4 to 3 6 meq l 1 after sag treatment whilst having no impact on sar ec zia et al 2006 it was also reported that sag sulphuric acid and gypsum were at par in improving rice yields but the costs involved in sag and sulphuric acid treatment were about six times greater than gypsum therefore because of economic considerations sag s are not becoming popular 3 1 4 use of organic green manures the beneficial effects of organic green manure as a source of nutrients and on improvement of soil structure and permeability are well established in addition to their nutritional benefits these have multiple benefits in term of bioremediation under sodic soil environments qadir et al 2006 organic acids produced during their decomposition and the increased pco2 in soils help to mobilise the inherent ca from calcite and other minerals moreover the ca and other cationic contents of these organic materials also get released on their decomposition green manure crops like sesbania also release protons h during n2 ﬁxation to lower soil ph and thus help in dissolving calcite qadir and oster 2004 the solubilised ca during above processes thereby replaces a part of exchangeable na the long term effects of additions of organic green manures on lowering of sodicity in soils have been well recognised nevertheless these may rather lead to enhanced dispersion of sodic soils on a short term basis and therefore caution is placed on their application to soils undergoing sodication in an already deteriorated soil with the use of alkali water ec 4 ds m 1 sar 26 rsc 15 meq l 1 wheat yield and soil permeability further declined when fym was applied alone but the performance of pearl millet and sorghum improved markedly with combined use of fym and gypsum sharma and manchanda 1989 dhankar et al 1990 later reported that longer term additions of fym improved ph infiltration rate and wheat yield to 9 7 8 1 mm h 1 and 3 14 mg ha 1 respectively while the corresponding values were 10 3 5 3 mm h 1 and 2 7 mg ha 1 under alkali water irrigation rsc 2 4 16 meq l 1 alone the response to fym however declined at higher rsc 16 meq l 1 therefore to overcome short term enhancement in dispersion with fym the upland kharif crops should be preceded with gypsum whilst the rice crop which requires submergence may benefit from reduced infiltration rates minhas et al 1995 reported rice and wheat yields to improve by 8 10 by additions of fym in alkali water ec 3 2 ds m 1 rsc 5 6 meq l 1 sar 11 3 irrigated soils through improved soil ph sodicity and fertility synergetic effects of adding fym and gypsum for improving sugar yield were later observed by choudhary et al 2004 the productivity 8 6 12 3 mg ha 1 was higher with alkali water irrigation as compared with saline sodic water 7 4 10 7 mg ha 1 in the case of saline sodic water sugar yield 10 8 mg ha 1 with fym additions was higher as compared with gypsum 9 1 mg ha 1 and was at par with combined use of gypsum plus fym murtaza et al 2013 also recorded marked improvements in yields of rice and wheat when these received fym and gypsum and were irrigated alternatively with fresh and sodic water sekhon and bajwa 1993 reported the potential of the organic materials to decrease the precipitation of ca and hco3 cause removal of na decrease soil ph and esp under rice wheat maize system irrigated with alkali waters rsc 6 0 and 10 6 meq l 1 the improvement in crop yields was the maximum with rice straw followed by green manuring and fym choudhary et al 2011b after monitoring the long term 15 year impacts of fym and green manuring gm concluded that improvements in soil ph and esp were on par while the performance of both rice and wheat was better with fym the yields of rice and wheat were increased by 38 and 26 with fym respectively over those obtained with sodic water without amendment application rsc 10 12 5 meq l 1 the corresponding increase with gypsum applied 50 gr was 18 and 19 similarly the gm and wheat straw ws resulted in 22 and 17 higher yields of rice while the impacts on wheat were similar 20 even in a long term experiment with vegetables rsc 11 6 meq l 1 the addition of gypsum 50 and 100 neutralisation of rsc along with organic amendments fym 10 20 mg ha 1 triggered the process of amelioration of these waters and consequently enhanced the yields of crops phogat et al 2010 other reports yaduvanshi and swarup 2005 murtaza et al 2009 buttar et al 2017 further support the above results whereby synergetic effects of organic and inorganic amendments were reported for improvements in crop productivity the trade off of organic materials is that it can help in reducing the gypsum demands required to off set the impacts of alkali waters and thus their use should be promoted for better crop productivity 3 2 conjunctive use of water under many situations supplies of good quality canal waters may be available to a limited extent and farmers may need to use these waters along with poor quality ground waters for meeting the crop demands the strategies usually adopted for the combined use of the two sources are either to apply these in cyclic mode where canal water irrigation coincides with sensitive growth stages or after mixing the two waters to attain water of acceptable quality by dilution most efforts thus far have been directed towards combining canal water with saline water for irrigation since soluble salts are mobile and relatively easier to displace the strategies include either the use of non saline canal water for pre plant irrigation and early crop growth to control salinity of the seed zone and prospective root zone during initial stages or for salt sensitive crops and switching over to saline water irrigation at tolerant growth stages crops minhas and gupta 1992 rhoades et al 1992 minhas 1996 nevertheless the strategy that minimises the sodification either reducing ca precipitation as calcite or increasing its release through calcite dissolution should be better minhas and bajwa 2001 groundwaters in aquifers are in equilibrium with soil minerals like calcite dolomite etc at a higher pco2 while surface canal waters with low ca are in a state of unsaturation with respect to calcite therefore irrigation with the latter and their blends should have a tendency to solubilise inherent ca which would decline with proportions of alkali groundwater in the blend the effect of the cyclic uses either inter intra seasonally or blending the two water supplies has been evaluated on longer term basis bajwa and josan 1989c minhas et al 2007a chauhan et al 2007 choudhary et al 2011b the crop productivity data under different modes of application of good quality gw and alkali aw waters for various cropping rotations have been included in table 3 it is evident that even when using waters with residual alkalinity the better intra seasonal cyclic use option is to start with good quality water gw and if opting for inter seasonal cyclic use using alkali water aw during monsoon rains would help sustain higher crop yields crops irrigated under a cyclic regime also tended to out perform those that are irrigated with blended waters while revisiting data it emerged that because of the number of irrigations required to raise crops in the different sequences the fractions of alkali waters aw were lower when good quality water gw was used to start with as compared to those in blended waters and some times also when alkali waters were applied initially therefore based upon the relations between relative crop yields ry and the fractions of alkali water aw applied under blending the ry s were estimated for same fractions of aw used under different cyclic use modes and are plotted in fig 5 the cyclic use still showed a marginal advantage when gw was used initially over blending the yields matched each other when aw was used for the initial one or two irrigations while these were less when the initial four irrigations were with aw similar advantages were earlier reported for equal salt input when saline and non saline waters were applied in cyclic or mixing mode minhas and gupta 1992 1993 rhoades 1999 also proposed that more crop consumable water is lost under blending and therefore for similar supplies of water the sequential use of non saline and saline water performs better the alterations in precipitation with alkali water irrigation and dissolution of freshly precipitated calcite with good quality canal water under cyclic uses seem to retain more ca in solution phase as compared with continued precipitation vis à vis sodication phase under blending though it occurs at a slower pace than original alkali water this was substantiated from ph sare and esp build up in soils monitored after 6 years of combined use either cyclic or blends with same proportions of gw ec 0 5 ds m 1 rsc nil and aw ec 2 3 ds m 1 rsc 11 3 meq l 1 sar 15 in rice wheat system minhas et al 2007a on the whole the cyclic use of surface canal and alkali water a strategy that shows higher yield potential and also more flexibility in its implementation can be considered as practical way to alleviate sodicity problems 3 3 choice of crops and varieties crops vary a lot in their tolerance of sodicity in soils in addition the ability of crops to perform under sodic irrigation is also defined by their tolerance to excessive soil moisture in rhizosphere or surface water logging permissible limits of esp surface 0 15 m soil tolerance of crops have been established from alkali sites undergoing reclamation with additions of gypsum and were compiled by gupta and abrol 1990 under these conditions rice with esp limit of 60 70 was the most tolerant followed by beets barley and sesbania esp 50 60 oats mustard cotton wheat and tomatoes esp 30 50 clover groundnut cowpea onion pearl millet linseed garlic and cluster bean esp 20 30 and chickpea soybean black gram peas lentil and pigeon pea esp 10 20 however the tolerance to sodicity espt in soils undergoing sodication with water having residual alkalinity is comparatively lower than the sodic soil under reclamation with gypsum minhas and sharma 2006 the obvious reasons seem to be the differential availability of ca in soil solution ca precipitates out as calcite in soils irrigated with alkali waters whereas dissolution of applied gypsum improves ca in the soil solution of alkali soils under reclamation moreover the concentration of soil solutions after the cessation of monsoon rains when the most kharif crops are at critical flowering and grain filling stages affects crop performance e g rice with threshold salinity level as 1 4 ds m 1 in addition to their sodicity salinity tolerance the choice of crops is governed by their water demands and the agro climatic conditions rice being a high water requiring crop also results in the maximum sodification of soils as compared to other upland crops and is also more sensitive under sodic irrigation the permissible limits for sustaining yields in the cropping sequences prevalent in north west india have been established table 4 in terms of adj rna of alkali waters for different rainfall zones minhas and sharma 2006 rice wheat with permissible limits of adj rna being almost half compared with millet wheat rotations is the most unsustainable cropping sequence therefore a general recommendation is to avoid rice with sodic waters the importance of rainfall is also evident e g in areas with annual rainfall more than 600 mm the permissible limit of adj sar is almost two fold 1 8 times as compared to sites where annual rainfall less than 400 mm the crop cultivars also show variability in their tolerance to sodicity maintenance of low na k ratio in shoot either through avoidance of na uptake or its exclusion sharma et al 2015 and the profuse rooting choudhary et al 2012 are the preferred characters for their better sodicity tolerance the cultivars with high yield potential were earlier preferred even for higher sodicity conditions but with later breeding efforts crop varieties e g csr 30 in rice and krl 219 in wheat which are both high yielding and tolerant to sodicity are now available these varieties are becoming an attractive option for the poor farmers lacking resources for affording costly amendments marker assisted and genomics based approaches are further being employed to accelerate the pace of genetic improvement for developing high yielding and multiple stress e g salt sodicity drought and water logging tolerant cultivars 3 4 fertiliser use practices in most situations the alkali sodic water irrigation is usually initiated on soils which are already under cultivation sodification affects the availability of nutrients by changing their form in which these are present is soils e g phosphorus and their losses e g aggravation of nitrogen losses through nh3 volatilization and their interactions with modified ionic constituents in soil solution to compensate for n losses the recommended doses of fertiliser n are about 25 more for sodified soils than those for normal soils practices to increase n use efficiency include its splitting as per crop demand deeper placement shift to slow release fertilizer and additions of organic n sources splitting of n in three equal doses at planting basal three and six weeks after planting resulted in highest productivity of both rice and wheat yaduvanshi and swarup 2005 deeper placement of fertilizers in soils has the requirements for relevant machines however a simple method to redistribute the fertilizer in soils is to apply before the pre plant irrigations this practice especially when combined with deep tillage chiseling on alkali water irrigated soil saved upon 30 40 kg n ha 1 minhas and bajwa 2001 organic materials temporarily immobilize the nh4 n subsequently release it slowly with decomposition during crop season therefore combining the inorganic fertiliser n with additions the organic green manures reduced n doses by 50 in rabi winter season and by 25 in kharif crops minhas et al 2004 yaduvanshi and swarup 2005 also concluded that fertilizer use efficiency improved considerably in rice and wheat crops when gypsum was combined with fym or spm sugarcane press mud in a soil irrigated with alkali water rsc 8 5 meq l 1 sar 8 8 therefore for judicious use of fertilizers in sodic water irrigated soils extraneous application of organic amendments seems a helpful strategy 3 5 irrigation scheduling steady state conditions have been traditionally assumed to exist in the long run when irrigating with brackish water and therefore a concept of leaching requirement lr was put forward to control salt balances in the root zone ussl 1954 rhoades et al 1992 since the alterations of cycles of salt sodicity build up with irrigation to winter season crops and their dilution leaching with monsoon rains do not allow for steady state conditions the lr s do not work under the monsoonal climate any effort to attain lr s during winter crops rather results in higher input of salts to mix with or push the carried over rainwater in soils and thereby reducing its availability to crops minhas 1996 similarly various indices like adj sar also predict reduced sodification if higher levels of leaching fraction lf are attained nevertheless as presented earlier the esp build up is the maximum 2 4 x adj rna under rice wheat cropping system with lf of almost 0 6 0 8 where as it is about 1 1 times in maize millet wheat system minhas and sharma 2006 moreover attempts to achieve leaching requirement lf 0 5 with additional amount of saline sodic water ec 3 2 ds m 1 sar 21 rsc 4 meq l 1 rather resulted in 1 3 1 5 fold higher salinity to reduce crop yields in both rice wheat and maize pearl millet wheat sequence bajwa et al 1983 light and frequent irrigations have also been tried to overcome the effects of lower water transmission with build up of sodicity bajwa et al 1993 salinity and esp remained at par with different irrigation frequencies created by variable quantities for each irrigation event 4 6 7 10 cm while the total applied alkali water ec 1 2 and 2 9 ds m 1 sar 12 2 and 29 4 rsc 9 5 was kept the same the fodder maize and wheat grown during monsoon and winter season also did not respond to smaller intervals of irrigation while its effects were monitored in terms of bringing down the supra optimal soil temperature that improved the yields of summer maize similar treatments were also tried for 7 years with alkali water rsc 12 meq l 1 on wheat where application of 6 cm water at each irrigation with sprinklers improved its grain yield by 12 8 and 4 2 over the treatment when irrigation amount was kept as 4 and 5 cm respectively this was in spite of higher ph being observed in the former yadav et al 2013 since the na k increased remarkably in leaves of wheat its toxicity did not allow for attainment of potential yields even with increased quantities of sprinkled alkali water singh et al 2009 3 6 tillage practices the progressive infilling with the dispersed and displaced surface clays increases the possibilities of development of dense subsoil plow sole in sodified soils this induces perched water table and restricts salt displacement to sub soil layers moreover the sodified surface soils are prone to crusting and becoming very hard and dense hard setting soils on drying all these factors impede root proliferation and thus impact crop growth to overcome these constraints deep ploughing chiselling offers a short term measure e g deep chiselling before planting of wheat resulted in about 10 improvement in wheat yield over conventional tillage minhas and bajwa 2001 singh et al 2013 reported that deep tillage during alternate years in combination with gypsum 50 gr could sustain the yields of cluster bean wheat in alkali water rsc 8 5 meq l 1 sar 14 7 the other alternative to improve surface soil drainage is to adapt furrow irrigation and raised bed planting firb system aicrp ssw 1972 2016 its comparison with conventional planting for 3 years showed an overall improvement in yields of pearl millet and wheat by 16 and 22 respectively in addition to few water logging effects during monsoon the advantage of such a system was low irrigation water requirements during rabi season nevertheless during the deficit rainfall years more salt accumulated toward the centre of the beds thus affecting the growth of the central row conservation tillage systems which are now becoming popular with rice wheat have also been tried in alkali water irrigated soils malik et al 2000 the practice of zero tillage in a soil irrigated with alkali water ec 2 8 ds m 1 rsc 8 5 meq l 1 sar 8 8 either with or without application of gypsum or fym before rice decreased soil ph sare sustained higher yields of wheat and saved irrigation water yaduvanshi and sharma 2008 as an alternative a practice popular with the farmers of the alkali water irrigated areas is to spread the wheat seed at the time of last irrigation to rice which is later harvested by combines that leave stubble at the soil surface such a practice not only helps in timely seeding of wheat the straw mulch improves thermal regimes and checks evaporation losses such that the crop matures with only two three post plant irrigations as compared with normal recommendation of four five irrigations singh et al 2010 4 conclusions and future directions ground waters which induce sodicity build up in soils and thereby diminish the benefits of irrigation exist in many parts of arid and semiarid regions sustained irrigations with these waters will possibly off set impacts of future scarcity of water resources and thus help in maintaining food security of especially the developing nations with concerted efforts at various research centers state of the art technologies are now available for controlling the sodification impacts on crop productivity and fragility of environment the recommended practices target the maintenance of soil structure vis à vis infiltration rates through chemical bio remediation means conjunctive use improved irrigation techniques enhanced organic carbon nutrient use efficiencies and other agronomic practices like proper crop selection deep tillage etc the integrated use of these component technologies is recommended for their economic viability under site specific conditions issues that require further attention include the utility of resource conservation technologies simulation models to perceive their long term impacts based upon ion chemistry of irrigation waters for typical agro ecosystems role of deficit irrigation micro irrigation techniques feasibilities for non food but economically viable crops etc some of the selected technologies can now be transferred to stakeholders i e farmers developmental agencies and policy planners for their implementation taking clues from success stories on reclamation of naturally occurring sodic lands cook 2014 similar impetus is desired for sustenance of agricultural productivity on soils irrigated with sodic alkali waters for achieving desired success and economic returns based on specific conditions and resource mobilization future investments should be on comprehensive programs at the river basin or national level by taking into consideration a range of factors such as water availability and quality land use options and strategy and national strategies for climate change management and national water and food security priorities community mobilization and preparatory activities are essential for successful implementation of large scale projects based on sound economic analysis initially some pilot studies should provide insights into subsequent implementation of large scale projects in addition consistent and independent monitoring and evaluation of large scale projects is important to identify and address challenges in a timely and efficient manner in addition to socio economic benefits in terms of food security the environmental benefits from these waters would help mitigate climate change impacts by enhancing soil carbon sequestration this would contribute to the 2030 sustainable development agenda by addressing sdg 13 on combating climate change and sdg 15 on reversing land degradation eradicating extreme poverty and meeting the sdgs without adequately addressing underperforming land and water resources is highly unlikely
