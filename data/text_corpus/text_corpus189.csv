945,carbon c and silicon si are essential lake ecosystem components impacting both phytoplankton growth and other available elements and nutrients in this study we selected a typical floodplain lake system to explore the seasonal role of coupled c and si as matter is imported and exported through lotic water processes results showed considerably higher dissolved inorganic carbon dic dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved total carbon dtc concentrations during the transitional stage between the dry and wet season here referred to as tdw compared to the other seasonal stages 5 81 mg l 28 80 mg l indicating that imported runoff significantly effects the transport of c and si rock weathering was the main source of dissolved silicon dsi the dilution effect and water temperature may also impact dic doc and dtc concentrations except for the wet season bacillariophyta was the dominant phytoplankton taxon and diatom growth as well as the growth of other algae taxon may influence dsi and dtc concentrations through several biochemical processes this study describes effects of coupled c and si and highlights variation in environmental variables driven by the resident phytoplankton communities in a lake ecosystem keywords dissolved silicon carbon cycling phytoplankton molar ratio lake poyang basin 1 introduction silicon si is one of the most abundant elements in the earth s crust second only to oxygen o silicate weathering consumes atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 and produces dissolved silicon dsi and bicarbonates hco3 in soil groundwater and river systems ran liu et al 2018 phytoplankton such as diatoms uses dsi and dissolved co2 to maintain their growth through photosynthesis in lake systems and other water bodies beaulieu goddéris et al 2010 the form and concentration of si is directly related to the primary production of phytoplankton and other aquatic organisms which will have a consequential effect on co2 concentrations and carbon c fixation

plant and diatom decay rashid mir et al 2019 both the deposition of diatoms and the production of phytoliths impact c sequestration lazarus barron et al 2014 therefore si is a key constituent of the c cycle strandmann hendry et al 2019 siliceous phytoplankton like diatoms releases biogenic silicon bsi through biochemical processes lü he et al 2015 such as the decomposition and deposition of dead phytoplankton detritus within water bodies maavara dürr et al 2014 ran liu et al 2016 deng tao et al 2020 while the cell walls of siliceous phytoplankton are preserved in lake sediment lü he et al 2015 in lake ecosystems terrestrial plants can also absorb atmospheric co2 through photosynthesis subsequently releasing si into the environment furthermore atmospheric wet deposition has been shown to be a significant source of si as well as other major biogenic elements that are imported into aquatic ecosystems prompting c fixation by supporting plant and phytoplankton growth parker 1981 zou chen et al 2000 xing song et al 2017 fig 1 provides a general explanation on the associative role between c and si cycling and phytoplankton in lake watershed ecosystems furthermore si is an essential biogenic element for diatom subsistence suitable si concentrations do not only promote the formation of phytoliths in aquatic organisms but also increase diatom growth and reproduction in aquatic ecosystems diatoms are a key producer they are widely distributed throughout marine ecosystems and lake watershed systems and they play a vital role in the global c cycle litchman klausmeier et al 2009 at a global scale diatoms contribute 15 to net primary production and 40 to c exports jin gruber et al 2006 various studies have accordingly focused on issues related to the coupling of si and c cycling in aquatic systems wang liu et al 2016 wang xiao et al 2019 krissansen totton and catling 2020 how planktonic biomass community and primary production respond to si concentrations in aquatic systems yang zhang et al 2002 gobler buck et al 2006 quiroz vazquez white et al 2008 how diatoms impact c sequestration krause schulz et al 2019 sethi butler et al 2020 as well as other related factors for this study we hypothesized that hydrological drought and external nutrient loading in a water conveyance type lake system may potentially influence si and c cycling and result in changes to planktonic biomass and communities accordingly the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to determine dsi dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved total carbon dtc concentrations and spatial distributions during four seasonal stages the dry season the transitional period between the dry and wet season tdw the wet season and the transitional period between the wet and dry season twd 2 to describe changes in planktonic biomass and community structure during these different seasonal stages 3 to explain the potential influence of phytoplankton on coupled si and c cycling during these seasonal stages 2 methods 2 1 study area lake poyang 115 47 116 45 e 28 22 29 45 n is the largest freshwater lake in china located in the northern region of jiangxi province fig 2 the watershed area of poyang lake is 162 200 km2 accounting for approx 97 of the basin area of jiangxi province the annual average temperature is 16 3 c with the highest temperatures in july and august 33 c average and the lowest temperatures from december to february lake poyang is also the largest throughput and seasonal freshwater lake system in china both afflux into lake poyang from its five tributaries and the water level of the yangtze river affect lake water levels the five tributaries include afflux from the gan river the fu river the xin river the rao river and the xiu river into lake poyang which then drains into the yangtze river at the hukou station the lake s size fluctuated dramatically with the total area during the wet seasons being four times that of the dry seasons fig s1 lake poyang usually begins to increase from may and then shrink in september sun ma et al 2021 the area of lake poyang expands to around 3000 km2 during the tdw stage and wet season and decreases to lower than 1000 km2 during the twd stage and dry season zhao and liu 2017 the maximum depth of the lake is 30 m however 85 of the lake has a depth of less than 6 m li zhang et al 2014 the mean water level was around 13 51 m during the wet season then decreased to 9 06 m during the dry season sun ma et al 2021 based on the runoff and dynamic lake volume data we tried to calculate the flushing rates ρ monthly discharge lake volume the reciprocal of water retention time of the lake which also changes with inflow outflow and reflect on the loss rate of resident phytoplankton li yu et al 2015 tang lei et al 2021 the flushing rates of lake poyang in four stages dry season tdw wet season twd were 1 58 month 1 2 30 month 1 1 09 month 1 and 1 66 month 1 respectively the expansion and reduction resulting from this extensive shifting pattern i e between river and lake systems cause regional variation leading to variability of phytoplankton community structure among different regions of the lake additionally recent studies have also reported that agricultural activities and fisheries have led to a deterioration in water quality in this region pu ni et al 2020 therefore investigating the coupling effect of si and c and the community structure and distribution of algae in poyang lake is crucial for maintaining the biogeochemical cycling of the lake ecosystem 2 2 sampling sites and applied method selection of samples points based on the land use type spatial distribution hydrological conditions and sampling convenience fifteen points were established in lake poyang unfortunately because of the drastically changing water levels during different periods samples at some points could not be collected due to the low water level among them the sampling site are divided into three parts the nanjishan wetland and estuaries nw p1 p5 p15 the retention basin rb p12 p14 and the water channel wc p6 p11 a total of 102 water samples were collected at a 0 40 cm surface water depth during in different hydrological seasons throughout 2018 2020 water samples 100 ml were preserved in polyethylene plastic bottles and refrigerated at 4 c every water sample was filtered through a 0 45 µm pore size organic microporous membrane filter the filters were pretreated in ultrapure water at 80 c for 8 h before eventually being transferred to the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research for analysis gao hao et al 2016 a total of 102 phytoplankton samples were collected at a 0 50 cm surface water depth from 2018 to 2020 and conserved in 1 l dark polyethylene bottles with 15 ml lugol s solution after 48 h phytoplankton samples were siphoned from the supernatant retaining 60 ml of the samples at the bottom of the bottles following this 1 ml of a formaldehyde solution was added and samples were then stored for laboratory analysis for this study the sum of runoff from all five tributaries was considered as runoff from poyang lake while the runoff from hukou station was also considered as runoff from poyang lake time series data were from 1950 to 2012 runoff data prior to 2000 was provided by the jiangxi provincial hydrological bureau after 2000 runoff data were collected from the yangtze river sediment bulletin yu peng et al 2020 2 3 sample analysis this study used the ultrameter 6p instrument myron l company the united

26 to examine the significant differences among different periods arcmap version 10 8 was used to compare dic doc and dsi spatial distribution python version 3 7 was used for the heatmap of pearson correlation coefficients between phytoplankton and other environmental variables finally origin 2019b version 9 65 was used to generate graphics 3 results 3 1 statistical analyses of carbon silicon nutrients and other environmental parameters as table 1 shows dic and doc concentration averages were lowest during the wet season moreover doc concentrations were lowest during the twd stage while dsi concentrations were comparatively lower during the wet season and the twd stage fig 3 ranges of the three c concentration forms were significantly higher during the tdw stage p 0 05 especially dtc concentrations which varied from 5 81 mg l 28 8 mg l while dic and doc concentrations varied from 4 00 mg l 15 0 mg l and 1 72 mg l 17 33 mg l respectively in addition significant differences of dsi were observed among dry tdw and wet season p 0 05 mean dtn concentrations during these four seasonal stages were 4 97 mg l dry season 2 14 mg l tdw 4 75 mg l wet season and 14 9 mg l twd dtn concentrations were lowest during the tdw stage whose different concentration patterns were obvious compared to dsi and dtc moreover dtn concentrations varied from 1 55 mg l to 47 7 mg l during the twd stage no significant difference in dtn concentrations was observed during either the dry season tdw stage or wet season similarly while dtp concentrations exhibited a distinct decreasing trend 0 135 mg l during the tdw stage such changes were indistinct during the other three seasonal stages these results potentially indicate that different water levels can influence biogenic element and nutrient concentrations except for ph other environmental indices showed significant variation during all four seasonal stages table 1 although changing slightly among the stages the ph level remained at about 7 46 the mean water temperature was highest during the wet season 28 7 c and lowest during the dry season 15 5 c the mean tds concentration was highest during the twd stage ranging from 64 5 mg l 367 mg l during the tdw stage the mean value of sd reached its highest level and significantly differed from other stages p 0 05 in 2018 lake poyang water levels may have potentially influenced c and si concentrations fig 3 mean water levels varied from 8 53 m 16 1 m throughout the year the mean water level was 9 48 m during the dry season and increased to 12 5 m during the tdw stage before reaching 15 8 m during the wet season and finally decreasing to 11 8 m during the twd stage table 3 indicates the hydrochemical properties during four stages except for tdw stage the order of cations concentration is ca2 na k mg2 and the order of anions concentration is so4 2 cl in other three stages all major ions reached their maximum concentration during the dry period ca2 is the most abundant cation reached its highest level in the dry season with a range of 8 78 mg l 32 9 mg l and has a significant difference with wet season p 0 05 the mean k concentration is highest during the dry season 4 06 mg l with a range of 1 33 mg l 15 9 mg l and significantly different from both tdw stage and wet season the mean so4 2 concentration ranged from 9 00 mg l 19 1 mg l during four stages in addition cl concentration has the same trend as so4 2 during all four stages 3 2 spatial dic doc dtc and dsi distributions for all four seasonal stages the highest dsi concentrations were typically observed at sampling sites located in the northwestern region of lake poyang while the lowest concentrations were observed in the western region of the lake fig 4 the low value was also observed during the wet season in the northwestern region furthermore dsi concentrations significantly differed in the eastern region of the lake during the tdw and twd stages being mainly affected by the rao river and the xin river additionally seasonal dsi concentration trends were reversed where the lowest dsi concentration was observed during the wet season and the highest was observed during the dry season high dsi concentrations were observed in wetland areas in the eastern region of the lake during the tdw stage while the highest dtc concentration was 23 4 mg l these sampling locations p1 p5 and p15 were also close to the lake outlet channel and its estuaries while lower concentrations were primarily observed in the area of the retention basin dissolved c concentrations decreased during the wet season and the highest dtc concentration was only 13 3 mg l which compared to the tdw stage was generally the lowest overall moreover c distribution patterns were similar during the twd stage and the dry season in general c concentrations accorded to the trend in dsi concentrations which indicated the potential influence of riverine inputs and seasonal changes 3 3 phytoplankton community variation phytoplankton communities varied during all four seasonal stages bacillariophyta was the dominant taxonomic division during the tdw stage the twd stage and the dry season while cryptophyta and cyanophyta became the dominant phyla at some sampling sites during the wet season fig 5 a as table 2 shows the mean biomass of bacillariophyta was highest during the twd stage 9 02 mg l while it was lowest during the wet season 1 72 mg l except for dry season bacillariophyta biomass differed significantly among tdw stage wet season and twd stage p 0 05 the mean value of cryptophyta biomass was 1 12 mg l during the tdw stage while it decreased to 0 44 mg l during the dry season notably cyanophyta biomass increased to 0 79 mg l moreover bacillariophyta was dominant in almost half of the sampling sites during the dry season accounting for 78 3 of the total biomass furthermore the total biomass of the sampling sites in the eastern region of the lake was significantly higher compared to that in the other regions of the lake fig 5 according to table s1 the mean biomass of bacillariophyta was highest in nw 7 70 mg l and lowest in rb 1 94 mg l there was a significant difference between bacillariophyta biomass in nw and rb p 0 05 the biomass of cryptophyta was significantly higher in rb 1 37 mg l than other locations in nw the total algal biomass was significantly higher than other two regions p 0 05 the above results indicate that there are significant differences in phytoplankton biomass in different areas of the lake which may be related to the varied hydrological conditions and water chemistry characteristics in different areas it is noteworthy that the total biomass of sampling sites near estuaries during the dry season was significantly higher than that of sites in the western region of the lake compared to the other seasonal stages ranging from 0 0887 mg l 27 5 mg l comparatively total biomass was uniformly distributed during the wet season varying from 3 45 mg l 7 59 mg l furthermore euglenophyta was dominant at the p3 and p12 sampling sites accounting for 49 3 and 41 4 respectively however cryptophyta was dominant at the p1 and p14 sampling sites accounting for 40 3 and 35 9 respectively the highest total phytoplankton biomass was 31 7 mg l during the twd stage after which it decreased to 0 09 mg l during the dry season 4 discussion 4 1 dsi dic doc and dtc variation during all four seasonal stages terrestrial and inland aquatic ecosystems can influence si transport and transformation processes ittekkot 2000 dürr meybeck et al 2011 dsi concentrations at the lake outlet channel were significantly higher compared to all other lake regions during all four seasonal stages this could be partly due to the physical migration of dsi afflux where it ultimately accumulated at the lake outlet moreover the water velocity of the outlet channel is faster than at other regions of lake poyang li liu et al 2019 which could potentially have led to accumulated si carried by suspended particulate matter fig 6 shows the mean imported and exported runoff of lake poyang from 1950 to 2012 this figure appears to show that a greater amount of runoff occurred during the tdw stage demonstrating the impact of riverine inputs on si and c within a lacustrine environment previous studies have shown that the varied streamflow changes contributed around 34 to the decline in the water level huang chunyu et al 2020 furthermore the proportion of ground water discharge was estimated to be 41 with a range of 29 50 liao wang et al 2020 according to a water balance analysis river outflows from the upstream gauged catchment and downstream catchment account for 79 0 and 12 2 of annual inflows respectively and direct precipitation contributes about 3 0 on the lake surface suggesting that the changing hydrological conditions affect the environmental parameters in the lake li zhang et al 2020 liao wang et al 2020 high dsi concentrations were observed in the western region of the lake namely the region close to xin river and rao river outlets and this is likely indicative of the potential influence of riverine si inputs into the lake moreover si concentrations were higher in the northern region compared to the southern region of the lake while bedrock weathering is considered the main si source in the lake poyang basin liao wang et al 2018 aeolian deposits including aeolian sands and loess deposits are abundant in the poyang lake region the loess deposits silt and clay particles underwent moderate chemical weathering resulting in the sediments have high sio2 mgo na2o cao and p2o5 content jia lai et al 2012 zhi yulian et al 2014 notably dsi concentration showed a highly significant positive correlation with ca2 r 0 33 p 0 01 dic showed a significant positive correlation with k ca2 and na p 0 05 and dtc showed a significant p 0 01 positive correlation with ca2 which further illustrates the effect of weathering on the coupling cycle of carbon and silicon in the lake soil and rock carbonate and silicate weathering are the dominant sources of dissolved ions in lake poyang basin especially the silicate weathering contributes to 26 to the main dic sources lu gao et al 2021 the hydrochemistry properties of gan river is almost the same as that of poyang lake which shows the direct influence of upstream riverine input to poyang lake rao zheng et al 2019 additionally si incorporated into organisms as bsi fresh water phytoplankton and terrestrial vegetation are the crucial sources in si cycle berges driskill et al 2021 in the bedrock area of the lake poyang basin silicon dioxide sio2 in groundwater is mainly released through the leaching and weathering of silicate rocks such as granite sandstone and their conglomerates therefore the si in water bodies is significantly correlated to the si concentration in rocks under reducing atmospheric conditions co2 can increase the solubility of aluminosilicate minerals in aqueous environments which will increase dissolved sio2 na2al2si6o16 co2 h2o h2al2si2o8 naco3 4sio2 the dsi contained in weathering products can be transported into soil solutions after which it can be partly absorbed by plants and deposited in plant cells or intercellular spaces and ultimately form phytoliths other dsi is preserved as secondary silicate mineral while the remaining will migrate into river systems with runoff zhang tao et al 2015 wen lu et al 2018 during the tdw stage doc dic and dtc concentrations were obviously higher compared to the other seasonal stages this finding confirmed the contribution of river and rainfall inputs during the tdw stage during the wet season however doc dic and dtc even tds concentrations significantly decreased table 1 even lower than that of the dry season likely reasons for this phenomena are as follows 1 the dilution effect of the lake 2 water temperatures were higher compared to the other seasonal stages prompting dic to transform into co2 that subsequently escaped from water li lu et al 2012 li gao et al 2020 the p1 p5 and p15 sampling sites were all concentrated within the nanjishan wetland area where the mean doc concentration was 5 46 mg l which was higher than that of lake poyang 4 82 mg l this result is in agreement with a previous study wang jiao et al 2016 where wetland vegetation and sediment were found to have a certain impact on doc in the lake poyang basin in lake poyang basin floodwaters changed the habitat and hydrochemistry of wetland ecosystems and the ensuing changes in diatom assemblages appear to be linked to water level fluctuations and seasonal variations qian liu et al 2017 wetlands are considered a key doc source in downstream surface water abril martinez et al 2014 dic is the principal form of dtc in the study area the main dic sources in the lake poyang basin include atmospheric deposition carbonate weathering and silicate weathering lu gao et al 2021 as inferred by fig 7 water temperature was significantly and negative correlated to dic and doc p 0 01 and water temperatures were highest during the wet season throughout the study area higher water temperatures may stimulate microbial degradation and photosynthetic activity which will lead to dic and doc consumption during the wet season moreover ph negatively correlated to dic doc and dtc p 0 01 this may due to the relative co2 bicarbonate and carbonate concentrations in water being the main influencing factors of hydrogen h ion concentrations and the solubility of co2 in water decreases with an increase in water temperature di sun et al 2021 4 2 phytoplankton community and interactive changes with environmental parameters except for the wet season diatoms bacillariophyta were the dominant taxon bacillariophyta density positively correlated to ph p 0 01 and negatively correlated to dsi p 0 05 generally lower ph under an increase in co2 will stimulate diatom growth gao and campbell 2014 moreover the mutual effect of phytoplankton and dsi differs in different aqueous environments under conditions of low dsi concentrations any increase in bacillariophyta biomass or growth rate will be inhibited decreasing overall biomass rantajrvi gran et al 1997 nevertheless diatom blooms can deplete dsi concentrations fehling davidson et al 2012 we observed a negative correlation between dsi and c in the study area fig 7 which was partly due to bacillariophyta blooms during the tdw stage fig 5a and diatoms absorb dsi for growth cryptophyta positively correlated to dic and doc p 0 01 therefore the extensive increase in phytoplankton increased photosynthesis and aspiration resulting in dic and doc concentration variation on the other hand the dsi depletion caused a decrease in bacillariophyta resulting in changes to the phytoplankton community during the wet season additionally according to the flushing rate results the low phytoplankton biomass during tdw stage may be due to the high flushing rate increase the loss of phytoplankton gao et al 2022 the main phytoplankton species in the middle and lower gan river included bacillariophyta and cyanophyta with total algal biomass ranging from 0 430 mg l to 1 26 mg l with average phytoplankton biomass of 0 690 mg l which was obviously lower than that in the lake yang liu et al 2020 cryptophyta was strongly and negatively correlated to dsi which is indicative of the same utilization pattern observed with bacillariophyta the doc dsi ratio can reflect the structure of the phytoplankton community during different periods results showed that the mean doc dsi ratio increased from the dry season onwards and peaked 5 30 during the tdw stage before dramatically decreasing 0 714 during the twd stage the doc dsi ratio was significantly higher in the wetland area of the lake during the tdw stage this was driven by phytoplankton activity and other such microbial activity in water and sediment during this stage and an increase in degradation may have contributed to an increase in doc concentrations and properties gao et al 2020 wang et al 2022 within dynamic lacustrine environments sunlight is also a limiting factor of phytoplankton due to seasonality meteorological conditions and phytoplankton bloom shading factors prelle graiff et al 2019 in this study sunlight and its level of intensity during the dry season the tdw stage and the twd stage was likely suitable for bacillariophyta growth an increase in sunshine duration during the tdw stage led to diatom blooms in the study area at the same time this increase also stimulated an increase in other phytoplankton taxa and changed the phytoplankton community structure at the beginning of the wet season the availability of biogenic and other nutrient elements may influence phytoplankton and other microbial growth processes prelle graiff et al 2019 elemental concentrations and ratios significantly impact the structure of phytoplankton abundance and diversity justić rabalais et al 1995 in this study dtn positively correlated to bacillariophyta and chlorophyta density fig 7 changes in seasonal discharge may cause changes in elemental ratios subsequently affecting variations in phytoplankton diversity and production fisher gustafson et al 1999 lee fisher et al 2000 anderson glibert et al 2002 generally the atomic ratio of si n p is 16 16 1 li shen et al 2017 and biological growth and reproduction will be inhibited if one of these elements is removed phytoplankton growth is inhibited by p when si p 22 and n p 22 it is inhibited by n when n p 10 and si n 1 and it is inhibited by si when si p 10 and si n 1 justić rabalais et al 1995 table 4 shows the mean molar ratio of si n and p during all four seasonal stages results indicated the limiting potential of p during the tdw stage and a slight limiting potential of n or si during the dry season and the twd stage in aquatic systems p is often a limiting factor jiang zhang et al 2020 the gan river and other tributaries located in the southern region of the lake are important sources of elemental inputs jia gao et al 2019 5 conclusions shifts in meteorological and hydrological conditions have caused changes to occur in si and c concentrations and subsequently in phytoplankton communities in ecosystems throughout the lake poyang basin during the transitional period between the dry and wet season tdw mean c concentrations were highest while corresponding c concentrations were lowest during the wet season diatoms were dominant throughout the tdw stage the dry season and the transitional period between the wet and dry season twd moreover phytoplankton biomass was highest during the tdw stage however phytoplankton community structure changed significantly during the wet season which may be related to variations in environmental parameters in the lake ecosystem the depletion of dsi in the lake area can be attributed to diatom blooms various biochemical processes during phytoplankton growth will also significantly affect si and c concentrations in lacustrine environments therefore it is critical to better understand the influence that si has on c as it relates to phytoplankton growth characteristics to further clarify the si and c mechanisms that phytoplankton assimilate in lake basin systems which is important for our understanding of the connection between si and c sequestration in the presence of phytoplankton in lake poyang declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors of this study

province fig 2 the watershed area of poyang lake is 162 200 km2 accounting for approx 97 of the basin area of jiangxi province the annual average temperature is 16 3 c with the highest temperatures in july and august 33 c average and the lowest temperatures from december to february lake poyang is also the largest throughput and seasonal freshwater lake system in china both afflux into lake poyang from its five tributaries and the water level of the yangtze river affect lake water levels the five tributaries include afflux from the gan river the fu river the xin river the rao river and the xiu river into lake poyang which then drains into the yangtze river at the hukou station the lake s size fluctuated dramatically with the total area during the wet seasons being four times that of the dry seasons fig s1 lake poyang usually begins to increase from may and then shrink in september sun ma et al 2021 the area of lake poyang expands to around 3000 km2 during the tdw stage and wet season and decreases to lower than 1000 km2 during the twd stage and dry season zhao and liu 2017 the maximum depth of the lake is 30 m however 85 of the lake has a depth of less than 6 m li zhang et al 2014 the mean water level was around 13 51 m during the wet season then decreased to 9 06 m during the dry season sun ma et al 2021 based on the runoff and dynamic lake volume data we tried to calculate the flushing rates ρ monthly discharge lake volume the reciprocal of water retention time of the lake which also changes with inflow outflow and reflect on the loss rate of resident phytoplankton li yu et al 2015 tang lei et al 2021 the flushing rates of lake poyang in four stages dry season tdw wet season twd were 1 58 month 1 2 30 month 1 1 09 month 1 and 1 66 month 1 respectively the expansion and reduction resulting from this extensive shifting pattern i e between river and lake systems cause regional variation leading to variability of phytoplankton community structure among different regions of the lake additionally recent studies have also reported that agricultural activities and fisheries have led to a deterioration in water quality in this region pu ni et al 2020 therefore investigating the coupling effect of si and c and the community structure and distribution of algae in poyang lake is crucial for maintaining the biogeochemical cycling of the lake ecosystem 2 2 sampling sites and applied method selection of samples points based on the land use type spatial distribution hydrological conditions and sampling convenience fifteen points were established in lake poyang unfortunately because of the drastically changing water levels during different periods samples at some points could not be collected due to the low water level among them the sampling site are divided into three parts the nanjishan wetland and estuaries nw p1 p5 p15 the retention basin rb p12 p14 and the water channel wc p6 p11 a total of 102 water samples were collected at a 0 40 cm surface water depth during in different hydrological seasons throughout 2018 2020 water samples 100 ml were preserved in polyethylene plastic bottles and refrigerated at 4 c every water sample was filtered through a 0 45 µm pore size organic microporous membrane filter the filters were pretreated in ultrapure water at 80 c for 8 h before eventually being transferred to the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research for analysis gao hao et al 2016 a total of 102 phytoplankton samples were collected at a 0 50 cm surface water depth from 2018 to 2020 and conserved in 1 l dark polyethylene bottles with 15 ml lugol s solution after 48 h phytoplankton samples were siphoned from the supernatant retaining 60 ml of the samples at the bottom of the bottles following this 1 ml of a formaldehyde solution was added and samples were then stored for laboratory analysis for this study the sum of runoff from all five tributaries was considered as runoff from poyang lake while the runoff from hukou station was also considered as runoff from poyang lake time series data were from 1950 to 2012 runoff data prior to 2000 was provided by the jiangxi provincial hydrological bureau after 2000 runoff data were collected from the yangtze river sediment bulletin yu peng et al 2020 2 3 sample analysis this study used the ultrameter 6p instrument myron l company the united states of america to analyze water temperature tem total dissolved solids tds and ph a secchi disk was used to measure secchi depth sd in situ the vario el cube elementar germany was used to measure

correlation coefficients between phytoplankton and other environmental variables finally origin 2019b version 9 65 was used to generate graphics 3 results 3 1 statistical analyses of carbon silicon nutrients and other environmental parameters as table 1 shows dic and doc concentration averages were lowest during the wet season moreover doc concentrations were lowest during the twd stage while dsi concentrations were comparatively lower during the wet season and the twd stage fig 3 ranges of the three c concentration forms were significantly higher during the tdw stage p 0 05 especially dtc concentrations which varied from 5 81 mg l 28 8 mg l while dic and doc concentrations varied from 4 00 mg l 15 0 mg l and 1 72 mg l 17 33 mg l respectively in addition significant differences of dsi were observed among dry tdw and wet season p 0 05 mean dtn concentrations during these four seasonal stages were 4 97 mg l dry season 2 14 mg l tdw 4 75 mg l wet season and 14 9 mg l twd dtn concentrations were lowest during the tdw stage whose different concentration patterns were obvious compared to dsi and dtc moreover dtn concentrations varied from 1 55 mg l to 47 7 mg l during the twd stage no significant difference in dtn concentrations was observed during either the dry season tdw stage or wet season similarly while dtp concentrations exhibited a distinct decreasing trend 0 135 mg l during the tdw stage such changes were indistinct during the other three seasonal stages these results potentially indicate that different water levels can influence biogenic element and nutrient concentrations except for ph other environmental indices showed significant variation during all four seasonal stages table 1 although changing slightly among the stages the ph level remained at about 7 46 the mean water temperature was highest during the wet season 28 7 c and lowest during the dry season 15 5 c the mean tds concentration was highest during the twd stage ranging from 64 5 mg l 367 mg l during the tdw stage the mean value of sd reached its highest level and significantly differed from other stages p 0 05 in 2018 lake poyang water levels may have potentially influenced c and si concentrations fig 3 mean water levels varied from 8 53 m 16 1 m throughout the year the mean water level was 9 48 m during the dry season and increased to 12 5 m during the tdw stage before reaching 15 8 m during the wet season and finally decreasing to 11 8 m during the twd stage table 3 indicates the hydrochemical properties during four stages except for tdw stage the order of cations concentration is ca2 na k mg2 and the order of anions concentration is so4 2 cl in other three stages all major ions reached their maximum concentration during the dry period ca2 is the most abundant cation reached its highest level in the dry season with a range of 8 78 mg l 32 9 mg l and has a significant difference with wet season p 0 05 the mean k concentration is highest during the dry season 4 06 mg l with a range of 1 33 mg l 15 9 mg l and significantly different from both tdw stage and wet season the mean so4 2 concentration ranged from 9 00 mg l 19 1 mg l during four stages in addition cl concentration has the same trend as so4 2 during all four stages 3 2 spatial dic doc dtc and dsi distributions for all four seasonal stages the highest dsi concentrations were typically observed at sampling sites located in the northwestern region of lake poyang while the lowest concentrations were observed in the western region of the lake fig 4 the low value was also observed during the wet season in the northwestern region furthermore dsi concentrations significantly differed in the eastern region of the lake during the tdw and twd stages being mainly affected by the rao river and the xin river additionally seasonal dsi concentration trends were reversed where the lowest dsi concentration was observed during the wet season and the highest was observed during the dry season high dsi concentrations were observed in wetland areas in the eastern region of the lake during the tdw stage while the highest dtc concentration was 23 4 mg l these sampling locations p1 p5 and p15 were also close to the lake outlet channel and its estuaries while lower concentrations were primarily observed in the area of the retention basin dissolved c concentrations decreased during the wet season and the highest dtc concentration was only 13 3 mg l which compared to the tdw stage was generally the lowest overall moreover c distribution patterns were similar during the twd stage and the dry season in general c concentrations accorded to the trend in dsi concentrations which indicated the potential influence of riverine inputs and seasonal changes 3 3 phytoplankton community variation phytoplankton communities varied during all four seasonal stages bacillariophyta was the dominant taxonomic division during the tdw stage the twd stage and the dry season while cryptophyta and cyanophyta became the dominant phyla at some sampling sites during the wet season fig 5 a as table 2 shows the mean biomass of bacillariophyta was highest during the twd stage 9 02 mg l while it was lowest during the wet season 1 72 mg l except for dry season bacillariophyta biomass differed significantly among tdw stage wet season and twd stage p 0 05 the mean value of cryptophyta biomass was 1 12 mg l during the tdw stage while it decreased to 0 44 mg l during the dry season notably cyanophyta biomass increased to 0 79 mg l moreover bacillariophyta was dominant in almost half of the sampling sites during the dry season accounting for 78 3 of the total biomass furthermore the total biomass of the sampling sites in the eastern region of the lake was significantly higher compared to that in the other regions of the lake fig 5 according to table s1 the mean biomass of bacillariophyta was highest in nw 7 70 mg l and lowest in rb 1 94 mg l there was a significant difference between bacillariophyta biomass in nw and rb p 0 05 the biomass of cryptophyta was significantly higher in rb 1 37 mg l than other locations in nw the total algal biomass was significantly higher than other two regions p 0 05 the above results indicate that there are significant differences in phytoplankton biomass in different areas of the lake which may be related to the varied hydrological conditions and water chemistry characteristics in different areas it is noteworthy that the total biomass of sampling sites near estuaries during the dry season was significantly higher than that of sites in the western region of the lake compared to the other seasonal stages ranging from 0 0887 mg l 27 5 mg l comparatively total biomass was uniformly distributed during the wet season varying from 3 45 mg l 7 59 mg l furthermore euglenophyta was dominant at the p3 and p12 sampling sites accounting for 49 3 and 41 4 respectively however cryptophyta was dominant at the p1 and p14 sampling sites accounting for 40 3 and 35 9 respectively the highest total phytoplankton biomass was 31 7 mg l during the twd stage after which it decreased to 0 09 mg l during the dry season 4 discussion 4 1 dsi dic doc and dtc variation during all four seasonal stages terrestrial and inland aquatic ecosystems can influence si transport and transformation processes ittekkot 2000 dürr meybeck et al 2011 dsi concentrations at the lake outlet channel were significantly higher compared to all other lake regions during all four seasonal stages this could be partly due to the physical migration of dsi afflux where it ultimately accumulated at the lake outlet moreover the water velocity of the outlet channel is faster than at other regions of lake poyang li liu et al 2019 which could potentially have led to accumulated si carried by suspended particulate matter fig 6 shows the mean imported and exported runoff of lake poyang from 1950 to 2012 this figure appears to show that a greater amount of runoff occurred during the tdw stage demonstrating the impact of riverine inputs on si and c within a lacustrine environment previous studies have shown that the varied streamflow changes contributed around 34 to the decline in the water level huang chunyu et al 2020 furthermore the proportion of ground water discharge was estimated to be 41 with a range of 29 50 liao wang et al 2020 according to a water balance analysis river outflows from the upstream gauged catchment and downstream catchment account for 79 0 and 12 2 of annual inflows respectively and direct precipitation contributes about 3 0 on the lake surface suggesting that the changing hydrological conditions affect the environmental parameters in the lake li zhang et al 2020 liao wang et al 2020 high dsi concentrations were observed in the western region of the lake namely the region close to xin river and rao river outlets and this is likely indicative of the potential influence of riverine si inputs into the lake moreover si concentrations were higher in the northern region compared to the southern region of the lake while bedrock weathering is considered the main si source in the lake poyang basin liao wang et al 2018 aeolian deposits including aeolian sands and loess deposits are abundant in the poyang lake region the loess deposits silt and clay particles underwent moderate chemical weathering resulting in the sediments have high sio2 mgo na2o cao and p2o5 content jia lai et al 2012 zhi yulian et al 2014 notably dsi concentration showed a highly significant positive correlation with ca2 r 0 33 p 0 01 dic showed a significant positive correlation with k ca2 and na p 0 05 and dtc showed a significant p 0 01 positive correlation with ca2 which further illustrates the effect of weathering on the coupling cycle of carbon and silicon in the lake soil and rock carbonate and silicate weathering are the dominant sources of dissolved ions in lake poyang basin especially the silicate weathering contributes to 26 to the main dic sources lu gao et al 2021 the hydrochemistry properties of gan river is almost the same as that of poyang lake which shows the direct influence of upstream riverine input to poyang lake rao zheng et al 2019 additionally si incorporated into organisms as bsi fresh water phytoplankton and terrestrial vegetation are the crucial sources in si cycle berges driskill et al 2021 in the bedrock area of the lake poyang basin silicon dioxide sio2 in groundwater is mainly released through the leaching and weathering of silicate rocks such as granite sandstone and their conglomerates therefore the si in water bodies is significantly correlated to the si concentration in rocks under reducing atmospheric conditions co2 can increase the solubility of aluminosilicate minerals in aqueous environments which will increase dissolved sio2 na2al2si6o16 co2 h2o h2al2si2o8 naco3 4sio2 the dsi contained in weathering products can be transported into soil solutions after which it can be partly absorbed by plants and deposited in plant cells or intercellular spaces and ultimately form phytoliths other dsi is preserved as secondary silicate mineral while the remaining will migrate into river systems with runoff zhang tao et al 2015 wen lu et al 2018 during the tdw stage doc dic and dtc concentrations were obviously higher compared to the other seasonal stages this finding confirmed the contribution of river and rainfall inputs during the tdw stage during the wet season however doc dic and dtc even tds concentrations significantly decreased table 1 even lower than that of the dry season likely reasons for this phenomena are as follows 1 the dilution effect of the lake 2 water temperatures were higher compared to the other seasonal stages prompting dic to transform into co2 that subsequently escaped from water li lu et al 2012 li gao et al 2020 the p1 p5 and p15 sampling sites were all concentrated within the nanjishan wetland area where the mean doc concentration was 5 46 mg l which was higher than that of lake poyang 4 82 mg l this result is in agreement with a previous study wang jiao et al 2016 where wetland vegetation and sediment were found to have a certain impact on doc in the lake poyang basin in lake poyang basin floodwaters changed the habitat and hydrochemistry of wetland ecosystems and the ensuing changes in diatom assemblages appear to be linked to water level fluctuations and seasonal variations qian liu et al 2017 wetlands are considered a key doc source in downstream surface water abril martinez et al 2014 dic is the principal form of dtc in the study area the main dic sources in the lake poyang basin include atmospheric deposition carbonate weathering and silicate weathering lu gao et al 2021 as inferred by fig 7 water temperature was significantly and negative correlated to dic and doc p 0 01 and water temperatures were highest during the wet season throughout the study area higher water temperatures may stimulate microbial degradation and photosynthetic activity which will lead to dic and doc consumption during the wet season moreover ph negatively correlated to dic doc and dtc p 0 01 this may due to the relative co2 bicarbonate and carbonate concentrations in water being the main influencing factors of hydrogen h ion concentrations and the solubility of co2 in water decreases with an increase in water temperature di sun et al 2021 4 2 phytoplankton community and interactive changes with environmental parameters except for the wet season diatoms bacillariophyta were the dominant taxon bacillariophyta density positively correlated to ph p 0 01 and negatively correlated to dsi p 0 05 generally lower ph under an increase in co2 will stimulate diatom growth gao and campbell 2014 moreover the mutual effect of phytoplankton and dsi differs in different aqueous environments under conditions of low dsi concentrations any increase in bacillariophyta biomass or growth rate will be inhibited decreasing overall biomass rantajrvi gran et al 1997 nevertheless diatom blooms can deplete dsi concentrations fehling davidson et al 2012 we observed a negative correlation between dsi and c in the study area fig 7 which was partly due to bacillariophyta blooms during the tdw stage fig 5a and diatoms absorb dsi for growth cryptophyta positively correlated to dic and doc p 0 01 therefore the extensive increase in phytoplankton increased photosynthesis and aspiration resulting in dic and doc concentration variation on the other hand the dsi depletion caused a decrease in bacillariophyta resulting in changes to the phytoplankton community during the wet season additionally according to the flushing rate results the low phytoplankton biomass during tdw stage may be due to the high flushing rate increase the loss of phytoplankton gao et al 2022 the main phytoplankton species in the middle and lower gan river included bacillariophyta and cyanophyta with total algal biomass ranging from 0 430 mg l to 1 26 mg l with average phytoplankton biomass of 0 690 mg l which was obviously lower than that in the lake yang liu et al 2020 cryptophyta was strongly and negatively correlated to dsi which is indicative of the same utilization pattern observed with bacillariophyta the doc dsi ratio can reflect the structure of the phytoplankton community during different periods results showed that the mean doc dsi ratio increased from the dry season onwards and peaked 5 30 during the tdw stage before dramatically decreasing 0 714 during the twd stage the doc dsi ratio was significantly higher in the wetland area of the lake during the tdw stage this was driven by phytoplankton activity and other such microbial activity in water and sediment during this stage and an increase in degradation may have contributed to an increase in doc concentrations and properties gao et al 2020 wang et al 2022 within dynamic lacustrine environments sunlight is also a limiting factor of phytoplankton due to seasonality meteorological conditions and phytoplankton bloom shading factors prelle graiff et al 2019 in this study sunlight and its level of intensity during the dry season the tdw stage and the twd stage was likely suitable for bacillariophyta growth an increase in sunshine duration during the tdw stage led to diatom blooms in the study area at the same time this increase also stimulated an increase in other phytoplankton taxa and changed the phytoplankton community structure at the beginning of the wet season the availability of biogenic and other nutrient elements may influence phytoplankton and other microbial growth processes prelle graiff et al 2019 elemental concentrations and ratios significantly impact the structure of phytoplankton abundance and diversity justić rabalais et al 1995 in this study dtn positively correlated to bacillariophyta and chlorophyta density fig 7 changes in seasonal discharge may cause changes in elemental ratios subsequently affecting variations in phytoplankton diversity and production fisher gustafson et al 1999 lee fisher et al 2000 anderson glibert et al 2002 generally the atomic ratio of si n p is 16 16 1 li shen et al 2017 and biological growth and reproduction will be inhibited if one of these elements is removed phytoplankton growth is inhibited by p when si p 22 and n p 22 it is inhibited by n when n p 10 and si n 1 and it is inhibited by si when si p 10 and si n 1 justić rabalais et al 1995 table 4 shows the mean molar ratio of si n and p during all four seasonal stages results indicated the limiting potential of p during the tdw stage and a slight limiting potential of n or si during the dry season and the twd stage in aquatic systems p is often a limiting factor jiang zhang et al 2020 the gan river and other tributaries located in the southern region of the lake are important sources of elemental inputs jia gao et al 2019 5 conclusions shifts in meteorological and hydrological conditions have caused changes to occur in si and c concentrations and subsequently in phytoplankton communities in ecosystems throughout the lake poyang basin during the transitional period between the dry and wet season tdw mean c concentrations were highest while corresponding c concentrations were lowest during the wet season diatoms were dominant throughout the tdw stage the dry season and the transitional period between the wet and dry season twd moreover phytoplankton biomass was highest during the tdw stage however phytoplankton community structure changed significantly during the wet season which may be related to variations in environmental parameters in the lake ecosystem the depletion of dsi in the lake area can be attributed to diatom blooms various biochemical processes during phytoplankton growth will also significantly affect si and c concentrations in lacustrine environments therefore it is critical to better understand the influence that si has on c as it relates to phytoplankton growth characteristics to further clarify the si and c mechanisms that phytoplankton assimilate in lake basin systems which is important for our understanding of the connection between si and c sequestration in the presence of phytoplankton in lake poyang declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors of this study

946,understanding how changes in land use and land cover classes influence the portioning of rainfall into blue and green water resources as well as land use dynamics on ecologically pertinent flows are vital for sustainable water resource management and ecology guder catchment one of the tributaries of the upper blue nile basin in ethiopia was considered for the conduction of ecohydrological modeling using land use land cover maps and the soil and water assessment tool swat cultivation land is expanded while forest and plantation are declined consequently blue water component increased while the green water component declined in the study catchment besides the decline in low flow specially during months of dry period and increase in high flow during rainy season could have negative consequences for ecology therefore sustainable land and water management at catchment level is essential to protect an ecosystem and for sustainable water resources management the vital resilience capacity of the ecosystem to accommodate alteration without loss of consistency should be maintained change in green water due to land use land cover affects biological functions in terrestrial ecosystem as green water is closely linked with biological functions and rainfed agriculture the approach applied in the present study to investigate the land use and land cover change impact on blue and green water flows as well as on ecological pertinent streamflows can be simply implemented in other river basin systems keywords swat indicators of hydrological alterations blue water green water ecology guder catchment 1 introduction freshwater water availability is a basis for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems jackson et al 2001 fresh water availability and ecosystems are affected by environmental drivers such as climate land use and land cover changes veldkamp et al 2017 liu et al 2012 the demand for fresh water increases due to economic development and population growth sectors for food production energy generation and environmental sustainability compete among each other for water resources there are also tensions among riparian states on development and management of transboundary water resources gao et al 2021 in view of this growing demand assessing fresh water availability under changing land use and land cover is vital for sustainable water resources management and water related ecosystem services precipitation is the main source of water in a catchment part of which is utilized in terrestrial ecosystems by plants and evaporation from moist soil surfaces as green water flow mao et al 2020 the excess goes to fill aquifers and streams as blue water flow which is ultimately used by society and aquatic ecosystems green water is mainly stored as soil moisture and ultimately utilized by ecosystems through evapotranspiration hoekstra 2019 it can be categorized into productive green water through vegetation transpiration in terrestrial ecosystems and non productive green water through soil evaporation and canopy interception rockström and falkenmark 2000 blue water flows into rivers artificial reservoirs and aquifers that can be consumed for human uses falkenmark and rockström 2006 human consumption and ecological functions are sustained by both green and blue water rainfed crop production and natural vegetation are primarily supported by green water i e soil moisture falkenmark and rockstrom 2004 therefore water resources assessment and management and ecological conservations should consider both blue and green water components in tandem environmental changes such as land use and land cover dynamics affect hydrological processes at catchment scale by altering the rainfall regime or by influencing vegetation water resources interactions the effect of land use and land cover changes on blue and green water availability is specific to a catchment the analysis of how rainfall is partitioned between green and blue water flows is essential in terrestrial ecosystems while evaluating access to water water demand and water consumption spatio temporal variability of blue and green water flows are more vital than annual streamflow volumes in ecohydrological perspective zuo et al 2015 watersheds are appropriate scale for integrating ecohydrological studies with modelling krysanova and arnold 2008 several studies assessed the hydrological components at river basin scale using ecohydrological models rost et al 2008 liu and yang 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 keys and falkenmark 2018 wierik et al 2019 mastrotheodoros et al 2020 aquatic ecosystem in rivers is affected by excessive low flow events that constrain habitat quality and availability high flow events can modify river channel morphology and connect disjoint flood plain habitats dudgeon et al 2006 seasonality interannual variability and timing of specific flow events can influence the river ecology literature is replete with studies investigating the impact of land use and land cover dynamics on basic water balance components such as surface runoff groundwater component and mean streamflow however the ecological implications of hydrological alterations due to land use and land cover dynamics have less been studied in complex topographic regions haregeweyn et al 2016 worku et al 2017 gashaw et al 2018 woldesenbet et al 2018 berihun et al 2019 besides few studies have focused on the impact of land use and land cover dynamics on blue and green water resources in the upper blue nile basin the primary goal of this study is to demonstrate the sensitivity of various ecologically relevant flow parameters to land use land cover dynamics in addition this study aims to evaluate the spatio temporal distribution and availability of green and blue water due to land use and land cover change using ecohydrological model in one of the tributaries of transboundary river upper blue nile basin 2 study area the guder river basin is one of the tributaries of the upper blue nile river with a drainage area of 7000 km2 figure 1 the predominant soil types at the guder catchment are nitosols fluvisols leptisols luvisols vertisols and alisols bceom 1999 guder catchment is one of the main sediment contributors around 7 5 ton ha year to the upper blue nile river basin nadew et al 2019 diverse topographic condition with elevation ranges between 900 to 3229 m a s l is the characteristics of the guder catchment altitude influences the distribution of rainfall and temperature over the catchment the rainfall has unimodal pattern with a single main rainy season from june to september annual total rainfall for the period 1980 2010 is around 1380 mm and tropical climate the average annual temperature ranges from 7 c on the highly elevated area of the basin to about 26 c in the lowland areas the mean average streamflow at a gauging catchment of 500 km2 for the period 1993 2009 is 0 63 m3 sec in february and 45 m3 sec in august rainfed crop and livestock productions are the dominant livelihood in the study area the main crops produced in the area during main rainy season are teff maize barley lentils beans pea and wheat pea and lentils are grown after main rainy season through residual soil moisture 3 data and methodology 3 1 data the digital elevation model dem data is downloaded from usgs earth explorer with a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m figure 2 land use and land cover lulc thematic data were developed from landsat satellite data using supervised classification for the years 1985 2000 and 2018 grassland cultivation water and forest and plantations are identified land use and land cover classes in the study region the soil data was obtained from ministry of water irrigation and energy its physical and chemical properties were adopted from guder irrigation feasibility study report climatological data from 1980 to 2010 were obtained from the national meteorological services agency consisting of daily rainfall minimum and maximum temperatures for five stations the streamflow data were acquired from ministry of water irrigation and energy at guder gauging station for the period 1993 2009 catchment boundaries river networks and hydrologic response units hrus were developed from the dem 3 2 methodology the method applied in this study was simulating blue and green water availability using 1985 2000 and 2018 lulc thematic maps and climate data for the period 1980 2010 as an input to the ecohydrological model first land use and land cover thematic maps were developed and validated using supervised classification maximum likelihood algorithm for the guder catchment for the years 1985 2000 and 2018 second an ecohydrological model swat was calibrated and validated using the land use and land cover map of the year 2000 and observed streamflow at the gauging station for the period 1993 2009 using the calibrated and validated model parameters three swat models were run for each land use and land cover maps 1985 2000 and 2018 for the period 1981 2010 the three model outputs allowed quantifying the green and blue water resources of the catchment due to land use and land cover dynamics however these were not separately validated the green and blue water resources for the three different land covers were then compared and analysed fresh water availability in the existing studies mainly consider streamflow and groundwater eastham et al 2008 however the concept of green and blue water is emphasized most recently zang and mao 2019 rost et al 2008 noted that rainfall over catchment is recycled mainly through evapotranspiration processes by plant transpiration emphasize the investigation of green water a vital ecohydrological resource according to falkenmark and rockström 2006 the blue water was supposed as the sum of deep aquifer recharge and surface water yield while the green water was considered as actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture in a terrestrial ecosystem part of the rain falling in a land surface was consumed by vegetation and evaporated from moist surface as green water while the surplus water fed rivers and aquifers as blue water which eventually available for aquatic ecosystems and water resources development using ecohydrological model blue water was estimated from surface and groundwater components while evaporated and transpired water from bare soil and vegetation was considered as green water in this study 3 3 ecohydrological modeling 3 3 1 the swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat was used in the guder catchment to evaluate the influence of lulc changes on blue and green water resources it is a physically based semi distributed model developed to evaluate the effect of land management on catchment hydrology arnold et al 1998 the dominant water balance components calculated by the swat model are evapotranspiration surface run off groundwater flow lateral flow percolation and transmission losses arnold et al 1998 the governing equation for computing water balance components of swat is 1 s w f s w i day r day surq gwq w seep et where swf is the final soil water content mm rday is the amount of daily precipitation mm day swi is the initial soil water content mm surq is the amount of surface run off mm day gwq is the amount of return flow mm day wseep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile mm day and et is the amount of evapotranspiration mm day the net water yield wyld to the river network is calculated using eq 2 as

linear function of leaf area index lai and potential evapotranspiration pet while evaporation is estimated using exponential functions of water content and soil depth in the current study pet is calculated using hargreaves and samani 1985 approach the surface run off was calculated using an adjustment of the scs curve number method usda 1972 with daily rainfall amounts the lateral flow was calculated concurrently with percolation using a kinematic storage model distance from sub basin to main channel hydraulic conductivity of the shallow aquifer and water table height were used to estimate the groundwater flow into the channel 3 3 2 model inputs the dem climate data lulc thematic maps and soil data were used as an input for swat model the soil type map was obtained from the ministry of water and energy ethiopia figure 2 related soil properties were acquired from feasibility study of the guder irrigation scheme the lulc data for the years 1985 2000 and 2018 at the guder catchment were used to assess the impact of its changes on hydrology these images included thematic mapper imaging tm for 1985 enhanced thematic mapper imaging etm for 2000 and operational land imager oli for 2018 the satellite images were selected based on availability and cloud cover percentage all landsat images were accessed free of charge from the us geological survey usgs via http earthexplorer usgs gov the spatial resolutions of tm etm and oli were 30 15 and 15 m respectively after pan sharpening all pre processing and image classification were conducted using erdas imagine software 2014 version http www hexagongeospatial com ground truth reference data were collected to associate the spectral classes with the cover types for the 2018 oli imagery from field observations from september 2018 to october 2018 the 1985 and 2000 images classification were implemented using reference data ground truth from google earth images a total of 500 reference data points for each year were collected of which about one thirds and two third of the points were used for classification accuracy evaluation and image classification respectively various band combinations were applied to better visualize and easily distinguish land use and land cover features maximum likelihood algorithm was applied to classify the pre processed satellite images to thematic maps the missing records of precipitation and temperature from five meteorological stations in and around the guder catchment were filled using the coefficient of correlation weighting method daily streamflow at guder gauging station from 1993 to 2009 was acquired from the ministry of water energy and irrigation ethiopia the recent version swat2012 was applied to run the hydrologic model simulation and compile the input files based on slope figure 2 lulc and soil data the guder catchment was divided into 24 sub basins which in turn were subdivided into 234 hydrologic response units hrus hru is the smallest uniform spatial unit for the calculation of water balance components in swat model it is defined by lumping identical land use and land cover soils and slopes within a subbasin based upon user defined thresholds for the land use and land cover soils and slope in the present study the user defined threshold for the hru development was 10 land use and land cover 10 soil type and 10 slope class 3 3 3 lulc classification accuracy assessment around 376 282 and 300 points of an independent reference data were used to evaluate the classification accuracies for the 2018 2000 and 1985 satellite images respectively based on the reference points kappa analysis and overall accuracy were developed from a confusion matrix according to congalton and green 2009 cross tabulation of the reference vs classified class were presented as error matrices and were used to evaluate classification accuracy proportion of lulc classes together with gain and losses in each class for the considered time period were summarized quantitatively 3 3 4 model calibration and validation the most sensitive parameters against the observed streamflow for the period 1993 to 2001 were selected before calibrating the swat model table s1 shows the optimum value for the most sensitive swat model parameters during the calibration the model is calibrated using the 2000 lulc map for the period 1993 to 2001 at guder gauging station using the same parameters as calibration simulations set up to validate the model for the period 2002 to 2009 by summarizing the simulation results in monthly intervals the model performance was evaluated using the nash sutcliff efficiency ens coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias error pbias values sensitivity analysis model calibration and validation were

water components the calibrated swat model was simulated for each of the three land use and land cover maps 1986 2000 and 2018 while maintaining the other input data constant from january 1980 to december 2010 in the guder catchment the first year was considered as model initiation period for the study catchment the simulated outputs were utilized to assess the impacts of lulc dynamics on changes in blue and green water resources at the catchment scale the blue water resources wrb at sub basin level includes the water yield and the change in groundwater storage rodrigues et al 2014 water yield wyld designates water flowing from the hrus to the main channel while change in groundwater storage denotes water entering the aquifer minus the water flowing out from the aquifer to the main channel kaur et al 2019 blue water resources for non irrigated land are calculated as follows 6 w r b g w rchg wyld g w q where wrb is blue water resources mm day gwrchg is water entering the aquifer mm day wyld is water flowing from the hrus to the stream network mm day and gwq is water flowing out from the aquifer to the main channel mm day gwrchg gwq represents the change in groundwater storage δgw the green water resource wrg includes the green water flow and the green water storage green water storage designates the soil moisture content at the beginning of the period swo while the green water flow means the actual evapotranspiration from rainfall falkenmark and rockström 2006a 3 3 6 ecologically pertinent streamflow parameters rivers are the main source of water for irrigated agriculture domestic supply and industry a streamflow regime is vital for ecosystem processes and ecological integrity of a watershed as streamflow dynamics is a key to stream functioning and its ability to provide ecosystem services changes in flow regime due to environmental drivers has repercussions many ecological processes in riverine ecosystem are mainly resulted by changes in river flow regime palmer and ruhi 2019 thus knowing the effects of lulc dynamics on ecologically pertinent flow characteristics is vital for sustainable development of riverine system the nature conservancy has developed the indicators of hydrologic alterations iha tool based on richter et al 1996 that computes several parameters from daily streamflow to compare and evaluate natural discharge characteristics flow regime and environmental flow components these parameters are subdivided into two general categories 1 iha and 2 environmental flow component efc in the current study a subset of 32 26 iha and 6 efc of those 67 parameters were chosen to describe the ecologically pertinent flow regime changes in the guder catchment the parameters were selected based on their ecological relevance the selected main indices can further be categorized into five classes 1 mean monthly discharge 12 parameters 2 mean annual extreme discharge under various durations 10 parameters 3 timing of annual extreme streamflow 2 parameters 4 rate and frequency of change in streamflow 2 parameters and 5 efc monthly high flows 6 parameters the list of groups the hydrologic parameters and their ecosystem influences according to the nature conservancy 2009 are provided in table s2 swat simulated daily streamflow data for 1985 2000 and 2018 lulc maps were fed into the iha software to compute each of the selected ecologically relevant flow parameters 4 results 4 1 lulc accuracy assessment figure 3 displays the classified maps for 1985 2000 and 2018 in the guder catchment according to the error matrix report in tables s3 and 4 overall classification accuracy was 92 8 91 5 and 91 for 2018 2000 and 1985 lulc thematic maps respectively similarly a kappa coefficient khat value of 0 89 0 86 and 0 85 were attained for the 2018 2000 and 1985 classified maps respectively these accuracy metrices values indicated that there is a strong agreement between classified classes and reference points congalton and green 2009 according to anderson et al 1976 the thematic maps satisfy the minimum accuracy requirements to be applied for subsequent post classification practice such as change detection and its impact on water resources related studies 4 2 calibration and validation of swat the most sensitive parameters calibration and validation results are reported in figure 4 and table s1 at catchment scale the impacts of land use and land cover change on blue and green water resources are discussed the swat model was calibrated at a gauging station near guder town in the sub basin the comparisons between simulated and observed monthly streamflow values in the period of calibration 1 1 1993 12 31 2001 and validation 01 01 2002 12 31 2009 are shown in figure 4 a clear consistency can be seen between the simulated and the observed values the ens r2 and pbias values for the monthly calibration are 0 80 0 82 and 15 1 respectively during the validation r2 ens and pbias are 0 82 0 79 and 17 3 respectively for daily simulation r2 ens and pbias values during calibration validation are 0 80 0 81 0 61 0 63 and 14 2 14 9 respectively based on the pbias ens and r2 values for monthly streamflow the swat model is acceptable during calibration and validation period moriasi et al 2007 noted that when ens and r2 greater than 0 5 and pbias ranges between 15 to 25 the swat model is acceptable therefore the swat model simulated using the calibrated parameters was implemented to assess the spatio temporal variability of blue and green water resources as well as changes in ecologically relevant flows due to land use land cover change 4 3 impacts of land use land cover changes on blue and green water resources at the basin scale during the study period 1985 2018 cultivated land followed by forest and plantation formed the major proportions in the study catchment figure s1 as shown in land use and land cover maps for the years 1985 2000 and 2018 lulc classes have been changing in the study area figure 3 the identified lulc classes in the study region are grassland cultivation water and forest and plantation cultivation land expanded persistently while forest and plantation declined over the considered time in the guder catchment table 1 displays the average annual basin values of soil moisture total water yield total aquifer recharge the ratio between streamflow to precipitation and the ratio between actual evapotranspiration to precipitation simulated using each lulc map for the period 1980 2010 compared to the lulc in 1985 baseline the average annual water yields over the catchment were 16 91 mm per year and 34 78 mm per year higher for 2000 and 2018 lulc maps respectively the average annual water yield increased gradually from 529 5mm per year for 1985 lulc map to 564 3mm per year for 2018 lulc map similarly the average annual basin soil moisture swi also increased from 137 mm to 138 8 mm and 148 7 mm for 1985 2000 and 2018 lulc maps respectively in contrast to this the average annual evapotranspiration declined from 761 mm per year using 1985 lulc to 747 and 730 mm per year for 2000 and 2018 lulc maps respectively the proportion of streamflow to rainfall increases over time while that of evapotranspiration to rainfall declined due to land use and land cover dynamics over time table 1 this might be attributed to the expansion of cultivation land and shrinkage in forest and plantation 4 4 impact of lulc changes on blue and green water resources at the sub basins level percentage of changes in land use and land cover classes over the period 1985 to 2018 is shown in table 1 and figure s1 the change in green water due to land use and land cover between the years 1985 2018 varied among the sub basins on annual scale figures 5 a and 5b subbasins with decline in cultivation land and increase in forest cover between the periods 1985 2018 coincides with increase in actual evapotranspiration increase in evapotranspiration matches spatially with decline in soil water water yield and percolation components considering lulc change between the period 1985 2018 figure 6 4 5 hydrological index alteration due to land use and land cover dynamics the differences of the mean values for each iha parameters table 2 using land use and land cover map of 1985 2000 and 2018 are discussed in the following sections 4 5 1 category 1 lulc change impacts on the hydrologic regime of the guder catchment were analysed using 1985 2000 and 2018 lulc map with climate data during 1981 2010 slightly a decreasing trend was found in mean annual streamflow over time due to lulc dynamics monthly mean streamflows simulated by swat under the lulc together with observed flow are shown in figure 7 monthly streamflows increased in june july and august due to 2018 lulc compared to that of 1985 lulc similarly the lulc change had an increase on streamflow in june july and august using 2018 lulc compared to that of 2000 lulc the mean monthly streamflow decreased for the remaining months using 2018 lulc compared to that of 2000 lulc the mean monthly streamflow using 2000 lulc is decreasing for most of the months compared to that of 1985 lulc 4 5 2 category 2 the annual maximum and minimum daily average discharges are presented in figures 8 and s2 due to lulc dynamic decline in daily minimum flows were noticed the 1 3 7 30 and 90 day minimum daily flows decreased very slightly under the 2018 lulc compared to that of 1985 lulc on the other hand less than 5 increase was simulated for extreme high flows for 2018 lulc compared to 1985 maximum daily flows for 1 3 7 30 and 90 day is the lowest for 2000 lulc compared to 1985 and 2018 lulc 4 5 3 category 3 and 4 julian dates of minimum flow varied substantially under lulc changes while date of maximum flow is more or less similar for lulc change the mean values of fall and rise rates were predicted to increase about 12 and 2 respectively for 2018 lulc compared to that of 1985 a slight decrease in the duration of high pulses table 3 may disfavour the stream ecosystem because the decline of high pulse duration might reduce nutrient supply to biosystem along the river banks and it may disturb the riverine biodiversity 4 5 4 category 5 the impact of land use and land cover change on monthly low flows can be seen in figure s2 results indicate that monthly low flows decreased in may june october and november due to lulc dynamics between the years 1985 and 2018 4 5 5 environmental flow components efc as shown in table 3 flood peak increases while its duration declined due to land use and land cover dynamics between 1985 and 2018 increase in extreme floods might reorganize bio physical structure of a stream and its floodplain it also might sweep away benthic invertebrates on the riverine ecosystem 5 discussion in this study the effects of lulc change on green and blue water resources as well as on ecologically pertinent flows were estimated using the swat ecohydrological model three lulc maps for the year 1985 2000 and 2018 were developed to simulate the blue and green water resources availability due to lulc dynamics in the guder catchment our results showed that the blue water water yield increased while green water evapotranspiration declined in the past few decades in the guder catchment expansion of cultivation land and decline in forest cover increased surface runoff in various watersheds in the upper blue nile tekleab et al 2014 welde and gebremariam 2017 gashaw et al 2018 woldesenbet et al 2018 berihun et al 2019 which means that less water infiltrated into the soil and declined green water storage for example the replacement of forest vegetation with croplands and pasture typically reduces soil infiltration capacity root depth and surface roughness and increases albedo these changes in land surface properties lead to decreases in evapotranspiration precipitation and water table depth and increase runoff naumburg et al 2005 the opposite effects occur in the case of afforestation nosetto et al 2005 woldesenbet et al 2017 reported that expansion of cultivation land and decline in woodland increases surface runoff and water yield but decline evapotranspiration and percolation components in the upper blue nile region the annual evapotranspiration from seasonal crops is smaller than the evapotranspiration from forests and plantations because seasonal crops transpire only during the growing season whereas forest and plantation transpire throughout the year green water vapour flows from vegetation and moist soil surface facilitates the formation of rainfall over the earth which creates vital moisture feedback to the atmosphere globally about 60 percent of terrestrial rainfall originates from water vapor generated from the land surface sheil 2018 therefore large scale land use and land cover dynamics can have substantial impacts on the consistency of rainfall actual evaporation from the land surface thus recycles moisture to the atmosphere and sustains rainfall van der ent et al 2010 however mohamed et al 2005 reported that reduction in evaporation due to the loss in sudd wetland in the white nile would not influence the regional water cycle the expansion of crop land converts higher proportion of rainfall into runoff which might reduce the amount of moisture replenish to the atmosphere besides cropland evaporates less than natural vegetation that increases water yield owuor et al 2016 or blue water component but reduces moisture feedback to the atmosphere these changes could have remarkable consequences for both ecosystem and rainfed crop production the response of terrestrial ecosystems to global environmental change is often mediated or sustained by changes in soil moisture dynamics rodriguez iturbe et al 2005 furthermore several studies have shown that human induced changes in land and water use greatly shift the total evapotranspiration further affect runoff and blue water consumption wang and hejazi 2011 destouni et al 2013 gordon et al 2005 the decline in low streamflow during dry season due to land use and land cover change have significant ecological consequences mantua et al 2010 as riverine ecosystems are an integrated result of many upstream processes any modification on the watershed can influence hydroecology of a catchment land use and land cover dynamics modifies supply of water and sediment through the network of river channels and ultimately initiate substantial changes in ecological processes aquatic and riparian ecosystems allan 2004 poff et al 2006b bunn and arthington 2002 where land use increases runoff in the case of guder catchment or sediment supplies flooding and sedimentation can increase and stream habitats can be severely altered james and lecce 2013 the key component of flow regime that influence ecological processes are the magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change of streamflow mathews 2005 expansion of cultivation land on the expense of natural vegetation declines evapotranspiration and soil infiltration tekleab et al 2014 gashaw et al 2018 thus intensifying runoff and generating more flashy flow conditions during rainy season and decreases low flow during dry period rientjes et al 2011 this might result flashier hydrograph changed river course morphology and declined biotic integrity kennen et al 2010 poff et al 2006b peak flows help maintain healthy riparian communities through providing side connection between the river course and the riparian zone and floodplains naiman et al 2005 however increase in peak flow might move large quantity of sediments which dislocate benthic invertebrates townsend et al 1997 increase in high flow may sweep away biota algae macrophytes benthos riparian plants and move sediments lytle and poff 2004 modifications of the magnitudes and timing of peak flows therefore can alter many ecological processes and communities poff et al 1997 stream communities were found to be affected negatively by increases in peak discharge streamflow flashiness konrad et al 2008 magnitude of low flows and duration and timing of high flows were identified as important hydrologic variables kennen et al 2010 streams with more unpredictable high flow events in combination with extreme low flows are indicative of catchments that are affected by changes in the landscape walsh et al 2005 the land use and land cover dynamics that decrease infiltration rates and magnify runoff during rainy season through vegetation removal leaves soils vulnerable to severe erosion ebabu et al 2019 thus anthropogenic lulc change may initiate soil erosion on the watershed and sedimentation downstream alterations in runoff and sediment regime might have immediate consequences for river ecosystems such as decline in species diversity through changes in habitat structure and disturbances poff et al 2006a as river ecosystem responses to catchment land use and land cover dynamics vary with both spatial and temporal scales welde and gebremariam 2017 the response of guder catchment flow might not be similar to other river basins moreover the effectiveness of changes in water and sediment loadings in generating geomorphic responses downstream in rivers and floodplains may also vary greatly within and between basins maintaining inter and intra annual hydrologic variation is essential for sustaining the native biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems kennen et al 2010 6 limitations the hydrological model framework for simulating land use and land cover dynamics effect on blue green water component in the current study considers unchanged soil physical properties for the whole simulation period however the long term land use and land cover dynamic might change the physical properties of soil and ultimately flow pathways particularly at larger watersheds therefore hydrological model framework for simulating land use and land cover change should consider variable physical parameters of soil over simulation periods in addition multisite calibration of the hydrologic model could improve the accuracy of the spatial variability of the blue green water distribution in the current study the hydrological model was calibrated and validated at one gauging station in the upper part of the watershed due to unavailability of hydrological data at multilocation in the watershed hence the performance of the hydrological model was not verified at all sub basins in addition not all the effects of ongoing human induced impacts on water availability e g climate change groundwater withdrawals that change the amount of water in the streams were accounted the change in ecological status of the riverine system is not reinforced by observed that which is lacking in the study river basin as many of the stream systems in developing countries 7 conclusions humans manipulate change of water balance components in the catchment and change of lulc types this manipulation might result in significant ecological changes and ecosystem disturbance therefore sustainable land and water management at catchment level is essential to protect an ecosystem and for sustainable water resources management the vital resilience capacity of the ecosystem to accommodate alteration without loss of consistency should be maintained besides in the face of environmental change on rainfed crop production system integrating green and blue water management is significantly necessary falkenmark and rockström 2010 according to the results from the present study we found that the lulc dynamics has impact on both blue and green water resources in the guder catchment the sound management of green water resources is crucial for food and ecological securities in the context of environmental change change in green water due to lulc dynamics affects biological functions in terrestrial ecosystem as green water is closely linked with biological functions and rainfed agriculture falkenmark 2020 since blue and green water flows maintain ecological functions and provision of ecosystem services d odorico et al 2010 both water components are vital for human development green water flow sustaining biomass growth in rainfed crop production regions must be emphasized as ecological water function that help society in an indirect way rather than conventional blue water withdrawal for water resources development in the present study impacts of land use and land cover change on ecologically pertinent flow parameters were investigated for the guder catchment a total of three lulc maps were developed and their corresponding daily streamflow were simulated by a calibrated and validated hydrologic model subsequently the sensitivity of ecologically pertinent streamflow parameters to lulc dynamics were evaluated the study results indicated that lulc dynamics have considerable impacts on ecologically pertinent streamflows of the guder catchment results suggest that lulc dynamics for the period between 1985 and 2018 considerable declined 1 3 7 30 and 90 day minimum flows and increases in the rise rate of streamflow decreased low flow due to lulc dynamics manifested a potential for frequent hydrological drought more surface runoff or streamflow due to expansion of cultivation land increases soil erosion and sedimentation during rainy season and might make the river flow muddy and decline aquatic habitats gascon et al 2007 the approach applied in the present study to investigate the lulc change impact on blue and green water flows as well as on ecological pertinent streamflows can be simply implemented in other river basin systems the increase in surface runoff might increase sediment supply especially at the beginning of the main rainy season where the cultivation land is not covered by crops might ultimately disturb riverine ecology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

946,understanding how changes in land use and land cover classes influence the portioning of rainfall into blue and green water resources as well as land use dynamics on ecologically pertinent flows are vital for sustainable water resource management and ecology guder catchment one of the tributaries of the upper blue nile basin in ethiopia was considered for the conduction of ecohydrological modeling using land use land cover maps and the soil and water assessment tool swat cultivation land is expanded while forest and plantation are declined consequently blue water component increased while the green water component declined in the study catchment besides the decline in low flow specially during months of dry period and increase in high flow during rainy season could have negative consequences for ecology therefore sustainable land and water management at catchment level is essential to protect an ecosystem and for sustainable water resources management the vital resilience capacity of the ecosystem to accommodate alteration without loss of consistency should be maintained change in green water due to land use land cover affects biological functions in terrestrial ecosystem as green water is closely linked with biological functions and rainfed agriculture the approach applied in the present study to investigate the land use and land cover change impact on blue and green water flows as well as on ecological pertinent streamflows can be simply implemented in other river basin systems keywords swat indicators of hydrological alterations blue water green water ecology guder catchment 1 introduction freshwater water availability is a basis for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems jackson et al 2001 fresh water availability and ecosystems are affected by environmental drivers such as climate land use and land cover changes veldkamp et al 2017 liu et al 2012 the demand for fresh water increases due to economic development and population growth sectors for food production energy generation and environmental sustainability compete among each other for water resources there are also tensions among riparian states on development and management of transboundary water resources gao et al 2021 in view of this growing demand assessing fresh water availability under changing land use and land cover is vital for sustainable water resources management and water related ecosystem services precipitation is the main source of water in a catchment part of which is utilized in terrestrial ecosystems by plants and evaporation from moist soil surfaces as green water flow mao et al 2020 the excess goes to fill aquifers and streams as blue water flow which is ultimately used by society and aquatic ecosystems green water is mainly stored as soil moisture and ultimately utilized by ecosystems through evapotranspiration hoekstra 2019 it can be categorized into productive green water through vegetation transpiration in terrestrial ecosystems and non productive green water through soil evaporation and canopy interception rockström and falkenmark 2000 blue water flows into rivers artificial reservoirs and aquifers that can be consumed for human uses falkenmark and rockström 2006 human consumption and ecological functions are sustained by both green and blue water rainfed crop production and natural vegetation are primarily supported by green water i e soil moisture falkenmark and rockstrom 2004 therefore water resources assessment and management and ecological conservations should consider both blue and green water components in tandem environmental changes such as land use and land cover dynamics affect hydrological processes at catchment scale by altering the rainfall regime or by influencing vegetation water resources interactions the effect of land use and land cover changes on blue and green water availability is specific to a catchment the analysis of how rainfall is partitioned between green and blue water flows is essential in terrestrial ecosystems while evaluating access to water water demand and water consumption spatio temporal variability of blue and green water flows are more vital than annual streamflow volumes in ecohydrological perspective zuo et al 2015 watersheds are appropriate scale for integrating ecohydrological studies with modelling krysanova and arnold 2008 several studies assessed the hydrological components at river basin scale using ecohydrological models rost et al 2008 liu and yang 2010 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 keys and falkenmark 2018 wierik et al 2019 mastrotheodoros et al 2020 aquatic ecosystem in rivers is affected by excessive low flow events that constrain habitat quality and availability high flow events can modify river channel morphology and connect disjoint flood plain habitats dudgeon et al 2006 seasonality interannual variability and timing of specific flow events can influence the river ecology literature is replete with studies investigating the impact of land use and land cover dynamics on basic water balance components such as surface runoff groundwater component and mean streamflow however the ecological implications of hydrological alterations due to land use and land cover dynamics have less been studied in complex topographic regions haregeweyn et al 2016 worku et al 2017 gashaw et al 2018 woldesenbet et al 2018 berihun et al 2019 besides few studies have focused on the impact of land use and land cover dynamics on blue and green water resources in the upper blue nile basin the primary goal of this study is to demonstrate the sensitivity of various ecologically relevant flow parameters to land use land cover dynamics in addition this study aims to evaluate the spatio temporal distribution and availability of green and blue water due to land use and land cover change using ecohydrological model in one of the tributaries of transboundary river upper blue nile basin 2 study area the guder river basin is one of the tributaries of the upper blue nile river with a drainage area of 7000 km2 figure 1 the predominant soil types at the guder catchment are nitosols fluvisols leptisols luvisols vertisols and alisols bceom 1999 guder catchment is one of the main sediment contributors around 7 5 ton ha year to the upper blue nile river basin nadew et al 2019 diverse topographic condition with elevation ranges between 900 to 3229 m a s l is the characteristics of the guder catchment altitude influences the distribution of rainfall and temperature over the catchment the rainfall has unimodal pattern with a single main rainy season from june to september annual total rainfall for the period 1980 2010 is around 1380 mm and tropical climate the average annual temperature ranges from 7 c on the highly elevated area of the basin to about 26 c in the lowland areas the mean average streamflow at a gauging catchment of 500 km2 for the period 1993 2009 is 0 63 m3 sec in february and 45 m3 sec in august rainfed crop and livestock productions are the dominant livelihood in the study area the main crops produced in the area during main rainy season are teff maize barley lentils beans pea and wheat pea and lentils are grown after main rainy season through residual soil moisture 3 data and methodology 3 1 data the digital elevation model dem data is downloaded from usgs earth explorer with a spatial resolution of 30 m 30 m figure 2 land use and land cover lulc thematic data were developed from landsat satellite data using supervised classification for the years 1985 2000 and 2018 grassland cultivation water and forest and plantations are identified land use and land cover classes in the study region the soil data was obtained from ministry of water irrigation and energy its physical and chemical properties were adopted from guder irrigation feasibility study report climatological data from 1980 to 2010 were obtained from the national meteorological services agency consisting of daily rainfall minimum and maximum temperatures for five stations the streamflow data were acquired from ministry of water irrigation and energy at guder gauging station for the period 1993 2009 catchment boundaries river networks and hydrologic response units hrus were developed from the dem 3 2 methodology the method applied in this study was simulating blue and green water availability using 1985 2000 and 2018 lulc thematic maps and climate data for the period 1980 2010 as an input to the ecohydrological model first land use and land cover thematic maps were developed and validated using supervised classification maximum likelihood algorithm for the guder catchment for the years 1985 2000 and 2018 second an ecohydrological model swat was calibrated and validated using the land use and land cover map of the year 2000 and observed streamflow at the gauging station for the period 1993 2009 using the calibrated and validated model parameters three swat models were run for each land use and land cover maps 1985 2000 and 2018 for the period 1981 2010 the three model outputs allowed quantifying the green and blue water resources of the catchment due to land use and land cover dynamics however these were not separately validated the green and blue water resources for the three different land covers were then compared and analysed fresh water availability in the existing studies mainly consider streamflow and groundwater eastham et al 2008 however the concept of green and blue water is emphasized most recently zang and mao 2019 rost et al 2008 noted that rainfall over catchment is recycled mainly through evapotranspiration processes by plant transpiration emphasize the investigation of green water a vital ecohydrological resource according to falkenmark and rockström 2006 the blue water was supposed as the sum of deep aquifer recharge and surface water yield while the green water was considered as actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture in a terrestrial ecosystem part of the rain falling in a land surface was consumed by vegetation and evaporated from moist surface as green water while the surplus water fed rivers and aquifers as blue water which eventually available for aquatic ecosystems and water resources development using ecohydrological model blue water was estimated from surface and groundwater components while evaporated and transpired water from bare soil and vegetation was considered as green water in this study 3 3 ecohydrological modeling 3 3 1 the swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat was used in the guder catchment to evaluate the influence of lulc changes on blue and green water resources it is a physically based semi distributed model developed to evaluate the effect of land management on catchment hydrology arnold et al 1998 the dominant water balance components calculated by the swat model are evapotranspiration surface run off groundwater flow lateral flow percolation and transmission losses arnold et al 1998 the governing equation for computing water balance components of swat is 1 s w f s w i day r day surq gwq w seep et where swf is the final soil water content mm rday is the amount of daily precipitation mm day swi is the initial soil water content mm surq is the amount of surface run off mm day gwq is the amount of return flow mm day wseep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile mm day and et is the amount of evapotranspiration mm day the net water yield wyld to the river network is calculated using eq 2 as follows 2 wyld gwq surq latq tloss where tloss is the transmission loss from the system mm day and latq is the lateral flow contribution to stream discharge mm day transpiration is estimated using a linear function of leaf area index lai and potential evapotranspiration pet while evaporation is estimated using exponential functions of water content and soil depth in the current study pet is calculated using hargreaves and samani 1985 approach the surface run off was calculated using an adjustment of the scs curve number method usda 1972 with daily rainfall amounts the lateral flow was calculated concurrently with percolation using a kinematic storage model distance from sub basin to main channel hydraulic conductivity of the shallow aquifer and water table height were used to estimate the groundwater flow into the channel 3 3 2 model inputs the dem climate data lulc thematic maps and soil data were used as an input for swat model the soil type map was obtained from the ministry of water and energy ethiopia figure 2 related soil properties were acquired from feasibility study of the guder irrigation scheme the lulc data for the years 1985 2000 and 2018 at the guder catchment were used to assess the impact of its changes on hydrology these images included thematic mapper imaging tm for 1985 enhanced thematic mapper imaging etm for 2000 and operational land imager oli for 2018 the satellite images were selected based on availability and cloud cover percentage all landsat images were accessed free of charge from the us geological survey usgs via http earthexplorer usgs gov the spatial resolutions of tm etm and oli were 30 15 and 15 m respectively after pan sharpening all pre processing and image classification were conducted using erdas imagine software 2014 version http www hexagongeospatial com ground truth reference data were collected to associate the spectral classes with the cover types for the 2018 oli imagery from field observations from september 2018 to october 2018 the 1985 and 2000 images classification were implemented using reference data ground truth from google earth images a total of 500 reference data points for each year were collected of which about one thirds and two third of the points were used for classification accuracy evaluation and image classification respectively various band combinations were applied to better visualize and easily distinguish land use and land cover features maximum likelihood algorithm was applied to classify the pre processed satellite images to thematic maps the missing records of precipitation and temperature from five meteorological stations in and around the guder catchment were filled using the coefficient of correlation weighting method daily streamflow at guder gauging station from 1993 to 2009 was acquired from the ministry of water energy and irrigation ethiopia the recent version swat2012 was applied to run the hydrologic model simulation and compile the input files based on slope figure 2 lulc and soil data the guder catchment was divided into 24 sub basins which in turn were subdivided into 234 hydrologic response units hrus hru is the smallest uniform spatial unit for the calculation of water balance components in swat model it is defined by lumping identical land use and land cover soils and slopes within a subbasin based upon user defined thresholds for the land use and land cover soils and slope in the present study the user defined threshold for the hru development was 10 land use and land cover 10 soil type and 10 slope class 3 3 3 lulc classification accuracy assessment around 376 282 and 300 points of an independent reference data were used to evaluate the classification accuracies for the 2018 2000 and 1985 satellite images respectively based on the reference points kappa analysis and overall accuracy were developed from a confusion matrix according to congalton and green 2009 cross tabulation of the reference vs classified class were presented as error matrices and were used to evaluate classification accuracy proportion of lulc classes together with gain and losses in each class for the considered time period were summarized quantitatively 3 3 4 model calibration and validation the most sensitive parameters against the observed streamflow for the period 1993 to 2001 were selected before calibrating the swat model table s1 shows the optimum value for the most sensitive swat model parameters during the calibration the model is calibrated using the 2000 lulc map for the period 1993 to 2001 at guder gauging station using the same parameters as calibration simulations set up to validate the model for the period 2002 to 2009 by summarizing the simulation results in monthly intervals the model performance was evaluated using the nash sutcliff efficiency ens coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias error pbias values sensitivity analysis model calibration and validation were

water components the calibrated swat model was simulated for each of the three land use and land cover maps 1986 2000 and 2018 while maintaining the other input data constant from january 1980 to december 2010 in the guder catchment the first year was considered as model initiation period for the study catchment the simulated outputs were utilized to assess the impacts of lulc dynamics on changes in blue and green water resources at the catchment scale the blue water resources wrb at sub basin level includes the water yield and the change in groundwater storage rodrigues et al 2014 water yield wyld designates water flowing from the hrus to the main channel while change in groundwater storage denotes water entering the aquifer minus the water flowing out from the aquifer to the main channel kaur et al 2019 blue water resources for non irrigated land are calculated as follows 6 w r b g w rchg wyld g w q where wrb is blue water resources mm day gwrchg is water entering the aquifer mm day wyld is water flowing from the hrus to the stream network mm day and gwq is water flowing out from the aquifer to the main channel mm day gwrchg gwq represents the change in groundwater storage δgw the green water resource wrg includes the green water flow and the green water storage green water storage designates the soil moisture content at the beginning of the period swo while the green water flow means the actual evapotranspiration from rainfall falkenmark and rockström 2006a 3 3 6 ecologically pertinent streamflow parameters rivers are the main source of water for irrigated agriculture domestic supply and industry a streamflow regime is vital for ecosystem processes and ecological integrity of a watershed as streamflow dynamics is a key to stream functioning and its ability to provide ecosystem services changes in flow regime due to environmental drivers has repercussions many ecological processes in riverine ecosystem are mainly resulted by changes in river flow regime palmer and ruhi 2019 thus knowing the effects of lulc dynamics on ecologically pertinent flow characteristics is vital for sustainable development of riverine system the nature conservancy has developed the indicators of hydrologic alterations iha tool based on richter et al 1996 that computes several parameters from daily streamflow to compare and evaluate natural discharge characteristics flow regime and environmental flow components these parameters are subdivided into two general categories 1 iha and 2 environmental flow component efc in the current study a subset of 32 26 iha and 6 efc of those 67 parameters were chosen to describe the ecologically pertinent flow regime changes in the guder catchment the parameters were selected based on their ecological relevance the selected main indices can further be categorized into five classes 1 mean monthly discharge 12 parameters 2 mean annual extreme discharge under various durations 10 parameters 3 timing of annual extreme streamflow 2 parameters 4 rate and frequency of change in streamflow 2 parameters and 5 efc monthly high flows 6 parameters the list of groups the hydrologic parameters and their ecosystem influences according to the nature conservancy 2009 are provided in table s2 swat simulated daily streamflow data for 1985 2000 and 2018 lulc maps were fed into the iha software to compute each of the selected ecologically relevant flow parameters 4 results 4 1 lulc accuracy assessment figure 3 displays the classified maps for 1985 2000 and 2018 in the guder catchment according to the error matrix report in tables s3 and 4 overall classification accuracy was 92 8 91 5 and 91 for 2018 2000 and 1985 lulc thematic maps respectively similarly a kappa coefficient khat value of 0 89 0 86 and 0 85 were attained for the 2018 2000 and 1985 classified maps respectively these accuracy metrices values indicated that there is a strong agreement between classified classes and reference points congalton and green 2009 according to anderson et al 1976 the thematic maps satisfy the minimum accuracy requirements to be applied for subsequent post classification practice such as change detection and its impact on water resources related studies 4 2 calibration and validation of swat the most sensitive parameters calibration and validation results are reported in figure 4 and table s1 at catchment scale the impacts of land use and land cover change on blue and green water resources are discussed the swat model was calibrated at a gauging station near guder town in the sub basin the comparisons between simulated and observed monthly streamflow values in the period of calibration 1 1 1993 12 31 2001 and validation 01 01 2002 12 31 2009 are shown in figure 4 a clear consistency can be seen between the simulated and the observed values the ens r2 and pbias values for the monthly calibration are 0 80 0 82 and 15 1 respectively during the validation r2 ens and pbias are 0 82 0 79 and 17 3 respectively for daily simulation r2 ens and pbias values during calibration validation are 0 80 0 81 0 61 0 63 and 14 2 14 9 respectively based on the pbias ens and r2 values for monthly streamflow the swat model is acceptable during calibration and validation period moriasi et al 2007 noted that when ens and r2 greater than 0 5 and pbias ranges between 15 to 25 the swat model is acceptable therefore the swat model simulated using the calibrated parameters was implemented to assess the spatio temporal variability of blue and green water resources as well as changes in ecologically relevant flows due to land use land cover change 4 3 impacts of land use land cover changes on blue and green water resources at the basin scale during the study period 1985 2018 cultivated land followed by forest and plantation formed the major proportions in the study catchment figure s1 as shown in land use and land cover maps for the years 1985 2000 and 2018 lulc classes have been changing in the study area figure 3 the identified lulc classes in the study region are grassland cultivation water and forest and plantation cultivation land expanded persistently while forest and plantation declined over the considered time in the guder catchment table 1 displays the average annual basin values of soil moisture total water yield total aquifer recharge the ratio between streamflow to precipitation and the ratio between actual evapotranspiration to precipitation simulated using each lulc map for the period 1980 2010 compared to the lulc in 1985 baseline the average annual water yields over the catchment were 16 91 mm per year and 34 78 mm per year higher for 2000 and 2018 lulc maps respectively the average annual water yield increased gradually from 529 5mm per year for 1985 lulc map to 564 3mm per year for 2018 lulc map similarly the average annual basin soil moisture swi also increased from 137 mm to 138 8 mm and 148 7 mm for 1985 2000 and 2018 lulc maps respectively in contrast to this the average annual evapotranspiration declined from 761 mm per year using 1985 lulc to 747 and 730 mm per year for 2000 and 2018 lulc maps respectively the proportion of streamflow to rainfall increases over time while that of evapotranspiration to rainfall declined due to land use and land cover dynamics over time table 1 this might be attributed to the expansion of cultivation land and shrinkage in forest and plantation 4 4 impact of lulc changes on blue and green water resources at the sub basins level percentage of changes in land use and land cover classes over the period 1985 to 2018 is shown in table 1 and figure s1 the change in green water due to land use and land cover between the years 1985 2018 varied among the sub basins on annual scale figures 5 a and 5b subbasins with decline in cultivation land and increase in forest cover between the periods 1985 2018 coincides with increase in actual evapotranspiration increase in evapotranspiration matches spatially with decline in soil water water yield and percolation components considering lulc change between the period 1985 2018 figure 6 4 5 hydrological index alteration due to land use and land cover dynamics the differences of the mean values for each iha parameters table 2 using land use and land cover map of 1985 2000 and 2018 are discussed in the following sections 4 5 1 category 1 lulc change impacts on the hydrologic regime of the guder catchment were analysed using 1985 2000 and 2018 lulc map with climate data during 1981 2010 slightly a decreasing trend was found in mean annual streamflow over time due to lulc dynamics monthly mean streamflows simulated by swat under the lulc together with observed flow are shown in figure 7 monthly streamflows increased in june july and august due to 2018 lulc compared to that of 1985 lulc similarly the lulc change had an increase on streamflow in june july and august using 2018 lulc compared to that of 2000 lulc the mean monthly streamflow decreased for the remaining months using 2018 lulc compared to that of 2000 lulc the mean monthly streamflow using 2000 lulc is decreasing for most of the months compared to that of 1985 lulc 4 5 2 category 2 the annual maximum and minimum daily average discharges are presented in figures 8 and s2 due to lulc dynamic decline in daily minimum flows were noticed the 1 3 7 30 and 90 day minimum daily flows decreased very slightly under the 2018 lulc compared to that of 1985 lulc on the other hand less than 5 increase was simulated for extreme high flows for 2018 lulc compared to 1985 maximum daily flows for 1 3 7 30 and 90 day is the lowest for 2000 lulc compared to 1985 and 2018 lulc 4 5 3 category 3 and 4 julian dates of minimum flow varied substantially under lulc changes while date of maximum flow is more or less similar for lulc change the mean values of fall and rise rates were predicted to increase about 12 and 2 respectively for 2018 lulc compared to that of 1985 a slight decrease in the duration of high pulses table 3 may disfavour the stream ecosystem because the decline of high pulse duration might reduce nutrient supply to biosystem along the river banks and it may disturb the riverine biodiversity 4 5 4 category 5 the impact of land use and land cover change on monthly low flows can be seen in figure s2 results indicate that monthly low flows decreased in may june october and november due to lulc dynamics between the years 1985 and 2018 4 5 5 environmental flow components efc as shown in table 3 flood peak increases while its duration declined due to land use and land cover dynamics between 1985 and 2018 increase in extreme floods might reorganize bio physical structure of a stream and its floodplain it also might sweep away benthic invertebrates on the riverine ecosystem 5 discussion in this study the effects of lulc change on green and blue water resources as well as on ecologically pertinent flows were estimated using the swat ecohydrological model three lulc maps for the year 1985 2000 and 2018 were developed to simulate the blue and green water resources availability due to lulc dynamics in the guder catchment our results showed that the blue water water yield increased while green water evapotranspiration declined in the past few decades in the guder catchment expansion of cultivation land and decline in forest cover increased surface runoff in various watersheds in the upper blue nile tekleab et al 2014 welde and gebremariam 2017 gashaw et al 2018 woldesenbet et al 2018 berihun et al 2019 which means that less water infiltrated into the soil and declined green water storage for example the replacement of forest vegetation with croplands and pasture typically reduces soil infiltration capacity root depth and surface roughness and increases albedo these changes in land surface properties lead to decreases in evapotranspiration precipitation and water table depth and increase runoff naumburg et al 2005 the opposite effects occur in the case of afforestation nosetto et al 2005 woldesenbet et al 2017 reported that expansion of cultivation land and decline in woodland increases surface runoff and water yield but decline evapotranspiration and percolation components in the upper blue nile region the annual evapotranspiration from seasonal crops is smaller than the evapotranspiration from forests and plantations because seasonal crops transpire only during the growing season whereas forest and plantation transpire throughout the year green water vapour flows from vegetation and moist soil surface facilitates the formation of rainfall over the earth which creates vital moisture feedback to the atmosphere globally about 60 percent of terrestrial rainfall originates from water vapor generated from the land surface sheil 2018 therefore large scale land use and land cover dynamics can have substantial impacts on the consistency of rainfall actual evaporation from the land surface thus recycles moisture to the atmosphere and sustains rainfall van der ent et al 2010 however mohamed et al 2005 reported that reduction in evaporation due to the loss in sudd wetland in the white nile would not influence the regional water cycle the expansion of crop land converts higher proportion of rainfall into runoff which might reduce the amount of moisture replenish to the atmosphere besides cropland evaporates less than natural vegetation that increases water yield owuor et al 2016 or blue water component but reduces moisture feedback to the atmosphere these changes could have remarkable consequences for both ecosystem and rainfed crop production the response of terrestrial ecosystems to global environmental change is often mediated or sustained by changes in soil moisture dynamics rodriguez iturbe et al 2005 furthermore several studies have shown that human induced changes in land and water use greatly shift the total evapotranspiration further affect runoff and blue water consumption wang and hejazi 2011 destouni et al 2013 gordon et al 2005 the decline in low streamflow during dry season due to land use and land cover change have significant ecological consequences mantua et al 2010 as riverine ecosystems are an integrated result of many upstream processes any modification on the watershed can influence hydroecology of a catchment land use and land cover dynamics modifies supply of water and sediment through the network of river channels and ultimately initiate substantial changes in ecological processes aquatic and riparian ecosystems allan 2004 poff et al 2006b bunn and arthington 2002 where land use increases runoff in the case of guder catchment or sediment supplies flooding and sedimentation can increase and stream habitats can be severely altered james and lecce 2013 the key component of flow regime that influence ecological processes are the magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change of streamflow mathews 2005 expansion of cultivation land on the expense of natural vegetation declines evapotranspiration and soil infiltration tekleab et al 2014 gashaw et al 2018 thus intensifying runoff and generating more flashy flow conditions during rainy season and decreases low flow during dry period rientjes et al 2011 this might result flashier hydrograph changed river course morphology and declined biotic integrity kennen et al 2010 poff et al 2006b peak flows help maintain healthy riparian communities through providing side connection between the river course and the riparian zone and floodplains naiman et al 2005 however increase in peak flow might move large quantity of sediments which dislocate benthic invertebrates townsend et al 1997 increase in high flow may sweep away biota algae macrophytes benthos riparian plants and move sediments lytle and poff 2004 modifications of the magnitudes and timing of peak flows therefore can alter many ecological processes and communities poff et al 1997 stream communities were found to be affected negatively by increases in peak discharge streamflow flashiness konrad et al 2008 magnitude of low flows and duration and timing of high flows were identified as important hydrologic variables kennen et al 2010 streams with more unpredictable high flow events in combination with extreme low flows are indicative of catchments that are affected by changes in the landscape walsh et al 2005 the land use and land cover dynamics that decrease infiltration rates and magnify runoff during rainy season through vegetation removal leaves soils vulnerable to severe erosion ebabu et al 2019 thus anthropogenic lulc change may initiate soil erosion on the watershed and sedimentation downstream alterations in runoff and sediment regime might have immediate consequences for river ecosystems such as decline in species diversity through changes in habitat structure and disturbances poff et al 2006a as river ecosystem responses to catchment land use and land cover dynamics vary with both spatial and temporal scales welde and gebremariam 2017 the response of guder catchment flow might not be similar to other river basins moreover the effectiveness of changes in water and sediment loadings in generating geomorphic responses downstream in rivers and floodplains may also vary greatly within and between basins maintaining inter and intra annual hydrologic variation is essential for sustaining the native biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems kennen et al 2010 6 limitations the hydrological model framework for simulating land use and land cover dynamics effect on blue green water component in the current study considers unchanged soil physical properties for the whole simulation period however the long term land use and land cover dynamic might change the physical properties of soil and ultimately flow pathways particularly at larger watersheds therefore hydrological model framework for simulating land use and land cover change should consider variable physical parameters of soil over simulation periods in addition multisite calibration of the hydrologic model could improve the accuracy of the spatial variability of the blue green water distribution in the current study the hydrological model was calibrated and validated at one gauging station in the upper part of the watershed due to unavailability of hydrological data at multilocation in the watershed hence the performance of the hydrological model was not verified at all sub basins in addition not all the effects of ongoing human induced impacts on water availability e g climate change groundwater withdrawals that change the amount of water in the streams were accounted the change in ecological status of the riverine system is not reinforced by observed that which is lacking in the study river basin as many of the stream systems in developing countries 7 conclusions humans manipulate change of water balance components in the catchment and change of lulc types this manipulation might result in significant ecological changes and ecosystem disturbance therefore sustainable land and water management at catchment level is essential to protect an ecosystem and for sustainable water resources management the vital resilience capacity of the ecosystem to accommodate alteration without loss of consistency should be maintained besides in the face of environmental change on rainfed crop production system integrating green and blue water management is significantly necessary falkenmark and rockström 2010 according to the results from the present study we found that the lulc dynamics has impact on both blue and green water resources in the guder catchment the sound management of green water resources is crucial for food and ecological securities in the context of environmental change change in green water due to lulc dynamics affects biological functions in terrestrial ecosystem as green water is closely linked with biological functions and rainfed agriculture falkenmark 2020 since blue and green water flows maintain ecological functions and provision of ecosystem services d odorico et al 2010 both water components are vital for human development green water flow sustaining biomass growth in rainfed crop production regions must be emphasized as ecological water function that help society in an indirect way rather than conventional blue water withdrawal for water resources development in the present study impacts of land use and land cover change on ecologically pertinent flow parameters were investigated for the guder catchment a total of three lulc maps were developed and their corresponding daily streamflow were simulated by a calibrated and validated hydrologic model subsequently the sensitivity of ecologically pertinent streamflow parameters to lulc dynamics were evaluated the study results indicated that lulc dynamics have considerable impacts on ecologically pertinent streamflows of the guder catchment results suggest that lulc dynamics for the period between 1985 and 2018 considerable declined 1 3 7 30 and 90 day minimum flows and increases in the rise rate of streamflow decreased low flow due to lulc dynamics manifested a potential for frequent hydrological drought more surface runoff or streamflow due to expansion of cultivation land increases soil erosion and sedimentation during rainy season and might make the river flow muddy and decline aquatic habitats gascon et al 2007 the approach applied in the present study to investigate the lulc change impact on blue and green water flows as well as on ecological pertinent streamflows can be simply implemented in other river basin systems the increase in surface runoff might increase sediment supply especially at the beginning of the main rainy season where the cultivation land is not covered by crops might ultimately disturb riverine ecology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

947,biodiversity maintenance is a main goal in ecology hence phytoplankton diversity and biomass were analyzed in a coastal bay cumã bay of the amazon macrotidal mangrove coast which has been designated as an international hotspot for conservation ramsar site with high biological productivity and diversity that provides crucial ecosystem services and elevated fish production an ecohydrology based approach was applied to identify the main factors that drive the patterns of phytoplankton diversity and biomass considering spatio temporal analyses of physical chemical and biological variables from may 2019 to june 2020 phytoplankton dynamics were investigated using multivariate analyses correlations and generalized additive models seven indices were tested to select the most efficient biodiversity metric the hydrological conditions of cumã bay were governed primarily by elevated precipitation and macrotidal dynamics resulting in two different functional zones based on environmental variability the freshwater influence zone and marine influence zone seasonally the maximum freshwater discharge low salinity and light availability promoted cell abundance and biomass increase with blooms of skeletonema costatum which reduced the taxonomic diversity of the community in the rainy season during the dry season turbid waters resulting from macrotidal dynamics and wind speed limited light penetration and phytoplankton photosynthesis leading to a higher uniformity in the species distribution shannon index was the most sensitive biodiversity metric to environmental changes this study found that deterministic processes governed the community which rainfall on the amazon coast along with wind speed salinity light availability and nutrients were the

study now in coastal systems wolanski and elliott 2015 cumã bay located on the northern amazon coast is known for its high productivity and biological diversity it is a spawning area and nursery for numerous species of fish shellfish and migratory birds due to its importance for conservation has been considered under the ramsar convention as an internationally important wetland hazin 2008 cumã bay provides relevant ecosystem services for the amazon coast however information based on ecosystem functionality is currently scarce in fact the challenges presented by the cumã bay represent a number of opportunities for the application of ecohydrological principles from an ecological point of view the interpretation of the effects of hydrological processes on biology is straightforward because mechanistic relationship can be hypothesized poff 1997 however this is different and more difficult in complex environments for example cumã bay which renders the interpretation of pressure effects on ecological functioning a challenge thus an application of multivariate analysis and additive models can solve this problem we hypothesized that hydrological seasonal changes in coastal ecosystems promote massive growth of phytoplankton which may lead to a reduction in overall biodiversity from this point our study combined traditional techniques and generalized additive model gam to evaluate the influence of environmental factors on phytoplankton diversity and biomass in the amazon coastal system cumã bay traditional techniques pca and correlations analysis were used to select the most appropriated biodiversity metric that reflects seasonal changes and gam was applied to determine the main environmental factors that drive phytoplankton diversity and biomass in an amazon macrotidal bay hence the present work is able to provide a new perspective to support conservation and management programs in amazon aquatic ecosystems 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and

baixada maranhense this region has a high diversity and covers 10 800 km2 with a seasonal flooding cycle that annually overflows and inundates the lowland components of the fluvial network resulting in the formation of temporary and permanent lakes almeida funo et al 2010 ibañez et al 2000 its discharge is marked by a seasonal cycle martins and oliveira 2011 the maximum flow rate 113 69 94 30 m3

strategy to analyze the spatiotemporal fluctuations of the phytoplankton community and environmental variables six surveys were conducted from may 2019 to june 2020 with a total of 60 collected samples n 60 the sampling period included the rainy may march and june and dry august october and december seasons at five sampling sites along the bay sampling was performed on the sub surface water as well as at a 2 m depth with a van dorn oceanographic bottle during the daytime ebb tide and the neap tide cumã bay was divided into two functional zones with spatial patterns of water quality physical and chemical variables during each season of either fig 1 i the freshwater influence zone fiz sites 1 to 2 depth 9 m and ii the marine influence zone miz sites 3 to 5 depth 12 17 m zone identification was based on cluster analysis following the approach of boyer et al 1997 boyer 2006 and varona cordeiro et al 2010 for coastal ecosystems to better understand and classify the bay into spatially distributed stations with similar water quality characteristics zones of similar influence zsi 2 3 physical and chemical variables and light limiting factors to physically characterize the cumã bay a conductivity temperature and depth ctd probe castway sontek inst co was used to measure salinity resolution 0 01 accuracy 0 1 temperature resolution 0 01 accuracy 0 05 c and pressure resolution 0 01 m accuracy 0 25 scale in situ by a vertical profile of the water column total dissolved solids tds ph and dissolved oxygen do concentrations were measured with a hanna multi parametric probe hi 9828 in order to evaluate the light limiting factors measurements of photosynthetically active radiation par were obtained using an underwater radiation quantum sensor li cor li 1500 water turbidity with a turbidity meter ms tecnopom tb 1000p and suspended particulate matter spm was determined according to gravimetric analysis as described by strickland and parsons 1972 water transparency was estimated based on secchi depth and the light extinction coefficient k from the formula described by poole and atkins 1929 water samples 350 500 ml were filtered through whatman gf f glass fiber filters 0 7 μm porosity and 47 mm diameter to determine dissolved inorganic nutrients the determination of ammonium ion nh3 followed the methodology described by koroleff 1983 the concentrations of nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 were based on strickland and parsons 1972 whereas orthophosphate po4 3 and silicate sio2 measurements were derived according to grasshoff et al 1983 the precision was 0 02 μmol for no3 0 02 μmol for no2 0 02 μmol for nh3 and 0 01 μmol for po4 3 the accuracy was 2 for po4 3 3 for no3 and no2 and 5 for nh3 2 4 phytoplankton community biomass and nutritional status phytoplankton in cumã bay were analyzed in terms of composition cell abundance biomass and diversity for biological analysis water samples 250 ml were collected from the sub surface and at 2 m depth and preserved with lugol s iodine solution at a final concentration of 1 in the laboratory identification and cell counts 20 200 μm cell size were performed using an inverted microscope zeiss axiovert 100 at 400 magnification following utermöhl s technique utermöhl 1958 the equation of villafañe and reid 1995 was applied to calculate the cell abundance cells l 1 phytoplankton were identified at the lowest taxonomic level and updated using the algaebase international database guiry and guiry 2020 chlorophyll a was used as a reliable proxy for total phytoplankton biomass water samples 150 350 ml were filtered through whatman gf f glass fiber filters 0 7 μm porosity and 47 mm diameter and to separate the microphytoplankton 20 μm from the nanophytoplankton 20 μm fraction chlorophyll a sub samples were passed through 20 μm mesh and then filtered pigment extraction was performed in 10 ml of 90 v v acetone in the dark at 18 c for 24 h and the fluorescence was measured both before and after acidification with 5 v v hcl using a turner designs trilogy laboratory fluorimeter parsons et al 1984 with the results expressed in mg m 3 the ratio of light absorption at 480 and 665 nm by 90 acetone extracts of phytoplankton pigments was used as proposed by heath et al 1990 as a potential indicator of the phytoplankton nutritional status ratio the optical density at 480 nm was used as an index of total carotenoid content strickland and parsons 1972 as a result the absorption ratio a480 a665 the 480 665 ratio was used as an index of the carotenoid chlorophyll a ratio values of 0 5 1 5 indicate a good physiological status of phytoplankton cells while those close to 2 reflect a potential nutrient limitation and ratios higher than 2 4 indicate severe nutritional depletion 2 5 estimation of diversity measures a number of the most commonly used diversity measures were used to estimate the phytoplankton diversity alpha diversity in terms of ecological information three aspects of diversity indices were considered including richness number of taxa s margalef index d and menhinick index d diversity shannon index h simpson index λ brillouin index hb and berger parker index bp and evenness index j table 1 2 6 data analysis 2 6 1 identification of environmental patterns and zones significant differences in physicochemical and biological variables were analyzed using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova with three factors season zsi and sampling depth after checking the normality and homogeneity of variances a non parametric analysis kruskal wallis test was used to test statistical differences for each variable considering p values of 0 05 as significant cluster analysis was used to aggregate sampling points and identify zones with similar water quality zsi using euclidean distance as a measure of distance and ward s method to construct the algorithm pielou 1984 based on a standardized data matrix in which the value was converted to a z value values in a standardized normal distribution 2 6 2 relationship between phytoplankton abundance and biomass to categorize the phytoplankton species the frequency of sampling sites where a species occurred was correlated with the abundance of each taxon and presented as an olmstead tukey diagram which classifies the species as dominant frequent occasional or rare based on sokal and rohlf 1994 criteria the relationship between phytoplankton biomass chlorophyll a content and abundance was analyzed using abundance biomass comparison abc curves which determine the level of disturbance in the phytoplankton community the w statistic was used which ranges from 1 dominance in abundance or disturbed community to 1 dominance in biomass or undisturbed community according to clarke 1990 and clarke and warwick 2001 2 6 3 selection of diversity indices and link with hydrological conditions biodiversity metrics that respond differently to hydrological conditions can be considered complementary rombouts et al 2019 hence we investigated the extent to which the selected biodiversity measures reflected changes in the environmental conditions and if these indices were interrelated a standardized principal component analysis pca was used to identify the spatial and seasonal patterns of the environmental variables and chlorophyll a subsequently the scores of the principal components which summarize the explanation of environmental variability were then correlated with diversity metrics to investigate how the phytoplankton diversity reflect changes in the environmental conditions of cumã bay linear pearson s correlations were calculated to assess the relationship between each pc and the phytoplankton diversity indices additionally to evaluate nonlinear interactions between environmental factors and phytoplankton biomass and diversity and critical species we used generalized additive models gams gams have several advantages in analyzing nonlinear and nonmonotonic relationships between a response variable and fitted predictors hastie and tibshirani 1986 and allow one response variable to be fitted by several predictors in additive models having the advantage of not requiring an a priori specification of functional relationships which is suitable for describing complex ecological interactions farias et al 2022 we modeled the response of phytoplankton biomass and diversity to the effect of main environmental variables salinity temperature spm par and nutrients using the gam function in the r package mgcv wood 2011 the estimated degrees of freedom edf indicate the degree of nonlinearity of the gams where values close to 1 implies a linear relationship and 1 implies a progressively higher order relationship xiong et al 2021 previously the draftsman plot from the spearman correlation was used for evaluating variable collinearity r2 0 6 multivariate statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics version 24 r software version 4 1 0 statistic software version 10 0 primer version 6 0 and canoco version 4 5 the interpolation maps were constructed by qgis software version 2 18 using the inverse distance weighting idw method 3 results 3 1 hydrological conditions spatial and seasonal fluctuations of physical and chemical variables in cumã bay were detected based on permanova analysis the environmental variables showed significant differences among seasonal periods spatial variations and sampling depths p 0 05 table 2 however the interaction between them was not statistically significant p 0 05 spatial and seasonal variations of hydrological variables are shown in table 3 and figure 3 in relation to depth sampling sub surface and 2 m only par was significantly different p 0 001 salinity in the bay ranged from 8 22 to 29 24 with a significant difference between seasonal and spatial variation p 0 05 the seasonal dynamics of the freshwater marine

functional zones and seasonal periods 3 2 phytoplankton biomass nutritional status and light limiting factors the distribution of chlorophyll a concentration along the bay showed a seasonal pattern fig 4 a with values significantly higher p 0 001 in the rainy season overall mean 13 81 6 53 mg m 3 than in the dry season overall mean 7 90 2 83 mg m 3 a spatial gradient 8 35 mg m 3 19 67 mg m 3 was identified with higher concentrations in the fiz even with no significant spatial difference p 0 05 from the average of the chlorophyll a fractions nanophytoplankton 20 µm was the dominant fraction with a contribution of 53 to 76 and was more representative in the fiz during both seasons fig 4c seasonality was not a significant factor in the phytoplankton nutritional state 480 665 ratio p 0 05 however a significant spatial gradient p 0 05 was observed with a minimum value in the miz 0 89 and maximum in the fiz 4 52 during the rainy season fig 4b a good physiological status of the phytoplankton cells was recorded with 73 of the data within to the reference limits 0 5 1 5 except in the p2 fiz during the rainy season which reached an average of 4 51 5 32 the lowest concentrations of spm 40 mg l 1 and turbidity 60 ntu were recorded on the sub surface water of the fiz during the rainy season which promoted a higher light availability par 1 000 µmol m 2 s 1 and water transparency secchi 0 6 m and consequently greater phytoplankton biomass fig 4d by contrast the dry season was characterized by turbid water with a higher light extinction coefficient k 3 and lower phytoplankton biomass 3 3 phytoplankton diversity between may 2019 and december 2020 192 taxa were identified in cumã bay distributed in six divisions bacillariophyta miozoa chrysophyta cyanobacteria euglenophyta and chlorophyta fig 5 diatoms were the most representative 82 29 158 taxa in both seasons and zones fiz miz with relative abundances ranging between 96 and 99 miozoa had the second highest contribution 8 33 16 taxa and relative abundance 3 while species of chrysophyta were observed exclusively during the rainy season out of 158 diatoms species identified 83 were centric where 40 showed ecological strategies of solitary and 43 formed chains while 75 were pennate including 60 solitaries and only 15 formed chains based on the seasonal variability of the community higher species richness 165 were observed in the rainy season whereby 29 48 taxa were classified as dominant abundance 2 5 10 5 cells l 1 and frequency 16 9 and 58 96 taxa rare during the dry season of the 126 taxa recorded 28 36 taxa were dominant abundance 0 78 10 5 cells l 1 and frequency 19 1 and 55 69 taxa were rare the diatoms skeletonema costatum thalassiosira rotula thalassiosira subtilis and cyclotella litoralis were the most dominant species along the study period the significant increasing abundance in the rainy season is due to blooms of s costatum 10 39 16 17 10 5 cells l 1 in the fiz during march 2020 while t subitilis 0 47 0 51 10 5 cells l 1 showed an abundance increasing from fiz to miz during the dry season more details on species dominance are available in the supplementary material supplementary fig 1 cell abundance was associated with phytoplankton distribution in response to seasonal variability of the environmental variables in the bay the minimum abundance was recorded in the dry season overall mean 3 06 1 08 10 5 cells l 1 with a significant increase in the rainy season overall mean 14 13 15 77 10 5 cells l 1 spatially a decreasing gradient was observed from the fiz to the miz particularly in the rainy season table 3 the alpha diversity also reflected a seasonal pattern with space time changes but showed only significant differences between seasons p 0 05 the phytoplankton richness was assessed using margalef d and menhinick d indices while evenness was based on the pielou j index and both showed higher means in the dry season especially in the fiz 4 87 0 72 2 47 0 52 and 0 60 0 12 respectively indicating higher homogeneity of the phytoplankton distribution in this period in addition higher fluctuations were recorded during the rainy season table 3 the diversity indices shannon h brillouin hb and simpson λ showed similar distributions with higher means in the inner part of the bay fiz during the dry season 2 59 0 28 bits cell 1 2 25 0 19 and 0 88 0 05 respectively which implies in higher diversity in this period however the berger parker bp index exhibited the opposite behavior with a higher mean in the outer part of the bay miz during the rainy season 0 52 0 32 in response to the greatest contribution of the dominant species table 3 the level of disturbance in the phytoplankton community was indicated by abc curves which the w index indicated a pronounced disturbed condition during the rainy season w 0 285 and more elevated k dominance curves denoting lower diversity in contrast k dominance curves did not show a marked difference during the dry season indicating a tendency toward a lower stressed environment w 0 005 blooms of the opportunistic species s costatum were the main factors responsible for the disturbance level in the period of higher precipitation abc curve plot and cell abundance of the s costatum are provided as supplementary fig 2 3 4 inter relationships among phytoplankton diversity metrics from the correlation analysis using seven indices widely used to measure alpha diversity strong correlations among diversity measures were found table 4 for the richness metrics the margalef index d and taxa number s were highly and positively correlated r 0 91 while the menhinick index d was correlated with cell abundance r 0 66 for the dominance group shannon h simpson λ and brillouin hb were strongly correlated r 0 97 between categories d was highly and positively correlated r 0 90 to h λ and hb indices suggesting that these metrics carry similar ecological information the pielou j index was significantly related to berger parker bp r 0 92 but presented a negative relationship in addition regression coefficients between richness and h and hb were significantly higher in comparison to evenness indicating a greater effect of the taxa number under the diversity measurements and that the λ and bp variations were primarily caused by relative abundance 3 5 environmental conditions as driving factors of phytoplankton biomass and diversity principal component analysis pca investigated the relationships among environmental descriptors hydrological and meteorological variables and ordination of the sampling sites for rainy and dry seasons in cumã bay supplementary fig 3 the pca applied for investigating the relationship among the hydrological data and chlorophyll a from the rainy season summarized 51 47 of the total variation in the first two axes the pc1 axis explains 47 28 and related rainfall temperature spm and no3 negatively to wind salinity do and ph that confirms that the highest freshwater influence increases spm concentrations and water temperature and decreases salinity and do the pc2 17 70 axis suggests that high chlorophyll a values are related to low po4 3 and sio2 concentrations a contrary scenario was observed in the pca performed with abiotic data from the dry season with 62 30 of the total variation explained in the first two axes the pc1 axis accounted for 42 27 of the variance and related wind speed negatively to salinity rainfall ph do spm nh3 and po4 3 in response to greater marine influence into the bay the pc2 axis showing an additional 20 03 of the variance highlighted the positive correlation between nutrients sio2 no3 no2 and par we investigated the relationships of the pc with phytoplankton diversity to select the most efficient biodiversity measure for assessing environmental changes table 5 significant correlations were found mainly between pc1 and richness and diversity groups suggesting that fluctuations of the environmental descriptors regulate the pattern identified by the diversity indices d was the most effective metric for richness and best explained the environmental fluctuations r 0 83 p 0 000 while h best reflected the diversity and evenness of the environmental conditions in the bay r 0 86 p 0 000 this sensitivity shared by d and h in relation to changes in aquatic ecosystems corroborates the strong interrelationships previously detected in table 4 gams analysis evaluating the response of phytoplankton diversity and chlorophyll a to the combined effects of the main drivers environmental factors explained at least 59 of the total variance table 6 the predictor variables were salinity temperature par spm and the responses variables were shannon index h critical species skeletonema costatum and thalassiosira subtilis and chlorophyll a for four gams respectively fig 6 the gam explained 84 8 of the variance in diversity phytoplankton the most significant predictor variables for phytoplankton diversity were salinity f 14 78 p 0 0001 spm f 10 12 p 0 0001 and temperature f 5 92 p 0 0001 where increases in salinity concentrations of spm up to 100 mg l 1 and temperature around 32 c induced positive effects on phytoplankton diversity the gam explained 80 9 and 59 1 of the deviance for s costatum and t subtilis respectively the most significant drivers for s costatum were salinity f 23 55 p 0 0001 spm f 11 14 p 0 0001 and par f 10 27 p 0 0001 blooms of s costatum occurred when salinity ranged between 10 to 25 and spm and par reached values up to 100 mg l 1 and 500 µmol m 2 s 1 respectively t subtilis were influenced mainly by salinity f 15 58 p 0 0001 and par f 3 77 p 0 004 with significant and positive non linear correlations while spm fluctuations implied a linear relationship f 3 76 p 0 05 but values up to 100 mg l 1 promoted an increase of t subtilis abundance gam results showed the response of phytoplankton biomass chlorophyll a to salinity f 4 53 p 0 0003 temperature f 4 33 p 0 001 and par f 5 53 p 0 023 with a combined explanation of 67 3 the highest chlorophyll a concentrations were observed at salinity around 10 under light availability 500 µmol m 2 s 1 and temperature values ranging between 30 c and 32 c thus salinity par and spm were the main predictors for all biological variables investigated phytoplankton diversity chlorophyll a critical

the world s wettest region and is characterized by high influence of macrotides 4 m associated with a high freshwater contribution pericumã itapetininga guarapiranga peri açu and seribeira rivers in marine ecosystems such as bays and estuaries the spatiotemporal variations of biological processes phytoplankton biomass are associated with physical factors such as tidal cycle solar energy input fluvial input dilution wind intensity and vertical mixing of the water column cloern 1996 wirtz and wiltshire 2005 yin et al 2004 the seasonality of the water balance rainfall and river flow and the variability of environmental descriptors and nutrients subjected to the macrotidal regime controls the patterns of biomass and phytoplankton diversity in this tropical area and produce accentuated gradients environmental broecker 1998 confirms that the water cycle among the land sea and atmosphere in the tropics is the main driving engine for ocean circulation of heat salt and water vapor freshwater cycle is an important external factor that controls nutrient inputs fertilizer runoff and organic matter from urban margins gameiro et al 2007 thompson et al 2015 the rainfall distribution along the maranhão coast was similar to the historical annual average last 28 years with higher than average volumes in the first four months of the year the high rainfall in maranhão 2 300 mm located on the amazon coast changed the hydrological conditions of the bay increasing the flow rate of its main contributors and nutrient inputs and decreasing salinity spm and water turbidity which favored phytoplankton growth an ecohydrologic conceptual diagram showing the relationships between phytoplankton biomass abundance and diversity the main hydrological variables physical conditions and anthropogenic processes are summarized in fig 7 increased precipitation from january to june is a consequence of the intertropical convergence zone itcz which is the controlling mechanism of the meteorological variables in northern and northeastern brazil araujo et al 2017 fu et al 2001 in response to the lower rainfall contribution negative water balance during the rest of the year greater wind intensity and marine water intrusion are determining factors for the dynamics of the environmental santos et al 2020 and biological descriptors cavalcanti et al 2020 seasonal variability in cumã bay directly influenced the dynamics and diversity of primary producers therefore our results corroborate the use of phytoplankton as an efficient indicator of water quality and ecological changes as they are sensitive to environmental stressors and respond quickly to changes in the water column cabrita 2014 lemley et al 2017 paerl et al 2007 santana et al 2018 4 2 phytoplankton biomass and environmental conditions two functional zones were identified in both seasonal periods freshwater and marine influence zones this zonation of the bay reflects its spatial heterogeneity the strong effect of external factors acting in bays and estuaries freshwater and marine water entering and local climatic conditions goes et al 2014 varona cordero et al 2010 influencing the photosynthetic process and phytoplankton abundance based on the fluctuations of thermohaline variables a river plume originating from the tributaries of cumã bay extended into the superficial layer of the inner zone of the bay fiz which has a greater positive water balance high freshwater input less salinity 18 and warmer water 31 c than the adjacent zone miz during the period of negative water balance dry season the macrotidal effects overlap with the flow rate of the main tributaries along the bay resulting in a higher intrusion of marine water salinity 22 temperature 32 c the variation of the thermohaline structure has been discussed with regard to two bays on the north amazon coast são marcos cavalcanti et al 2018 lefèvre et al 2017 and são josé santos et al 2020 both of which showed similar patterns to those of cumã bay these outcomes confirm the typical dynamics of the equatorial coastal zone which is influenced by local water balance with relevant fluvial contributions in the rainy season and intrusion of the coastal water mass in the dry season this seasonal variability directly influenced the phytoplankton community since salinity and nutrients are the main factors affecting phytoplankton distribution biochemistry and control in coastal systems brand 1984 papry et al 2020 and they are unique hydrological aspects because they are markers of freshwater influx into coastal ecosystems lancelot and muylaert 2011 phosphorus concentration significantly influences phytoplankton behavior because it is an essential macronutrient for these species jin et al 2021 contributing 0 87 of the phytoplankton cell dry weight redfield 1958 and participating in metabolism nucleic acid replication and cellular constitution pasek et al 2015 reed et al 2016 land uses may directly influence n and p delivery to coastal waters and concentrations of total n and p and biomass chlorophyll a are often higher within the inner zones of coastal areas thereby affecting phytoplankton composition our findings confirmed the ecological importance of salinity light and nutrients on chlorophyll a distribution mainly on spatial and seasonal scales fig 4a since multivariate analyses and generalized additive models showed significant correlations with freshwater input and marine water influence the higher extension of the river plume in the rainy season reduces salinity promoting a favorable condition for the significant increase in phytoplankton biomass azhikodan and yokoyama 2016 cabral et al 2020 howarth et al 2000 leach et al 2018 higher light availability in the water column in this season also contributed for phytoplankton growth and it is a result of the lower values of water turbidity spm and light extinction coefficient that favored light penetration par and water transparency this scenario resulted in a greater depth of the photic layer which promoted a necessary condition for phytoplankton growth in terms of abundance and biomass fig 7 in contrast during the months in which the wind speed was intensified and precipitation was scarce dry season higher salinity and spm concentrations reduced the light penetration in the water column and consequently limited phytoplankton growth the increased spm load into the bay and higher water turbidity are likely the result of the higher wind speed associated with greater permanence of coastal waters in the bay which causes resuspension of the previously deposited material and or erosion of the margins dias et al 2016 santos et al 2020 vale and sundby 1987 which is intensified by tidal flux in macrotidal systems wolanski and spagnol 2003 yellen et al 2017 the average chlorophyll a concentration recorded in the present study 10 85 5 80 mg m 3 was typical of coastal ecosystems with anthropogenic effects such as domestic and industrial pollutants smith et al 1999 in addition the nutritional state assessed by the 480 665 ratio did not identify phytoplankton cells under nutritional depletion values 2 0 indicating a good physiological status heath et al 1990 chlorophyll is commonly used as a proxy for water quality because it provides consistent insights on eutrophication therefore it should be considered with changes in community composition and structure bužančić et al 2016 mcquatters gollop et al 2009 previous studies world wide have investigated the major factors that affect chlorophyll a distribution and the significant influence of seasonality was observed with phytoplankton along the northern bay of bengal jyothibabu et al 2018 the mississippi delta lane et

phytoplankton community identifying factors that control species diversity in a community is a key question in ecology sommer and worm 2002 stein et al 2014 our results showed significant correlations between alpha diversity indices and environmental distribution patterns table 5 suggesting that the variability of environmental descriptors affects phytoplankton diversity these finding showed deterministic processes governed the phytoplankton community in cumã bay and rainfall on the amazon coast was the main controlling factor for phytoplankton diversity and richness species diversity can enhance ecosystem productivity at higher levels of species richness cardinale et al 2012 korhonen et al 2011 tilman et al 2012 in cumã bay the high number of taxa identified 192 taxa contributed to a significant species richness and biological diversity thereby preserving the ecosystem integrity similar data were found in bays cavalcanti et al 2018 estuaries cavalcanti et al 2020 duarte dos santos et al 2017 and beaches matos et al 2016a matos et al 2016b governed by macrotides along the northern amazon coast diatoms were the dominant phytoplankton group 80 found at all sampling sites and throughout the seasonal cycle recent meta analysis studies suggest that the interaction between estuarine and coastal environments function as diatom producing systems carstensen et al 2015 which are well adapted to environmental conditions and responsible for numerous ecosystem functions alexander et al 2015 malviya et al 2016 diatom dominance followed by dinoflagellates is consistent with studies on phytoplankton diversity in marine and coastal environments bužančić et al 2016 cavalcanti et al 2020 goes et al 2014 madhu et al 2006 olli et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 blooms of skeletonema costatum 10 39 16 17 10 5 cells l 1 recorded in rainy period march 2020 contributed to the maximum abundance and biomass in the rainy season and decreased the local diversity and richness s costatum is a common bloom forming diatom with long chains and small cells usually 10 μm shikata et al 2008 that has a preference for waters with higher freshwater influences such as a diatom adaptable that thrives in coastal waters globally and is most common at salinities between 14 and 28 carstensen et al 2015 typical estuarine phytoplankton s costatum was found as the most critical species responsible for higher dissimilarity among the seasons during this study the environmental conditions present in the dry period high wind intensity salinity and turbidity favored the predominance of thalassiosira subtilis a critical species which causes a dissimilarity in the community due to its higher abundance this dominance reflects the ability of this colonial diatom to associate with detrital and inorganic particles which is an ecological response to minimize stress by such conditions in turbulent and turbid environments kang et al 2019 verity et al 1998 shifts in diatom dominance and niche partitioning enhance resource use efficiency ye et al 2019 such as light and nutrient availability which is reflected in the good physiological state of phytoplankton cells these results demonstrate the importance of interspecific and nutritional relationships in ecosystem homeostasis and resilience the phytoplankton diversity h hb λ richness d and evenness j varied significantly p 0 05 among the seasons and the highest values were recorded during the dry season while the lowest values were recorded during the rainy season therefore the observed highest diversity during the dry season could be linked to the diverse species composition observed during this period combined with higher marine water intrusion that favors the co occurrence of a greater number of species moreover the advantageous environmental circumstances with an elevated nutrient level in water could have explained another reason for the higher diversity indices during this season as haque et al 2021 reported during the rainy season the highest freshwater discharge and the occurrence of diatom blooms led to a destabilization of the phytoplankton population structure which was reflected in the decrease in alpha diversity except for in the berger parker bp index which showed higher values due to the numerical importance of the most abundant species berger and parker 1970 according to francé et al 2021 environmental stress often decreases taxonomic diversity of affected communities by selecting only the most stress tolerant taxa in phytoplankton communities light and nutrient availability associated with hydrological dynamics frequently promote blooms of a few dominant species cozzoli et al 2017 stated that taxonomically rich and diverse phytoplankton communities are considered indicators of good environmental status the final selection of the most appropriated biodiversity metric that reflects the community ecological information was based on multivariate and comparative analyses including its sensitivity to environmental changes the menhinick d and shannon h indices were the most effective metrics to describe the pattern of species richness and diversity these two indices were also sensitive to environmental stress with significant fluctuations at spatiotemporal scales showing a more optimistic characterization of water quality in cumã bay similar studies in coastal systems corroborate that d is an efficient tool for the assessment of water quality because it shows changes across environmental gradients bužančić et al 2016 rombouts et al 2019 spatharis and tsirtsis 2010 similarly h was selected here because it is a commonly used diversity index that includes both richness and diversity traits and it is not significantly affected by rare species francé et al 2021 heip et al 1998 suggested that caution must be taken when interpreting indices based on estimates of the number of species in the community since these are biased however we are more interested in the overall state and the relative changes in the community structure the application of different and combined ecological metrics could be an efficient approach to better understand ecological changes for the implementation of phytoplankton monitoring which can reflect the true taxonomic diversity in the community 5 conclusions this study shows the importance of this tropical area and their influences in the land ocean boundary that could extend beyond the shelf edge influencing the marine biogeochemical cycles in the maranhão reentrances this was the first study to provide fundamental information on the phytoplankton species diversity biomass and the influence of physicochemical parameters of water on phytoplankton community we found that deterministic processes governed the phytoplankton communities in cumã bay among the environmental variables rainfall on the amazon coast along with wind speed salinity light availability and nutrients were the main controlling factors conducive to specific phytoplankton community as a result of these abiotic interactions it was possible to identify two functionally distinct zones the freshwater influence zone fiz and the marine influence zone miz the phytoplankton biomass and abundance reached the maximum in the rainy season with a decreasing gradient to the miz while the dry season showed a homogeneous distribution due to higher synergetic species interactions the metric diversity responded to environmental and biological shifts and menhinick and shannon indices were the most sensitive to environmental changes the phytoplankton community varied as a function of the seasonal cycle along the two zones highlighting the colonial diatoms s costatum and t subtilis as critical species thus these findings demonstrate the connectivity of phytoplankton diversity and hydrological conditions elucidating the relationship not yet described in brazilian amazon ecosystem in summary cumã bay revealed a high phytoplankton diversity good physiological status of the cells and chlorophyll a concentration as an indicator of good environmental status however further studies of phytoplankton and seasonal bloom monitoring will provide directions for the sustainable management of amazon coastal ecosystems using ecohydrology principles declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this

947,biodiversity maintenance is a main goal in ecology hence phytoplankton diversity and biomass were analyzed in a coastal bay cumã bay of the amazon macrotidal mangrove coast which has been designated as an international hotspot for conservation ramsar site with high biological productivity and diversity that provides crucial ecosystem services and elevated fish production an ecohydrology based approach was applied to identify the main factors that drive the patterns of phytoplankton diversity and biomass considering spatio temporal analyses of physical chemical and biological variables from may 2019 to june 2020 phytoplankton dynamics were investigated using multivariate analyses correlations and generalized additive models seven indices were tested to select the most efficient biodiversity metric the hydrological conditions of cumã bay were governed primarily by elevated precipitation and macrotidal dynamics resulting in two different functional zones based on environmental variability the freshwater influence zone and marine influence zone seasonally the maximum freshwater discharge low salinity and light availability promoted cell abundance and biomass increase with blooms of skeletonema costatum which reduced the taxonomic diversity of the community in the rainy season during the dry season turbid waters resulting from macrotidal dynamics and wind speed limited light penetration and phytoplankton photosynthesis leading to a higher uniformity in the species distribution shannon index was the most sensitive biodiversity metric to environmental changes this study found that deterministic processes governed the community which rainfall on the amazon coast along with wind speed salinity light availability and nutrients were the main controlling factors for phytoplankton diversity and richness keywords maranhão reentrances ecohydrology diversity hotspot phytoplankton generalized additive model chlorophyll a 1 introduction biodiversity is a key factor in ecology that is directly related to the regulation and functioning of ecosystems cardinale et al 2012 chalar 2009 and its maintenance and integrity at multiple scales is of great interest to the scientific community konar et al 2013 wilsey and potvin 2000 studies evaluating the factors influencing species diversity and richness in aquatic ecosystems have been a hot topic on ongoing ecological researchers in recent years due to declining biodiversity at the global level through anthropogenic effects on the goods and services that humans rely on that are provided by these ecosystems chai et al 2020 hooper et al 2012 knapp et al 2017 korhonen et al 2011 yang et al 2021 coastal environments are important aquatic ecosystems because they are highly productive and dynamic providing essential ecosystem services such as bioremediation food production nutrient cycling and recreational activities that aid in the maintenance of both marine life and humanity attrill

wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 several plankton species can coexist despite the limited resources for which they compete i e the paradox of plankton hutchinson 1961 however the essential factors and processes controlling biodiversity have not been clarified especially in coastal ecosystems subject to constant changes furthermore served as a crucial tool the traditional statistical analysis can

relaxing parametric assumptions liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 nonetheless the combination of traditional techniques and sophisticated models to explain the ecohydrological interactions still lacks study now in coastal systems wolanski and elliott 2015 cumã bay located on the northern amazon coast is known for its high productivity and biological diversity it is a spawning area and nursery for numerous species of fish shellfish and migratory birds due to its importance for conservation has been considered under the ramsar convention as an internationally important wetland hazin 2008 cumã bay provides relevant ecosystem services for the amazon coast however information based on ecosystem functionality is currently scarce in fact the challenges presented by the cumã bay represent a number of opportunities for the application of ecohydrological principles from an ecological point of view the interpretation of the effects of hydrological processes on biology is straightforward because mechanistic relationship can be hypothesized poff 1997 however this is different and more difficult in complex environments for example cumã bay which renders the interpretation of pressure effects on ecological functioning a challenge thus an application of multivariate analysis and additive models can solve this problem we hypothesized that hydrological seasonal changes in coastal ecosystems promote massive growth of phytoplankton which may lead to a reduction in overall biodiversity from this point our study combined traditional techniques and generalized additive model gam to evaluate the influence of environmental factors on phytoplankton diversity and biomass in the amazon coastal system cumã bay traditional techniques pca and correlations analysis were used to select the most appropriated biodiversity metric that reflects seasonal changes and gam was applied to determine the main environmental factors that drive phytoplankton diversity and biomass in an amazon macrotidal bay hence the present work is able to provide a new perspective to support conservation and management programs in amazon aquatic ecosystems 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and climatology the brazilian amazon coast also known as the amazon macrotidal mangrove coast amcc is located between the amapá and maranhão states and contains a complex mosaic of vitally important aquatic ecosystems sheltering bays islands estuaries nascimento et al 2013 it is characterized by complex hydrodynamic processes nittrouer and demaster 1996 and large volumes of river water solutes and particulate matter from the amazon and maranhão rivers araujo et al 2017 matos et al 2016a pereira et al 2013 as well as dozens of other smaller estuaries that surround the maranhão coastline known as the maranhão reentrances maranhão reentrances was declared as ramsar site number 640 and based on its ecological and socio cultural importance the government of brazil declared the study area as wetland of international importance under the ramsar convention in the year 1993 hazin 2008 this large wetland features bays inlets and estuaries low and flat areas as well as extensive mangroves

pressures from fishing agriculture cassava and rice farming livestock cattle and buffalo breeding dam construction and domestic sewage discharge from the main urban centers as part of the maranhão reentrances cumã bay is the second largest water body on the western coast of maranhão with an area of approximately 205 72 km2 and a length of 33 92 km fig 1 this bay has semidiurnal macrotides tidal

the köppen classification the climate in the region is a tropical wet dry climate aw it is situated between the amazon super wet and semi arid northeastern brazil and has as high temperatures 26 c and average precipitation of 2 000 mm throughout the year cutrim et al 2019 the total precipitation in 2019 2 753 mm and 2020 2 708 mm followed the trend of the historical annual average 2 200 mm based on the last 28 years and the climatological data showed two well defined seasonal periods the rainy season extends from january to july with the highest precipitation in march 2019 818 2 mm and the

baixada maranhense this region has a high diversity and covers 10 800 km2 with a seasonal flooding cycle that annually overflows and inundates the lowland components of the fluvial network resulting in the formation of temporary and permanent lakes almeida funo et al 2010 ibañez et al 2000 its discharge is marked by a seasonal cycle martins and oliveira 2011 the maximum flow rate 113 69 94 30 m3

strategy to analyze the spatiotemporal fluctuations of the phytoplankton community and environmental variables six surveys were conducted from may 2019 to june 2020 with a total of 60 collected samples n 60 the sampling period included the rainy may march and june and dry august october and december seasons at five sampling sites along the bay sampling was performed on the sub surface water as well as at a 2 m depth with a van dorn oceanographic bottle during the daytime ebb tide and the neap tide cumã bay was divided into two functional zones with spatial patterns of water quality physical and chemical variables during each season of either fig 1 i the freshwater influence zone fiz sites 1 to 2 depth 9 m and ii the marine influence zone miz sites 3 to 5 depth 12 17 m zone identification was based on cluster analysis following the approach of boyer et al 1997 boyer 2006 and varona cordeiro et al 2010 for coastal ecosystems to better understand and classify the bay into spatially distributed stations with similar water quality characteristics zones of similar influence zsi 2 3 physical and chemical variables and light limiting factors to physically characterize the cumã bay a conductivity temperature and depth ctd probe castway sontek inst co was used to measure salinity resolution 0 01 accuracy 0 1 temperature resolution 0 01 accuracy 0 05 c and pressure resolution 0 01 m accuracy 0 25 scale in situ by a vertical profile of the water column total dissolved solids tds ph and dissolved oxygen do concentrations were measured with a hanna multi parametric probe hi 9828 in order to evaluate the light limiting factors measurements of photosynthetically active radiation par were obtained using an underwater radiation quantum sensor li cor li 1500 water turbidity with a turbidity meter ms tecnopom tb 1000p and suspended particulate matter spm was determined according to gravimetric analysis as described by strickland and parsons 1972 water transparency was estimated based on secchi depth and the light extinction coefficient k from the formula described by poole and atkins 1929 water samples 350 500 ml were filtered through whatman gf f glass fiber filters 0 7 μm porosity and 47 mm diameter to determine dissolved inorganic nutrients the determination of ammonium ion nh3 followed the methodology described by koroleff 1983 the concentrations of nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 were based on strickland and parsons 1972 whereas orthophosphate po4 3 and silicate sio2 measurements were derived according to grasshoff et al 1983 the precision was 0 02 μmol for no3 0 02 μmol for no2 0 02 μmol for nh3 and 0 01 μmol for po4 3 the accuracy was 2 for po4 3 3 for no3 and no2 and 5 for nh3 2 4 phytoplankton community biomass and nutritional status phytoplankton in cumã bay were analyzed in terms of composition cell abundance biomass and diversity for biological analysis water samples 250 ml were collected from the sub surface and at 2 m depth and preserved with lugol s iodine solution at a final concentration of 1 in the laboratory identification and cell counts 20 200 μm cell size were performed using an inverted microscope zeiss axiovert 100 at 400 magnification following utermöhl s technique utermöhl 1958 the equation of villafañe and reid 1995 was applied to calculate the cell abundance cells l 1 phytoplankton were identified at the lowest taxonomic level and updated using the algaebase international database guiry and guiry 2020 chlorophyll a was used as a reliable proxy for total phytoplankton biomass water samples 150 350 ml were filtered through whatman gf f glass fiber filters 0 7 μm porosity and 47 mm diameter and to separate the microphytoplankton 20 μm from the nanophytoplankton 20 μm fraction chlorophyll a sub samples were passed through 20 μm mesh and then filtered pigment extraction was performed in 10 ml of 90 v v acetone in the dark at 18 c for 24 h and the fluorescence was measured both before and after acidification with 5 v v hcl using a turner designs trilogy laboratory fluorimeter parsons et al 1984 with the results expressed in mg m 3 the ratio of light absorption at 480 and 665 nm by 90 acetone extracts of phytoplankton pigments was used as proposed by heath et al 1990 as a potential indicator of the phytoplankton nutritional status ratio the optical density at 480 nm was used as an index of total carotenoid content strickland and parsons 1972 as a result the absorption ratio a480 a665 the 480 665 ratio was used as an index of the carotenoid chlorophyll a ratio values of 0 5 1 5 indicate a good physiological status of phytoplankton cells while those close to 2 reflect a potential nutrient limitation and ratios higher than 2 4 indicate severe nutritional depletion 2 5 estimation of diversity measures a number of the most commonly used diversity measures were used to estimate the phytoplankton diversity alpha diversity in terms of ecological information three aspects of diversity indices were considered including richness number of taxa s margalef index d and menhinick index d diversity shannon index h simpson index λ brillouin index hb and berger parker index bp and evenness index j table 1 2 6 data analysis 2 6 1 identification of environmental patterns and zones significant differences in physicochemical and biological variables were analyzed using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova with three factors season zsi and sampling depth after checking the normality and homogeneity of variances a non parametric analysis kruskal wallis test was used to test statistical differences for each variable considering p values of 0 05 as significant cluster analysis was used to aggregate sampling points and identify zones with similar water quality zsi using euclidean distance as a measure of distance and ward s method to construct the algorithm pielou 1984 based on a standardized data matrix in which the value was converted to a z value values in a standardized normal distribution 2 6 2 relationship between phytoplankton abundance and biomass to categorize the phytoplankton species the frequency of sampling sites where a species occurred was correlated with the abundance of each taxon and presented as an olmstead tukey diagram which classifies the species as dominant frequent occasional or rare based on sokal and rohlf 1994 criteria the relationship between phytoplankton biomass chlorophyll a content and abundance was analyzed using abundance biomass comparison abc curves which determine the level of disturbance in the phytoplankton community the w statistic was used which ranges from 1 dominance in abundance or disturbed community to 1 dominance in biomass or undisturbed community according to clarke 1990 and clarke and warwick 2001 2 6 3 selection of diversity indices and link with hydrological conditions biodiversity metrics that respond differently to hydrological conditions can be considered complementary rombouts et al 2019 hence we investigated the extent to which the selected biodiversity measures reflected changes in the environmental conditions and if these indices were interrelated a standardized principal component analysis pca was used to identify the spatial and seasonal patterns of the environmental variables and chlorophyll a subsequently the scores of the principal components which summarize the explanation of environmental variability were then correlated with diversity metrics to investigate how the phytoplankton diversity reflect changes in the environmental conditions of cumã bay linear pearson s correlations were calculated to assess the relationship between each pc and the phytoplankton diversity indices additionally to evaluate nonlinear interactions between environmental factors and phytoplankton biomass and diversity and critical species we used generalized additive models gams gams have several advantages in analyzing nonlinear and nonmonotonic relationships between a response variable and fitted predictors hastie and tibshirani 1986 and allow one response variable to be fitted by several predictors in additive models having the advantage of not requiring an a priori specification of functional relationships which is suitable for describing complex ecological interactions farias et al 2022 we modeled the response of phytoplankton biomass and diversity to the effect of main environmental variables salinity temperature spm par and nutrients using the gam function in the r package mgcv wood 2011 the estimated degrees of freedom edf indicate the degree of nonlinearity of the gams where values close to 1 implies a linear relationship and 1 implies a progressively higher order relationship xiong et al 2021 previously the draftsman plot from the spearman correlation was used for evaluating variable collinearity r2 0 6 multivariate statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics version 24 r software version 4 1 0 statistic software version 10 0 primer version 6 0 and canoco version 4 5 the interpolation maps were constructed by qgis software version 2 18 using the inverse distance weighting idw method 3 results 3 1 hydrological conditions spatial and seasonal fluctuations of physical and chemical variables in cumã bay were detected based on permanova

significantly different p 0 001 salinity in the bay ranged from 8 22 to 29 24 with a significant difference between seasonal and spatial variation p 0 05 the seasonal dynamics of the freshwater marine

functional zones and seasonal periods 3 2 phytoplankton biomass nutritional status and light limiting factors the distribution of chlorophyll a concentration along the bay showed a seasonal pattern fig 4 a with values significantly higher p 0 001 in the rainy season overall mean 13 81 6 53 mg m 3 than in the dry season overall mean 7 90 2 83 mg m 3 a spatial gradient 8 35 mg m 3 19 67 mg m 3 was identified with higher concentrations in the fiz even with no significant spatial difference p 0 05 from the average of the chlorophyll a fractions nanophytoplankton 20 µm was the dominant fraction with a contribution of 53 to 76 and was more representative in the fiz during both seasons fig 4c seasonality was not a significant factor in the phytoplankton nutritional state 480 665 ratio p 0 05 however a significant spatial gradient p 0 05 was observed with a minimum value in the miz 0 89 and maximum in the fiz 4 52 during the rainy season fig 4b a good physiological status of the phytoplankton cells was recorded with 73 of the data within to the reference limits 0 5 1 5 except in the p2 fiz during the rainy season which reached an average of 4 51 5 32 the lowest concentrations of spm 40 mg l 1 and turbidity 60 ntu were recorded on the sub surface water of the fiz during the rainy season which promoted a higher light availability par 1 000 µmol m 2 s 1 and water transparency secchi 0 6 m and consequently greater phytoplankton biomass fig 4d by contrast the dry season was characterized by turbid water with a higher light extinction coefficient k 3 and lower phytoplankton biomass 3 3 phytoplankton diversity between may 2019 and december 2020 192 taxa were identified in cumã bay distributed in six divisions bacillariophyta miozoa chrysophyta cyanobacteria euglenophyta and chlorophyta fig 5 diatoms were the most representative 82 29 158 taxa in both seasons and zones fiz miz with relative abundances ranging between 96 and 99 miozoa had the second highest contribution 8 33 16 taxa and relative abundance 3 while species of chrysophyta were observed exclusively during the rainy season out of 158 diatoms species identified 83 were centric where 40 showed ecological strategies of solitary and 43 formed chains while 75 were pennate including 60 solitaries and only 15 formed chains based on the seasonal variability of the community higher species richness 165 were observed in the rainy season whereby 29 48 taxa were classified as dominant abundance 2 5 10 5 cells l 1 and frequency 16 9 and 58 96 taxa rare during the dry season of the 126 taxa recorded 28 36 taxa were dominant abundance 0 78 10 5 cells l 1 and frequency 19 1 and 55 69 taxa were rare the diatoms skeletonema costatum thalassiosira rotula thalassiosira subtilis and cyclotella litoralis were the most dominant species along the study period the significant increasing abundance in the rainy season is due to blooms of s costatum 10 39 16 17 10 5 cells l 1 in the fiz during march 2020 while t subitilis 0 47 0 51 10 5 cells l 1 showed an abundance increasing from fiz to miz during the dry season more details on species dominance are available in the supplementary material supplementary fig 1 cell abundance was associated with phytoplankton distribution in response to seasonal variability of the environmental variables in the bay the minimum abundance was recorded in the dry season overall mean 3 06 1 08 10 5 cells l 1 with a significant increase in the rainy season overall mean 14 13 15 77 10 5 cells l 1 spatially a decreasing gradient was observed from the fiz to the miz particularly in the rainy season table 3 the alpha diversity also reflected a seasonal pattern with space time changes but showed only significant differences between seasons p 0 05 the phytoplankton richness was assessed using margalef d and menhinick d indices while evenness was based on the pielou j index and both showed higher means in the dry season especially in the fiz 4 87 0 72 2 47 0 52 and 0 60 0 12 respectively indicating higher homogeneity of the phytoplankton distribution in this period in addition higher fluctuations were recorded during the rainy season table 3 the diversity indices shannon h brillouin hb and simpson λ showed similar distributions with higher means in the inner part of the bay fiz during the dry season 2 59 0 28 bits cell 1 2 25 0 19 and 0 88 0 05 respectively which implies in higher diversity in this period however the berger parker bp index exhibited the opposite behavior with a higher mean in the outer part of the bay miz during the rainy season 0 52 0 32 in response to the greatest contribution of the dominant species table 3 the level of disturbance in the phytoplankton community was indicated by abc curves which the w index indicated a pronounced disturbed condition during the rainy season w 0 285 and more elevated k dominance curves denoting lower diversity in contrast k dominance curves did not show a marked difference during the dry season indicating a tendency toward a lower stressed environment w 0 005 blooms of the opportunistic species s costatum were the main factors responsible for the disturbance level in the period of higher precipitation abc curve plot and cell abundance of the s costatum are provided as supplementary fig 2 3 4 inter relationships among phytoplankton diversity metrics from the correlation analysis using seven indices widely used to measure alpha diversity strong correlations among diversity measures were found table 4 for the richness metrics the margalef index d and taxa number s were highly and positively correlated r 0 91 while the menhinick index d was correlated with cell abundance r 0 66 for the dominance group shannon h simpson λ and brillouin hb were strongly correlated r 0 97 between categories d was highly and positively correlated r 0 90 to h λ and hb indices suggesting that these metrics carry similar ecological information the pielou j index was significantly related to berger parker bp r 0 92 but presented a negative relationship in addition regression coefficients between richness and h and hb were significantly higher in comparison to evenness indicating a greater effect of the taxa number under the diversity measurements and that the λ and bp variations were primarily caused by relative abundance 3 5 environmental conditions as driving factors of phytoplankton biomass and diversity principal component analysis pca investigated the relationships among environmental descriptors hydrological and meteorological variables and ordination of the sampling sites for rainy and dry seasons in cumã bay supplementary fig 3 the pca applied for investigating the relationship among the hydrological data and chlorophyll a from the rainy season summarized 51 47 of the total variation in the first two axes the pc1 axis explains 47 28 and related rainfall temperature spm and no3 negatively to wind salinity do and ph that confirms that the highest freshwater influence increases spm concentrations and water temperature and decreases salinity and do the pc2 17 70 axis suggests that high chlorophyll a values are related to low po4 3 and sio2 concentrations a contrary scenario was observed in the pca performed with abiotic data from the dry season with 62 30 of the total variation explained in the first two axes the pc1 axis accounted for 42 27 of the variance and related wind speed negatively to salinity rainfall ph do spm nh3 and po4 3 in response to greater marine influence into the bay the pc2 axis showing an additional 20 03 of the variance highlighted the positive correlation between nutrients sio2 no3 no2 and par we investigated the relationships of the pc with phytoplankton diversity to select the most efficient biodiversity measure for assessing environmental changes table 5 significant correlations were found mainly between pc1 and richness and diversity groups suggesting that fluctuations of the environmental descriptors regulate the pattern identified by the diversity indices d was the most effective metric for richness and best explained the environmental fluctuations r 0 83 p 0 000 while h best reflected the diversity and evenness of the environmental conditions in the bay r 0 86 p 0 000 this sensitivity shared by d and h in relation to changes in aquatic ecosystems corroborates the strong interrelationships previously detected in table 4 gams analysis evaluating the response of phytoplankton diversity and chlorophyll a to the combined effects of the main drivers environmental factors explained at least 59 of the total variance table 6 the predictor variables were salinity temperature par spm and the responses variables were shannon index h critical species skeletonema costatum and thalassiosira subtilis and chlorophyll a for four gams respectively fig 6 the gam explained 84 8 of the variance in diversity phytoplankton the most significant predictor variables for phytoplankton diversity were salinity f 14 78 p 0 0001 spm f 10 12 p 0 0001 and temperature f 5 92 p 0 0001 where increases in salinity concentrations of spm up to 100 mg l 1 and temperature around 32 c induced positive effects on phytoplankton diversity the gam explained 80 9 and 59 1 of the deviance for s costatum and t subtilis respectively the most significant drivers for s costatum were salinity f 23 55 p 0 0001 spm f 11 14 p 0 0001 and par f 10 27 p 0 0001 blooms of s costatum occurred when salinity ranged between 10 to 25 and spm and par reached values up to 100 mg l 1 and 500 µmol m 2 s 1 respectively t subtilis were influenced mainly by salinity f 15 58 p 0 0001 and par f 3 77 p 0 004 with significant and positive non linear correlations while spm fluctuations implied a linear relationship f 3 76 p 0 05 but values up to 100 mg l 1 promoted an increase of t subtilis abundance gam results showed the response of phytoplankton biomass chlorophyll a to salinity f 4 53 p 0 0003 temperature f 4 33 p 0 001 and par f 5 53 p 0 023 with a combined explanation of 67 3 the highest chlorophyll a concentrations were observed at salinity around 10 under light availability 500 µmol m 2 s 1 and temperature values ranging between 30 c and 32 c thus salinity par and spm were the main predictors for all biological variables investigated phytoplankton diversity chlorophyll a critical species 4 discussion 4 1 seasonality as a controlling factor for phytoplankton dynamics cumã bay a wetland of international importance ramsar site is inserted in the latitudinal band which contains the world s wettest region and is characterized by high influence of macrotides 4 m associated with a high freshwater contribution pericumã itapetininga guarapiranga peri açu and seribeira rivers in marine ecosystems such as bays and estuaries the spatiotemporal variations of biological processes phytoplankton biomass are associated with physical factors such as tidal cycle solar energy input fluvial input dilution wind intensity and vertical mixing of the water column cloern 1996 wirtz and wiltshire 2005 yin et al 2004 the seasonality of the water balance rainfall and river flow and the variability of environmental descriptors and nutrients subjected to the macrotidal regime controls the patterns of biomass and phytoplankton diversity in this tropical area and produce accentuated gradients environmental broecker 1998 confirms that the water cycle among the land sea and atmosphere in the tropics is the main driving engine for ocean circulation of heat salt and water vapor freshwater cycle is an important external factor that controls nutrient inputs fertilizer runoff and organic matter from urban margins gameiro et al 2007 thompson et al 2015 the rainfall distribution along the maranhão coast was similar to the historical annual average last 28 years with higher than average volumes in the first four months of the year the high rainfall in maranhão 2 300 mm located on the amazon coast changed the hydrological conditions of the bay increasing the flow rate of its main contributors and nutrient inputs and decreasing salinity spm and water turbidity which favored phytoplankton growth an ecohydrologic conceptual diagram showing the relationships between phytoplankton biomass abundance and diversity the main hydrological variables physical conditions and anthropogenic processes are summarized in fig 7 increased precipitation from january to june is a consequence of the intertropical convergence zone itcz which is the controlling mechanism of the meteorological variables in northern and northeastern brazil araujo et al 2017 fu et al 2001 in response to the lower rainfall contribution negative water balance during the rest of the year greater wind intensity and marine water intrusion are determining factors for the dynamics of the environmental santos et al 2020 and biological descriptors cavalcanti et al 2020 seasonal variability in cumã bay directly influenced the dynamics and diversity of primary producers therefore our results corroborate the use of phytoplankton as an efficient indicator of water quality and ecological changes as they are sensitive to environmental stressors and respond quickly to changes in the water column cabrita 2014 lemley et al 2017 paerl et al 2007 santana et al 2018 4 2 phytoplankton biomass and environmental conditions two functional zones were identified in both seasonal periods freshwater and marine influence zones this zonation of the bay reflects its spatial heterogeneity the strong effect of external factors acting in bays and estuaries freshwater and marine water entering and local climatic conditions goes et al 2014 varona cordero et al 2010 influencing the photosynthetic process and phytoplankton abundance based on the fluctuations of thermohaline variables a river plume originating from the tributaries of cumã bay extended into the superficial layer of the inner zone of the bay fiz which has a greater positive water balance high freshwater input less salinity 18 and warmer water 31 c than the adjacent zone miz during the period of negative water balance dry season the macrotidal effects overlap with the flow rate of the main tributaries along the bay resulting in a higher intrusion of marine water salinity 22 temperature 32 c the variation of the thermohaline structure has been discussed with regard to two bays on the north amazon coast são marcos cavalcanti et al 2018 lefèvre et al 2017 and são josé santos et al 2020 both of which showed similar patterns to those of cumã bay these outcomes confirm the typical dynamics of the equatorial coastal zone which is influenced by local water balance with relevant fluvial contributions in the rainy season and intrusion of the coastal water mass in the dry season this seasonal variability directly influenced the phytoplankton community since salinity and nutrients are the main factors affecting phytoplankton distribution biochemistry and control in coastal systems brand 1984 papry et al 2020 and they are unique hydrological aspects because they are markers of freshwater influx into coastal ecosystems lancelot and muylaert 2011 phosphorus concentration significantly influences phytoplankton behavior because it is an essential macronutrient for these species jin et al 2021 contributing 0 87 of the phytoplankton cell dry weight redfield 1958 and participating in metabolism nucleic acid replication and cellular constitution pasek et al 2015 reed et al 2016 land uses may directly influence n and p delivery to coastal waters and concentrations of total n and p and biomass chlorophyll a are often higher within the inner zones of coastal areas thereby affecting phytoplankton composition our findings confirmed the ecological importance of salinity light and nutrients on chlorophyll a distribution mainly on spatial and seasonal scales fig 4a since multivariate analyses and generalized additive models showed significant correlations with freshwater input and marine water influence the higher extension of the river plume in the rainy season reduces salinity promoting a favorable condition for the significant increase in phytoplankton biomass azhikodan and yokoyama 2016 cabral et al 2020 howarth et al 2000 leach et al 2018 higher light availability in the water column in this season also contributed for phytoplankton growth and it is a result of the lower values of water turbidity spm and light extinction coefficient that favored light penetration par and water transparency this scenario resulted in a greater depth of the photic layer which promoted a necessary condition for phytoplankton growth in terms of abundance and biomass fig 7 in contrast during the months in which the wind speed was intensified and precipitation was scarce dry season higher salinity and spm concentrations reduced the light penetration in the water column and consequently limited phytoplankton growth the increased spm load into the bay and higher water turbidity are likely the result of the higher wind speed associated with greater permanence of coastal waters in the bay which causes resuspension of the previously deposited material and or erosion of the margins dias et al 2016 santos et al 2020 vale and sundby 1987 which is intensified by tidal flux in macrotidal systems wolanski and spagnol 2003 yellen et al 2017 the average chlorophyll a concentration recorded in the present study 10 85 5 80 mg m 3 was typical of coastal ecosystems with anthropogenic effects such as domestic and industrial pollutants smith et al 1999 in addition the nutritional state assessed by the 480 665 ratio did not identify phytoplankton cells under nutritional depletion values 2 0 indicating a good physiological status heath et al 1990 chlorophyll is commonly used as a proxy for water quality because it provides consistent insights on eutrophication therefore it should be considered with changes in community composition and structure bužančić et al 2016 mcquatters gollop et al 2009 previous studies world wide have investigated the major factors that affect chlorophyll a distribution and the significant influence of seasonality was observed with phytoplankton along the northern bay of bengal jyothibabu et al 2018 the mississippi delta lane et al 2007 the southern north sea van der hout et al 2017 the brazilian coastal bays cabral et al 2020 cavalcanti et al 2018 and the amazon river plume goes et al 2014 4 3 ecological status of the phytoplankton community identifying factors that control species diversity in a community is a key question in ecology sommer and worm 2002 stein et al 2014 our results showed significant correlations between alpha diversity indices and environmental distribution patterns table 5 suggesting that the variability of environmental descriptors affects phytoplankton diversity these finding showed deterministic processes governed the phytoplankton community in cumã bay and rainfall on the amazon coast was the main controlling factor for phytoplankton diversity and richness species diversity can enhance ecosystem productivity at higher levels of species richness cardinale et al 2012 korhonen et al 2011 tilman et al 2012 in cumã bay the high number of taxa identified 192 taxa contributed to a significant species richness and biological diversity thereby preserving the ecosystem integrity similar data were found in bays cavalcanti et al 2018 estuaries cavalcanti et al 2020 duarte dos santos et al 2017 and beaches matos et al 2016a matos et al 2016b governed by macrotides along the northern amazon coast diatoms were the dominant phytoplankton group 80 found at all sampling sites and throughout the seasonal cycle recent meta analysis studies suggest that the interaction between estuarine and coastal environments function as diatom producing systems carstensen et al 2015 which are well adapted to environmental conditions and responsible for numerous ecosystem functions alexander et al 2015 malviya et al 2016 diatom dominance followed by dinoflagellates is consistent with studies on phytoplankton diversity in marine and coastal environments bužančić et al 2016 cavalcanti et al 2020 goes et al 2014 madhu et al 2006 olli et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 blooms of skeletonema costatum 10 39 16 17 10 5 cells l 1 recorded in rainy period march 2020 contributed to the maximum abundance and biomass in the rainy season and decreased the local diversity and richness s costatum is a common bloom forming diatom with long chains and small cells usually 10 μm shikata et al 2008 that has a preference for waters with higher freshwater influences such as a diatom adaptable that thrives in coastal waters globally and is most common at salinities between 14 and 28 carstensen et al 2015 typical estuarine phytoplankton s costatum was found as the most critical species responsible for higher dissimilarity among the seasons during this study the environmental conditions present in the dry period high wind intensity salinity and turbidity favored the predominance of thalassiosira subtilis a critical species which causes a dissimilarity in the community due to its higher abundance this dominance reflects the ability of this colonial diatom to associate with detrital and inorganic particles which is an ecological response to minimize stress by such conditions in turbulent and turbid environments kang et al 2019 verity et al 1998 shifts in diatom dominance and niche partitioning enhance resource use efficiency ye et al 2019 such as light and nutrient availability which is reflected in the good physiological state of phytoplankton cells these results demonstrate the importance of interspecific and nutritional relationships in ecosystem homeostasis and resilience the phytoplankton diversity h hb λ richness d and evenness j varied significantly p 0 05 among the seasons and the highest values were recorded during the dry season while the lowest values were recorded during the rainy season therefore the observed highest diversity during the dry season could be linked to the diverse species composition observed during this period combined with higher marine water intrusion that favors the co occurrence of a greater number of species moreover the advantageous environmental circumstances with an elevated nutrient level in water could have explained another reason for the higher diversity indices during this season as haque et al 2021 reported during the rainy season the highest freshwater discharge and the occurrence of diatom blooms led to a destabilization of the phytoplankton population structure which was reflected in the decrease in alpha diversity except for in the berger parker bp index which showed higher values due to the numerical importance of the most abundant species berger and parker 1970 according to francé et al 2021 environmental stress often decreases taxonomic diversity of affected communities by selecting only the most stress tolerant taxa in phytoplankton communities light and nutrient availability associated with hydrological dynamics frequently promote blooms of a few dominant species cozzoli et al 2017 stated that taxonomically rich and diverse phytoplankton communities are considered indicators of good environmental status the final selection of the most appropriated biodiversity metric that reflects the community ecological information was based on multivariate and comparative analyses including its sensitivity to environmental changes the menhinick d and shannon h indices were the most effective metrics to describe the pattern of species richness and diversity these two indices were also sensitive to environmental stress with significant fluctuations at spatiotemporal scales showing a more optimistic characterization of water quality in cumã bay similar studies in coastal systems corroborate that d is an efficient tool for the assessment of water quality because it shows changes across environmental gradients bužančić et al 2016 rombouts et al 2019 spatharis and tsirtsis 2010 similarly h was selected here because it is a commonly used diversity index that includes both richness and diversity traits and it is not significantly affected by rare species francé et al 2021 heip et al 1998 suggested that caution must be taken when interpreting indices based on estimates of the number of species in the community since these are biased however we are more interested in the overall state and the relative changes in the community structure the application of different and combined ecological metrics could be an efficient approach to better understand ecological changes for the implementation of phytoplankton monitoring which can reflect the true taxonomic diversity in the community 5 conclusions this study shows the importance of this tropical area and their influences in the land ocean boundary that could extend beyond the shelf edge influencing the marine biogeochemical cycles in the maranhão reentrances this was the first study to provide fundamental information on the phytoplankton species diversity biomass and the influence of physicochemical parameters of water on phytoplankton community we found that deterministic processes governed the phytoplankton communities in cumã bay among the environmental variables rainfall on the amazon coast along with wind speed salinity light availability and nutrients were the main controlling factors conducive to specific phytoplankton community as a result of these abiotic interactions it was possible to identify two functionally distinct zones the freshwater influence zone fiz and the marine influence zone miz the phytoplankton biomass and abundance reached the maximum in the rainy season with a decreasing gradient to the miz while the dry season showed a homogeneous distribution due to higher synergetic species interactions the metric diversity responded to environmental and biological shifts and menhinick and shannon indices were the most sensitive to environmental changes the phytoplankton community varied as a function of the seasonal cycle along the two zones highlighting the colonial diatoms s costatum and t subtilis as critical species thus these findings demonstrate the connectivity of phytoplankton diversity and hydrological conditions elucidating the relationship not yet described in brazilian amazon ecosystem in summary cumã bay revealed a high phytoplankton diversity good physiological status of the cells and chlorophyll a concentration as an indicator of good environmental status however further studies of phytoplankton and seasonal bloom monitoring will provide directions for the sustainable management of amazon coastal ecosystems using ecohydrology principles declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this

in the process of global change yu et al 2016 wetland soil is the main regulator of material conversion and energy flow in wetland ecosystem and is of great significance in maintaining cycle stability of nutrient elements huang and yuan 2021 as a unique ecotone between terrestrial and marine ecosystem coastal wetland is a highly dynamic complex and fragile system which has multifarious ecological functions and services xie et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 qiu et al 2019 he and cui 2015 previous studies mainly focused on the distribution characteristics and variation tendency of coastal soil nutrients which were influenced by myriad factors including climate change hydrological processes biological disturbances and anthropogenic interferences yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 abrar et al 2020 wang et al 2019 above first three factors affect the biogeochemical processes of soil nutrient elements in coastal wetland at large medium and small scales respectively and human factors are the foremost interference factors the bioturbation which is defined as the biological reworking of soils and sediments has been regarded as an important factor for soil processes and geomorphology meysman et al 2006 the benthic organisms distribute widely in coastal wetland and significantly impact the soil properties otani et al 2010 chen et al 2021 fiddler crab which is the dominant macroinvertebrate in coastal wetland has been aroused great concerns for its enormous numbers and significant bioturbation xiao et al 2019 li et al 2018 previous studies showed that fiddler crab was one of the major bioturbations affecting soil physical and chemical characteristics in coastal wetlands wang et al 2010 botto and iribarne 2000 botto et al 2005 the study in northern argentinean coast found that the movement of fiddler crab could increase the penetrability of surface soil which led the change of sediment quality and bedload transport botto and iribarne 2000 in addition fiddler crab activities such as the creation and maintenance of burrow could increase soil surface area and change coastal wetland microtopography directly karlson et al 2007 moreover the depth of crab holes could range from a few centimeters to hundreds of centimeters and then constitute a complex carve system in coastal wetland smith et al 2009 fanjul et al 2015 these carve system could increase the connection of sediment water gas chen et al 2017 moore 2019 furthermore the fiddler crab could selectively migrate soil of different sizes from subsoil to surface wang et al 2010 thus a significant correlation of soil texture with hole depth and burrow morphology was observed chen et al 2017 as ecosystem engineers fiddler crabs and their moving and burrowing activities could not only make the structure of surface soil complicated kristensen 2008 accelerate the turnover rate of sediment wang et al 2010 botto et al 2005 change soil bulk density wolfrath 1992 but also increase soil moisture content and alter pore water salinity xiao et al 2019 wang et al 2010 chen et al 2017 besides above physical effects fiddler crab activities could also affect soil chemical processes the study in the eastern shore of virgina of spartina alterniflora wetland showed that the complex microtopography by fiddler crab was favorable to trap organic matter and particulate matter passively thomas and blum 2010 the crab hole became the centralized place where a series of chemical processes took place wilson et al 2012 sasaki et al 2009 the study of mangrove ecosystem in peninsular malaysia showed that the crab

et al 2019 the excretion of fiddler crab could increase effectively the available nutrients of nh4 n and no3 n which were greatly limited in coastal wetland ecosystem cheng et al 2020 therefore as the key participant of food chain fiddler crab could change soil physical and chemical processes significantly wilson et al 2012 mokhtari et al 2016 influence material circulation and energy flow of food chain mokhtari et al 2016 costa et al 2017 further magnify the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrient elements cheng et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 and transform the biogeochemical process of coastal wetland ecosystem ultimately costa et al 2017 as a typical coastal wetland along the pacific coast the yellow river delta wetland covers a large area of salt marsh in intertidal zone yu et al 2016 a

group the soil no3 n contents of tc were significantly higher than those of the other three wetland types p 0 05 the averaged soil no3 n contents of tc and sa in fc group were 89 79 and 167 70 higher than those in ck group p 0 05 respectively based on the correlation analysis a linear relationship was found in soil toc tn and tp contents in different wetland types fig 5 the toc and tn contents in different wetland types change synchronously the difference of r 2 value indicated that the linear fitting degree of toc and tn toc and tp tn and tp in ck group were better than fc group fig 5 the toc and tn contents in tpa and sa were higher than those in tc and ss obviously while the contents of tp were relatively stable in different types 3 3 effects of fiddler crab activities on soil ecological stoichiometry the averaged values of soil c n of ck group in tc tpa ss and sa were 12 28 19 79 21 94 and 22 49 respectively the soil c n in sa were significantly higher than those in tc and tpa p 0 05 fig 6 the averaged values of soil c n of tc tpa ss and sa in fc group were 13 13 24 03 22 07 and 24 45 respectively the c n values of tpa and sa in fc group were significantly higher than those in ck

similarly in fc group the n p values of tc tpa ss and sa were 1 45 1 40 0 79 and 0 96 respectively which were higher than those in ck group generally the variation tendency of c n and c p in four wetland types were greatly similar with the contents of toc while the tendency of n p was similar with the contents of tn fig 6 3 4 the analysis of soil nutrients concentration and ecological stoichiometry the multifactor analysis of variance results showed that the contents of soil tn nh4 n no3 n and n p were significantly correlated with wetland type fiddler crab activities and their

correlated with the proportion of clay while positively correlated with sand proportion in ck group in fc group the significantly negative correlation was found between nh4 n and soil ph p 0 05 between no3 n and soil ph and soil clay proportion p 0 05 while the relations of no3 n and soil salinity and sand proportion were significant positive p 0 05 the c n c p and n p were positively

and n p p 0 05 fig 7 while this relationship was not observed in ck group the principal component analysis pca was selected to analyze the response of soil nutrient elements to fiddler crab activities the analysis result showed that the pc1 was mainly mediated by toc tn and doc the pc2 was mainly mediated by c n and no3 n fig 8 the cumulative interpretation degree of the first two principal components to the overall data characteristics reached 72 25 except no3 n there was a positive correlation among all nutrient elements the obvious differences between ck group and fc group in the direction of pc1 were showed in fig 8 the nutrient element contents in fc group which was influenced by fiddler crab activities were higher than those in ck group the rda results showed that the axes 1 and axes 2 could explain 64 01 and 13 57 characteristics of the overall data in ck group respectively fig 9 a in axes 1 direction the main influence indicators were soil clay proportion sand proportion and mps except no3 n nutrient elements and their stoichiometric ratios were positively correlated with soil clay proportion in axes 2 direction the main influence indicators were soil ph and salinity the rda results in fc group showed that the axes 1 and axes 2 could explain 40 54 and 35 59 characteristics of the overall data respectively fig 9b in axes 1 direction the main influence indicators were soil ph soil salinity and soil sand proportion the indexes of nutrient elements related to carbon i e toc doc c n and c p were significantly positively correlated with soil ph the indexes of nutrient elements related to nitrogen i e tn nh4 n no3 n and n p were significantly positively correlated with soil salinity and sand proportion and significantly negatively correlated with soil ph therefore the differences of soil carbon and nitrogen contents mediated the main contradictory characteristics of axes 1 direction in axes 2 direction the main influence indicators were soil clay and silt proportion except tp and no3 n nutrient elements were significantly negative correlation with soil silt proportion the complete difference of the rda results between ck group and fc group fig 9 a b indicated that the soil nutrient contents and eco stoichiometric characteristics were greatly influenced by the function of bioturbation from fiddler crab especially carbon and nitrogen nutrients 4 discussion 4 1 responses of soil nutrients to fiddler crab activities in coastal wetlands of the yellow river delta as typical benthos which widely distributed in coastal wetland fiddler crab were importantly intermediate link in food web and played a key role in the process of nutrient elements transformation mokhtari et al 2016 our results showed that the contents of soil toc tn tp and available nutrients doc nh4 n and no3 n of different wetland types in ck and fc groups were different fig 4 the tn doc and nh4 n contents in fc group were higher than those in ck group generally fig 4 indicating that the crab activities were beneficial to soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation the similar results were found in mangrove wetland of zhanjiang and spartina alterniflora wetland of samborombom bay of southwest atlantic ocean fanjul et al 2015 cheng et al 2020 while the obvious differences of toc in sa and ss between fc group and ck group were not observed p 0 05 this might because the sampling site of sa and ss were in intertidal zone where the soil subjected to tidal erosion frequently leading to the spatial heterogeneity of nutrient elements by fiddler crab activities decreased in contrast the averaged toc and tn contents of tc in fc group were 140 32 and 134 83 higher than ck group respectively indicating that the effects of crab activities were extremely great in tc the significant difference of no3 n of sa and tc between fc group and ck group was found in the study fig 4 mainly because the tn and nh4 n were increased or anaerobic environment was created by the fiddler crab activity mokhtari et al 2016 fanjul et al 2011 in fc group the fiddler crab hole system in wetlands were conducive to nitrification process fanjul et al 2011 the difference of rda results between ck and fc group fig 9 indicated that the bioturbation from fiddler crab made the influencing factors of nutrient elements diversified especially carbon and nitrogen several ways for improvement of the som and soil available nutrients by fiddler crab activities in coastal wetlands were concluded and showed in fig 10 firstly the feeding process of crab was conducive to the detritus of plant residues which could accelerate the decomposition of bulk organic residues costa et al 2017 nomann and pennings 1998 secondly the excretion from crab could increase soil nutrients directly especially the available nutrients like nh4 n and no3 n botto et al 2005 costa et al 2017 li et al 2021 the previous studies showed that the excrement of fiddler crab could create a suitable habitat which serviced a variety of microorganism e g cyanobacteria alphaproteobacteria actinobacteria zilius et al 2020 gardner et al 1987 under the functions of feeding and metabolism of fiddler crab the conversion process of plants litter to organic detritus then to som and soil available nutrients ultimately was accelerated arajo jnior et al 2016 kawaida et al 2019 hsieh et al 2002 to agree with the opinion we observed that the ratios of som in different wetland types of fc group to ck group r som were more than 1 thirdly burrow activity could change the microtopography complicated which was conducive to the retention and accumulation of organic debris chen et al 2017 alvarez et al 2018 as well as nitrification process wang et al 2010 cheng et al 2020 above processes made the crab hole became an important place for nutrients conversion thus formed a huge amount of spot like nutrient concentration regions in intertidal zone fig 10 besides the fiddler crab activities the vegetable types and soil environment factors were also the main influence factors for nutrients difference in the wetlands of the yellow river delta the toc and tn contents of tpa in ck and fc group were higher than those of the three wetlands the results of multi anova also showed that wetland type had significant influence on soil toc and tn p 0 01 table 1 the main reasons were the vegetation functions for soil nutrients absorption and fixation as well as nutrient elements return zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 as a dominant species the yellow river delta phragmites australis occupied a large area of intertidal zoon the biomass of phragmites australis was much higher than those of others which resulted the soil toc and tn of tpa were higher than others because much more litters returned to soil liu et al 2010 the doc contents of sa in ck group and fc group were significantly higher than others p 0 01 fig 4 because of the high carbon accumulation capacity of spartina alterniflora zhang et al 2021 feng et al 2017 the soil toc and tn were significantly correlated with soil clay proportion p 0 01 fig 3 fig 7 there was no significant difference in soil tp content between the four natural wetlands p 0 05 while the contents of soil carbon and nitrogen in different wetlands varied greatly fig 4 and table 1 the difference of toc tn and tp in wetland soil mainly decided the mother material and vegetation the soil mother material of the study area was fluvial sediments which transported by the yellow river the most of carbon and nitrogen of sediment which deposited in study area were lost after long distance transportation by river resulting in the contents of soil carbon and nitrogen were very low while the phosphorus in sediment loss was relatively low because the chemical character of phosphorus was stable yu et al 2016 liang et al 2020 the redistribution of soil carbon and nitrogen were significantly affected by the absorption and decomposition of plant communities mou et al 2011 zhao et al 2015 li et al 2019 while the above functions for phosphorus redistribution was small because the soil phosphorus in the yellow river data was sufficient yu et al 2016 meng et al 2021 in additional soil tp in the yellow river delta wetland was mainly constituted by inorganic phosphorus 85 qu et al 2018 qu et al 2021 the source of sediment and the saline alkali environment of coastal wetland jointly determine the relatively stable content of soil tp in study area the significant difference between ck group and fc group from rda results indicated that fiddler crab activities were beneficial to soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation the previous study showed that soil clay particle was conducive to nutriment elements retention under tidal condition tahir and marschner 2017 therefore the nutrient elements were positively correlated with clay proportion except no3 n in ck group and fc group previous studies proved that the changed of soil ph was pervasive effects on various soil nitrogen conversion processes bergamasco et al 2019 liua et al 2020 the lower ph could stimulate the net nitrogen mineralization for saline alkali soil and the optimum ph of nitrification and denitrification were also close to the neutral ph value dahlgren 1994 hu et al 2021 therefore it might be extremely likely that the crab activities led to the decrease of soil ph which was conducive to the processes of soil nitrogen especially in tc tpa and ss the result of bioturbation could reduce the nitrogen limitation of coastal ecosystem therefore it could be concluded from our study that nutrient elements related to carbon i e toc doc c n and c p were mainly mediated by clay proportion and were insensitive for soil ph change while soil ph was a sensitive environment factors for nutrient elements related to nitrogen i e tn nh4 n no3 n and n p in coastal wetlands of the yellow river delta 4 2 response of soil ecological stoichiometry to fiddler crab activities ecological stoichiometric ratios are important indicators to measure soil nutrient composition and nutrient balance elser et al 2007 as a sensitive index of environment change c n can reflect the circulation of soil organic carbon and nitrogen huang and yuan 2021 the c p can be used to indicate the mineralization capacity of soil organic phosphorus wang et al 2019 n p can reflect the supply capacity and limiting level of soil nutrients abrar et al 2020 multi anova results showed that the soil c n c p and n p were significantly affected by fiddler crab activities in different wetlands p 0 05 table 1 the c n in ck group and fc group were 12 81 22 49 and 13 13 24 75 respectively which much lower than the optimal value 25 for som decomposition ye et al 2018 coonan et al 2020 indicating that the decomposition of som was quick and the nutrient accumulation was low in wetlands cao et al 2015 c n and c p in ck group was lower than that in fc group illustrated that fiddler crab activities were beneficial to the accumulation of som costa et al 2017 li et al 2021 as an essential nutrient element for plant growth and development nitrogen was an important limiting element which affecting the primary productivity of coastal wetland ecosystem yu et al 2016 cheng et al 2020 our results of n p between ck group 0 64 1 21 and fc group 0 79 1 45 fig 6 suggest that fiddler crab activities could promote the transformation rate of nitrogen and reduce the nitrogen limitation in ecosystem cheng et al 2020 especially in tc the variation tendency of c n in different wetland types were similar to that of toc fig 9 similarly the c p and n p were similar to that of toc and tn respectively fig 7 above regulations illustrated that the soil c n c p and n p were mainly mediated by the change of soil toc and tn in coastal wetlands zhang et al 2012 an et al 2021 5 conclusions in this study the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrient elements and their response of fiddler crab activities were evaluated in four typical coastal wetlands of ck and fc group in the yellow river delta the results showed that 1 the fiddler crab activities could improve the som and soil available nutrients of coastal wetlands in the yellow river delta 2 the bioturbation from fiddler crab made the influencing factors of nutrient elements diversified especially carbon and nitrogen nutrients 3 fiddler crab activities were conducive to the soil nutrients accumulation and could reduce the nitrogen limitation of coastal ecosystem 4 the soil nutrient elements related to

948,the four typical wetlands of phragmites australis wetland tpa tamarix chinensis wetland tc suaeda salsa wetland ss and spartina alterniflora wetland sa in the yellow river delta were selected to clarify the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients and their ecological stoichiometric characteristics under fiddler crab activities the results showed that soil particle size soil salinity and ph in

anova results showed that soil carbon and nitrogen were significantly influenced by fiddler crab activities and wetland types p 0 05 the pca and rda analysis results indicated that the bioturbation from fiddler crab made the influencing factors of nutrient elements diversified the fiddler crab activities were favorable to the soil nutrients accumulation and could reduce the nitrogen limitation of coastal ecosystem our results should be of importance to insight the biogeochemical process of soil nutrient elements differentiation by fiddler crab activities in coastal wetlands keywords coastal wetland soil nutrients eco stoichiometric characteristics fiddler crab activities 1 introduction as the source sink and converter of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus the wetland plays an important role in the process of global change yu et al 2016 wetland soil is the main regulator of material conversion and energy flow in wetland ecosystem and is of great significance in maintaining cycle stability of nutrient elements huang and yuan 2021 as a unique ecotone between terrestrial and marine ecosystem coastal wetland is a highly dynamic complex and fragile system which has multifarious ecological functions and services xie et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 qiu et al 2019 he and cui 2015 previous studies mainly focused on the distribution characteristics and variation tendency of coastal soil nutrients which were influenced by myriad factors including climate change hydrological processes biological disturbances and anthropogenic interferences yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 abrar et al 2020 wang et al 2019 above first three factors affect the biogeochemical processes of soil nutrient elements in coastal wetland at large medium and small scales respectively and human factors are the foremost interference factors the bioturbation which is defined as the biological reworking of soils and sediments has been regarded as an important factor for soil processes and geomorphology meysman et al 2006 the benthic organisms distribute widely in coastal wetland and significantly impact the soil properties otani et al 2010 chen et al 2021 fiddler crab which is the dominant macroinvertebrate in coastal wetland has been aroused great concerns for its enormous numbers and significant bioturbation xiao et al 2019 li et al 2018 previous studies showed that fiddler crab was one of the major bioturbations affecting soil physical and chemical characteristics in coastal wetlands wang et al 2010 botto and iribarne 2000 botto et al 2005 the study in northern argentinean coast found that the movement of fiddler crab could increase the penetrability of surface soil which led the change of sediment quality and bedload transport botto and iribarne 2000 in addition fiddler crab activities such as the creation and maintenance of burrow could increase soil surface area and change coastal wetland microtopography directly karlson et al 2007 moreover the depth of crab holes could range from a few centimeters to hundreds of centimeters and then constitute a complex carve system in coastal wetland smith et al 2009 fanjul et al 2015 these carve system could increase the connection of sediment water gas chen et al 2017 moore 2019 furthermore the fiddler crab could selectively migrate soil of different sizes from subsoil to surface wang et al 2010 thus a significant correlation of soil texture with hole depth and burrow morphology was observed chen et al 2017 as ecosystem engineers fiddler crabs and their moving and burrowing activities could not only make the structure of surface soil complicated kristensen 2008 accelerate the turnover rate of sediment wang et al 2010 botto et al 2005 change soil bulk density wolfrath 1992 but also increase soil moisture content and alter pore water salinity xiao et al 2019 wang et al 2010 chen et al 2017 besides above physical effects fiddler crab activities could also affect soil chemical processes the study in the eastern shore of virgina of spartina alterniflora wetland showed that the complex microtopography by fiddler crab was favorable to trap organic matter and particulate matter passively thomas and blum 2010 the crab hole became the centralized place where a series of chemical processes took place wilson et al 2012 sasaki et al 2009 the study of mangrove ecosystem in peninsular malaysia showed that the crab hole could extend subsoil redox environment significantly further influence the process of some aerobic anaerobic reactions e g soil aerobic respiration the reduction of iron sulfur nitrification and

et al 2019 the excretion of fiddler crab could increase effectively the available nutrients of nh4 n and no3 n which were greatly limited in coastal wetland ecosystem cheng et al 2020 therefore as the key participant of food chain fiddler crab could change soil physical and chemical processes significantly wilson et al 2012 mokhtari et al 2016 influence material circulation and energy flow of food chain mokhtari et al 2016 costa et al 2017 further magnify the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrient elements cheng et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 and transform the biogeochemical process of coastal wetland ecosystem ultimately costa et al 2017 as a typical coastal wetland along the pacific coast the yellow river delta wetland covers a large area of salt marsh in intertidal zone yu et al 2016 a

the analysis result showed that the pc1 was mainly mediated by toc tn and doc the pc2 was mainly mediated by c n and no3 n fig 8 the cumulative interpretation degree of the first two principal components to the overall data characteristics reached 72 25 except no3 n there was a positive correlation among all nutrient elements the obvious differences between ck group and fc group in the direction of pc1 were showed in fig 8 the nutrient element contents in fc group which was influenced by fiddler crab activities were higher than those in ck group the rda results showed that the axes 1 and axes 2 could explain 64 01 and 13 57 characteristics of the overall data in ck group respectively fig 9 a in axes 1 direction the main influence indicators were soil clay proportion sand proportion and mps except no3 n nutrient elements and their stoichiometric ratios were positively correlated with soil clay proportion in axes 2 direction the main influence indicators were soil ph and salinity the rda results in fc group showed that the axes 1 and axes 2 could explain 40 54 and 35 59 characteristics of the overall data respectively fig 9b in axes 1 direction the main influence indicators were soil ph soil salinity and soil sand proportion the indexes of nutrient elements related to carbon i e toc doc c n and c p were significantly positively correlated with soil ph the indexes of nutrient elements related to nitrogen i e tn nh4 n no3 n and n p were significantly positively correlated with soil salinity and sand proportion and significantly negatively correlated with soil ph therefore the differences of soil carbon and nitrogen contents mediated the main contradictory characteristics of axes 1 direction in axes 2 direction the main influence indicators were soil clay and silt proportion except tp and no3 n nutrient elements were significantly negative correlation with soil silt proportion the complete difference of the rda results between ck group and fc group fig 9 a b indicated that the soil nutrient contents and eco stoichiometric characteristics were greatly influenced by the function of bioturbation from fiddler crab especially carbon and nitrogen nutrients 4 discussion 4 1 responses of soil nutrients to fiddler crab activities in coastal wetlands of the yellow river delta as typical benthos which widely distributed in coastal wetland fiddler crab were importantly intermediate link in food web and played a key role in the process of nutrient elements transformation mokhtari et al 2016 our results showed that the contents of soil toc tn tp and available nutrients doc nh4 n and no3 n of different wetland types in ck and fc groups were different fig 4 the tn doc and nh4 n contents in fc group were higher than those in ck group generally fig 4 indicating that the crab activities were beneficial to soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation the similar results were found in mangrove wetland of zhanjiang and spartina alterniflora wetland of samborombom bay of southwest atlantic ocean fanjul et al 2015 cheng et al 2020 while the obvious differences of toc in sa and ss between fc group and ck group were not observed p 0 05 this might because the sampling site of sa and ss were in intertidal zone where the soil subjected to tidal erosion frequently leading to the spatial heterogeneity of nutrient elements by fiddler crab activities decreased in contrast the averaged toc and tn contents of tc in fc group were 140 32 and 134 83 higher than ck group respectively indicating that the effects of crab activities were extremely great in tc the significant difference of no3 n of sa and tc between fc group and ck group was found in the study fig 4 mainly because the tn and nh4 n were increased or anaerobic environment was created by the fiddler crab activity mokhtari et al 2016 fanjul et al 2011 in fc group the fiddler crab hole system in wetlands were conducive to nitrification process fanjul et al 2011 the difference of rda results between ck and fc group fig 9 indicated that the bioturbation from fiddler crab made the influencing factors of nutrient elements diversified especially carbon and nitrogen several ways for improvement of the som and soil available nutrients by fiddler crab activities in coastal wetlands were concluded and showed in fig 10 firstly the feeding process of crab was conducive to the detritus of plant residues which could accelerate the decomposition of bulk organic residues costa et al 2017 nomann and pennings 1998 secondly the excretion from crab could increase soil nutrients directly especially the available nutrients like nh4 n and no3 n botto et al 2005 costa et al 2017 li et al 2021 the previous studies showed that the excrement of fiddler crab could create a suitable habitat which serviced a variety of microorganism e g cyanobacteria alphaproteobacteria actinobacteria zilius et al 2020 gardner et al 1987 under the functions of feeding and metabolism of fiddler crab the conversion process of plants litter to organic detritus then to som and soil available nutrients ultimately was accelerated arajo jnior et al 2016 kawaida et al 2019 hsieh et al 2002 to agree with the opinion we observed that the ratios of som in different wetland types of fc group to ck group r som were more than 1 thirdly burrow activity could change the microtopography complicated which was conducive to the retention and accumulation of organic debris chen et al 2017 alvarez et al 2018 as well as nitrification process wang et al 2010 cheng et al 2020 above processes made the crab hole became an important place for nutrients conversion thus formed a huge amount of spot like nutrient concentration regions in intertidal zone fig 10 besides the fiddler crab activities the vegetable types and soil environment factors were also the main influence factors for nutrients difference in the wetlands of the yellow river delta the toc and tn contents of tpa in ck and fc group were higher than those of the three wetlands the results of multi anova also showed that wetland type had significant influence on soil toc and tn p 0 01 table 1 the main reasons were the vegetation functions for soil nutrients absorption and fixation as well as nutrient elements return zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 as a dominant species the yellow river delta phragmites australis occupied a large area of intertidal zoon the biomass of phragmites australis was much higher than those of others which resulted the soil toc and tn of tpa were higher than others because much more litters returned to soil liu et al 2010 the doc contents of sa in ck group and fc group were significantly higher than others p 0 01 fig 4 because of the high carbon accumulation capacity of spartina alterniflora zhang et al 2021 feng et al 2017 the soil toc and tn were significantly correlated with soil clay proportion p 0 01 fig 3 fig 7 there was no significant difference in soil tp content between the four natural wetlands p 0 05 while the contents of soil carbon and nitrogen in different wetlands varied greatly fig 4 and table 1 the difference of toc tn and tp in wetland soil mainly decided the mother material and vegetation the soil mother material of the study area was fluvial sediments which transported by the yellow river the most of carbon and nitrogen of sediment which deposited in study area were lost after long distance transportation by river resulting in the contents of soil carbon and nitrogen were very low while the phosphorus in sediment loss was relatively low because the chemical character of phosphorus was stable yu et al 2016 liang et al 2020 the redistribution of soil carbon and nitrogen were significantly affected by the absorption and decomposition of plant communities mou et al 2011 zhao et al 2015 li et al 2019 while the above functions for phosphorus redistribution was small because the soil phosphorus in the yellow river data was sufficient yu et al 2016 meng et al 2021 in additional soil tp in the yellow river delta wetland was mainly constituted by inorganic phosphorus 85 qu et al 2018 qu et al 2021 the source of sediment and the saline alkali environment of coastal wetland jointly determine the relatively stable content of soil tp in study area the significant difference between ck group and fc group from rda results indicated that fiddler crab activities were beneficial to soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation the previous study showed that soil clay particle was conducive to nutriment elements retention under tidal condition tahir and marschner 2017 therefore the nutrient elements were positively correlated with clay proportion except no3 n in ck group and fc group previous studies proved that the changed of soil ph was pervasive effects on various soil nitrogen conversion processes bergamasco et al 2019 liua et al 2020 the lower ph could stimulate the net nitrogen mineralization for saline alkali soil and the optimum ph of nitrification and denitrification were also close to the neutral ph value dahlgren 1994 hu et al 2021 therefore it might be extremely likely that the crab activities led to the decrease of soil ph which was conducive to the processes of soil nitrogen especially in tc tpa and ss the result of bioturbation could reduce the nitrogen limitation of coastal ecosystem therefore it could be concluded from our study that nutrient elements related to carbon i e toc doc c n and c p were mainly mediated by clay proportion and were insensitive for soil ph change while soil ph was a sensitive environment factors for nutrient elements related to nitrogen i e tn nh4 n no3 n and n p in coastal wetlands of the yellow river delta 4 2 response of soil ecological stoichiometry to fiddler crab activities ecological stoichiometric ratios are important indicators to measure soil nutrient composition and nutrient balance elser et al 2007 as a sensitive index of environment change c n can reflect the circulation of soil organic carbon and nitrogen huang and yuan 2021 the c p can be used to indicate the mineralization capacity of soil organic phosphorus wang et al 2019 n p can reflect the supply capacity and limiting level of soil nutrients abrar et al 2020 multi anova results showed that the soil c n c p and n p were significantly affected by fiddler crab activities in different wetlands p 0 05 table 1 the c n in ck group and fc group were 12 81 22 49 and 13 13 24 75 respectively which much lower than the optimal value 25 for som decomposition ye et al 2018 coonan et al 2020 indicating that the decomposition of som was quick and the nutrient accumulation was low in wetlands cao et al 2015 c n and c p in ck group was lower than that in fc group illustrated that fiddler crab activities were beneficial to the accumulation of som costa et al 2017 li et al 2021 as an essential nutrient element for plant growth and development nitrogen was an important limiting element which affecting the primary productivity of coastal wetland ecosystem yu et al 2016 cheng et al 2020 our results of n p between ck group 0 64 1 21 and fc group 0 79 1 45 fig 6 suggest that fiddler crab activities could promote the transformation rate of nitrogen and reduce the nitrogen limitation in ecosystem cheng et al 2020 especially in tc the variation tendency of c n in different wetland types were similar to that of toc fig 9 similarly the c p and n p were similar to that of toc and tn respectively fig 7 above regulations illustrated that the soil c n c p and n p were mainly mediated by the change of soil toc and tn in coastal wetlands zhang et al 2012 an et al 2021 5 conclusions in this study the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrient elements and their response of fiddler crab activities were evaluated in four typical coastal wetlands of ck and fc group in the yellow river delta the results showed that 1 the fiddler crab activities could improve the som and soil available nutrients of coastal wetlands in the yellow river delta 2 the bioturbation from fiddler crab made the influencing factors of nutrient elements diversified especially carbon and nitrogen nutrients 3 fiddler crab activities were conducive to the soil nutrients accumulation and could reduce the nitrogen limitation of coastal ecosystem 4 the soil nutrient elements related to

evaluating the impact of hydrological factors regulating the dynamics of phytoplankton communities and the influence of chemical parameters on phytoplankton growth in pearl river estuary pre during wet season april around 50 different species of phytoplankton were identified at 14 different sampling sites including 24 diatoms 9 dinoflagellates 10 green algae and 6 cyanobacterial species respectively the diatom melosira granulate was the dominant species at most of the sampling sites phytoplankton surveys during the dry season november showed bellerochea malleus and skeletonema costatum species as dominant at most of the sampling locations silicate sio3 distribution was one of the reason for the abundance of diatoms in west shoal sites the concentration of nutrients and hydrological factors like water depth and salinity strongly supported phytoplankton growth in addition pre west and middle shoal sites showed evidence of rich phytoplankton diversity when compared to east shoal and channel sites the non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis and cluster grouping analysis demonstrated the uniqueness of plankton species diversity at pre west and east shoal sites the results of canonical correspondence analysis cca suggested that diversity of phytoplankton communities was significantly influenced by environmental factors such as salinity depth and sio3

important role in maintaining healthy marine ecosystems the peculiar hydrodynamic conditions of estuaries create high concentrations of suspended sediments contaminant flushing and dredging which establishes the most productive and fertile environment for primary producers phytoplankton by providing enriched landmass nutrients through river discharge qi et al 2019 lakshmikandan et al 2021 xu et al 2021 since the complex physical and biogeochemical interactions of estuaries makes it difficult to determine the phytoplankton diversity and regulating factors however determination of essential nutrients ratio and hydrological factors provides an opportunity to assess or predict the dynamics of phytoplankton communities in ecosystem several reports suggested that essential nutrients like ammonium nh4 nitrites no2 nitrates no3 phosphate po4 and silicate sio3 act as a crucial influencer for phytoplankton diversity li et al 2017 lu and gan 2015 niu et al 2020 the relationship between nutrients limitation such as phosphorus li et al 2017 nitrogen nixon et al 1996 and iron del amo et al 1997 with estuarine geomorphology results in the variation pattern of phytoplankton distribution in addition some in vitro studies evidenced that small quantity 0 0034 1 370 mm of sio3 combination with essential nutrients have encouraged the phytoplankton growth wu and chou 2003 above all variations in salinity impacts the phytoplankton distribution growth and species compositions by affecting their photosynthesis and respiration process d ors et al 2016 lakshmikandan et al 2020 li 2019 muylaert et al 2009 the complex marine environment and essential nutrients discharge still requires better knowledge to understand the regulating factors of phytoplankton community composition in estuarine ecosystems in last two decades rapid development of economic zones excessive utilization of agricultural fertilizers aquaculture and industrial wastewater discharge were causing serious threats to estuaries and marine ecosystems by eutrophication and red tides situation chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 yi et al 2018 the pearl river is china s third longest river with 453 700 km drainage area subjected to intense nutrients discharge by various anthropogenic activity wang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the strong interactions between ocean tides coastal water and river water outflow of pearl river estuarine pre plays a crucial role in phytoplankton behavior and diversity gan et al 2014 niu et al 2020 recent studies indicated that concentration of nitrate was elevated to extreme level while phosphates were recorded very low in estuarine and coastal plume xu et al 2008 yin et al 2011 the ineffective ecosystem management strategies and substantial increase of anthropogenic activity in pre may lead to eutrophication and red tides situation in marine ecosystems therefore understanding the phytoplankton growth species diversity dominancy and their regulating factors are the major keys to preserve the fundamental food chain in the marine ecosystem gao and song 2005 since our knowledge of phytoplankton behavior and diversity in response to hydrological factors combined with anthropogenic organic inorganic pollutants are limited hence short term monitoring was performed in order to explore the existence of essential nutrients limiting enriched conditions driving on phytoplankton community composition in pre the study was mainly designed to determine the impact of hydrological parameters like salinity ph temperature depth transparency and chemical parameters such as nh4 no2 dissolved inorganic nitrogen dip dissolved inorganic phosphorous dip and sio3 on phytoplankton community composition for healthy pre ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling location and collection the pre surface and bottom water samples were collected from 14 different locations on april and november 2020 sampling sites fig 1 were selected based on river distribution locations around nine samples were collected from west shoal s1 s4 s6 s8 s10 s12 one from east shoal s5 two from middle shoal s13 s14 and east channel s7 s9 respectively both surface and bottom samples were collected from the sampling sites except west shoal sampling sites which were having less than 8 meters depth so bottom sampling was avoided samples were collected in sterile 500 ml transparent labeled polypropylene tube for nutrient analysis nh4 no2 din dip sio3 and were stored at 4 c simultaneously sampling sites depth transparency ph temperature dissolved oxygen and salinity were measured using in situ instruments the concentrations of chlorophyll a chl a analysis were performed by using 2 µm 20 mm nylon membrane to filter serially 500 ml then membrane was shaded and were stored in liquid nitrogen for phytoplankton determination water samples were collected in sterile 1l dark bottles and were fixed with buffered formaldehyde solution at final concentration of 2 5 and were stored in dark condition 2 2 analysis of samples the cell counting and identification of phytoplankton species were followed by sedimentation method using an olympus gx53 inverted microscope 400 the identification of phytoplankton taxonomy was done by following jin et al 1965 the concentrations of nutrients nh4 no2 din dip sio3 were determined by using technicon aa3 auto analyzer bran luebbe liquid nitrogen stored filtered membranes were extracted with 90 acetone to evaluate chl a concentration by using laboratory fluorometer 2 3 statistical analysis of environmental factors the phytoplankton community structure in different sampling locations and habitat was determined by non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds applying bray curtis distance using the vegan community ecology package different species with 14 different locations were analyzed in nmds on metamds function to achieve considerable robust stress value 0 2 the environmental factors impact and dominating relationships between different variables were indicated by performing canonical correspondence analysis cca additionally hierarchical cluster analysis hca and heatmap were conducted to evaluate the physiochemical distance between different sampling sites and phytoplankton diversity all the above statistical analyses were performed by using r version 4 0 2 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological parameters and chlorophyll a the phytoplankton species richness in estuaries was mainly determined by crucial hydrological parameters like water temperature ph dissolved oxygen and salinity they directly reflect the modification or damage of two different ecosystems phytoplankton diversity the surface and bottom water ph 7 0 7 7 and seasonal thermocline 23 26 c of pre sampling locations showed no significant changes from upper to lower sites fig 2 dissolved oxygen of pre indicated gradual increase from upper to lower estuary sampling sites and most of the bottom test samplings evidenced increased concentration when compared to surface water samples since extensive organic waste and sewage discharge benthic community oxygen demand decomposition of organic matters are main factors causing oxygen depletion in upper estuary sites of pre harrison et al 2008 pakulski et al 2000 the strong flow of ocean currents in east channel s9 3 7 and 10 6 ppt and middle shoal sampling sites recorded maximum surface and bottom salinity however this physical process completely depends on seasonality and dominance of freshwater outflow lu and gan 2015 since the water transparency acts as an important factor in encouraging phytoplankton growth and species diversity of ecosystem the pre sampling locations evidenced variation of chl a concentration limitation of light source and high depth of east channel sampling sites recorded reduced concentration of chl a fig s1 supplementary data maximum chl a concentration was observed at s4 6 8 µg l 1 of pre and also most of the west and middle shoal sites showed higher concentration when compared to other locations the light dependent reaction process and strong water currents required for exchange of essential nutrients have directly impacted on total chl a concentration of pre sampling locations burford and rothlisberg 1999 ho et al 2010 when compared with previous years chl a recorded results of pre niu et al 2020 our findings showed significant increase in lower sampling locations in both wet and dry seasons 3 2 variations of chemical parameters the intense nitrification and denitrification process in estuaries occurred due to increasing anthropogenic activities in stream banks by discharging organic and inorganic pollutants in biogeochemical cycles of ocean and estuaries nh4 plays an important role in nitrification process and is the major material source for phytoplankton growth the present study indicated that maximum concentration of nh4 was recorded at west 0 17 0 31 mg l 1 and east 0 15 0 28 mg l 1 shoal fig 3 locations in dry seasonal samplings similarly high concentrations of no2 were observed in dry seasonal samplings of east 0 04 0 16 mg l 1 and west 0 15 0 18 mg l 1 shoal sites in addition dry seasonal recorded results evidenced significant increase of no2 concentration when compared to wet seasonal report in east 70 6 and west 16 7 shoal sampling locations of the pre during the wet season no2 distributions were reflected by strong water current with average annual rainfall and mixing of riverine no2 of the pre moreover dry seasonal significant increase of no2 is mainly generated by bacterial mediated oxidation of nh4 within the water column morris et al 1985 the high concentration of din and dip fig 4 distributions were observed in west shoal locations on wet seasonal samplings of the pre this seasonal variation of din and dip concentrations were mainly driven by effluent discharge and river dilution ratio most of the phosphorus were dissolved and became particulate matters due to short flushing time 3 days of the pre morris 1990 dry seasonal conditions were suitable for effective phosphorus recycling process in the water columns two seasonal samplings recorded intense sio3 discharge in west and middle shoal locations of the pre most of the surface samplings fig 5 exhibits high concentration of sio3 when compared to bottom samplings the present study on distribution of sio3 and din indicated significant association with salinity pattern which is distinctly correlated with freshwater discharge of pre li et al 2017 the dendrogram of cluster analysis grouped wet and dry seasonal sampling sites into two major cluster groups based on all chemical parameters of pre fig s2 supplementary data in wet season eight sampling sites including all east shoal and channel sampling sites two west s4 and s6 and one middle shoal s12 sites were closely grouped in the cluster the second cluster group holds most of the west and middle shoal sampling sites in contrast to wet season most of the sampling sites were closely grouped in dry seasonal cluster analysis except s8 and s14 the cluster analysis significantly evidenced uniqueness of west and east shoal locations hydrodynamic activities and nutrient distributions which directly impacted on phytoplankton growth variation chl a of the pre 3 3 distribution and community composition of phytoplankton around 50 different phytoplankton species were identified at pre sampling locations in wet seasonal samplings and among them diatoms 24 species were more dominant group the chain forming diatom melosira granulata mg was predominantly found in all sampling sites and contributed approximately to 88 of all diatom species this dominating nature of chain forming diatoms in pre was also evidenced by several previous studies particularly mg recorded at wet seasonal samplings on upper to lower west and east shoal locations harrison et al 2008 huang et al 2004 green algae are next highest number of species recorded in group 10 species contributing around 15 8 of the total phytoplankton in addition dry seasonal phytoplankton species distribution also revealed diatoms 99 5 dominance in all sampling sites of the pre the planktonic diatom bellerochea malleus bm and cosmopolitan diatom skeletonema costatum sc were observed predominantly 87 5 of all diatoms in most of the sampling locations previously several studies reported that wet and dry seasons were suitable conditions for dinoflagellates dominance guo et al 2014 liu et al 2016 but surprisingly present study recorded very low counts 0 2 at all pre sampling locations the overall phytoplankton species abundance in wet and dry season of pre sampling locations varied from 0 02 16 105 cells m 3 fig 6 the west and middle shoal sampling sites indicated rich phytoplankton distribution and maximum count were recorded at west shoal sampling sites in contrast east shoal and channel sampling sites showed significant decrease of phytoplankton abundance and distribution in addition results of nmds analysis fig 7 indicated that phytoplankton community composition differed in pre sampling locations with stress value of around 0 025 and 0 008 which were effective in dimensionality reduction in wet season west shoal sampling locations s1 4 and 11 were arranged in a close manner sharing almost similar species diversity in addition east shoal s5 and channel s7 and s9 species diversity were closely related to some east s3 6 and 12 and middle shoal s13 locations the west shoal s8 and s10 sampling sites were placed more distinctly in the ordination space due to less diverse species and abundance similarly middle shoal s14 was also isolated in the ordination diagram due to cyanobacterial species dominance direct contrast to wet season dry seasonal west shoal sampling sites s4 and s11 were placed distinctly in the ordination space due to sharing unique species abundance in the evaluation of phytoplankton abundance with all nutrients distribution pattern sio3 resembled more significantly this crucial role of sio3 on phytoplankton diversity was previously evidenced by noman et al 2019 and wu and chou 2003 moreover sio3 has significant negative correlation with diatoms diversity due to higher requirement for their frustule formation egge and aksnes 1992 nelson and dortch 1996 hence the community composition of phytoplankton was mainly encouraged by the influence of salinity on nutrient biogeochemical cycle and richness of sio3 in pre 3 4 phytoplankton grouping and effect of environmental factors the phytoplankton abundance and community composition in pre sampling sites were grouped by using heatmap with dendrogram fig 8 three major groups of clusters were obtained by evidencing uniqueness and similarities in phytoplankton community composition on sampling sites s10 and s8 in wet season s11 and s4 in dry season respectively the wet seasonal sampling locations s1 s2 s4 and s11 were arranged in a close manner on second group and all the other sampling sites were included in third cluster group the abundance and community composition of diatom mg in wet season followed by bm and sc in dry season were placed in top of the cluster group distinctively the environmental factors are crucial influencers for phytoplankton abundance and community composition liu et al 2020 wei et al 2017 mainly three important factors depth salinity and silicate were estimated by cca fig 9 for wet and dry seasonal phytoplankton community composition the coefficient values of canonical set sampling sites phytoplankton and environmental factors showed more than 90 of total variation with p value of 0 013 and 0 861 respectively table 1 2 in addition low eigen value 0 386 and 0 082 evidenced less variability in the studied dataset the variation of cca1 73 23 and 66 70 indicated that water depth and salinity positively influence the formation of canonical variance in relation to environmental factors besides species of phytoplankton cs sc cm ae ms os as bm nl np sp tf and ts also showed positive coefficient on cca1 whereas cca2 17 19 and 22 76 explained the positive correlation of salinity and cs ns pm pb ae as bm cl db ds np sc and sp in relation to environmental factors and phytoplankton species respectively both cca 1 and 2 evidenced that silicate has negative influence in wet season and positive influence in dry season on environmental factors the ordination diagram indicated a positive correlation between salinity with phytoplankton ae as cs nl and tf respectively environmental factor and water depth positively correlated with sc ms cm os cms mm and ts respectively phytoplankton mg ps pb ns pm sp np and bm were strongly relevant to silicate collectively cca suggests that the positively correlated environmental factors water depth salinity played a crucial role in regulating phytoplankton communities in pre along with negatively correlated factor sio3 playing an important role in variation of phytoplankton community composition 4 conclusion the present study evidenced that hydrological and chemical parameters played a crucial role in regulating phytoplankton communities in two different ecosystems more importantly pre provides suitable environment like water salinity and depth to encourage the phytoplankton growth meanwhile organic and inorganic nutrients discharged from river basin are also associated with species diversity in pre distribution of sio3 plays a crucial role in diatom dominance and phytoplankton growth promotion in all pre sampling locations the correlation between salinity and sio3 indicated abundance of phytoplankton community at west and middle shoal sampling sites of pre in addition cluster grouping of nutrient distribution nmds and heatmap analysis supported the claim finally cca proved that the water salinity and depth of pre sampling sites were positively correlated with influence of phytoplankton community composition while silicate were strongly related with most of the dominant phytoplankton species growth hence hydrological factor of water salinity with silicate distributions plays a crucial role in pre phytoplankton community composition assisting in maintaining healthy intertidal ecosystem however the successive long term monitoring of nutrients discharge and phytoplankton community distribution structure will provide the comprehensive impact of environmental factors on planktonic influence and diversity declaration of

nutrients limitation such as phosphorus li et al 2017 nitrogen nixon et al 1996 and iron del amo et al 1997 with estuarine geomorphology results in the variation pattern of phytoplankton distribution in addition some in vitro studies evidenced that small quantity 0 0034 1 370 mm of sio3 combination with essential nutrients have encouraged the phytoplankton growth wu and chou 2003 above all variations in salinity impacts the phytoplankton distribution growth and species compositions by affecting their photosynthesis and respiration process d ors et al 2016 lakshmikandan et al 2020 li 2019 muylaert et al 2009 the complex marine environment and essential nutrients discharge still requires better knowledge to understand the regulating factors of phytoplankton community composition in estuarine ecosystems in last two decades rapid development of economic zones excessive utilization of agricultural fertilizers aquaculture and industrial wastewater discharge were causing serious threats to estuaries and marine ecosystems by eutrophication and red tides situation chen et al 2019 jiang et al 2014 yi et al 2018 the pearl river is china s third longest river with 453 700 km drainage area subjected to intense nutrients discharge by various anthropogenic activity wang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the strong interactions between ocean tides coastal water and river water outflow of pearl river estuarine pre plays a crucial role in phytoplankton behavior and diversity gan et al 2014 niu et al 2020 recent studies indicated that concentration of nitrate was elevated to extreme level while phosphates were recorded very low in estuarine and coastal plume xu et al 2008 yin et al 2011 the ineffective ecosystem management strategies and substantial increase of anthropogenic activity in pre may lead to eutrophication and red tides situation in marine ecosystems therefore understanding the phytoplankton growth species diversity dominancy and their regulating factors are the major keys to preserve the fundamental food chain in the marine ecosystem gao and song 2005 since our knowledge of phytoplankton behavior and diversity in response to hydrological factors combined with anthropogenic organic inorganic pollutants are limited hence short term monitoring was performed in order to explore the existence of essential nutrients limiting enriched conditions driving on phytoplankton community composition in pre the study was mainly designed to determine the impact of hydrological parameters like salinity ph temperature depth transparency and chemical parameters such as nh4 no2 dissolved inorganic nitrogen dip dissolved inorganic phosphorous dip and sio3 on phytoplankton community composition for healthy pre ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling location and collection the pre surface and bottom water samples were collected from 14 different locations on april and november 2020 sampling sites fig 1 were selected based on river distribution locations around nine samples were collected from west shoal s1 s4 s6 s8 s10 s12 one from east shoal s5 two from middle shoal s13 s14 and east channel s7 s9 respectively both surface and bottom samples were collected from the sampling sites except west shoal sampling sites which were having less than 8 meters depth so bottom sampling was avoided samples were collected in sterile 500 ml transparent labeled polypropylene tube for nutrient analysis nh4 no2 din dip sio3 and were stored at 4 c simultaneously sampling sites depth transparency ph temperature dissolved oxygen and salinity were measured using in situ instruments the concentrations of chlorophyll a chl a analysis were performed by using 2 µm 20 mm nylon membrane to filter serially 500 ml then membrane was shaded and were stored in liquid nitrogen for phytoplankton determination water samples were collected in sterile 1l dark bottles and were fixed with buffered formaldehyde solution at final concentration of 2 5 and were stored in dark condition 2 2 analysis of samples the cell counting and identification of phytoplankton species were followed by sedimentation method using an olympus gx53 inverted microscope 400 the identification of phytoplankton taxonomy was done by following jin et al 1965 the concentrations of nutrients nh4 no2 din dip sio3 were determined by using technicon aa3 auto analyzer bran luebbe liquid nitrogen stored filtered membranes were extracted with 90 acetone to evaluate chl a concentration by using laboratory fluorometer 2 3 statistical analysis of environmental factors the phytoplankton community structure in different sampling locations and habitat was determined by non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds applying bray curtis distance using the vegan community ecology package different species with 14 different locations were analyzed in nmds on metamds function to achieve considerable robust stress value 0 2 the environmental factors impact and dominating relationships between different variables were indicated by performing canonical correspondence analysis cca additionally hierarchical cluster analysis hca and heatmap were conducted to evaluate the physiochemical distance between different sampling sites and phytoplankton diversity all the above statistical analyses were performed by using r version 4 0 2 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological parameters and chlorophyll a the phytoplankton species richness in estuaries was mainly determined by crucial hydrological parameters like water temperature ph dissolved oxygen and salinity they directly reflect the modification or damage of two different ecosystems phytoplankton diversity the surface and bottom water ph 7 0 7 7 and seasonal thermocline 23 26 c of pre sampling locations showed no significant changes from upper to lower sites fig 2 dissolved oxygen of pre indicated gradual increase from upper to lower estuary sampling sites and most of the bottom test samplings evidenced increased concentration when compared to surface water samples since extensive organic waste and sewage discharge benthic community oxygen demand decomposition of organic matters are main factors causing oxygen depletion in upper estuary sites of pre harrison et al 2008 pakulski et al 2000 the strong flow of ocean currents in east channel s9 3 7 and 10 6 ppt and middle shoal sampling sites recorded maximum surface and bottom salinity however this physical process completely depends on seasonality and dominance of freshwater outflow lu and gan 2015 since the water transparency acts as an important factor in encouraging phytoplankton growth and species diversity of ecosystem the pre sampling locations evidenced variation of chl a concentration limitation of light source and high depth of east channel sampling sites recorded reduced concentration of chl a fig s1 supplementary data maximum chl a concentration was observed at s4 6 8 µg l 1 of pre and also most of the west and middle shoal sites showed higher concentration when compared to other locations the light dependent reaction process and strong water currents required for exchange of essential nutrients have directly impacted on total chl a concentration of pre sampling locations burford and rothlisberg 1999 ho et al 2010 when compared with previous years chl a recorded results of pre niu et al 2020 our findings showed significant increase in lower sampling locations in both wet and dry seasons 3 2 variations of chemical parameters the intense nitrification and denitrification process in estuaries occurred due to increasing anthropogenic activities in stream banks by discharging organic and inorganic pollutants in biogeochemical cycles of ocean and estuaries nh4 plays an important role in nitrification process and is the major material source for phytoplankton growth the present study indicated that maximum concentration of nh4 was recorded at west 0 17 0 31 mg l 1 and east 0 15 0 28 mg l 1 shoal fig 3 locations in dry seasonal samplings similarly high concentrations of no2 were observed in dry seasonal samplings of east 0 04 0 16 mg l 1 and west 0 15 0 18 mg l 1 shoal sites in addition dry seasonal recorded results evidenced significant increase of no2 concentration when compared to wet seasonal report in east 70 6 and west 16 7 shoal sampling locations of the pre during the wet season no2 distributions were reflected by strong water current with average annual rainfall and mixing of riverine no2 of the pre moreover dry seasonal significant increase of no2 is mainly generated by bacterial mediated oxidation of nh4 within the water column morris et al 1985 the high concentration of din and dip fig 4 distributions were observed in west shoal locations on wet seasonal samplings of the pre this seasonal variation of din and dip concentrations were mainly driven by effluent discharge and river dilution ratio most of the phosphorus were dissolved and became particulate matters due to short flushing time 3 days of the pre morris 1990 dry seasonal conditions were suitable for effective phosphorus recycling process in the water columns two seasonal samplings recorded intense sio3 discharge in west and middle shoal locations of the pre most of the surface samplings fig 5 exhibits high concentration of sio3 when compared to bottom samplings the present study on distribution of sio3 and din indicated significant association with salinity pattern which is distinctly correlated with freshwater discharge of pre li et al 2017 the dendrogram of cluster analysis grouped wet and dry seasonal sampling sites into two major cluster groups based on all chemical parameters of pre fig s2 supplementary data in wet season eight sampling sites including all east shoal and channel sampling sites two west s4 and s6 and one middle shoal s12 sites were closely grouped in the cluster the second cluster group holds most of the west and middle shoal sampling sites in contrast to wet season most of the sampling sites were closely grouped in dry seasonal cluster analysis except s8 and s14 the cluster analysis significantly evidenced uniqueness of west and east shoal locations hydrodynamic activities and nutrient distributions which directly impacted on phytoplankton growth variation chl a of the pre 3 3 distribution and community composition of phytoplankton around 50 different phytoplankton species were identified at pre sampling locations in wet seasonal samplings and among them diatoms 24 species were more dominant group the chain forming diatom melosira granulata mg was predominantly found in all sampling sites and contributed approximately to 88 of all diatom species this dominating nature of chain forming diatoms in pre was also evidenced by several previous studies particularly mg recorded at wet seasonal samplings on upper to lower west and east shoal locations harrison et al 2008 huang et al 2004 green algae are next highest number of species recorded in group 10 species contributing around 15 8 of the total phytoplankton in addition dry seasonal phytoplankton species distribution also revealed diatoms 99 5 dominance in all sampling sites of the pre the planktonic diatom bellerochea malleus bm and cosmopolitan diatom skeletonema costatum sc were observed predominantly 87 5 of all diatoms in most of the sampling locations previously several studies reported that wet and dry seasons were suitable conditions for dinoflagellates dominance guo et al 2014 liu et al 2016 but surprisingly present study recorded very low counts 0 2 at all pre sampling locations the overall phytoplankton species abundance in wet and dry season of pre sampling locations varied from 0 02 16 105 cells m 3 fig 6 the west and middle shoal sampling sites indicated rich phytoplankton distribution and maximum count were recorded at west shoal sampling sites in contrast east shoal and channel sampling sites showed significant decrease of phytoplankton abundance and distribution in addition results of nmds analysis fig 7 indicated that phytoplankton community composition differed in pre sampling locations with stress value of around 0 025 and 0 008 which were effective in dimensionality reduction in wet season west shoal sampling locations s1 4 and 11 were arranged in a close manner sharing almost similar species diversity in addition east shoal s5 and channel s7 and s9 species diversity were closely related to some east s3 6 and 12 and middle shoal s13 locations the west shoal s8 and s10 sampling sites were placed more distinctly in the ordination space due to less diverse species and abundance similarly middle shoal s14 was also isolated in the ordination diagram due to cyanobacterial species dominance direct contrast to wet season dry seasonal west shoal sampling sites s4 and s11 were placed distinctly in the ordination space due to sharing unique species abundance in the evaluation of phytoplankton abundance with all nutrients distribution pattern sio3 resembled more significantly this crucial role of sio3 on phytoplankton diversity was previously evidenced by noman et al 2019 and wu and chou 2003 moreover sio3 has significant negative correlation with diatoms diversity due to higher requirement for their frustule formation egge and aksnes 1992 nelson and dortch 1996 hence the community composition of phytoplankton was mainly encouraged by the influence of salinity on nutrient biogeochemical cycle and richness of sio3 in pre 3 4 phytoplankton grouping and effect of environmental factors the phytoplankton abundance and community composition in pre sampling sites were grouped by using heatmap with dendrogram fig 8 three major groups of clusters were obtained by evidencing uniqueness and similarities in phytoplankton community composition on sampling sites s10 and s8 in wet season s11 and s4 in dry season respectively the wet seasonal sampling locations s1 s2 s4 and s11 were arranged in a close manner on second group and all the other sampling sites were included in third cluster group the abundance and community composition of diatom mg in wet season followed by bm and sc in dry season were placed in top of the cluster group distinctively the environmental factors are crucial influencers for phytoplankton abundance and community composition liu et al 2020 wei et al 2017 mainly three important factors depth salinity and silicate were estimated by cca fig 9 for wet and dry seasonal phytoplankton community composition the coefficient values of canonical set sampling sites phytoplankton and environmental factors showed more than 90 of total variation with p value of 0 013 and 0 861 respectively table 1 2 in addition low eigen value 0 386 and 0 082 evidenced less variability in the studied dataset the variation of cca1 73 23 and 66 70 indicated that water depth and salinity positively influence the formation of canonical variance in relation to environmental factors besides species of phytoplankton cs sc cm ae ms os as bm nl np sp tf and ts also showed positive coefficient on cca1 whereas cca2 17 19 and 22 76 explained the positive correlation of salinity and cs ns pm pb ae as bm cl db ds np sc and sp in relation to environmental factors and phytoplankton species respectively both cca 1 and 2 evidenced that silicate has negative influence in wet season and positive influence in dry season on environmental factors the ordination diagram indicated a positive correlation between salinity with phytoplankton ae as cs nl and tf respectively environmental factor and water depth positively correlated with sc ms cm os cms mm and ts respectively phytoplankton mg ps pb ns pm sp np and bm were strongly relevant to silicate collectively cca suggests that the positively correlated environmental factors water depth salinity played a crucial role in regulating phytoplankton communities in pre along with negatively correlated factor sio3 playing an important role in variation of phytoplankton community composition 4 conclusion the present study evidenced that hydrological and chemical parameters played a crucial role in regulating phytoplankton communities in two different ecosystems more importantly pre provides suitable environment like water salinity and depth to encourage the phytoplankton growth meanwhile organic and inorganic nutrients discharged from river basin are also associated with species diversity in pre distribution of sio3 plays a crucial role in diatom dominance and phytoplankton growth promotion in all pre sampling locations the correlation between salinity and sio3 indicated abundance of phytoplankton community at west and middle shoal sampling sites of pre in addition cluster grouping of nutrient distribution nmds and heatmap analysis supported the claim finally cca proved that the water salinity and depth of pre sampling sites were positively correlated with influence of phytoplankton community composition while silicate were strongly related with most of the dominant phytoplankton species growth hence hydrological factor of water salinity with silicate distributions plays a crucial role in pre phytoplankton community composition assisting in maintaining healthy intertidal ecosystem however the successive long term monitoring of nutrients discharge and phytoplankton community distribution structure will provide the comprehensive impact of environmental factors on planktonic influence and diversity declaration of
