6315,the waters of the euphrates and tigris rivers have always been a vital resource in the water food energy nexus of the middle east region the currently ongoing southeastern anatolia project gap in turkey aims to increase regional prosperity by optimizing the use of these waters for irrigation and hydropower since the beginning of the 1990s the irrigation schemes and water management infrastructures within the scope of the gap have caused significant land use and land cover lulc change in this semi arid region we employed a high resolution regional climate model to simulate the effects of irrigation induced lulc changes on the regional water and energy balances for this purpose historical simulations were conducted by using three land cover distributions which reflect the increase in irrigation and water surfaces our experiment reveals that water loss through evapotranspiration increases significantly with the areal expansion of irrigation this increase is driven by the change in partitioning of the available energy at the surface between turbulent heat fluxes on the one hand a significant reduction in sensible heat flux causes local cooling by around 0 4 c and 0 8 c for the current and future irrigation conditions respectively on the other hand the increase in latent heat flux enhances evapotranspiration and consequently atmospheric water vapor concentration the moistening of a shallower boundary layer triggers the formation of convective clouds which increases convective precipitation most notably during the irrigation months the enhanced water loss through evapotranspiration has potential to significantly alter the water budget of the gap region it seems that the water surplus of the headwaters region may not be enough to meet the water deficit of the gap region in the future if the planned irrigation schemes are carried out to completion keywords irrigation land use and land cover change regional climate modeling euphrates tigris basin

and reservoir construction as a common land management practice irrigation may have an important effect on local and regional climates e g jin and miller 2011 kueppers et al 2007 lobell et al 2009 ozdogan et al 2010 sen et al 2013 irrigation also represents an important link between water resources and land use water demand for irrigation would increase with the expansion of agricultural areas increasing irrigation water use might place a pressure on surface water and groundwater resources in the basins especially in arid and semi arid regions for these reasons it could be said that understanding the changes in agricultural irrigation demand and its impact on water budget in river basins is a necessity for achieving sustainable water and food security in the future destouni et al 2013 however as noted by mahmood et al 2014 impact of irrigation on regional hydroclimatology still remains one of the insufficiently understood issues of lulc change the upper euphrates tigris basin hereafter etb historically also known as upper mesopotamia the cradle of civilization and the fertile crescent is a critical regional water resource yılmaz et al 2019 show that the terrestrial water storage has been declining in the etb during recent years and that this decline is strongly related with the snowpack depletion in the montane parts of the basin at the same time the etb is subjected to massive lulc change especially due to the expansion of irrigated cultivation özcan et al 2018 ozdogan and salvucci 2004 the etb represents a potential breadbasket for the middle east an arid and semi arid region where cereal production is mostly dependent on irrigation the etb is also defined as one of the future risk hotspots among the transboundary river basins in the world unep dhi and unep 2016 the currently ongoing southeastern anatolia project of turkey known by its turkish abbreviation as gap is a multipurpose regional development program focused on utilizing the waters of the euphrates and tigris rivers by irrigating vast semi arid lands and by producing hydroelectric power by the end of 2017 nearly one third of the planned irrigation schemes within the scope of gap had been completed gap 2018 this implies that the spatial extent of the future irrigated fields in the region will be around three times the extent of the presently irrigated fields other than irrigation schemes several dams have been constructed in the upper etb dam reservoirs have the potential to affect local climate significantly in mediterranean and semi arid climates degu et al 2011 ohara et al 2011 showed using a coupled regional hydroclimate model chen et al 2011 that the water demands from the downstream countries can be compensated by different water release scenarios from the upstream sector of the etb they suggested that storing water in the headwaters part of the basin is an effective water storage strategy in order to reduce considerable amounts of evaporation from the reservoirs in the arid lower part of the basin since the reservoirs located in the upstream region would have a smaller surface area and a cooler climate recent climate extremes give clues about what could happen in the region in the future in terms of water resources for instance drought over the mesopotamia region in 2008 caused significant decreases in water resources the estimated loss in water resources was 144 billion m3 for the region voss et al 2013 as a result crop cultivation and livestock breeding were damaged which triggered migration to other places as an upstream country besides also being affected by the dry spell turkey had to face an increased downstream water demand from syria and iraq kelley et al 2015 claim that the chaotic environment after the most severe drought on record in syria between 2007 and 2010 contributed to the syrian insurrection in 2011 in such cases the water management decisions of upstream countries would conceivably have serious outcomes for the downstream users it is clear that more knowledge about the etb water availability and use is needed to create effective policies to mitigate the potential adverse effects of climate variability in the basin land use decisions are especially important from a water resources perspective the water resources management in the etb has been challenging since the basin is a transboundary river system the strategic value of the two rivers the euphrates and tigris is high for the whole region the main riparian countries turkey iraq and syria of the euphrates and tigris rivers have been facing a water sharing problem gleick 2014 it is of great concern that future precipitation is projected to decrease in the basin bozkurt and sen 2013 evans 2009 since this along with the increasing water demand by irrigation projects kibaroglu and maden 2014 will escalate the severity of the water crisis large basin projects such as the gap may lead to major environmental disturbances changes in the land use pattern have already resulted in substantial water losses through evaporation considering the already declining terrestrial water storage in the basin e g voss et al 2013 yılmaz et al 2019 the larger region may face a deepening water crisis in the future due to the climate change the objective of the study is to simulate the effects of agricultural expansion and dam reservoirs on the regional climate and water budget in the upper etb under present time climate conditions the simulations are carried out with a state of the art regional climate model and the landscape changes related with the irrigation and damming are incorporated into the model by altering its default land use map which represents the pre irrigation conditions in the region based on present time satellite observations and future irrigation schemes we describe the physical characteristics and climate of the basin and the irrigation and dam projects in the basin in section 2 present the information about the model the data sets the methodology in generating the land use maps and the experimental design in section 3 and give the results in section 4 we discuss the results in section 5 and finalize the paper providing a summary and conclusions in section 6 2 study domain 2 1 physical characteristics and climate the eastern mediterranean and black sea embs region forms the geographic link between europe and asia turkey as the largest country fully contained within this region has several climatic zones unal et al 2003 due to its complex topography and landscape it is located blue box in fig 1 in one of the hotspots that is highly vulnerable to climate change giorgi 2006 in addition to greenhouse gas emissions human activities such as irrigation and dam constructions in the country s largest basin the etb have the potential to enhance the anticipated effects of climate change at local and regional scales the etb is one of the largest transboundary basins in the world located on the territories of six riparian countries turkey iraq iran syria saudi arabia and jordan with a total drainage area of 868 060 km2 the population in the basin is over 65 million people unep dhi and unep 2016 the transboundary waters of both the euphrates and tigris rivers originate from the mountains of eastern turkey and end by pouring into the persian gulf the whole basin receives 357 mm of average annual rainfall unep dhi and unep 2016 while this amount is around 561 3 mm kayhan and alan 2012 in the northern part of the basin 22 percent of the total area which is the most important basin for turkey in terms of water resources the turkish section of the etb contributes 90 and 51 of the total annual water volume of the euphrates and tigris rivers respectively fao 2009 in this study the effects of the land use change in the turkish section of the basin black lines in fig 1 are investigated the study basin i e the upper etb in turkey is split into two regions defined as the headwaters hw and the gap region the inset in fig 1 for further analyses the headwaters of the euphrates and tigris rivers are fed by the snowmelt and subsequent runoff in the high eastern anatolia mountains bozkurt and sen 2013 the gap region where irrigation is more dominant is at a relatively lower elevation compared to the headwaters the irrigation projects within the scope of the gap take place in this region the headwaters region has high vegetation coverage while the gap region is mainly characterized by semi desert land cover conditions fig 2 a the etb is located in a transitional climate zone from vegetated lands yellow green to arid orange brown areas fig 2a according to the köppen geiger classification the headwaters area belongs mainly to the cold snowy forest climate with dry summer dsb while the gap region has the characteristic of temperate rainy climate with a dry summer i e a mediterranean climate csa turkes 2010 2 2 dams and irrigation projects in the basin the waters of the euphrates and tigris rivers have been used for large scale irrigation since the beginning of the ancient mesopotamian civilizations bozkurt and sen 2013 since then not much has changed in terms of the water use in the region the riparian countries still intensively use the waters of these two rivers for the purposes of agriculture water storage and energy production the total area equipped for irrigation aei in the whole euphrates tigris basin is around 6 5 7 million ha fao 2009 according to a global inventory of siebert et al 2010 the aei with surface water is larger compared to the aei with groundwater in the whole basin by the year 2003 groundwater abstraction for irrigation reported in eurostat for turkey was 18 4 of total water abstraction for irrigation while the area actually irrigated with groundwater was estimated to be around 49 of the total irrigated area which is approximately the same as that number reported by the turkish state hydraulic works dsi supplement s1 of siebert et al 2010 unep dhi and unep 2016 reported that the total irrigation water withdrawal in the basin was around 99 000 million m3 which is 88 of the total water withdrawal of which iraq accounts for approximately 44 iran for 25 turkey for 18 and syria for 13 since the beginning of 1990s starting with the irrigation of the harran plain see the inset in fig 1 such irrigation schemes carried out within the scope of the aforementioned gap have substantially altered the land use of the upper etb by the end of 2017 30 4 0 55 million ha of the planned irrigation projects were in operation gap 2018 according to the master plan of gap an immense area of 1 8 million hectares will be irrigated upon the completion of the ongoing irrigation investments the waters of the euphrates and tigris rivers are not only used for irrigation but also for energy production as reported in fao 2009 the capacity of the large dams in the euphrates tigris basin is around 99 million m3 for turkey 11 million m3 for syria 110 million m3 for iraq 15 million m3 for iran these dams are in use for irrigation hydropower water supply and flood protection purposes the construction of 22 dams and 19 hydropower plants is planned within the scope of the gap gap 2018 by the end of 2017 78 of the planned hydropower capacity had been installed which corresponds to a total production of 443 8 billion kwh gap 2018 approximately one fourth of the hydroelectric production in turkey is provided by the hydropower plants of the gap gap 2018 since the date that the atatürk dam became operational as a part of the gap irrigated agricultural activities have substantially increased in the region this large dam is of central importance in the gap for irrigation and hydropower in order to highlight the significance of this date which is a milestone for the land use change in the region all dates prior to this will be considered as pre gap the exact date of the start of the gap project is not important here but the pre gap period corresponds the time before the irrigated agricultural areas started to expand rapidly around the years of 1993 and 1994 due to the basin s location the use of transboundary water resources is one of the main reasons for geopolitical problems in the middle east region overexploitation of the euphrates and tigris rivers as a result of human activities involving irrigation and hydropower generation can significantly affect the amount of water flow to the downstream countries 3 material and methods 3 1 model description a regional climate model regcm4 the regional climate model system the revision 4283 version is the main tool used in this study regcm4 is a hydrostatic compressible sigma p vertical coordinate and community model giorgi et al 2012 developed by the international centre of theoretical physics ictp after several sensitivity experiments results not shown here over the model domains the following model physics parameterizations were chosen the grell cumulus convection scheme grell 1993 for both over land and ocean with the fritsch and chappell 1980 closure assumption the subgrid explicit moisture scheme subex pal et al 2000 the boundary layer scheme of holtslag et al 1990 the radiation scheme of ncar ccm3 kiehl et al 1996 and the zeng et al 1998 ocean flux scheme the default land surface model of regcm4 is bats biosphere atmosphere transfer scheme dickinson et al 1993 in this study we preferred to use the subgrid version of bats subbats giorgi et al 2003 as it enables us to resolve the surface processes at higher resolution than the atmospheric part of the climate model one of the advantages of this approach is to retain some relatively small surface features which are usually lost in the process of upscaling to the model resolution in the cases that do not employ this approach thus the regional climate model works with a more representative lulc map than it otherwise would the land surface model calculates the exchanges of energy and moisture between surface and atmosphere based on the prescribed land cover class for each grid cell subbats has 22 vegetation land cover types and it assigns the values of several parameters such as albedo roughness length minimum stomatal resistance maximum and minimum leaf area index from a look up table see table 2 in dickinson et al 1993 provided in the model the treatment of vegetation in terms of energy and moisture fluxes is similar for all types including irrigated crop vegetation is represented as a single layer canopy in bats kueppers et al 2007 and its seasonal variation represented by leaf area index is simulated based on soil temperature dickinson et al 1993 apart from the parameter values the only difference irrigated crop has over the other vegetation classes is that bats adjusts the root zone soil moisture to field capacity at every time step kueppers et al 2007 the required water is taken from the runoff thus making it negative i e the irrigation water it should be mentioned that bats does not include a detailed irrigation scheme that could estimate different aspects of irrigation such as amount source method and timing the irrigation treatment in bats as well as in many similar land surface models coupled with global and regional climate models is deemed adequate for a climatological perspective e g kueppers et al 2007 3 2 data 3 2 1 forcing data the initial and lateral boundary conditions to the model were provided by the nnrp1 ncep ncar reanalysis product version 1 global reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 nnrp1 data have 6 hourly temporal 1948 present and 2 5 2 5 spatial coverage and 17 pressure levels the noaa optimum interpolation weekly mean of sea surface temperature oisst v2 with a spatial resolution of 1 1 on a global grid was also employed reynolds et al 2002 for all the experiments mentioned in section 3 3 the simulations were performed first over the od48 red lines in fig 1 domain by using the nnrp1 and oisst data as initial and boundary conditions then the outputs of the 48 km simulations were used to drive the nested 12 km simulation over the tr12 blue lines in fig 1 domain 3 2 2 evaluation data the performance of the regional climate model is assessed by comparing the model outputs with observation based products henceforth simply referred to as observations the modeled precipitation and temperature are evaluated against the same fields from the observation based gridded cru climatic research unit of the university of east anglia dataset over the larger domain od48 the cru time series v 4 01 dataset is available as global land data for various climate variables at a 0 5 0 5 resolution harris et al 2014 it has been widely used for regional climate model evaluation studies over the eastern mediterranean black sea region e g bozkurt et al 2012 önol and semazzi 2009 the evapotranspiration outputs of regcm4 were evaluated using the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 data at a 0 25 spatial resolution gldas estimates evapotranspiration using a land surface model driven by satellite and ground based observational data products because the land surface model is run offline i e not coupled with a regional or global climate model with driving data coming from the observations the estimated evapotranspiration data could be considered as a reference to broadly assess the performance of climate models at regional or global scale when evaluating gridded regional climate model outputs it is also preferable to use gridded observational data at a similar spatial scale to model grids for this reason temperature and precipitation data from cru and evapotranspiration data from gldas were regridded to the 48 km model grids using inverse distance weighting to compare with the model outputs for the 20 year period between 1991 and 2010 3 2 3 generating the land use maps the accuracy of the lulc classification is important in climate simulations ge et al 2007 in this study we generate the current and future land use maps over the gap region by considering real data rather than using hypothetical scenarios and conduct the regional climate simulations by incorporating these maps into the model for this purpose both the implemented and planned irrigation schemes as well as the dam reservoirs were added to the prescribed land use map the default land use map of the regional climate model was created using the terrain program of regcm4 which uses a static surface dataset the global land cover characteristics glcc loveland et al 2000 the glcc dataset was produced from advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr satellite retrievals between the dates of april 1992 and march 1993 at 1 km horizontal resolution this land use map represents the natural conditions before the lulc change in the gap region hence it becomes possible to apply the aforementioned lulc changes on the prescribed land use map which does not include the recent dam constructions and irrigated crop area therefore a number of modifications on the default land use map hereafter pre gap of the regcm4 model is required to gauge the impact of lulc change on the hydroclimate of the upper etb the 2006 corine land cover clc dataset a computerized inventory consisting of land cover information of 38 countries most of the european union members and middle and east european countries eea 2007 is used in order to update the current irrigation and inland water dams areas onto the pre gap land use map this second land use map called the current map depicts the near present day situation of the irrigated areas in the gap region based on the clc dataset the third and the last land use map was prepared based on the future irrigation schemes obtained from the dsi table 1 summarizes the land use maps used in this study the land surface model of regcm4 bats has 22 land use categories fig 2a in order to create the current and future land use maps as an input for the regcm4 simulations the pre gap map was processed via qgis 2 8 and ncl ncar command language since the three maps were in different projections firstly the projections of all the maps were transformed to the lambert conformal conic projection which is the default projection of the model outputs similarly datum information which includes the coordinate systems of the maps was transformed to wgs 84 to pave the way for working on three different maps the projection transformation process was done by using the functions of an open source tool namely the geospatial data abstraction library gdal while producing the new land use maps only lulc changes in the gap region were taken into account the extension of irrigated crop and inland water areas was applied on the newly derived land use maps the land use maps used in this study are given in fig 2 the extension of the irrigated crop areas shown in grass green colored grid cells class number 10 can be easily seen in the high resolution maps in the right column panels c and d generating the land use maps at high resolution 3 km in our case is also important to see the distribution of lulc classes in detail it is mainly the grid cells that fall under the lulc categories of crop mixed farming forest field mosaic and short grass in the pre gap land cover map that were converted to inland water and irrigated crop in the current and future land use maps as a result of the implementation of the gap table 2 shows how the fractional areal coverage of each land surface type changes according to the land use map in the pre gap land use map only 0 7 of the gap region is irrigated but this increases to 17 4 and 38 for the current and future land use maps respectively after filling up the reservoirs of the constructed dams the inland water fractional coverage similarly increases from 1 7 to 2 6 and 3 0 3 3 experimental design regcm4 was used to simulate the regional climate corresponding with the three generated land use maps of the gap region 1 pre gap conditions little or no irrigation 2 near present time conditions significant expansion in irrigation projects and 3 future conditions completion of the entire gap irrigation schemes the first simulation named tr12d corresponds to the control simulation assuming no applied irrigation in the gap region the second simulation called tr12c reflects the effects of the current situation of implemented irrigation projects in the gap region the last simulation tr12f includes the effects of all irrigation projects planned within the scope of the gap the nnrp1 reanalysis dataset was used as forcing for regcm4 at the boundaries the model simulations with the default and two reconstructed land use maps were conducted at a horizontal resolution of 48 km over a large domain covering the balkans and embs region od48 experiments and the relevant outputs from these simulations were subsequently used to drive the simulations of a nesting domain over turkey with 12 km resolution tr12 experiments the bats scheme of regcm4 was run with a 3 km subgrid set up this configuration resolves the land surface processes at a higher resolution over turkey by using the subgrid parameterization modification of bats we aim towards an improvement of the representation of the surface processes particularly in mountainous regions giorgi et al 2003 the three simulations were conducted for the period between 1991 and 2010 3 4 water and energy budget calculation at the land surface the water budget for the surface layer can be expressed as 1 ds dt p e r s r g where ds dt is the change in water storage p is precipitation e is evapotranspiration r s is surface runoff and r g is groundwater runoff under the natural conditions e g no reservoir constructions it is assumed that there is no change in long term water storage ds dt 0 consequently the sum of runoff rates r s r g is equal to the long term average of the precipitation minus evapotranspiration p e values in the land surface model bats of regcm4 the required irrigation water for plants is supplied from the runoff term in order to avoid the soil moisture stress in the irrigated crop grid cells in the etb the irrigation water for the gap region is transferred from the reservoirs of the dams storing the water of the headwaters region hence the p e values were used in order to calculate the water storage in this study the land surface energy balance is generally formulated as follows 2 dh dt r n λ e s h g here the first term dh dt is the change in energy storage r n is net radiation λ e is the latent heat flux λ is the latent heat of vaporization and e is the evapotranspiration flux sh is the sensible heat flux and g is the ground heat flux here the net radiation is defined as positive towards the surface while the remaining fluxes are defined as positive when directed away from the surface often one assumes an infinitesimally small layer such that the change in energy storage is effectively zero seneviratne et al 2010 so that the surface energy balance can be reformulated as 3 q a r n g λ e s h where q a is the energy available for transfer from the surface to atmosphere by turbulent fluxes λ e s h by using the outputs of the simulations a residual term is calculated by subtracting the latent and sensible heat fluxes from the net radiation net shortwave net longwave this calculated residual term corresponds to the sum of the change in energy storage and ground heat flux as in eq 2 if we assume that there is no change in energy storage valid for long term analysis then the residual term equals to the ground heat flux which we consider to be negligible from eqs 1 and 2 it is clear that the surface energy and water balances are coupled through evapotranspiration term e 4 results 4 1 model evaluation the performance of the regional climate model was evaluated by comparing the simulation outputs against the observations for the period between 1991 and 2010 with the default pre gap land use map the evaluation was focused on the 20 year mean values of downscaled climate fields such as surface air temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration the temperature values over the headwaters region are essential due to its role in snow accumulation and the timing of snowmelt sen et al 2011 precipitation and evapotranspiration are the main components of the terrestrial water budget therefore the performance of the model in simulating these three variables is critical to diagnose the consequences of the lulc changes on the regional climate and water budget fig 3 shows the comparison between downscaled model results driven by the nnrp data and observations over the etb at a grid spacing of 48 km the first map fig 3a shows spatial pattern of the observed surface temperature within the basin the annual mean temperature shows a clear meridional gradient being higher in the south of the domain similar to the temperature pattern of the od48 domain see supplementary information fig s1 over the larger domain the lowest mean temperature values are observed over the mountainous areas such as the caucasus and european alps the model has a cold bias in the etb fig 3d i e the overall performance of the model in terms of reproducing the observed temperature field indicates a tendency of underestimation fig 3j model outputs for average near surface air temperature give a spatially averaged cold bias of around 1 7 c the scatter plot fig 3g of observed and modeled temperature shows that the regional climate model is able to simulate the spatial distribution of the near surface temperature field with a high correlation coefficient of around 0 98 fig 3e clearly shows that for the 20 year average annual precipitation the model has a wet bias in the higher elevation headwaters of the etb and a dry bias in the lower elevation downstream gap region still the overall bias for the etb is around 52 7 mm per year which amounts to a relative bias of just 10 the overall root mean squared error rmse is slightly higher at around 117 6 mm per year but this only amounts to a relative rmse of 21 furthermore despite the slight wet and dry bias patterns that were previously mentioned the model is able to capture the overall spatial pattern fig 3h of the 20 year average annual precipitation in the etb with a relatively high correlation coefficient 0 77 as well as the temporal pattern of the spatially averaged precipitation values fig 3k in their study bozkurt and sen 2011 were able to produce a similar precipitation pattern distribution fig 3b over the etb by using a similar model physics configuration but with an older version of the same model i e regcm3 the performance of regcm4 in terms of estimating evapotranspiration is quite important since the simulation outputs will be used in the water budget calculations both the absolute and relative biases fig 3f for the 20 year average annual evapotranspiration are lower compared to those of the precipitation when spatially averaged over the etb although the biases are relatively small both are 10 3 mm per year the regional climate model has a very low spatial correlation coefficient 0 22 which shows that the model struggles to capture the correct spatial evapotranspiration distribution fig 3i still for the etb as a whole the performance of regcm4 in terms of simulating evapotranspiration is satisfying over the entire 20 year simulation period as the model is able to capture the main tendencies in the interannual variability as indicated by the higher temporal correlation coefficient fig 3l comparison against observations over the etb region showed that the model is able to reproduce the temperature and precipitation fields fairly well even though regcm4 could not capture the spatial pattern of evapotranspiration the interannual variability for this field was reproduced reasonably the biases could be caused by deficiencies both in the model and in the observation data reducing the uncertainty in the observation data is still a challenging issue regardless of the source of the products including the gauge based i e cru precipitation estimates sun et al 2018 4 2 effects of lulc changes in this section we mainly show the results of the high resolution tr12 simulations these simulations which have 12 km spatial resolution are run with the three land use maps which represent the different phases of lulc changes in the gap region the change in annual means of several surface variables are given in table 3 for both the gap region and headwaters area of the etb to determine whether the changes in the simulations are statistically significant the student s t test was applied to the model results this tests if the null hypothesis in our case h0 the time averages of two different simulation results are the same is correct or not according to the test rejection of the h0 occurs when the calculated probability of t values is less than a certain threshold 5 in our case a change in the time average of a model result due to a change in irrigation is deemed statistically significant when the null hypothesis is rejected over the 20 year simulation period the model results indicate that the irrigation schemes have a moderate cooling effect over the irrigated grid cells fig 4 a and e the annual mean 2 m air and ground temperatures decrease by as much as 0 8 c and 2 1 c table 3 respectively in the gap region due to irrigation still the absolute changes in temperature values due to irrigation were not statistically significant according to the t test results additionally annual mean ground and 2 m air temperatures did not change significantly in the headwaters area or in the rest of the domain particularly in summer months the cooling effect of irrigation greatly reduces the temperature in the gap region by around 1 5 c at near the surface and 4 2 c at the ground surface for the fully irrigated simulation the sensible heat flux decreases compared to the control run by around 22 and 50 for partly and fully irrigated conditions respectively as opposed to the increase of 51 and 113 in latent heat flux values table 3 while the effect of irrigation on the sensible heat flux was confined only to the irrigated grid cells it spreads to the neighboring grid cells for the latent heat flux in connection with this the alteration of the surface energy partitioning due to the increased water availability also changes the bowen ratio throughout the year statistically significant changes in the bowen ratio occurred in the gap region decreasing to 2 17 and 0 94 on average for the current tr12c and future tr12f land use map simulations respectively table 3 in the latter case the annual bowen ratio also declined from 0 91 to 0 57 on average in the hw area of the basin for the gap region these typical values correspond to a shift from semi arid landscapes to irrigated crop the moisture content of upper soil layer increases over the semi arid areas in the gap region due to the irrigation table 3 in the case of the completion of all irrigation plans tr12f the model results show that total soil moisture of the gap region increases by around 25 7 in the upper soil layer 10 cm the most striking modeled impact of the wet soil generated by irrigation is the dramatic increase in evapotranspiration amounts fig 4c and g the spatially averaged increase in evapotranspiration for the gap region is around 51 for the current irrigation status tr12c and 113 for the completion of the all irrigation projects tr12f however the increased evapotranspiration in the headwaters region is insignificant compared to the lower part of the basin table 3 specific humidity is the mass of water vapor per unit mass of moist air as a direct result of the influx of water vapor supplied to the boundary layer through enhanced evapotranspiration annual specific humidity increases over the irrigated grid cells during the summer months when the irrigation applications peak the increase in specific humidity compared to the control run is even higher 13 1 and 29 3 for the partly and fully irrigated simulations for the headwaters part of the basin insignificant changes of around 2 occur for specific humidity in the tr12f simulation table 3 enhanced water vapor leads to an increase in convective precipitation as a result of the increased convective cloud formation for the fully irrigated conditions table 3 the convective precipitation increases by around 18 and 9 4 for the gap and headwaters regions respectively however statistically significant increases only occur in small areas over the gap region unlike the convective precipitation the change in total precipitation snow rainfall amounts due to the increased irrigation applications were not significant anywhere fig 4b and f for the fully irrigated conditions annual precipitation increased by around 6 5 and 3 0 for the gap region and the headwaters area respectively in the gap region we also see a statistically significant decrease in averaged atmospheric boundary layer height of around 88 m and 214 m for the partly and the fully irrigated simulations respectively table 3 in addition to the water budget components the snow related outputs of the model do not show significant changes according to the t test results the snow water equivalent swe over the gap region show an increase annually of 4 1 and 3 3 for the partly and fully irrigated simulations respectively table 3 lastly wind speed increases mostly over the lowland areas of the gap region while it tends to decrease over the highlands of the gap region fig 4d and h overall it significantly increases over the gap region for both current and future simulations table 3 an increase in wind speed increases the turbulent flux exchange and vice versa for decrease 4 3 surface energy balance fig 5 summarizes the overall effects of lulc change on the annual mean 2 m air temperature and energy balance components the significant changes due to the irrigation activities usually occur over the irrigated grid cells in the gap region consequently the spatially averaged values of surface variables were also affected over the upper etb even though the changes in the headwaters area were insignificant owing to the extensive irrigation increase in soil moisture table 3 leads to a significant change in the partitioning of the available energy from radiation between the latent and sensible heat fluxes in the gap region the latent heat flux increases with more irrigation while the sensible heat flux decreases fig 5 our irrigation simulations resulted in an increase of net radiation at the surface due to an increase in the absorption of shortwave irradiance fig 6 shows the changes in the diurnal cycles of climatic variables over the gap region for the different simulations the diurnal cycle of the net radiation does not change so much with only a slight increase between 9 00 and 12 00 local time for the more irrigated conditions fig 6a fig 6b and c illustrates that the change in the partitioning of the available surface energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes due to irrigation becomes apparent especially during mid day local time between 9 00 and 15 00 with a decrease in the sensible flux and an increase in the latent heat flux the latent heat flux for the fully irrigated conditions is about three times as high as that for the non irrigation situation at noon time 12 00 owing to irrigation s cooling effect the magnitude of the decrease in skin temperature fig 6d is higher than that in the near surface air temperature fig 6e still both temperatures peak at noon time while the specific humidity is nearly constant during the day for the non irrigation condition irrigation amplifies the magnitude of change in specific humidity during daylight hours fig 6f the thickness of the boundary layer also decreases most around the noon time fig 6g irrigation also increases total precipitation flux fig 6h during mid day there is a slight increase in total precipitation flux during the night local time between 00 00 and 06 00 for both of the irrigation simulations 4 4 water budget as previously stated the water and energy budgets are directly linked through evapotranspiration the dramatic increase in evapotranspiration due to the irrigation has a strong impact on the water budget the impact of irrigation on the seasonal cycle of the water budget components is shown in fig 7 similar to the change in annual mean values of the land surface variables table 3 the irrigation projects affect mostly the irrigated gap region fig 7a as opposed to the headwaters areas fig 7b the increased evapotranspiration can be seen throughout the year with an exception of the winter djf months as shown in detail in fig 7a the evapotranspiration amounts increase in parallel to the timing of the irrigation activities in the gap region and reach its maximum in summer months jja in summer months the magnitude of evapotranspiration in the gap region is doubled for the partly and tripled for the fully irrigated simulations the irrigation effect on convective precipitation and total precipitation mostly occurs in spring mam months for both the gap region and headwaters areas according to the fully irrigated simulation the relative increase in spring convective precipitation 18 7 over the gap region is higher than that over the headwaters area 7 in the gap region the increase in evapotranspiration is markedly higher than the change in total precipitation as such the precipitation minus evapotranspiration p e values considerably decrease for the partly and fully irrigated simulations in the gap region the simulated magnitude of the water deficit over the gap region in summer months is 212 mm and 348 mm for the partly and fully irrigated model runs respectively the significant changes due to the irrigation activities usually occur over the irrigated grid cells in the gap region according to the model results the impact of irrigation on the water budget is mainly due to the increase in evapotranspiration and decrease in p e values in order to better understand the impact of the changes in the water budget we calculated the p e values for the sub regions of the euphrates and tigris basins obtained by separating their basins in the hw and gap region as shown in fig 8 under the natural conditions no irrigation positive p e values indicate water storage potential both in the headwaters and gap regions due to the slight increase in precipitation amounts in the headwaters area p e values slightly increase in both sub regions orange and blue areas in fig 8 of the headwaters for partly and fully irrigated conditions however after the start of the irrigation projects reflected by the current land use map partly irrigated we see that the p e value over the euphrates part of the gap region green region in fig 8 becomes negative representing a local water deficit of around 6 3 billion m3 per year for the simulation with the future land use map reflecting fully irrigated conditions the simulated p e values for the gap region indicate an even stronger water deficit these values are calculated as 14 5 and 5 billion m3 per year in the euphrates and tigris parts of the gap region respectively at first glance the irrigation water need in the gap region could be compensated by the water surplus of the headwaters area however we need to take the water commitment to the downstream countries into account for a holistic evaluation of the water budget for the upper etb whether this deficit could be met by transferring water from the headwaters region will be discussed in the next section 5 discussion we show as in other modeling studies e g destouni et al 2010 han and yang 2013 kueppers et al 2007 sacks et al 2009 that the irrigation practices cause a cooling effect i e the oasis effect over the heavily irrigated areas due to the increased evapotranspiration and associated latent heat flux on the other hand this influence may vary for different regions as shown in the study of lobell et al 2009 depending on the ability of the employed models in simulating the soil moisture diurnally we find that the irrigation induced decreases in both skin and near surface temperatures occur throughout the day with a peak around noon where the energy available from radiation for turbulent exchange reaches its maximum the most dramatic impact of irrigation and dam constructions is the steep increase in evapotranspiration the land surface model of regcm4 i e bats suppresses the water stress on crops by using the irrigation water to moisten the root zone irrigation water is extracted from the surface runoff even if it becomes negative meaning that there must be water transfer from somewhere else to meet the water demand of the irrigation practices thus there is more water available for evapotranspiration this leads to a transition in the evapotranspiration regime from water limited to energy limited as a result of the enhanced irrigation thus energy partitioned to the latent heat flux increases which increases the evapotranspiration from the surface the magnitude of the turbulent heat fluxes is also inversely proportional to the aerodynamic resistance which is itself dependent on the wind speed atmospheric stability and surface roughness length pitman 2003 the conversion of the land cover to the irrigated crop c f table 2 leads to a decrease in roughness length dickinson et al 1993 albeit not much and consequently an increase in aerodynamic resistance which we would expect to decrease both turbulent heat fluxes the significant decrease in the sensible heat flux c f table 3 could also be explained by the local temperature inversion i e the difference between the skin and near surface air temperatures is negative over the irrigated grid cells results not shown here and the significant latent heat flux increase could also be explained by the typical stomatal resistance decreases dickinson et al 1993 in the conversion to irrigated crop areas which in turn lowers the bulk surface resistance for the latent heat flux furthermore the wind speed increases over the irrigated areas while it decreases in the rest of the gap region a possible reason for this duality is the formation of an inland sea breeze phenomenon seth and giorgi 1996 due to the temperature difference over the irrigated and dry areas as a result of temperature differences the wind flows towards the dry and warmer regions from the cool and wet land areas due to the higher wind speeds over the irrigated grid cells which lowers the aerodynamic resistance the evapotranspiration is further enhanced the increase in the latent heat flux also causes an increase in water vapor concentration in the shallower boundary layer and consequently enhances the convective cloud formation the net climate feedback of clouds is not well understood in the literature bony et al 2015 coelho et al 2008 stephens 2005 still it is known that the increase in high altitude clouds e g cirrus trap more heat while low level clouds e g stratocumulus cause cooling by reflecting more sunlight convective clouds are generally optically thick low level clouds thus we might expect a decrease in net surface radiation due to the enhanced convection however the irrigation simulations resulted in an increase of net radiation at the surface this occurs for several reasons firstly the surface albedo decreases and so the subsequent absorptance of shortwave radiation i e the ratio of absorbed to incoming shortwave radiation at the surface increases secondly irrigation causes a statistically significant decrease in outgoing net longwave radiation see fig 5 due to the evaporative cooling of the skin temperature leading to a decrease in upward longwave radiation at the surface as suggested by the stefan boltzmann law the driver of the changes in temperature is the change in the partitioning of the available energy between latent and sensible heat fluxes due to lulc change in the gap region the starting point is the increase in soil moisture due to irrigation this in turn may lead to the direct soil moisture precipitation feedback mechanism which is discussed in several studies betts et al 1996 dirmeyer et al 2009 eltahir 1998 koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2010 this direct positive feedback mechanism is simply the recycling effect between increased soil moisture and increased precipitation through increased evapotranspiration eltahir and bras 1996 this feedback exemplifies the important role of surface turbulent fluxes in controlling precipitation by their modulation of the available moisture in the boundary layer in addition there is another indirect feedback of soil moisture precipitation via boundary layer dynamics ek and holtslag 2004 lawrence and slingo 2005 through this mechanism an increase in soil moisture leads to a repartitioning of the available energy with an increase in latent heat flux and a decrease in the sensible heat flux the bowen ratio decrease in turn leads to a shallower boundary layer we can see this response in our simulations too table 3 at the same time as discussed darker and cooler soil enhances net surface radiation by absorbing more solar radiation and reducing longwave emissions the combination of the higher water vapor concentration and the shallower boundary layer leads to an increase in moist static energy which accelerates the development of convective processes lawrence and slingo 2005 this indirect feedback mechanism can explain the increase in convective precipitation that we find in our simulations the importance of soil moisture for enhanced precipitation in semi arid has been shown in many other modeling studies alter et al 2015 koster et al 2004 taylor et al 2011 the indirect soil moisture precipitation mechanism may be a positive amplifying or negative damping feedback depending on the analysis region or the employed model our findings in their current form suggest a positive soil moisture precipitation feedback mechanism in the etb more studies are needed to understand the control of the vertical resolution on land surface boundary layer interactions findell and eltahir 2003 recently tuttle and salvucci 2017 showed that three factors long timescale variability precipitation persistence and endogeneity between soil moisture and precipitation must be accounted for in order to determine the sign and strength of the soil moisture precipitation feedback in our study the increase in precipitation is much less compared to the evapotranspiration increase over the etb fig 7 shows that the seasonal cycle of water surplus p e values mainly changes during the irrigation months april through september in the headwaters area the positive values of precipitation minus evapotranspiration p e shows a water surplus for all irrigation simulations however in the euphrates part of the gap region the modeled p e values are negative for both the partly and fully irrigated simulations fig 8 therefore the irrigation practices lead to water loss over the gap region according to our model results here we assume that all of the committed water amount 15 8 billion m3 per year kibaroglu and maden 2014 is released to the downstream countries from the euphrates river every year under the current irrigation conditions i e the partly irrigated land use map the water surplus in the headwaters area of the euphrates 19 1 billion m3 per year is not enough to balance the combined water deficit of the euphrates part of the gap region 6 3 billion m3 per year and water commitment to the downstream countries 15 8 billion m3 per year the water surplus of the entire etb headwaters area seems to be adequate for the water demand of the entire gap region for the current conditions however in the case of completion of the irrigation projects it appears that the gap region will experience significant water shortage even after transferring all the water surplus from the headwaters wei et al 2013 show that irrigation induced water deficit may not be sustainable in several regions including the embs that they identified through the ratio of precipitation and evapotranspiration increases by using reanalysis datasets the possible increase in evapotranspiration due to the irrigation in the gap region has been highlighted in the studies of kolars and mitchell 1991 and ozdogan and salvucci 2004 focusing on the harran plain ozdogan and salvucci 2004 used observations from a meteorological station to investigate the complex feedback mechanism between the available water at the surface and evaporation through bouchet s complementary theory similar to our results they demonstrate a shift from a water limited to an energy limited regime through irrigation as hypothesized in the theory of bouchet irrigation decreases the potential evaporation while increasing the actual evaporation the dynamic water budget of the basin was also modeled in the studies of kavvas et al 2011 and ohara et al 2011 in both studies they computed the water budget for a pre gap time period by using the outputs of a hydroclimate model that they validated over the whole euphrates tigris basin another water balance study in the etb was conducted by evans and zaitchik 2008 with their implementation of two irrigation algorithms added to a land surface scheme they evaluated the efficiency of irrigation systems such as flood and drip for the basin they demonstrated significant decreases in evapotranspiration and irrigation water demand by using drip irrigation rather than flood irrigation their study concluded that the feasibility of a planned syrian irrigation expansion is only possible with modernization of the irrigation systems their results could similarly apply to the irrigation plans under the gap project in the recent years updated irrigation applications by dsi personal communication are promising in terms of water efficiency and reducing the water loss the gradual replacement of flood irrigation with sprinkle and drip irrigation systems has the potential to reduce the irrigation return flow in the gap region reduction of water loss through efficient irrigation systems would also reduce the water stress on the downstream region due to the upstream water use in this transboundary river basin which has a large number of collaboration and conflict events due to water stress munia et al 2016 the increasing water demand of the irrigated region gap seems to be barely compensated by the water supply of the headwaters of the euphrates tigris basin moreover our high resolution simulations show that the water need of the gap region may not be met from the water storage of the headwaters area once all planned irrigation projects are completed this implies that the further agricultural expansion in the region might not be sustainable under present time climate conditions our simulations use the same climate forcing so that the water loss rates for different lulc stages in the gap region are calculated under the same climate conditions however climate change induced by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gasses has been projected to have adverse effects increase temperature and decrease precipitation in the etb e g bozkurt et al 2012 bozkurt and sen 2013 evans 2009 önol et al 2014 this brings up another important question that this study has not addressed what will be the combined effects of irrigation induced lulc changes and the greenhouse gas emissions on the hydroclimate of the etb the integrated impacts of these will likely exacerbate the water budget problem this study reveals 6 summary and conclusions this study investigates the hydroclimatic effects of the human induced lulc changes in the upper euphrates tigris basin etb by conducting sensitivity simulations with a regional climate model under present time climate conditions the lulc change is primarily characterized by increasing irrigation and reservoir area in this region for the sensitivity simulations we created two new lulc maps over the default map of the model namely the current and future lulc maps reflecting the current situation and future plans of the irrigation and dam areas respectively after a promising evaluation of the performance of the employed regional climate model regcm4 with a focus on the reproduction of the temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration fields we carried out the lulc change simulations whose main results are given below 1 compared to the results from the reference run the simulations with current and future lulc maps indicate that the 2 m surface air temperature values over the irrigated grids decrease by about 0 4 0 8 c while the cooling in skin temperature was around 0 9 2 1 c for the current and future irrigation conditions respectively our findings are consistent with various studies that have demonstrated the cooling effect of irrigation 2 irrigation in the gap region locally alters the surface energy balance through a statistically significant decrease in the bowen ratio evapotranspiration indicates statistically significant increases of 51 and 113 in the current and future irrigation simulations respectively this suggests that the expansion of the irrigated fields affect the water resources of the upper etb significantly by enhancing water loss through evapotranspiration 3 the strong positive feedback mechanism between soil moisture and precipitation is also observed in our study the combined effect of increased latent heat flux and a shallower boundary layer leads to increased convective precipitation over the irrigated parts of the upper etb mostly in spring 4 the conversion of a land use type can alter climate due to its effect on surface heat fluxes here it is shown that the applied irrigation scheme in the upper etb perturbs both the surface water and energy balances via significantly increasing the evapotranspiration these results indicate that the future modeling studies should include lulc changes for a more realistic representation of the climate responses 5 according to the diurnal cycle analysis the effects of irrigation are visible especially during the daytime the seasonal cycle analysis showed that the time of the largest changes in climatic variables coincides with the irrigation months april through september 6 finally increased water loss through evapotranspiration will put pressure on water partitioned for the energy production and for release to the downstream countries it seems that the solution of this multidimensional problem of water resources in the basin will become more difficult with further agricultural expansion a sustainable water use practice might be achieved in the region through a modernization of the implemented and planned irrigation systems in this study we showed that land use land cover changes in the upper euphrates tigris basin will adversely affect the water budget of this region which will have implications not only for turkey but also for the downstream countries the water related tension is already high in this semi arid region some adaptation measures can be implemented to tackle the water loss problem which has a potential for shaping the future water resources management and policies in the region the importance of the water energy food nexus in the implementation of an integrated approach for transboundary water resources management in the etb has already emerged at the national and international levels kibaroglu and gürsoy 2015 our study encourages the environmental scientists and policy makers to address the issue of water loss via evapotranspiration as a corollary our study points out the potential future consequences of the combination of the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 dilemma and changing climate of the euphrates tigris basin declaration of competing interest

6315,the waters of the euphrates and tigris rivers have always been a vital resource in the water food energy nexus of the middle east region the currently ongoing southeastern anatolia project gap in turkey aims to increase regional prosperity by optimizing the use of these waters for irrigation and hydropower since the beginning of the 1990s the irrigation schemes and water management infrastructures within the scope of the gap have caused significant land use and land cover lulc change in this semi arid region we employed a high resolution regional climate model to simulate the effects of irrigation induced lulc changes on the regional water and energy balances for this purpose historical simulations were conducted by using three land cover distributions which reflect the increase in irrigation and water surfaces our experiment reveals that water loss through evapotranspiration increases significantly with the areal expansion of irrigation this increase is driven by the change in partitioning of the available energy at the surface between turbulent heat fluxes on the one hand a significant reduction in sensible heat flux causes local cooling by around 0 4 c and 0 8 c for the current and future irrigation conditions respectively on the other hand the increase in latent heat flux enhances evapotranspiration and consequently atmospheric water vapor concentration the moistening of a shallower boundary layer triggers the formation of convective clouds which increases convective precipitation most notably during the irrigation months the enhanced water loss through evapotranspiration has potential to significantly alter the water budget of the gap region it seems that the water surplus of the headwaters region may not be enough to meet the water deficit of the gap region in the future if the planned irrigation schemes are carried out to completion keywords irrigation land use and land cover change regional climate modeling euphrates tigris basin

ozdogan et al 2010 sen et al 2013 irrigation also represents an important link between water resources and land use water demand for irrigation would increase with the expansion of agricultural areas increasing irrigation water use might place a pressure on surface water and groundwater resources in the basins especially in arid and semi arid regions for these reasons it could be said that understanding the changes in agricultural irrigation demand and its impact on water budget in river basins is a necessity for achieving sustainable water and food security in the future destouni et al 2013 however as noted by mahmood et al 2014 impact of irrigation on regional hydroclimatology still remains one of the insufficiently understood issues of lulc change the upper euphrates tigris basin hereafter etb historically also known as upper mesopotamia the cradle of civilization and the fertile crescent is a critical regional water resource yılmaz et al 2019 show that the terrestrial water storage has been declining in the etb during recent years and that this decline is strongly related with the snowpack depletion in the montane parts of the basin at the same time the etb is subjected to massive lulc change especially due to the expansion of irrigated cultivation özcan et al 2018 ozdogan and salvucci 2004 the etb represents a potential breadbasket for the middle east an arid and semi arid region where cereal production is mostly dependent on irrigation the etb is also defined as one of the future risk hotspots among the transboundary river basins in the world unep dhi and unep 2016 the currently ongoing southeastern anatolia project of turkey known by its turkish abbreviation as gap is a multipurpose regional development program focused on utilizing the waters of the euphrates and tigris rivers by irrigating vast semi arid lands and by producing hydroelectric power by the end of 2017 nearly one third of the planned irrigation schemes within the scope of gap had been completed gap 2018 this implies that the spatial extent of the future irrigated fields in the region will be around three times the extent of the presently irrigated fields other than irrigation schemes several dams have been constructed in the upper etb dam reservoirs have the potential to affect local climate significantly in mediterranean and semi arid climates degu et al 2011 ohara et al 2011 showed using a coupled regional hydroclimate model chen et al 2011 that the water demands from the downstream countries can be compensated by different water release scenarios from the upstream sector of the etb they suggested that storing water in the headwaters part of the basin is an effective water storage strategy in order to reduce considerable amounts of evaporation from the reservoirs in the arid lower part of the basin since the reservoirs located in the upstream region would have a smaller surface area and a cooler climate recent climate extremes give clues about what could happen in the region in the future in terms of water resources for instance drought over the mesopotamia region in 2008 caused significant decreases in water resources the estimated loss in water resources was 144 billion m3 for the region voss et al 2013 as a result crop cultivation and livestock breeding were damaged which triggered migration to other places as an upstream country besides also being affected by the dry spell turkey had to face an increased downstream water demand from syria and iraq kelley et al 2015 claim that the chaotic environment after the most severe drought on record in syria between 2007 and 2010 contributed to the syrian insurrection in 2011 in such cases the water management decisions of upstream countries would conceivably have serious outcomes for the downstream users it is clear that more knowledge about the etb water availability and use is needed to create effective policies to mitigate the potential adverse effects of climate variability in the basin land use decisions are especially important from a water resources perspective the water resources management in the etb has been challenging since the basin is a transboundary river system the strategic value of the two rivers the euphrates and tigris is high for the whole region the main riparian countries turkey iraq and syria of the euphrates and tigris rivers have been facing a water sharing problem gleick 2014 it is of great concern that future precipitation is projected to decrease in the basin bozkurt and sen 2013 evans 2009 since this along with the increasing water demand by irrigation projects kibaroglu and maden 2014 will escalate the severity of the water crisis large basin projects such as the gap may lead to major environmental disturbances changes in the land use pattern have already resulted in substantial water losses through evaporation considering the already declining terrestrial water storage in the basin e g voss et al 2013 yılmaz et al 2019 the larger region may face a deepening water crisis in the future due to the climate change the objective of the study is to simulate the effects of agricultural expansion and dam reservoirs on the regional climate and water budget in the upper etb under present time climate conditions the simulations are carried out with a state of the art regional climate model and the landscape changes related with the irrigation and damming are incorporated into the model by altering its default land use map which represents the pre irrigation conditions in the region based on present time satellite observations and future irrigation schemes we describe the physical characteristics and climate of the basin and the irrigation and dam projects in the basin in section 2

the geographic link between europe and asia turkey as the largest country fully contained within this region has several climatic zones unal et al 2003 due to its complex topography and landscape it is located blue box in fig 1 in one of the hotspots that is highly vulnerable to climate change giorgi 2006 in addition to greenhouse gas emissions human activities such as irrigation and dam constructions in the country s largest basin the etb have the potential to enhance the anticipated effects of climate change at local and regional scales the etb is one of the largest transboundary basins in the world located on the territories of six riparian countries turkey iraq iran syria saudi arabia and jordan with a total drainage area of 868 060 km2 the population in the basin is over 65 million people unep dhi and unep 2016 the transboundary waters of both the euphrates and tigris rivers originate from the mountains of eastern turkey and end by pouring into the persian gulf the whole basin receives 357 mm of average annual rainfall unep dhi and unep 2016 while this amount is around 561 3 mm kayhan and alan 2012 in the northern part of the basin 22 percent of the total area which is the most important basin for turkey in terms of water resources the turkish section of the etb contributes 90 and 51 of the total annual water volume of the euphrates and tigris rivers respectively fao 2009 in this study the effects of the land use change in the turkish section of the basin black lines in fig 1 are investigated the study basin i e the upper etb in turkey is split into two regions defined as the headwaters hw and the gap region the inset in fig 1 for further analyses the headwaters of the euphrates and tigris rivers are fed by the snowmelt and subsequent runoff in the high eastern anatolia mountains bozkurt and sen 2013 the gap region where irrigation is more dominant is at a relatively lower elevation compared to the headwaters the irrigation projects within the scope of the gap take place in this region the headwaters region has high vegetation coverage while the gap region is mainly characterized by semi desert land cover conditions fig 2 a the etb is located in a transitional climate zone from vegetated lands yellow green to arid orange brown areas fig 2a according to the köppen geiger classification the headwaters area belongs mainly to the cold snowy forest climate with dry summer dsb while the gap region has the characteristic of temperate rainy climate with a dry summer i e a mediterranean climate csa turkes 2010 2 2 dams and irrigation projects in the basin the waters of the euphrates and tigris rivers have been used for large scale irrigation since the beginning of the ancient mesopotamian civilizations bozkurt and sen 2013 since then not much has changed in terms of the water use in the region the riparian countries still intensively use the waters of these two rivers for the purposes of agriculture water storage and energy production the total area equipped for irrigation aei in the whole euphrates tigris basin is around 6 5 7 million ha fao 2009 according to a global inventory of siebert et al 2010 the aei with surface water is larger compared to the aei with groundwater in the whole basin by the year 2003 groundwater abstraction for irrigation reported in eurostat for turkey was 18 4 of total water abstraction for irrigation while the area actually irrigated with groundwater was estimated to be around 49 of the total irrigated area which is approximately the same as that number reported by the turkish state hydraulic works dsi supplement s1 of siebert et al 2010 unep dhi and unep 2016 reported that the total irrigation water withdrawal in the basin was around 99 000 million m3 which is 88 of the total water withdrawal of which iraq accounts for approximately 44 iran for 25 turkey for 18 and syria for 13 since the beginning of 1990s starting with the irrigation of the harran plain see the inset in fig 1 such irrigation schemes carried out within the scope of the aforementioned gap have substantially altered the land use of the upper etb by the end of 2017 30 4 0 55 million ha of the planned irrigation projects were in operation gap 2018 according to the master plan of gap an immense area of 1 8 million hectares will be irrigated upon the completion of the ongoing irrigation investments the waters of the euphrates and tigris rivers are not only used for irrigation but also for energy production as reported in fao 2009 the capacity of the large dams in the euphrates tigris basin is around 99 million m3 for turkey 11 million m3 for syria 110 million m3 for iraq 15 million m3 for iran these dams are in use for irrigation hydropower water supply and flood protection purposes the construction of 22 dams and 19 hydropower plants is planned within the scope of the gap gap 2018 by the end of 2017 78 of the planned hydropower capacity had been installed which corresponds to a total production of 443 8 billion kwh gap 2018 approximately one fourth of the hydroelectric production in turkey is provided by the hydropower plants of the gap gap 2018 since the date that the atatürk dam became operational as a part of the gap irrigated agricultural activities have substantially increased in the region this large dam is of central importance in the gap for irrigation and hydropower in order to highlight the significance of this date which is a milestone for the land use change in the region all dates prior to this will be considered as pre gap the exact date of the start of the gap project is not important here but the pre gap period corresponds the time before the irrigated agricultural areas started to expand rapidly around the years of 1993 and 1994 due to the basin s location the use of transboundary water resources is one of the main reasons for geopolitical problems in the middle east region overexploitation of the euphrates and tigris rivers as a result of human activities involving irrigation and hydropower generation can significantly affect the amount of water flow to the downstream countries 3 material and methods 3 1 model description a regional climate model regcm4 the regional climate model system the revision 4283 version is the main tool used in this study regcm4 is a hydrostatic compressible sigma p vertical coordinate and community model giorgi et al 2012 developed by the international centre of theoretical physics ictp after several sensitivity experiments results not shown here over the model domains the following model physics parameterizations were chosen the grell cumulus convection scheme grell 1993 for both over land and ocean with the fritsch and chappell 1980 closure assumption the subgrid explicit moisture scheme subex pal et al 2000 the boundary layer scheme of holtslag et al 1990 the radiation scheme of ncar ccm3 kiehl et al 1996 and the zeng et al 1998 ocean flux scheme the default land surface model of regcm4 is bats biosphere atmosphere transfer scheme dickinson et al 1993 in this study we preferred to use the subgrid version of bats subbats giorgi et al 2003 as it enables us to resolve the surface processes at higher resolution than the atmospheric part of the climate model one of the advantages of this approach is to retain some relatively small surface features which are usually lost in the process of upscaling to the model resolution in the cases that do not employ this approach thus the regional climate model works with a more representative lulc map than it otherwise would the land surface model calculates the exchanges of energy and moisture between surface and atmosphere based on the prescribed land cover class for each grid cell subbats has 22 vegetation land cover types and it assigns the values of several parameters such as albedo roughness length minimum stomatal resistance maximum and minimum leaf area index from a look up table see table 2 in dickinson et al 1993 provided in the model the treatment of vegetation in terms of energy and moisture fluxes is similar for all types including irrigated crop vegetation is represented as a single layer canopy in bats kueppers et al 2007 and its seasonal variation represented by leaf area index is simulated based on soil temperature dickinson et al 1993 apart from the parameter values the only difference irrigated crop has over the other vegetation classes is that bats adjusts the root zone soil moisture to field capacity at every time step kueppers et al 2007 the required water is taken from the runoff thus making it negative i e the irrigation water it should be mentioned that bats does not include a detailed irrigation scheme that could estimate different aspects of irrigation such as amount source method and timing the irrigation treatment in bats as well as in many similar land surface models coupled with global and regional climate models is deemed adequate for a climatological perspective e g kueppers et al 2007 3 2 data 3 2 1 forcing data the initial and lateral boundary conditions to the model were provided by the nnrp1 ncep ncar reanalysis product version 1 global reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 nnrp1 data have 6 hourly temporal 1948 present and 2 5 2 5 spatial coverage and 17 pressure levels the noaa optimum interpolation weekly mean of sea surface temperature oisst v2 with a spatial resolution of 1 1 on a global grid was also employed reynolds et al 2002 for all the experiments mentioned in section 3 3 the simulations were performed first over the od48 red lines in fig 1 domain by using the nnrp1 and oisst data as initial and boundary conditions then the outputs of the 48 km simulations were used to drive the nested 12 km simulation over the tr12 blue lines in fig 1 domain 3 2 2 evaluation data the performance of the regional climate model is assessed by comparing the model outputs with observation based products henceforth simply referred to as observations the modeled precipitation and temperature are evaluated against the same fields from the observation based gridded cru climatic research unit of the university of east anglia dataset over the larger domain od48 the cru time series v 4 01 dataset is available as global land data for various climate variables at a 0 5 0 5 resolution harris et al 2014 it has been widely used for regional climate model evaluation studies over the eastern mediterranean black sea region e g bozkurt et al 2012 önol and semazzi 2009 the evapotranspiration outputs of regcm4 were evaluated using the global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 data at a 0 25 spatial resolution gldas estimates evapotranspiration using a land surface model driven by satellite and ground based observational data products because the land surface model is run offline i e not coupled with a regional or global climate model with driving data coming from the observations the estimated evapotranspiration data could be considered as a reference to broadly assess the performance of climate models at regional or global scale when evaluating gridded regional climate model outputs it is also preferable to use gridded observational data at a similar spatial scale to model grids for this reason temperature and precipitation data from cru and evapotranspiration data from gldas were regridded to the 48 km model grids using inverse distance weighting to compare with the model outputs for the 20 year period between 1991 and 2010 3 2 3 generating the land use maps the accuracy of the lulc classification is important in climate simulations ge et al 2007 in this study we generate the current and future land use maps over the gap region by considering real data rather than using hypothetical scenarios and conduct the regional climate simulations by incorporating these maps into the model for this purpose both the implemented and planned irrigation schemes as well as the dam reservoirs were added to the prescribed land use map the default land use map of the regional climate model was created using the terrain program of regcm4 which uses a static surface dataset the global land cover characteristics glcc loveland et al 2000 the glcc dataset was produced from advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr satellite retrievals between the dates of april 1992 and march 1993 at 1 km horizontal resolution this land use map represents the natural conditions before the lulc change in the gap region hence it becomes possible to apply the aforementioned lulc changes on the prescribed land use map which does not include the recent dam constructions and irrigated crop area therefore a number of modifications on the default land use map hereafter pre gap of the regcm4 model is required to gauge the impact of lulc change on the hydroclimate of the upper etb the 2006 corine land cover clc dataset a computerized inventory consisting of land cover information of 38 countries most of the european union members and middle and east european countries eea 2007 is used in order to update the current irrigation and inland water dams areas onto the pre gap land use map this second land use map called the current map depicts the near present day situation of the irrigated areas in the gap region based on the clc dataset the third and the last land use map was prepared based on the future irrigation schemes obtained from the dsi table 1 summarizes the land use maps used in this study the land surface model of regcm4 bats has 22 land use categories fig 2a in order to create the current and future land use maps as an input for the regcm4 simulations the pre gap map was processed via qgis 2 8 and ncl ncar command language since the three maps were in different projections firstly the projections of all the maps were transformed to the lambert conformal conic projection which is the default projection of the model outputs similarly datum information which includes the coordinate systems of the maps was transformed to wgs 84 to pave the way for working on three different maps the projection transformation process was done by using the functions of an open source tool namely the geospatial data abstraction library gdal while producing the new land use maps only lulc changes in the gap region were taken into account the extension of irrigated crop and inland water areas was applied on the newly derived land use maps the land use maps used in this study are given in fig 2 the extension of the irrigated crop areas shown in grass green colored grid cells class number 10 can be easily seen in the high resolution maps in the right column panels c and d generating the land use maps at high resolution 3 km in our case is also important to see the distribution of lulc classes in detail it is mainly the grid cells that fall under the lulc categories of crop mixed farming forest field mosaic and short grass in the pre gap land cover map that were converted to inland water and irrigated crop in the current and future land use maps as a result of the implementation of the gap table 2 shows how the fractional areal coverage of each land surface type changes according to the land use map in the pre gap land use map only 0 7 of the gap region is irrigated but this increases to 17 4 and 38 for the current and future land use maps respectively after filling up the reservoirs of the constructed dams the inland water fractional coverage similarly increases from 1 7 to 2 6 and 3 0 3 3 experimental design regcm4 was used to simulate the regional climate corresponding with the three generated land use maps of the gap region 1 pre gap conditions little or no irrigation 2 near present time conditions significant expansion in irrigation projects and 3 future conditions completion of the entire gap irrigation schemes the first simulation named tr12d corresponds to the control simulation assuming no applied irrigation in the gap region the second simulation called tr12c reflects the effects of the current situation of implemented irrigation projects in the gap region the last simulation tr12f includes the effects of all irrigation projects planned within the scope of the gap the nnrp1 reanalysis dataset was used as forcing for regcm4 at the boundaries the model simulations with the default and two reconstructed land use maps were conducted at a horizontal resolution of 48 km over a large domain covering the balkans and embs region od48 experiments and the relevant outputs from these simulations were subsequently used to drive the simulations of a nesting domain over turkey with 12 km resolution tr12 experiments the bats scheme of regcm4 was run with a 3 km subgrid set up this configuration resolves the land surface processes at a higher resolution over turkey by using the subgrid parameterization modification of bats we aim towards an improvement of the representation of the surface processes particularly in mountainous regions giorgi et al 2003 the three simulations were conducted for the period between 1991 and 2010 3 4 water and energy budget calculation at the land surface the water budget for the surface layer can be expressed as 1 ds dt p e r s r g where ds dt is the change in water storage p is precipitation e is evapotranspiration r s is surface runoff and r g is groundwater runoff under the natural conditions e g no reservoir constructions it is assumed that there is no change in long term water storage ds dt 0 consequently the sum of runoff rates r s r g is equal to the long term average of the precipitation minus evapotranspiration p e values in the land surface model bats of regcm4 the required irrigation water for plants is supplied from the runoff term in order to avoid the soil moisture stress in the irrigated crop grid cells in the etb the irrigation water for the gap region is transferred from the reservoirs of the dams storing the water of the headwaters region hence the p e values were used in order to calculate the water storage in this study the land surface energy balance is generally formulated as follows 2 dh dt r n λ e s h g here the first term dh dt is the change in energy storage r n is net radiation λ e is the latent heat flux λ is the latent heat of vaporization and e is the evapotranspiration flux sh is the sensible heat flux and g is the ground heat flux here the net radiation is defined as positive towards the surface while the remaining fluxes are defined as positive when directed away from the surface often one assumes an infinitesimally small layer such that the change in energy storage is effectively zero seneviratne et al 2010 so that the surface energy balance can be reformulated as 3 q a r n g λ e s h where q a is the energy available for transfer from the surface to atmosphere by turbulent fluxes λ e s h by using the outputs of the simulations a residual term is calculated by subtracting the latent and sensible heat fluxes from the net radiation net shortwave net longwave this calculated residual term corresponds to the sum of the change in energy storage and ground heat flux as in eq 2 if we assume that there is no change in energy storage valid for long term analysis then the residual term equals to the ground heat flux which we consider to be negligible from eqs 1 and 2 it is clear that the surface energy and water balances are coupled through evapotranspiration term e 4 results 4 1 model evaluation the performance of the regional climate model was evaluated by comparing the simulation outputs against the observations for the period between 1991 and 2010 with the default pre gap land use map the evaluation was focused on the 20 year mean values of downscaled climate fields such as surface air temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration the temperature values over the headwaters region are essential due to its role in snow accumulation and the timing of snowmelt sen et al 2011 precipitation and evapotranspiration are the main components of the terrestrial water budget therefore the performance of the model in simulating these three variables is critical to diagnose the consequences of the lulc changes on the regional climate and water budget fig 3 shows the comparison between downscaled model results driven by the nnrp data and observations over the etb at a grid spacing of 48 km the first map fig 3a shows spatial pattern of the observed surface temperature within the basin the annual mean temperature shows a clear meridional gradient being higher in the south of the domain similar to the temperature pattern of the od48 domain see supplementary information fig s1 over the larger domain the lowest mean temperature values are observed over the mountainous areas such as the caucasus and european alps the model has a cold bias in the etb fig 3d i e the overall performance of the model in terms of reproducing the observed temperature field indicates a tendency of underestimation fig 3j model outputs for average near surface air temperature give a spatially averaged cold bias of around 1 7 c the scatter plot fig 3g of observed and modeled temperature shows that the regional climate model is able to simulate the spatial distribution of the near surface temperature field with a high correlation coefficient of around 0 98 fig 3e clearly shows that for the 20 year average annual precipitation the model has a wet bias in the higher elevation headwaters of the etb and a dry bias in the lower elevation downstream gap region still the overall bias for the etb is around 52 7 mm per year which amounts to a relative bias of just 10 the overall root mean squared error rmse is slightly higher at around 117 6 mm per year but this only amounts to a relative rmse of 21 furthermore despite the slight wet and dry bias patterns that were previously mentioned the model is able to capture the overall spatial pattern fig 3h of the 20 year average annual precipitation in the etb with a relatively high correlation coefficient 0 77 as well as the temporal pattern of the spatially averaged precipitation values fig 3k in their study bozkurt and sen 2011 were able to produce a similar precipitation pattern distribution fig 3b over the etb by using a similar model physics configuration but with an older version of the same model i e regcm3 the performance of regcm4 in terms of estimating evapotranspiration is quite important since the simulation outputs will be used in the water budget calculations both the absolute and relative biases fig 3f for the 20 year average annual evapotranspiration are lower compared to those of the precipitation when spatially averaged over the etb although the biases are relatively small both are 10 3 mm per year the regional climate model has a very low spatial correlation coefficient 0 22 which shows that the model struggles to capture the correct spatial evapotranspiration distribution fig 3i still for the etb as a whole the performance of regcm4 in terms of simulating evapotranspiration is satisfying over the entire 20 year simulation period as the model is able to capture the main tendencies in the interannual variability as indicated by the higher temporal correlation coefficient fig 3l comparison against observations over the etb region showed that the model is able to reproduce the temperature and precipitation fields fairly well even though regcm4 could not capture the spatial pattern of evapotranspiration the interannual variability for this field was reproduced reasonably the biases could be caused by deficiencies both in the model and in the observation data reducing the uncertainty in the observation data is still a challenging issue regardless of the source of the products including the gauge based i e cru precipitation estimates sun et al 2018 4 2 effects of lulc changes in this section we mainly show the results of the high resolution tr12 simulations these simulations which have 12 km spatial resolution are run with the three land use maps which represent the different phases of lulc changes in the gap region the change in annual means of several surface variables are given in table 3 for both the gap region and headwaters area of the etb to determine whether the changes in the simulations are statistically significant the student s t test was applied to the model results this tests if the null hypothesis in our case h0 the time averages of two different simulation results are the same is correct or not according to the test rejection of the h0 occurs when the calculated probability of t values is less than a certain threshold 5 in our case a change in the time average of a model result due to a change in irrigation is deemed statistically significant when the null hypothesis is rejected over the 20 year simulation period the model results indicate that the irrigation schemes have a moderate cooling effect over the irrigated grid cells fig 4 a and e the annual mean 2 m air and ground temperatures decrease by as much as 0 8 c and 2 1 c table 3 respectively in the gap region due to irrigation still the absolute changes in temperature values due to irrigation were not statistically significant according to the t test results additionally annual mean ground and 2 m air temperatures did not change significantly in the headwaters area or in the rest of the domain particularly in summer months the cooling effect of irrigation greatly reduces the temperature in the gap region by around 1 5 c at near the surface and 4 2 c at the ground surface for the fully irrigated simulation the sensible heat flux decreases compared to the control run by around 22 and 50 for partly and fully irrigated conditions respectively as opposed to the increase of 51 and 113 in latent heat flux values table 3 while the effect of irrigation on the sensible heat flux was confined only to the irrigated grid cells it spreads to the neighboring grid cells for the latent heat flux in connection with this the alteration of the surface energy partitioning due to the increased water availability also changes the bowen ratio throughout the year statistically significant changes in the bowen ratio occurred in the gap region decreasing to 2 17 and 0 94 on average for the current tr12c and future tr12f land use map simulations respectively table 3 in the latter case the annual bowen ratio also declined from 0 91 to 0 57 on average in the hw area of the basin for the gap region these typical values correspond to a shift from semi arid landscapes to irrigated crop the moisture content of upper soil layer increases over the semi arid areas in the gap region due to the irrigation table 3 in the case of the completion of all irrigation plans tr12f the model results show that total soil moisture of the gap region increases by around 25 7 in the upper soil layer 10 cm the most striking modeled impact of the wet soil generated by irrigation is the dramatic increase in evapotranspiration amounts fig 4c and g the spatially averaged increase in evapotranspiration for the gap region is around 51 for the current irrigation status tr12c and 113 for the completion of the all irrigation projects tr12f however the increased evapotranspiration in the headwaters region is insignificant compared to the lower part of the basin table 3 specific humidity is the mass of water vapor per unit mass of moist air as a direct result of the influx of water vapor supplied to the boundary layer through enhanced evapotranspiration annual specific humidity increases over the irrigated grid cells during the summer months when the irrigation applications peak the increase in specific humidity compared to the control run is even higher 13 1 and 29 3 for the partly and fully irrigated simulations for the headwaters part of the basin insignificant changes of around 2 occur for specific humidity in the tr12f simulation table 3 enhanced water vapor leads to an increase in convective precipitation as a result of the increased convective cloud formation for the fully irrigated conditions table 3 the convective precipitation increases by around 18 and 9 4 for the gap and headwaters regions respectively however statistically significant increases only occur in small areas over the gap region unlike the convective precipitation the change in total precipitation snow rainfall amounts due to the increased irrigation applications were not significant anywhere fig 4b and f for the fully irrigated conditions annual precipitation increased by around 6 5 and 3 0 for the gap region and the headwaters area respectively in the gap region we also see a statistically significant decrease in averaged atmospheric boundary layer height of around 88 m and 214 m for the partly and the fully irrigated simulations respectively table 3 in addition to the water budget components the snow related outputs of the model do not show significant changes according to the t test results the snow water equivalent swe over the gap region show an increase annually of 4 1 and 3 3 for the partly and fully irrigated simulations respectively table 3 lastly wind speed increases mostly over the lowland areas of the gap region while it tends to decrease over the highlands of the gap region fig 4d and h overall it significantly increases over the gap region for both current and future simulations table 3 an increase in wind speed increases the turbulent flux exchange and vice versa for decrease 4 3 surface energy balance fig 5 summarizes the overall effects of lulc change on the annual mean 2 m air temperature and energy balance components the significant changes due to the irrigation activities usually occur over the irrigated grid cells in the gap region consequently the spatially averaged values of surface variables were also affected over the upper etb even though the changes in the headwaters area were insignificant owing to the extensive irrigation increase in soil moisture table 3 leads to a significant change in the partitioning of the available energy from radiation between the latent and sensible heat fluxes in the gap region the latent heat flux increases with more irrigation while the sensible heat flux decreases fig 5 our irrigation simulations resulted in an increase of net radiation at the surface due to an increase in the absorption of shortwave irradiance fig 6 shows the changes in the diurnal cycles of climatic variables over the gap region for the different simulations the diurnal cycle of the net radiation does not change so much with only a slight increase between 9 00 and 12 00 local time for the more irrigated conditions fig 6a fig 6b and c illustrates that the change in the partitioning of the available surface energy between sensible and latent heat fluxes due to irrigation becomes apparent especially during mid day local time between 9 00 and 15 00 with a decrease in the sensible flux and an increase in the latent heat flux the latent heat flux for the fully irrigated conditions is about three times as high as that for the non irrigation situation at noon time 12 00 owing to irrigation s cooling effect the magnitude of the decrease in skin temperature fig 6d is higher than that in the near surface air temperature fig 6e still both temperatures peak at noon time while the specific humidity is nearly constant during the day for the non irrigation condition irrigation amplifies the magnitude of change in specific humidity during daylight hours fig 6f the thickness of the boundary layer also decreases most around the noon time fig 6g irrigation also increases total precipitation flux fig 6h during mid day there is a slight increase in total precipitation flux during the night local time between 00 00 and 06 00 for both of the irrigation simulations 4 4 water budget as previously stated the water and energy budgets are directly linked through evapotranspiration the dramatic increase in evapotranspiration due to the irrigation has a strong impact on the water budget the impact of irrigation on the seasonal cycle of the water budget components is shown in fig 7 similar to the change in annual mean values of the land surface variables table 3 the irrigation projects affect mostly the irrigated gap region fig 7a as opposed to the headwaters areas fig 7b the increased evapotranspiration can be seen throughout the year with an exception of the winter djf months as shown in detail in fig 7a the evapotranspiration amounts increase in parallel to the timing of the irrigation activities in the gap region and reach its maximum in summer months jja in summer months the magnitude of evapotranspiration in the gap region is doubled for the partly and tripled for the fully irrigated simulations the irrigation effect on convective precipitation and total precipitation mostly occurs in spring mam months for both the gap region and headwaters areas according to the fully irrigated simulation the relative increase in spring convective precipitation 18 7 over the gap region is higher than that over the headwaters area 7 in the gap region the increase in evapotranspiration is markedly higher than the change in total precipitation as such the precipitation minus evapotranspiration p e values considerably decrease for the partly and fully irrigated simulations in the gap region the simulated magnitude of the water deficit over the gap region in summer months is 212 mm and 348 mm for the partly and fully irrigated model runs respectively the significant changes due to the irrigation activities usually occur over the irrigated grid cells in the gap region according to the model results the impact of irrigation on the water budget is mainly due to the increase in evapotranspiration and decrease in p e values in order to better understand the impact of the changes in the water budget we calculated the p e values for the sub regions of the euphrates and tigris basins obtained by separating their basins in the hw and gap region as shown in fig 8 under the natural conditions no irrigation positive p e values indicate water storage potential both in the headwaters and gap regions due to the slight increase in precipitation amounts in the headwaters area p e values slightly increase in both sub regions orange and blue areas in fig 8 of the headwaters for partly and fully irrigated conditions however after the start of the irrigation projects reflected by the current land use map partly irrigated we see that the p e value over the euphrates part of the gap region green region in fig 8 becomes negative representing a local water deficit of around 6 3 billion m3 per year for the simulation with the future land use map reflecting fully irrigated conditions the simulated p e values for the gap region indicate an even stronger water deficit these values are calculated as 14 5 and 5 billion m3 per year in the euphrates and tigris parts of the gap region respectively at first glance the irrigation water need in the gap region could be compensated by the water surplus of the headwaters area however we need to take the water commitment to the downstream countries into account for a holistic evaluation of the water budget for the upper etb whether this deficit could be met by transferring water from the headwaters region will be discussed in the next section 5 discussion we show as in other modeling studies e g destouni et al 2010 han and yang 2013 kueppers et al 2007 sacks et al 2009 that the irrigation practices cause a cooling effect i e the oasis effect over the heavily irrigated areas due to the increased evapotranspiration and associated latent heat flux on the other hand this influence may vary for different regions as shown in the study of lobell et al 2009 depending on the ability of the employed models in simulating the soil moisture diurnally we find that the irrigation induced decreases in both skin and near surface temperatures occur throughout the day with a peak around noon where the energy available from radiation for turbulent exchange reaches its maximum the most dramatic impact of irrigation and dam constructions is the steep increase in evapotranspiration the land surface model of regcm4 i e bats suppresses the water stress on crops by using the irrigation water to moisten the root zone irrigation water is extracted from the surface runoff even if it becomes negative meaning that there must be water transfer from somewhere else to meet the water demand of the irrigation practices thus there is more water available for evapotranspiration this leads to a transition in the evapotranspiration regime from water limited to energy limited as a result of the enhanced irrigation thus energy partitioned to the latent heat flux increases which increases the evapotranspiration from the surface the magnitude of the turbulent heat fluxes is also inversely proportional to the aerodynamic resistance which is itself dependent on the wind speed atmospheric stability and surface roughness length pitman 2003 the conversion of the land cover to the irrigated crop c f table 2 leads to a decrease in roughness length dickinson et al 1993 albeit not much and consequently an increase in aerodynamic resistance which we would expect to decrease both turbulent heat fluxes the significant decrease in the sensible heat flux c f table 3 could also be explained by the local temperature inversion i e the difference between the skin and near surface air temperatures is negative over the irrigated grid cells results not shown here and the significant latent heat flux increase could also be explained by the typical stomatal resistance decreases dickinson et al 1993 in the conversion to irrigated crop areas which in turn lowers the bulk surface resistance for the latent heat flux furthermore the wind speed increases over the irrigated areas while it decreases in the rest of the gap region a possible reason for this duality is the formation of an inland sea breeze phenomenon seth and giorgi 1996 due to the temperature difference over the irrigated and dry areas as a result of temperature differences the wind flows towards the dry and warmer regions from the cool and wet land areas due to the higher wind speeds over the irrigated grid cells which lowers the aerodynamic resistance the evapotranspiration is further enhanced the increase in the latent heat flux also causes an increase in water vapor concentration in the shallower boundary layer and consequently enhances the convective cloud formation the net climate feedback of clouds is not well understood in the literature bony et al 2015 coelho et al 2008 stephens 2005 still it is known that the increase in high altitude clouds e g cirrus trap more heat while low level clouds e g stratocumulus cause cooling by reflecting more sunlight convective clouds are generally optically thick low level clouds thus we might expect a decrease in net surface radiation due to the enhanced convection however the irrigation simulations resulted in an increase of net radiation at the surface this occurs for several reasons firstly the surface albedo decreases and so the subsequent absorptance of shortwave radiation i e the ratio of absorbed to incoming shortwave radiation at the surface increases secondly irrigation causes a statistically significant decrease in outgoing net longwave radiation see fig 5 due to the evaporative cooling of the skin temperature leading to a decrease in upward longwave radiation at the surface as suggested by the stefan boltzmann law the driver of the changes in temperature is the change in the partitioning of the available energy between latent and sensible heat fluxes due to lulc change in the gap region the starting point is the increase in soil moisture due to irrigation this in turn may lead to the direct soil moisture precipitation feedback mechanism which is discussed in several studies betts et al 1996 dirmeyer et al 2009 eltahir 1998 koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2010 this direct positive feedback mechanism is simply the recycling effect between increased soil moisture and increased precipitation through increased evapotranspiration eltahir and bras 1996 this feedback exemplifies the important role of surface turbulent fluxes in controlling precipitation by their modulation of the available moisture in the boundary layer in addition there is another indirect feedback of soil moisture precipitation via boundary layer dynamics ek and holtslag 2004 lawrence and slingo 2005 through this mechanism an increase in soil moisture leads to a repartitioning of the available energy with an increase in latent heat flux and a decrease in the sensible heat flux the bowen ratio decrease in turn leads to a shallower boundary layer we can see this response in our simulations too table 3 at the same time as discussed darker and cooler soil enhances net surface radiation by absorbing more solar radiation and reducing longwave emissions the combination of the higher water vapor concentration and the shallower boundary layer leads to an increase in moist static energy which accelerates the development of convective processes lawrence and slingo 2005 this indirect feedback mechanism can explain the increase in convective precipitation that we find in our simulations the importance of soil moisture for enhanced precipitation in semi arid has been shown in many other modeling studies alter et al 2015 koster et al 2004 taylor et al 2011 the indirect soil moisture precipitation mechanism may be a positive amplifying or negative damping feedback depending on the analysis region or the employed model our findings in their current form suggest a positive soil moisture precipitation feedback mechanism in the etb more studies are needed to understand the control of the vertical resolution on land surface boundary layer interactions findell and eltahir 2003 recently tuttle and salvucci 2017 showed that three factors long timescale variability precipitation persistence and endogeneity between soil moisture and precipitation must be accounted for in order to determine the sign and strength of the soil moisture precipitation feedback in our study the increase in precipitation is much less compared to the evapotranspiration increase over the etb fig 7 shows that the seasonal cycle of water surplus p e values mainly changes during the irrigation months april through september in the headwaters area the positive values of precipitation minus evapotranspiration p e shows a water surplus for all irrigation simulations however in the euphrates part of the gap region the modeled p e values are negative for both the partly and fully irrigated simulations fig 8 therefore the irrigation practices lead to water loss over the gap region according to our model results here we assume that all of the committed water amount 15 8 billion m3 per year kibaroglu and maden 2014 is released to the downstream countries from the euphrates river every year under the current irrigation conditions i e the partly irrigated land use map the water surplus in the headwaters area of the euphrates 19 1 billion m3 per year is not enough to balance the combined water deficit of the euphrates part of the gap region 6 3 billion m3 per year and water commitment to the downstream countries 15 8 billion m3 per year the water surplus of the entire etb headwaters area seems to be adequate for the water demand of the entire gap region for the current conditions however in the case of completion of the irrigation projects it appears that the gap region will experience significant water shortage even after transferring all the water surplus from the headwaters wei et al 2013 show that irrigation induced water deficit may not be sustainable in several regions including the embs that they identified through the ratio of precipitation and evapotranspiration increases by using reanalysis datasets the possible increase in evapotranspiration due to the irrigation in the gap region has been highlighted in the studies of kolars and mitchell 1991 and ozdogan and salvucci 2004 focusing on the harran plain ozdogan and salvucci 2004 used observations from a meteorological station to investigate the complex feedback mechanism between the available water at the surface and evaporation through bouchet s complementary theory similar to our results they demonstrate a shift from a water limited to an energy limited regime through irrigation as hypothesized in the theory of bouchet irrigation decreases the potential evaporation while increasing the actual evaporation the dynamic water budget of the basin was also modeled in the studies of kavvas et al 2011 and ohara et al 2011 in both studies they computed the water budget for a pre gap time period by using the outputs of a hydroclimate model that they validated over the whole euphrates tigris basin another water balance study in the etb was conducted by evans and zaitchik 2008 with their implementation of two irrigation algorithms added to a land surface scheme they evaluated the efficiency of irrigation systems such as flood and drip for the basin they demonstrated significant decreases in evapotranspiration and irrigation water demand by using drip irrigation rather than flood irrigation their study concluded that the feasibility of a planned syrian irrigation expansion is only possible with modernization of the irrigation systems their results could similarly apply to the irrigation plans under the gap project in the recent years updated irrigation applications by dsi personal communication are promising in terms of water efficiency and reducing the water loss the gradual replacement of flood irrigation with sprinkle and drip irrigation systems has the potential to reduce the irrigation return flow in the gap region reduction of water loss through efficient irrigation systems would also reduce the water stress on the downstream region due to the upstream water use in this transboundary river basin which has a large number of collaboration and conflict events due to water stress munia et al 2016 the increasing water demand of the irrigated region gap seems to be barely compensated by the water supply of the headwaters of the euphrates tigris basin moreover our high resolution simulations show that the water need of the gap region may not be met from the water storage of the headwaters area once all planned irrigation projects are completed this implies that the further agricultural expansion in the region might not be sustainable under present time climate conditions our simulations use the same climate forcing so that the water loss rates for different lulc stages in the gap region are calculated under the same climate conditions however climate change induced by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gasses has been projected to have adverse effects increase temperature and decrease precipitation in the etb e g bozkurt et al 2012 bozkurt and sen 2013 evans 2009 önol et al 2014 this brings up another important question that this study has not addressed what will be the combined effects of irrigation induced lulc changes and the greenhouse gas emissions on the hydroclimate of the etb the integrated impacts of these will likely exacerbate the water budget problem this study reveals 6 summary and conclusions this study investigates the hydroclimatic effects of the human induced lulc changes in the upper euphrates tigris basin etb by conducting sensitivity simulations with a regional climate model under present time climate conditions the lulc change is primarily characterized by increasing irrigation and reservoir area in this region for the sensitivity simulations we created two new lulc maps over the default map of the model namely the current and future lulc maps reflecting the current situation and future plans of the irrigation and dam areas respectively after a promising evaluation of the performance of the employed regional climate model regcm4 with a focus on the reproduction of the temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration fields we carried out the lulc change simulations whose main results are given below 1 compared to the results from the reference run the simulations with current and future lulc maps indicate that the 2 m surface air temperature values over the irrigated grids decrease by about 0 4 0 8 c while the cooling in skin temperature was around 0 9 2 1 c for the current and future irrigation conditions respectively our findings are consistent with various studies that have demonstrated the cooling effect of irrigation 2 irrigation in the gap region locally alters the surface energy balance through a statistically significant decrease in the bowen ratio evapotranspiration indicates statistically significant increases of 51 and 113 in the current and future irrigation simulations respectively this suggests that the expansion of the irrigated fields affect the water resources of the upper etb significantly by enhancing water loss through evapotranspiration 3 the strong positive feedback mechanism between soil moisture and precipitation is also observed in our study the combined effect of increased latent heat flux and a shallower boundary layer leads to increased convective precipitation over the irrigated parts of the upper etb mostly in spring 4 the conversion of a land use type can alter climate due to its effect on surface heat fluxes here it is shown that the applied irrigation scheme in the upper etb perturbs both the surface water and energy balances via significantly increasing the evapotranspiration these results indicate that the future modeling studies should include lulc changes for a more realistic representation of the climate responses 5 according to the diurnal cycle analysis the effects of irrigation are visible especially during the daytime the seasonal cycle analysis showed that the time of the largest changes in climatic variables coincides with the irrigation months april through september 6 finally increased water loss through evapotranspiration will put pressure on water partitioned for the energy production and for release to the downstream countries it seems that the solution of this multidimensional problem of water resources in the basin will become more difficult with further agricultural expansion a sustainable water use practice might be achieved in the region through a modernization of the implemented and planned irrigation systems in this study we showed that land use land cover changes in the upper euphrates tigris basin will adversely affect the water budget of this region which will have implications not only for turkey but also for the downstream countries the water related tension is already high in this semi arid region some adaptation measures can be implemented to tackle the water loss problem which has a potential for shaping the future water resources management and policies in the region the importance of the water energy food nexus in the implementation of an integrated approach for transboundary water resources management in the etb has already emerged at the national and international levels kibaroglu and gürsoy 2015 our study encourages the environmental scientists and policy makers to address the issue of water loss via evapotranspiration as a corollary our study points out the potential future consequences of the combination of the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 dilemma and changing climate of the euphrates tigris basin declaration of competing interest

demonstrate how this technique can supplement classical approaches such as analyses based on piper diagrams the main purpose of this work is to differentiate clearly and comprehensibly between geogenic mineralized groundwater and salt water plume influenced groundwater using the self organizing map 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is a former potash mine in northern germany the potash works and its tailings pile are located directly above a salt dome this structure is characterized by deep faults originating from tectonic activity during the period jurassic to tertiary allowing the plastic and less dense salt to rise into the overburden formations and to form a diapir the potash deposits within this structure were the target of mining activities due to circulating groundwater the uppermost part of the salt dome was dissolved flattening the salt dome and generating a so called salt table the residuals insoluble or less soluble rocks such as clay carbonates and gypsum form a caprock above the salt dome the caprock is secondary karstified and the resulting cavities are partially filled with younger sediments dissolution processes left their traces in the surface morphology and form subrosion zones with the caprock located at shallow depth various depressions in the study area were formed due to subrosion and are partially filled with water see fig 10 lepper et al 1984 the mining residues were piled up to a tailings pile mainly composed of halite nacl kieserite mgso 4 n h 2 o mirabilite na 2 so 4 n h 2 o gypsum caso 4 and anhydrite caso 4 2 h 2 o sylvinite kcl and carnallite kmgcl 3 n h 2 o as well as clay and sand because the magnesium sulfate kieserite was not of economical value in the past its fraction in the tailings pile is relatively high european comission 2009 precipitation infiltrates into the tailings pile mantle and percolates as interflow into a collector trench hypodermic runoff most of this brine is collected in a surrounding trench and discharged into a pond however a certain amount still infiltrates from the footprint area of the tailings pile mantle into the subsurface originating from this source certain observation wells downgradient are possibly affected by the tailings brine and mixed with geogenic saline groundwater fugro 2014 fugro 2014 the unconfined quaternary porous aquifers in the study area are composed of pleistocene meltwater sands and gravels these aquifers are superimposed by loam 2 3 m thick and intermitted by glacial till layers 2 5 m thick of low or very low conductivity the latter ones are extensive in the southern and discontinuous in the northern parts of the area hence hydraulic connections between the individual aquifer layers are likely fine grained tertiary sediments or caprock confine the aquifer at the bottom fig 1 groundwater flow is oriented south to north towards the river in order to accommodate for the different aquifers observation wells are partially built in doubles or triples next to each other e g well 43 s hallow m edium and d eep see fig 10 fugro 2014 2 2 hydrochemical data groundwater quality is partially affected by mining activities among other factors such as agriculture and naturally occurring brines mining caused elevated concentrations in chloride sulfate and magnesium ions in the groundwater downgradient of the tailings pile in deeper layers naturally mineralized groundwaters occur originating from the dissolution of the salt dome and caprock minerals the typical composition of different types of groundwater in the area of interest is described in table 1 fugro 2014 lepper et al 1984 groundwater analyses from the mining area sampled twice per year from 2011 until 2015 in groundwater observation wells and surface water bodies provide the hydrochemical database in total 445 samples were available multiple parameters were measured standard ones major ions electrical conductivity ph as well as trace elements nitrate and organic species depending on the sampling location not all parameters are always available however the major ions ca2 mg2 k na hco 3 2 cl and so 4 2 were commonly measured 2 3 the som algorithm the som converts the nonlinear statistical relationship between high dimensional data into simple geometric relationships of their image points on a regular two dimensional grid of nodes the som thereby compresses information while preserving the most important topological and or metric relationships of the primary data thus it may also be regarded as an abstraction measure the obtained feature maps can help to visualize patterns in large datasets kohonen et al 2001 in addition to these two aspects visualization and abstraction cluster analysis is performed on the som feature map using hierarchical clustering vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 in general the som algorithm maps a sequence of observation vectors x t r n with features x k k 1 2 n from the input data space r n onto a regular two dimensional array of nodes every node i is associated with a sequence of successively computed model vectors m i t r n kohonen et al 1996 kohonen 2013 for this work the batch type process was used which runs the algorithm for the whole input data set at once the model vectors m i for the som can be initialized randomly however convergence is faster and more stable if the initial values are selected as a regular two dimensional sequence of vectors taken along a hyperplane spanned by the two largest principal components of the input vectors x r n the centroid of the hyperplane should coincide with the feature mean x mean and the ratio of the two main dimensions should be proportional to the length of the first two principal components ratio of the two largest eigenvalues this method is called linear initialization it is particularly recommended for the batch computation with euclidean input vectors kohonen 2013 kohonen et al 2001 in self organizing maps nodes are displayed on a regular hexagonal array that means that every node has six neighbors the horizontal and vertical axes are dimensionless kohonen 2013 usually the ratio of the axes of the lattice should correspond to the ratio of the standard deviations in the data given by the two largest principal components garcía and gonzález 2004 kohonen 2013 before the som output can be used clusters are formed based on the distance of the model vectors using hierarchical clustering with average linkage this two stage approach 1 using a som for visualization to show the relation between the data points and 2 clustering it subsequently performs better than direct clustering the reason is that many clustering approaches such as hierarchical clustering require the clusters to be compact and well separated in real world data this is rarely the case because gaps between the clusters are obscured by outliers or the clusters overlap a first sorting with a som using a reasonably large grid can overcome these problems the som model vectors are local averages of the observation vectors which makes them less sensitive to noise furthermore computational time is reduced vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 the clustering outcome is evaluated calculating the silhouette coefficients and displaying it for the whole dataset at once in a so called silhouette plot this silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster and which ones are located somewhere in between clusters the silhouette ranges between plus and minus one a value close to one indicates that the object is close to its own cluster and far from neighboring clusters and vice versa rousseeuw 1987 2 4 methodology the workflow from the hydrochemical analyses to the interpretation is presented in fig 2 steps 1 4 will be addressed in this section steps 5 7 are part of the results 2 4 1 data pre processing the species of the water analyses are given in mg l the data is converted into meq l to ensure that heavier and higher charged ions do not distort the outcome absolute concentrations were converted into relative concentrations by dividing them by the total salinity of the respective sample this conversion step accommodates for the huge variations of concentration between the samples several orders of magnitude highly saline samples from the tailings had to be made comparable to freshwater diluted samples this was necessary because the som learning algorithm uses the euclidean distances between the model vectors as the origin of the samples is of particular interest the goal of the som is to identify small differences in relative concentrations the concentration differences are illustrated in fig 3 top left and top right and demonstrate that tds varies within five orders of magnitude as mentioned above the som learning algorithm uses the euclidean distance between the input vectors concentrations to produce model vectors therefore incomplete datasets had to be removed to ensure comparable distances to place equal emphasis on each parameter within one sample the parameters were standardized in the last pre processing step to have a zero mean and a standard deviation of one larger euclidean distances would otherwise lead to disproportional emphasis on chemical species with higher concentrations such as chloride and neglect the less concentrated ones such as potassium nguyen et al 2015 kohonen 2013 the distribution of the major ions before and after standardization is shown in fig 3 bottom left and bottom right 2 4 2 som training the self organizing map was trained using the batch algorithm with linear initialization using the kohonen wehrens and buydens 2007 package in r r core team 2017 the initialization of the model vectors based on pca follows a code by yan yan 2003 the implementation of the piper diagram in r a code by lessels lessels 2013 2 4 3 som training output the som learning process results in various outputs the main output are the som model vectors one for every cell of the som with the same dimensions as the training data i e the seven major ions the som model vectors are commonly visualized as heat maps showing every dimension in a single 2d grid fig 6 furthermore the som model vectors are used for clustering another important output is the classification of every input vector into its respective som cell winner unit shown in fig 7 the som model vectors contain seven features in this case the major ions visualizing those features for each cluster allows an interpretation of every single cluster the assignment of the chemical signature to the clusters is based on the relative concentration shown by the som heatmaps neither knowledge of the area nor the location of the samples are used instead spatial and hydrogeological knowledge will complete the interpretation made in this part regarding the source see section 3 3 2 4 4 clustering the som before the som output can be used clusters are formed based on the distance of the model vectors using hierarchical clustering with average linkage the som itself is already a clustering method however to facilitate the analysis of the map and the data similar units of the som have to be grouped the summary should provide the user with a quick overview of the structure of the som showing clearly the interesting aggregations of the data the number of clusters was chosen calculating the within cluster sum of squares wss for 2 14 clusters and looking for a so called elbow point the result is five clusters as a reasonable trade off between low amount of clusters and low wss fig 4 to evaluate the performance of the clustering results produced by the som the silhouette coefficient was utilized the results of clustering are presented fig 5 in general a reasonable clustering could be achieved especially for cluster two three and five these show mainly values close to one and no negative ones indicating that the sample is close to its own cluster and far from neighboring clusters however even though the majority of the samples in cluster one and four also show silhouette coefficients close to one a few show negative coefficients the reason for these analyses showing a low or negative silhouette coefficient is addressed in section 3 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical characteristics of the clusters the som heatmap fig 6 is one of the most powerful features of the som approach the same som map is plotted seven times each highlighting another dimension major ion of the model vectors one vector for each som cell additionally the boundaries given by hierarchical clustering using average linkage are superimposed indicated by thick black lines this is helpful for the interpretation of the determined clusters each cluster shows at least one chemical species that is significantly elevated relative to the other ones bicarbonate is highest in cluster 4 potassium is highest in cluster 2 magnesium is strongly elevated in cluster 1 while sodium is elevated in cluster 3 sulfate is highest in cluster 5 calcium shows highest concentrations in the areas 4 and 5 while chloride is elevated in clusters 3 and 1 both separated by a boundary fig 7 shows the clustered som to demonstrate the reason why which water sample is attributed to a certain cluster the median maximum minimum as well as the 25 and 75 percentile of the absolute concentrations and the tds in mg l were calculated for each major ion the results are shown as box plots in fig 8 the box plots show that tds shows the highest absolute values and also the largest scatter in all clusters the respective clusters are described below the colors of the headings correspond to the colors of the clusters in fig 7 cluster 1 95 obs is defined by its high relative magnesium values and shows elevated absolute concentrations for all major ions and tds the total salinity is approximately one order of magnitude larger than that in the cluster with the second highest concentration chloride has by far the largest absolute concentrations followed by sulfate sodium magnesium and potassium no outliers can be found the whiskers are short all features show a strong positive skewness cluster 2 32 obs is characterized by high relative potassium values and shows the second highest total salinity compared to the remaining ions chloride shows highest absolute concentrations followed by sulfate and potassium cluster 3 32 obs exhibits high relative sodium concentrations total salinity is again less about one third of cluster 2 highest absolute concentrations are again reached by chloride followed by sodium and sulfate the potassium and magnesium content is negligible cluster 4 258 obs shows by far the lowest tds concentration it has a high relative bicarbonate content which also shows the highest absolute values followed by calcium sulfate and chloride this cluster shows long whiskers in comparison with the spread of the box and plenty of outliers reflecting the large variability in concentration cluster 5 28 obs has a high relative sulfate content and highest absolute concentrations as well followed by bicarbonate and calcium tds is slightly higher compared to the values in cluster 4 all features show a strong positive skewness with very few outliers fig 8 also shows the importance of considering the relative concentrations rather than the absolute ones otherwise cluster 1 to 3 would probably be merged due to their high absolute chloride concentrations 3 2 integrating som and piper diagrams in order to link clustering using som and classical hydrogeological visualization methods the data used for the som training is plotted in a piper diagram fetter 2001 the piper diagram expanded by som based clusters is shown in fig 9 and is interpreted in the following clusters 1 2 and 3 mg2 k and na dominated can all be found in the right corner of the sample cloud although there is a certain separation distinguishing them without the som clustering would be challenging this area of the piper diagram describes nacl waters cluster 4 bicarbonate dominated can mainly be found in the left corner this area of the piper plot represents ca hco3 waters typical for shallow fresh groundwaters cluster 5 sulfate dominated data points are situated at the top of the piper plot corresponding to ground waters resulting from gypsum dissolution at the caprock for further discrimination the cation and anion piper diagrams can be employed fig 9 bottom in the cation chart some of the black data points cluster 1 mg2 dominated can be separated visibly and assigned to the mg2 type the red cluster 2 k dominated and the green cluster 3 na dominated can be assigned to the na k type in the cation chart but barely separated although the classification chart in fig 9 performs well for a preliminary classification mixed regions like the mg2 na and k clusters would be hard to separate into individual significant entities 3 3 spatial distribution of the respective clusters in the next step the clustered measurements are set in spatial relation to each other and the features of the mining area according to their position in fig 10 in the following we discuss the possible origin of each cluster and provide extended cluster maps with labels based on the results of the spatial hydrogeological analysis see fig 7 cluster 1 represents mg2 dominated plume influenced water and can be found in observation wells north of the tailings pile the observation wells in direct neighborhood of the tailings pile sampling locations 21 and 41 show this cluster at all depth levels in observation wells further to the north sampling locations 43 42 and 24 this cluster only shows up in the middle and deeper part hence a relocation of the mg2 dominated plume cluster to deeper layers can be observed sampling location 8 is a pond where brine from the trench at the foot of the tailings pile is collected hence is correctly assigned to the cluster plume the cluster contains 95 observations distributed over 9 observation points cluster 2 is k dominated and can be found only north downgradient of the former production area sampling locations 39 44 10 and 13 which probably shows an influence by the production activities also the chemical composition the main product of this plant was kcl speaks in favor of this interpretation 32 observations at five observation points belong to this cluster cluster 3 is dominated by na and the occurrence is not restricted to one individual area the cluster appears to be randomly distributed over the entire area upstream sampling locations 7 and 1 downstream 23 and 16 and west 22 d of the tailings pile which suggests a geogenic origin furthermore this cluster is vertically restricted to the deeper layers as these observation wells are situated in or close to subrosion zones where the caprock is located at shallow depths 50 m below ground this is assumed to be the origin of the geogenic saltwaters the cluster consists of 32 measurements at five observation points cluster 4 is hco 3 dominated and the largest cluster 258 observations at 38 observation points and can also be found at most observation wells this cluster represents recently recharged groundwater of geogenic origin and shows only minor concentrations of ions most shallow wells are assigned to this cluster even though the lower part might be influenced by saltwater examples are observation wells 24 s 23 s and 20 s however some wells 44 19 and 45 are assigned at all depths to this cluster due to the lack of saltwater influence the same applies to most surface water bodies sample locations 2 and 28 and the observation points along the river 25 30 and 26 cluster 5 is characterized by high so 4 2 and can only be found in the south west observation points 20 d and 47 d as well as at 29 far from the production area or the tailings pile the location in the subrosion zones suggests calcium sulfate rich caprock as the origin of these geogenic saltwaters four observation points with a total of 28 observations are part of this cluster together with the above interpretation fig 10 shows that the som method is able to detect density dependent flow of concentrated saltwater close to the tailings pile at observation well 21 both depth levels can be attributed to the influence of the mg2 dominated brine plume cluster 1 while further to the north with the plume sinking to the bottom of the aquifer only the deeper levels give evidence of this water type further geogenic na and so 4 2 water types appear only at deeper levels fig 10 also reveals outliers that do not correspond to the hydrochemical facies of the other measurements at the respective observation wells those outliers can be found at the sampling points 16 17 13 and 10 regarding the negative silhouette coefficients in section 2 4 4 the non ideal clustering of these analyses can be explained by mixing of different groundwaters in cluster one the analyses with negative silhouette coefficient were obtained at the observation wells 21 d and 43 d for those deeper wells an influence by geogenic saline groundwaters cannot be excluded in cluster four the analyses with negative silhouette coefficient were obtained at 24 s and 43 s the respective deeper wells at those locations are influenced by saline waters so a slight influence due to fluctuating water levels is likely transitions of one cluster to another can theoretically be tracked using the som clustering approach however within the available observation period of five years no transient effects of plume migration were observed 4 conclusion and perspectives we applied an artificial neural network technique the self organizing map combined with a hierarchical clustering approach to interpret a hydrochemical data set obtained at a former potash mining site in germany with respect to the identification of the salinity source the som clustering approach succeeded in assigning the groundwater samples automatically according to their chemical composition together with geological and hydrogeological information five clusters could be conclusively identified and separated into geogenic and anthropogenic origins here the som proved to be a robust and straightforward method to condense the information content of large datasets and provide a clear and concise overview the two geogenic clusters with elevated salt concentrations sodium and sulfate dominated exhibit remarkable features the observation points of both are located at subrosion zones this highlights that more than one specific geogenic fluid can originate from the caprock as differences in their chemical compositions must be caused by variations of the parent rock composition within the field site two main types of caprock exist anhydrite and halite can explain geogenic brines of two different compositions the two anthropogenic clusters with elevated salinity potassium and magnesium dominated could be separated clearly according to their chemical composition and assigned to their source the performance of neural networks generally depends on the volume of data available for the training procedure thus the som method performs best where large numbers of measurements can be recorded kohonen 2013 unfortunately this is not the case for many hydrogeological applications viable alternatives are in situ sampling using direct push methods and automatic groundwater sampling as demonstrated in this work the cluster assignments of samples obtained at the same well do not change during the sampled time interval changes in groundwater chemistry may take several decades if groundwater flow is slow hence to enhance the quality of the som method increasing the number of sampling points using direct push might be an option worth considering in this work we focused on the major ions because they represent the most exhaustive and reliable data sources from the field site however the som might perform even better if additional information e g concentrations of trace elements or isotopes are included to reveal additional information about the origin of the respective waters the bicarbonate cluster for example is mostly found at shallow levels and possibly influenced by agricultural activities however with the current setup an agriculturally influenced cluster could not be detected due to features partially missing in the training procedure of the som such as nitrate acknowledgement this research was supported by k s aktiengesellschaft we thank the colleagues of the k s geology department who provided insight and expertise furthermore we thank the reviewers for their helpful comments

in the area of interest is described in table 1 fugro 2014 lepper et al 1984 groundwater analyses from the mining area sampled twice per year from 2011 until 2015 in groundwater observation wells and surface water bodies provide the hydrochemical database in total 445 samples were available multiple parameters were measured standard ones major ions electrical conductivity ph as well as trace elements nitrate and organic species depending on the sampling location not all parameters are always available however the major ions ca2 mg2 k na hco 3 2 cl and so 4 2 were commonly measured 2 3 the som algorithm the som converts the nonlinear statistical relationship between high dimensional data into simple geometric relationships of their image points on a regular two dimensional grid of nodes the som thereby compresses information while preserving the most important topological and or metric relationships of the primary data thus it may also be regarded as an abstraction measure the obtained feature maps can help to visualize patterns in large datasets kohonen et al 2001 in addition to these two aspects visualization and abstraction cluster analysis is performed on the som feature map using hierarchical clustering vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 in general the som algorithm maps a sequence of observation vectors x t r n with features x k k 1 2 n from the input data space r n onto a regular two dimensional array of nodes every node i is associated with a sequence of successively computed model vectors m i t r n kohonen et al 1996 kohonen 2013 for this work the batch type process was used which runs the algorithm for the whole input data set at once the model vectors m i for the som can be initialized randomly however convergence is faster and more stable if the initial values are selected as a regular two dimensional sequence of vectors taken along a hyperplane spanned by the two largest principal components of the input vectors x r n the centroid of the hyperplane should coincide with the feature mean x mean and the ratio of the two main dimensions should be proportional to the length of the first two principal components ratio of the two largest eigenvalues this method is called linear initialization it is particularly recommended for the batch computation with euclidean input vectors kohonen 2013 kohonen et al 2001 in self organizing maps nodes are displayed on a regular hexagonal array that means that every node has six neighbors the horizontal and vertical axes are dimensionless kohonen 2013 usually the ratio of the axes of the lattice should correspond to the ratio of the standard deviations in the data given by the two largest principal components garcía and gonzález 2004 kohonen 2013 before the som output can be used clusters are formed based on the distance of the model vectors using hierarchical clustering with average linkage this two stage approach 1 using a som for visualization to show the relation between the data points and 2 clustering it subsequently performs better than direct clustering the reason is that many clustering approaches such as hierarchical clustering require the clusters to be compact and well separated in real world data this is rarely the case because gaps between the clusters are obscured by outliers or the clusters overlap a first sorting with a som using a reasonably large grid can overcome these problems the som model vectors are local averages of the observation vectors which makes them less sensitive to noise furthermore computational time is reduced vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 the clustering outcome is evaluated calculating the silhouette coefficients and displaying it for the whole dataset at once in a so called silhouette plot this silhouette shows which objects lie well within their cluster and which ones are located somewhere in between clusters the silhouette ranges between plus and minus one a value close to one indicates that the object is close to its own cluster and far from neighboring clusters and vice versa rousseeuw 1987 2 4 methodology the workflow from the hydrochemical analyses to the interpretation is presented in fig 2 steps 1 4 will be addressed in this section steps 5 7 are part of the results 2 4 1 data pre processing the species of the water analyses are given in mg l the data is converted into meq l to ensure that heavier and higher charged ions do not distort the outcome absolute concentrations were converted into relative concentrations by dividing them by the total salinity of the respective sample this conversion step accommodates for the huge variations of concentration between the samples several orders of magnitude highly saline samples from the tailings had to be made comparable to freshwater diluted samples this was necessary because the som learning algorithm uses the euclidean distances between the model vectors as the origin of the samples is of particular interest the goal of the som is to identify small differences in relative concentrations the concentration differences are illustrated in fig 3 top left and top right and demonstrate that tds varies within five orders of magnitude as mentioned above the som learning algorithm uses the euclidean distance between the input vectors concentrations to produce model vectors therefore incomplete datasets had to be removed to ensure comparable distances to place equal emphasis on each parameter within one sample the parameters were standardized in the last pre processing step to have a zero mean and a standard deviation of one larger euclidean distances would otherwise lead to disproportional emphasis on chemical species with higher concentrations such as chloride and neglect the less concentrated ones such as potassium nguyen et al 2015 kohonen 2013 the distribution of the major ions before and after standardization is shown in fig 3 bottom left and bottom right 2 4 2 som training the self organizing map was trained using the batch algorithm with linear initialization using the kohonen wehrens and buydens 2007 package in r r core team 2017 the initialization of the model vectors based on pca follows a code by yan yan 2003 the implementation of the piper diagram in r a code by lessels lessels 2013 2 4 3 som training output the som learning process results in various outputs the main output are the som model vectors one for every cell of the som with the same dimensions as the training data i e the seven major ions the som model vectors are commonly visualized as heat maps showing every dimension in a single 2d grid fig 6 furthermore the som model vectors are used for clustering another important output is the classification of every input vector into its respective som cell winner unit shown in fig 7 the som model vectors contain seven features in this case the major ions visualizing those features for each cluster allows an interpretation of every single cluster the assignment of the chemical signature to the clusters is based on the relative concentration shown by the som heatmaps neither knowledge of the area nor the location of the samples are used instead spatial and hydrogeological knowledge will complete the interpretation made in this part regarding the source see section 3 3 2 4 4 clustering the som before the som output can be used clusters are formed based on the distance of the model vectors using hierarchical clustering with average linkage the som itself is already a clustering method however to facilitate the analysis of the map and the data similar units of the som have to be grouped the summary should provide the user with a quick overview of the structure of the som showing clearly the interesting aggregations of the data the number of clusters was chosen calculating the within cluster sum of squares wss for 2 14 clusters and looking for a so called elbow point the result is five clusters as a reasonable trade off between low amount of clusters and low wss fig 4 to evaluate the performance of the clustering results produced by the som the silhouette coefficient was utilized the results of clustering are presented fig 5 in general a reasonable clustering could be achieved especially for cluster two three and five these show mainly values close to one and no negative ones indicating that the sample is close to its own cluster and far from neighboring clusters however even though the majority of the samples in cluster one and four also show silhouette coefficients close to one a few show negative coefficients the reason for these analyses showing a low or negative silhouette coefficient is addressed in section 3 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical characteristics of the clusters the som heatmap fig 6 is one of the most powerful features of the som approach the same som map is plotted seven times each highlighting another dimension major ion of the model vectors one vector for each som cell additionally the boundaries given by hierarchical clustering using average linkage are superimposed indicated by thick black lines this is helpful for the interpretation of the determined clusters each cluster shows at least one chemical species that is significantly elevated relative to the other ones bicarbonate is highest in cluster 4 potassium is highest in cluster 2 magnesium is strongly elevated in cluster 1 while sodium is elevated in cluster 3 sulfate is highest in cluster 5 calcium shows highest concentrations in the areas 4 and 5 while chloride is elevated in clusters 3 and 1 both separated by a boundary fig 7 shows the clustered som to demonstrate the reason why which water sample is attributed to a certain cluster the median maximum minimum as well as the 25 and 75 percentile of the absolute concentrations and the tds in mg l were calculated for each major ion the results are shown as box plots in fig 8 the box plots show that tds shows the highest absolute values and also the largest scatter in all clusters the respective clusters are described below the colors of the headings correspond to the colors of the clusters in fig 7 cluster 1 95 obs is defined by its high relative magnesium values and shows elevated absolute concentrations for all major ions and tds the total salinity is approximately one order of magnitude larger than that in the cluster with the second highest concentration chloride has by far the largest absolute concentrations followed by sulfate sodium magnesium and potassium no outliers can be found the whiskers are short all features show a strong positive skewness cluster 2 32 obs is characterized by high relative potassium values and shows the second highest total salinity compared to the remaining ions chloride shows highest absolute concentrations followed by sulfate and potassium cluster 3 32 obs exhibits high relative sodium concentrations total salinity is again less about one third of cluster 2 highest absolute concentrations are again reached by chloride followed by sodium and sulfate the potassium and magnesium content is negligible cluster 4 258 obs shows by far the lowest tds concentration it has a high relative bicarbonate content which also shows the highest absolute values followed by calcium sulfate and chloride this cluster shows long whiskers in comparison with the spread of the box and plenty of outliers reflecting the large variability in concentration cluster 5 28 obs has a high relative sulfate content and highest absolute concentrations as well followed by bicarbonate and calcium tds is slightly higher compared to the values in cluster 4 all features show a strong positive skewness with very few outliers fig 8 also shows the importance of considering the relative concentrations rather than the absolute ones otherwise cluster 1 to 3 would probably be merged due to their high absolute chloride concentrations 3 2 integrating som and piper diagrams in order to link clustering using som and classical hydrogeological visualization methods the data used for the som training is plotted in a piper diagram fetter 2001 the piper diagram expanded by som based clusters is shown in fig 9 and is interpreted in the following clusters 1 2 and 3 mg2 k and na dominated can all be found in the right corner of the sample cloud although there is a certain separation distinguishing them without the som clustering would be challenging this area of the piper diagram describes nacl waters cluster 4 bicarbonate dominated can mainly be found in the left corner this area of the piper plot represents ca hco3 waters typical for shallow fresh groundwaters cluster 5 sulfate dominated data points are situated at the top of the piper plot corresponding to ground waters resulting from gypsum dissolution at the caprock for further discrimination the cation and anion piper diagrams can be employed fig 9 bottom in the cation chart some of the black data points cluster 1 mg2 dominated can be separated visibly and assigned to the mg2 type the red cluster 2 k dominated and the green cluster 3 na dominated can be assigned to the na k type in the cation chart but barely separated although the classification chart in fig 9 performs well for a preliminary classification mixed regions like the mg2 na and k clusters would be hard to separate into individual significant entities 3 3 spatial distribution of the respective clusters in the next step the clustered measurements are set in spatial relation to each other and the features of the mining area according to their position in fig 10 in the following we discuss the possible origin of each cluster and provide extended cluster maps with labels based on the results of the spatial hydrogeological analysis see fig 7 cluster 1 represents mg2 dominated plume influenced water and can be found in observation wells north of the tailings pile the observation wells in direct neighborhood of the tailings pile sampling locations 21 and 41 show this cluster at all depth levels in observation wells further to the north sampling locations 43 42 and 24 this cluster only shows up in the middle and deeper part hence a relocation of the mg2 dominated plume cluster to deeper layers can be observed sampling location 8 is a pond where brine from the trench at the foot of the tailings pile is collected hence is correctly assigned to the cluster plume the cluster contains 95 observations distributed over 9 observation points cluster 2 is k dominated and can be found only north downgradient of the former production area sampling locations 39 44 10 and 13 which probably shows an influence by the production activities also the chemical composition the main product of this plant was kcl speaks in favor of this interpretation 32 observations at five observation points belong to this cluster cluster 3 is dominated by na and the occurrence is not restricted to one individual area the cluster appears to be randomly distributed over the entire area upstream sampling locations 7 and 1 downstream 23 and 16 and west 22 d of the tailings pile which suggests a geogenic origin furthermore this cluster is vertically restricted to the deeper layers as these observation wells are situated in or close to subrosion zones where the caprock is located at shallow depths 50 m below ground this is assumed to be the origin of the geogenic saltwaters the cluster consists of 32 measurements at five observation points cluster 4 is hco 3 dominated and the largest cluster 258 observations at 38 observation points and can also be found at most observation wells this cluster represents recently recharged groundwater of geogenic origin and shows only minor concentrations of ions most shallow wells are assigned to this cluster even though the lower part might be influenced by saltwater examples are observation wells 24 s 23 s and 20 s however some wells 44 19 and 45 are assigned at all depths to this cluster due to the lack of saltwater influence the same applies to most surface water bodies sample locations 2 and 28 and the observation points along the river 25 30 and 26 cluster 5 is characterized by high so 4 2 and can only be found in the south west observation points 20 d and 47 d as well as at 29 far from the production area or the tailings pile the location in the subrosion zones suggests calcium sulfate rich caprock as the origin of these geogenic saltwaters four observation points with a total of 28 observations are part of this cluster together with the above interpretation fig 10 shows that the som method is able to detect density dependent flow of concentrated saltwater close to the tailings pile at observation well 21 both depth levels can be attributed to the influence of the mg2 dominated brine plume cluster 1 while further to the north with the plume sinking to the bottom of the aquifer only the deeper levels give evidence of this water type further geogenic na and so 4 2 water types appear only at deeper levels fig 10 also reveals outliers that do not correspond to the hydrochemical facies of the other measurements at the respective observation wells those outliers can be found at the sampling points 16 17 13 and 10 regarding the negative silhouette coefficients in section 2 4 4 the non ideal clustering of these analyses can be explained by mixing of different groundwaters in cluster one the analyses with negative silhouette coefficient were obtained at the observation wells 21 d and 43 d for those deeper wells an influence by geogenic saline groundwaters cannot be excluded in cluster four the analyses with negative silhouette coefficient were obtained at 24 s and 43 s the respective deeper wells at those locations are influenced by saline waters so a slight influence due to fluctuating water levels is likely transitions of one cluster to another can theoretically be tracked using the som clustering approach however within the available observation period of five years no transient effects of plume migration were observed 4 conclusion and perspectives we applied an artificial neural network technique the self organizing map combined with a hierarchical clustering approach to interpret a hydrochemical data set obtained at a former potash mining site in germany with respect to the identification of the salinity source the som clustering approach succeeded in assigning the groundwater samples automatically according to their chemical composition together with geological and hydrogeological information five clusters could be conclusively identified and separated into geogenic and anthropogenic origins here the som proved to be a robust and straightforward method to condense the information content of large datasets and provide a clear and concise overview the two geogenic clusters with elevated salt concentrations sodium and sulfate dominated exhibit remarkable features the observation points of both are located at subrosion zones this highlights that more than one specific geogenic fluid can originate from the caprock as differences in their chemical compositions must be caused by variations of the parent rock composition within the field site two main types of caprock exist anhydrite and halite can explain geogenic brines of two different compositions the two anthropogenic clusters with elevated salinity potassium and magnesium dominated could be separated clearly according to their chemical composition and assigned to their source the performance of neural networks generally depends on the volume of data available for the training procedure thus the som method performs best where large numbers of measurements can be recorded kohonen 2013 unfortunately this is not the case for many hydrogeological applications viable alternatives are in situ sampling using direct push methods and automatic groundwater sampling as demonstrated in this work the cluster assignments of samples obtained at the same well do not change during the sampled time interval changes in groundwater chemistry may take several decades if groundwater flow is slow hence to enhance the quality of the som method increasing the number of sampling points using direct push might be an option worth considering in this work we focused on the major ions because they represent the most exhaustive and reliable data sources from the field site however the som might perform even better if additional information e g concentrations of trace elements or isotopes are included to reveal additional information about the origin of the respective waters the bicarbonate cluster for example is mostly found at shallow levels and possibly influenced by agricultural activities however with the current setup an agriculturally influenced cluster could not be detected due to features partially missing in the training procedure of the som such as nitrate acknowledgement this research was supported by k s aktiengesellschaft we thank the

6317,the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s is considered to be one of the main soil hydraulic properties to simulate water transport in the vadose zone yet it is notoriously difficult to assess due to its large field scale variability and sensitivity to preferential flow paths with the increasing availability of convenient methods to measure the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k u the additional value of measuring k s could be questioned this study investigates the relevance of measuring k s in two ways firstly a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate which part of the hydraulic conductivity curve impacts the simulation of unsaturated water transport most it was found that hydraulic conductivity curve between 10 cm and 1000 cm matric head was affecting the simulation more than at saturation secondly a functional evaluation was performed by simulating water flow in six test fields according to three scenarios in which the hydraulic properties were determined with the measured k s and or k u the simulation of saturation degree at three depths was the least accurate in the scenario where only k s was measured remarkably the most accurate simulation was found in the scenario with only the measured k u according to these results measuring k u would be of greater importance than measuring k s for the simulation of water flow in the

vadose zone hydrology the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s is considered to be one of the principal soil physical properties it governs the flux of water through porous media as described in darcy s law despite it being relatively straight forward to measure the k s of a soil sample it is a notoriously difficult soil property to assess due to its high variability in space and time and sensitivity to sample scale or minor changes in soil structure crawford 1994 arvidsson 1997 brooks et al 2004 rahmati et al 2017 preferential flow paths such as macropores and cracks result in a high k s which can be regarded as not representative for the soil minor disturbances such as soil compaction or smearing of pores whilst sampling can reduce the measured k s significantly dane et al 2002 to overcome these issues a high number of replicated samples need to be taken making k s a costly and time consuming property to measure moreover the resulting data is often seemingly inconsistent and having a coefficient of variation 1 making the interpretation a challenge nielsen et al 1973 adding to that the non uniqueness of k s depending on the measuring and calculation method used can cause values to be significantly different verbist et al 2013 rezaei et al 2016b weninger et al 1559 morbidelli et al 2017 since soil degradation processes such as soil compaction are often associated with the decrease in macroporosity or connectivity thereof k s is frequently used as soil quality indicator lebert et al 2003 reynolds et al 2009 however since the variability of k s can be particularly high for cultivated soils picciafuoco et al 2019 some studies found that k s did not reflect the degree of soil compactness significantly arvidsson 1997 van den akker and de groot 2008 van der bolt et al 2016 this contradicts with the well established effect of soil compaction on infiltration perched water tables and erosion de haan and van der valk 1970 fullen 1985 verbist et al 2007 blanco canqui et al 2010 studies that simulate this effect based on measured k s i e without additional calibration are rare coquet 2005a coquet et al 2005b alaoui et al 2011 hartmann et al 2012 and simulations that estimate consequences of soil degradation at larger scale rarely rely on measured k s alaoui et al 2018 in the simulation of water flow the water retention curve θ h and the hydraulic conductivity curve k h are usually linked measuring soil water content at various matric head h levels is a standard lab procedure and allows to fit a water retention model but measuring the hydraulic conductivity at various unsaturated states is not usually only k s is measured and is combined with the retention model to predict the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k u in that approach k h is modelled in function of the wetness degree scaled to a matching point k 0 at saturation campbell 1974 mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 van genuchten and nielsen 1985 mualem 1976 warned that the validity of such approach is limited to soils without macropores the shape of θ h near saturation has a very strong influence on k h vogel and cislerova 1988 ippisch et al 2006 madi et al 2018 and k h can be off by several orders of magnitude when only k s is used as match point khaleel et al 1995 schaap and leij 2000 efforts were done to correct for this by suggesting a dual porosity model jarvis et al 1991 durner 1994 an explicit air entry value to the saturation function ippisch et al 2006 introducing a maximum pore radius in the pore bundle model iden et al 2015 or scaling of k h luckner et al 1989 thomasson et al 2006 still it is convenient and widely regarded as common practice to simply use a measured k s as k 0 as a consequence of the lack of k u measurements the uncertainty of k h in water flow simulations is usually much larger than that of θ h this is particularly true when the only measured value k s has a high measuring uncertainty furthermore sensitivity studies of unsaturated water flow simulations have often identified k 0 as one of the most important parameters governing unsaturated water flow abbasi et al 1097 rocha et al 2006 vrugt et al 2008 yuan et al 2015 rezaei et al 2016a to overcome this several authors have recommended to measure k u near saturation instead of k s this approach has the advantage that the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is less sensitive to macropores or cracks resulting in a lower variability and less required repetitions van genuchten and nielsen 1985 luckner et al 1989 schaap and van genuchten 2006 thomasson et al 2006 the techniques to measure the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity are less straightforward compared to those for k s determination of k u in situ can be achieved with the internal drainage test hillel et al 1972 the beerkan method lassabatere et al 2006 or the tension disc infiltrometer logsdon and jaynes 1993 šimůnek and van genuchten 1996 lab methods to measure k u include the steady state head control method watson 1966 klute and dirksen 1986 multistep outflow method klute 1972 eching et al 1994 the centrifuge method van den berg et al 2009 the mini disc infiltration method madsen and chandler 2007 and the evaporation method wind 1966 schindler 1980 peters and durner 2008 with the increasing availability of new methods and equipment which allows to measure k u in a convenient way the additional value of measuring k s could be questioned the objective of this study was to evaluate the value of measuring k s in the context of unsaturated water flow simulations first we perform a sensitivity analysis to evaluate which zone of k h is most important for the simulation of water flow section 2 since in reality the vadose zone is often not saturated our hypothesis is that k u is affecting the simulation more than k s if this is the case the measured k s could be of limited value in the simulation of water flow this is tested in section 3 where a functional evaluation of k s was done by performing simulations in six test sites with hydraulic properties determined with the measured k s and or k u 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis aims to assess which region of k h is most important for water flow simulations in particular this study investigates vertical water flow due to infiltration and evaporation for three soil types 2 1 model the simulation used in the sensitivity analysis entailed a homogeneous 1d soil profile subjected to two extreme rain events return period of 5 years based on belgian historic rainfall data with a duration of 1 2 h and 9 6 h and a rainfall intensity of 50 cm d and 10 cm d respectively waterbeleid 2012 a constant potential evaporation of 0 7 cm d and with free drainage at the bottom the rain events occurred at day 1 and 6 respectively and the total duration of the simulation was 20 days this simplified scenario should be sufficient to isolate the consequences of minor changes in hydraulic conductivity and is representative enough for a sensitivity analysis as it contains extreme evaporation and rainfall events the richards equation to calculate water flow was solved numerically with the hydrus 1d model from pc progress šimůnek et al 2005 šimůnek et al 2016 a python wrapper was built around it to control it rezaei et al 2017 the code is made publicly available 1 https github com jandepue khsensitivity 1 the soil profile was 2 m deep and discretized in 201 nodes with a higher density near the soil surface the resolution of the discretization was 9 10 4 m at the top and 9 10 3 m at the bottom hydrus 1d uses a variable time step ranging between 1 10 5 days and 5 days šimůnek et al 2005 for the sensitivity analysis the status of the soil profile i e water content matric head and water flux in every node was printed at 250 times with a regular 0 08 days time interval the matric head at the soil surface was limited to 1 10 5 cm defined from equilibrium conditions between soil water and atmospheric vapor šimůnek et al 2005 the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity curve were modelled with the unconstrained van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 model the formulas are given in eq 1 3 where θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated water content α n m and l are shape parameters and s e is the effective saturation degree 1 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m 2 s e θ h θ r θ s θ r m 1 1 n 3 k h k 0 s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 three soil types were selected for this analysis the parameters of their hydraulic properties are given in table 1 and derived from the pedotransfer function of carsel and parrish 1988 the resulting hydraulic conductivity curves are shown in fig 1 hydrus uses look up tables in its calculations which allows to modify the points on the hydraulic conductivity curve for the sensitivity analysis 2 2 sensitivity to determine the most important zone of k h for water flow the sensitivity of individual points on the hydraulic conductivity curve was evaluated rather than to parameters which would influence the complete range of k h the sensitivity of the model was determined at 50 matric heads between 10 1 cm and 10 5 cm by changing the value of k h with a perturbation factor p f of 20 for clay loam and 5 for loam and loamy sand eq 4 p f was chosen based on the precision of the output of hydrus to ensure numerically stable results the sensitivity was calculated in terms of the central parameter relative sensitivity cprs given in eq 5 where y is the output variable saltelli et al 2008 rezaei et al 2016a cprs is a normalized sensitivity index so it is independent of the absolute perturbation value this allows comparison of the sensitivity between different soils and matric heads a low cprs value indicates a low sensitivity of y to k h the output variables tested were matric head log transformed water content and flux throughout the soil profile and for the complete duration of the simulation cprs was calculated in every node and for every time step and its average weighted according to the spatial and time discretization 4 δ k h k h p f 5 cprs h δ y k h δ k h k h y k h δ k h y k h δ k h 2 δ k h k h 2 3 results the simulated water flux for the loam soil is shown in fig 2 a the two wetting fronts are clearly visible and reached the bottom of the soil profile within the 20 days simulation period the flux in the top layer shows that the evaporation rate after the infiltration events at t 1 d and 6 d was initially equal to the potential evaporation rate 0 7 cm d and dropped as it transitioned to the soil limited phase similarly the average cprs of water flux for the full range of k h is shown in fig 2b the sensitivity is highest in regions with high flux values in the infiltration front and near the soil surface but during the soil limited phase where it is governed by k u and not by the boundary condition figs 2c and d show the average cprs of water flux in function of time and h and h and depth respectively during the infiltration event a high sensitivity is observed over the full range of h values shortly after this event the sensitivity narrows to a region around h 100 cm similarly the sensitivity is large over a wide range of h values near the soil surface and narrows with depth the same tendencies were found for the sensitivity of water content and matric head the other soil types also showed the same trends although the zone with high cprs differed the simulations with loamy sand showed the highest sensitivity to k h in a narrow band around h 20 cm whereas the simulation with clay loam had a high sensitivity to k h in a wider region around h 150 cm this can be observed in fig 3 where the average cprs of log transformed matric head water content and water flux is plotted in function of h across all soil types tested water flow variables are most sensitive to k h for h between 10 cm and 1000 cm rather than to k h near saturation 3 functional evaluation to evaluate the value of measuring k s functional evaluation was done at six test sites in this evaluation three scenarios were tested in kskh all available lab data for θ h k u and k s is used for the combined fit of a θ h and k h model in ks the θ h model is fitted to θ h lab data and uses of k s as k 0 in the corresponding k h model with measured k s together with default values for other parameters this scenario represents the common practice in kh the lab measurements of θ h and k u are used for the combined fit of θ h and k h model the three scenarios are summarized in table 2 in this experiment design kskh is the reference scenario in which all available lab measurements are considered ks represents the common practice with a large uncertainty of k h in the unsaturated region to which water flow is the most sensitive kh is the scenario in which k s is not measured and k h near saturation is extrapolated based on the measured k u 3 1 experiment design and model the test sites were six agricultural fields in belgium which cover the major textural classes according to the belgian textural triangle i e sand z loamy sand s light sandy loam p heavy sandy loam l silt loam a clay e dondeyne et al 2012 in each site three soil layers were considered the topsoil 0 30 cm top a compacted subsoil layer 30 40 cm csub and the subsoil 40 80 cm sub the layer thicknesses were determined with penetrologger and visual assessment of the soil profile for each site individually in each layer six undisturbed samples were taken van der bolt et al 2016 one sample was used to measure θ h and k u with the evaporation method hyprop meter group and k s was measured on all six samples with ksat equipment meter group using the falling head method dane et al 2002 texture gee et al 1986 organic matter content walkley and black 1934 and bulk density dane et al 2002 were measured which allowed to use the vereecken pedotransfer function vereecken et al 1990 to predict an initial value of the parameter k s for the fit of the hydraulic conductivity model in the kh approach see further this pedotransfer function was chosen because it is developed for belgian soils and has a good accuracy cornelis et al 2001 the model used in this simulation was the bimodal peters durner iden pdi variant of the constrained van genuchten model the pdi model considers capillary and adsorptive water retention and capillary film and vapor conductivity peters 2013 iden et al 2014 peters 2014 unlike the unimodal van genuchten model an excellent fit was achieved for all soil samples with this model data shown in

1 5 respectively pertassek et al 2011 peters 2013 iden et al 2014 peters 2014 the combined fit was performed using sequential least squares programming algorithm kraft 1988 jones et al 2014 and a least square error objective function the initial estimation of k 0 for the fit in the kskh and kh scenario consists of the default parameter values and the measured kskh or predicted kh value of k s fig 4 shows an example of the available measured data for a sample in the csub layer of test site z and the resulting hydraulic models for the kskh ks and kh scenario measurements for k u usually spanned between 100 cm and 1000 cm the values for k s were inserted at matric head 0 1 cm during the fitting procedure this would imply according to the young laplace equation that all pores had a diameter 3 cm which was visually verified the hydraulic models that were fitted according to the three proposed methods resulted in k s values which were roughly around a tenfold smaller with kh compared to kskh and ks fig 5 see also fig 4 for 1 soil sample as k u was usually measured between 100 cm 1000 cm matric head the hydraulic conductivity of kh and kskh is similar in this zone whereas it was mostly overestimated in the ks scenario by several orders of magnitude at the six sites kskh ks and kh scenarios were run for a three year simulation period the groundwater table depth was monitored on an hourly basis between 10 2014 and 10 2017 with diver sensors eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment which were installed at 2 m depth in 2 1 m deep piezometers with 0 3 m sized filters after correction for atmospheric pressure measured with a baro diver the pressure of the water column above the diver and thus the depth of the groundwater table could be determined this was used as bottom boundary condition for the upper boundary condition rainfall and meteorological data were obtained from waterinfo be vlaamse mileumaatschppij with a 15 min resolution the potential evaporation flux was calculated with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and the pressure head at the soil surface was limited to 10 5 cm šimůnek et al 2005 the slope at the test sites was negligible therefore no runoff was allowed and excess water could pond on the soil surface water flow was simulated with hydrus 1d the soil profile was 2 m in the model deep and was discretized with 5 10 3 m resolution similar to the model in the sensitivity analysis a variable time step was used 3 2 validation to validate the simulations under the three scenarios capacitance probes ec 5 decagon were installed horizontally in each layer at 10 cm 35 cm and 70 cm depth with some variation between the six test sites depending on the soil layering and monitored the water content with an hourly resolution at the corresponding depths and times water content was extracted from the simulations the sensors were used with the manufacturers calibration but maximum water contents observed in the field deviated from the saturated water content measured in the lab to overcome this issue water contents were converted to saturation degrees s the simulated s is the ratio of the water content over the θ s parameter which determines the water content at saturation of the water retention model and the observed s is the ratio of the water content over the maximum observed water content at some observation points 3 out of 18 no saturation was reached in those cases the θ s parameter of the kskh retention model was used instead of the maximum observed water content if the mean error me between the observed and all simulated s i e kskh ks and kh still exceeded 0 05 the observation point was omitted 2 out of 18 the sensor located in the sub layer of test site e was permanently below the ground water table and was excluded from the validation overall the validation was possible for 14 observation points across the six sites the validation indices used are mean error me root mean

summer months were removed from the validation dataset only the periods between october and march over three years were used 3 3 results an example of the simulated and observed s is shown in fig 6 results for all sites can be found in the supplement in general the largest similarities in simulated s were found in the kskh and kh scenario they follow similar and more pronounced trends in s as compared with the ks scenario which had a relatively low response to precipitation events the summer season data are shown as well in these graphs lighter color but not used for validation the simulated s is clearly higher in every summer due to the missing root water uptake the simulated s is plotted against the observations in fig 7 the range of s is limited 0 6 1 0 since only data from autumn and winter when soil wetness is above field capacity is used for validation validation indices per layer and site are given in table 3 overall the me and rmse of the simulations are lowest in the kh scenario simulations with in the ks scenario show the highest rmse despite that kskh has the highest absolute me r values were similar under the three scenarios despite the differences in validation indices per site and depth for the three scenarios significant differences wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 over the total dataset were only found for me p 0 011 and 0 011 for kskh ks and kskh kh respectively but not for rmse and r this can be largely attributed to the limited range in s during the simulation period used for validation nevertheless other interesting observations when comparing the kskh ks and kh scenarios could be made in fig 8 the pressure head and flux at the soil surface simulated under the kskh scenario are plotted against that under the kh fig 8a and c and ks fig 8a and c scenario for all sites together and the complete duration of the simulation including the summer periods the soil surface appears to be often around field capacity pressure head 100 cm under the ks scenario whereas it has reached the minimal value of 1 10 5 cm under the kskh scenario indicating that the evaporation flux in dry periods is more limited in the kskh scenario likewise the ks scenario systematically shows a higher evaporation rate positive flux than the kskh scenario this is a consequence of the overestimation of k u with ks fig 5 on the other hand the pressure head at the soil surface in kh indicates much more frequent ponding water events compared to kskh indeed k s in kh is more than tenfold smaller compared to the k s in kskh fig 5 and is at most sites smaller than the rainfall intensity 4 discussion the results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the most important region of the hydraulic conductivity curve is at h between 10 cm and 1000 cm according to the young laplace equation this corresponds to the pore fraction with radius between 1 48 10 4 m and 1 48 10 6 m which excludes the macropore fraction this result strongly disagrees with the notion that preferential flow through macropores are responsible for the largest fraction of water flow alaoui and helbling 2006 jarvis et al 2012 even in unsaturated conditions lin et al 1996 preferential flow through macropores is of major importance in the simulation of solute transport e g pesticide leaching or extreme infiltration events there is convincing evidence that the classic richards model as used in this study is not suitable for the simulation of such processes beven and germann 2013 however such events or processes are not the focus of this study the presented results should be interpreted in the context where the richards equation is valid i e the simulation of water transport under non extreme meteorological conditions the functional evaluation of the three scenarios showed that the simulated s was least accurate in the ks scenario this is in accordance with the results of the sensitivity analysis since k h is consistently overestimated in the most sensitive region for the simulation of water flow however it was counter intuitive to find that the simulated s was more accurate in the kh scenario than in the kskh scenario a possible explanation is the lack of k u measurements between matric head 10 cm and 100 cm k h is likely overestimated in this region with the kskh scenario due to the high values of k s the evaporation method is not suitable to measure k h in this region other methods such as the mini disc infiltrometer need to be applied to bridge this gap jarvis and messing 1995 meadows et al 2005 furthermore the k s measured in the lab can be several orders of magnitude times higher than in the field due to blocked pores by entrapped air in particular for compacted soils peck 1965 koga 1987 even though differences in k h between kskh ks and kh were extreme in this study differences in the validation indices were not significant this can be largely attributed to the limited range in wetness during the validation period still it can be observed that common practice ks scenario leads to a significant overestimation of k u yielding larger differences during the summer period these results call for more research with validation during dryer periods the chosen scenario kskh ks or kh had a pronounced effect on the water flux and pressure head at the soil surface the evaporation flux in dry periods is likely overestimated in the ks scenario and the ponding water events are most frequent in the kh scenario the latter could have significant consequences when coupled to a different model e g surface flow or soil erosion however no measurements of evaporation or ponding water depth are available in this study to validate these observations 5 conclusion in the light of increasing availability of convenient methods to measure the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity the additional value of measuring k s was investigated measurements of k s are associated with a large variability whereas measurements of k u are more stable this study was performed in two steps firstly a sensitivity analysis of the simulation of vertical water transport to k h was executed for three soil types this indicated that the most important region of k h lies between matric head 10 cm and 1000 cm secondly a functional evaluation of k s was performed by simulating water flow in six test sites three scenarios were considered i e kskh ks and kh in which k h was determined with the measured k s and or k u it was found that in the ks scenario which represents the common practice in which k u is not measured the simulation of saturation degree at 10 cm 35 cm and 70 cm was the least accurate surprisingly the most accurate scenario was the kh scenario in which k s is not measured this indicated that k h in the range between saturation and 100 cm matric head i e the highest matric head of the measured k u with the evaporation method in this study was overestimated in the kskh scenario additional measurements of k h in this range with other methods such as the mini disc infiltrometer are needed to further improve the simulations the results of this study indicate that the measurement of k u is of greater importance for the simulation of water flow than the measurement of k s this is in contradiction with the notion that water flow is mainly governed by preferential flow through macropores further research with additional measurements of k h in the near saturated zone simulation of water flow during dryer periods and validation of evaporation and excess infiltration is recommended declaration of competing

6317,the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s is considered to be one of the main soil hydraulic properties to simulate water transport in the vadose zone yet it is notoriously difficult to assess due to its large field scale variability and sensitivity to preferential flow paths with the increasing availability of convenient methods to measure the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k u the additional value of measuring k s could be questioned this study investigates the relevance of measuring k s in two ways firstly a sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate which part of the hydraulic conductivity curve impacts the simulation of unsaturated water transport most it was found that hydraulic conductivity curve between 10 cm and 1000 cm matric head was affecting the simulation more than at saturation secondly a functional evaluation was performed by simulating water flow in six test fields according to three scenarios in which the hydraulic properties were determined with the measured k s and or k u the simulation of saturation degree at three depths was the least accurate in the scenario where only k s was measured remarkably the most accurate simulation was found in the scenario with only the measured k u according to these results measuring k u would be of greater importance than measuring k s for the simulation of water flow in the

vadose zone hydrology the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s is considered to be one of the principal soil physical properties it governs the flux of water through porous media as described in darcy s law despite it being relatively straight forward to measure the k s of a soil sample it is a notoriously difficult soil property to assess due to its high variability in space and time and sensitivity to sample scale or minor changes in soil structure crawford 1994 arvidsson 1997 brooks et al 2004 rahmati et al 2017 preferential flow paths such as macropores and cracks result in a high k s which can be regarded as not representative for the soil minor disturbances such as soil compaction or smearing of pores whilst sampling can reduce the measured k s significantly dane et al 2002 to overcome these issues a high number of replicated samples need to be taken making k s a costly and time consuming property to measure moreover the resulting data is often seemingly inconsistent and having a coefficient of variation 1 making the interpretation a challenge nielsen et al 1973 adding to that the non uniqueness of k s depending on the measuring and calculation method used can cause values to be significantly different verbist et al 2013 rezaei et al 2016b weninger et al 1559 morbidelli et al 2017 since soil degradation processes such as soil compaction are often associated with the decrease in macroporosity or connectivity thereof k s is frequently used as soil quality indicator lebert et al 2003 reynolds et al 2009 however since the variability of k s can be particularly high for cultivated soils picciafuoco et al 2019 some studies found that k s did not reflect the degree of soil compactness significantly arvidsson 1997 van den akker and de groot 2008 van der bolt et al 2016 this contradicts with the well established effect of soil compaction on infiltration perched water tables and erosion de haan and van der valk 1970 fullen 1985 verbist et al 2007 blanco canqui et al 2010 studies that simulate this effect based on measured k s i e without additional calibration are rare coquet 2005a coquet et al 2005b alaoui et al 2011 hartmann et al 2012 and simulations that estimate consequences of soil degradation at larger scale rarely rely on measured k s alaoui et al 2018 in the simulation of water flow the water retention curve θ h and the hydraulic conductivity curve k h are usually linked measuring soil water content at various matric head h levels is a standard lab procedure and allows to fit a water retention model but measuring the hydraulic conductivity at various unsaturated states is not usually only k s is measured and is combined with the retention model to predict the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k u in that approach k h is modelled in function of the wetness degree scaled to a matching point k 0 at saturation campbell 1974 mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 van genuchten and nielsen 1985 mualem 1976 warned that the validity of such approach is limited to soils without macropores the shape of θ h near saturation has a very strong influence on k h vogel and cislerova 1988 ippisch et al 2006 madi et al 2018 and k h can be off by several orders of magnitude when only k s is used as match point khaleel et al 1995 schaap and leij 2000 efforts were done to correct for this by suggesting a dual porosity model jarvis et al 1991 durner 1994 an explicit air entry value to the saturation function ippisch et al 2006 introducing a maximum pore radius in the pore bundle model iden et al 2015 or scaling of k h luckner et al 1989 thomasson et al 2006 still it is convenient and widely regarded as common practice to simply use a measured k s as k 0 as a consequence of the lack of k u measurements the uncertainty of k h in water flow simulations is usually much larger than that of θ h this is particularly true when the only measured value k s has a high measuring uncertainty furthermore sensitivity studies of unsaturated water flow simulations have often identified k 0 as one of the most important parameters governing unsaturated water flow abbasi et al 1097 rocha et al 2006 vrugt et al 2008 yuan et al 2015 rezaei et al 2016a to overcome this several authors have recommended to measure k u near saturation instead of k s this approach has the advantage that the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is less sensitive to macropores or cracks resulting in a lower variability and less required repetitions van genuchten and nielsen 1985 luckner et al 1989 schaap and van genuchten 2006 thomasson et al 2006 the techniques to measure the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity are less straightforward compared to those for k s determination of k u in situ can be achieved with the internal drainage test hillel et al 1972 the beerkan method lassabatere et al 2006 or the tension disc infiltrometer logsdon and jaynes 1993 šimůnek and van genuchten 1996 lab methods to measure k u include the steady state head control method watson 1966 klute and dirksen 1986 multistep outflow method klute 1972 eching et al 1994 the centrifuge method van den berg et al 2009 the mini disc infiltration method madsen and chandler 2007 and the evaporation method wind 1966 schindler 1980 peters and durner 2008 with the increasing availability of new methods and equipment which allows to measure k u in a convenient way the additional value of measuring k s could be questioned the objective of this study was to evaluate the value of measuring k s in the context of unsaturated water flow simulations first we perform a sensitivity analysis to evaluate which zone of k h is most important for the simulation of water flow section 2 since in reality the vadose zone is often not saturated our hypothesis is that k u is affecting the simulation more than k s if this is the case the measured k s could be of limited value in the simulation of water flow this is tested in section 3 where a functional evaluation of k s was done by performing simulations in six test sites with hydraulic properties determined with the measured k s and or k u 2 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis aims to assess which region of k h is most important for water flow simulations in particular this study investigates vertical water flow due to infiltration and evaporation for three soil types 2 1 model the simulation used in the sensitivity analysis entailed a homogeneous 1d soil profile subjected to two extreme rain events return period of 5 years based on belgian historic rainfall data with a duration of 1 2 h and 9 6 h and a rainfall intensity of 50 cm d and 10 cm d respectively waterbeleid 2012 a constant potential evaporation of 0 7 cm d and with free drainage at the bottom the rain events occurred at day 1 and 6 respectively and the total duration of the simulation was 20 days this simplified scenario should be sufficient to isolate the consequences of minor changes in hydraulic conductivity and is representative enough for a sensitivity analysis as it contains extreme evaporation and rainfall events the richards equation to calculate water flow was solved numerically with the hydrus 1d model from pc progress šimůnek et al 2005 šimůnek et al 2016 a python wrapper was built around it to control it rezaei et al 2017 the code is made publicly available 1 https github com jandepue khsensitivity 1 the soil profile was 2 m deep and discretized in 201 nodes with a higher density near the soil surface the resolution of the discretization was 9 10 4 m at the top and 9 10 3 m at the bottom hydrus 1d uses a variable time step ranging between 1 10 5 days and 5 days šimůnek et al 2005 for the sensitivity analysis the status of the soil profile i e water content matric head and water flux in every node was printed at 250 times with a regular 0 08 days time interval the matric head at the soil surface was limited to 1 10 5 cm defined from equilibrium conditions between soil water and atmospheric vapor šimůnek et al 2005 the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity curve were modelled with the unconstrained van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 model the formulas are given in eq 1 3 where θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated water content α n m and l are shape parameters and s e is the effective saturation degree 1 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m 2 s e θ h θ r θ s θ r m 1 1 n 3 k h k 0 s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 three soil types were selected for this analysis the parameters of their hydraulic properties are given in table 1 and derived from the pedotransfer function of carsel and parrish 1988 the resulting hydraulic conductivity curves are shown in fig 1 hydrus uses look up tables in its calculations which allows to modify the points on the hydraulic conductivity curve for the sensitivity analysis 2 2 sensitivity to determine the most important zone of k h for water flow the sensitivity of individual points on the hydraulic conductivity curve was evaluated rather than to parameters which would influence the complete range of k h the sensitivity of the model was determined at 50 matric heads between 10 1 cm and 10 5 cm by changing the value of k h with a perturbation factor p f of 20 for clay loam and 5 for loam and loamy sand eq 4 p f was chosen based on the precision of the output of hydrus to ensure numerically stable results the sensitivity was calculated in terms of the central parameter relative sensitivity cprs given in eq 5 where y is the output variable saltelli et al 2008 rezaei et al 2016a cprs is a normalized sensitivity index so it is independent of the absolute perturbation value this allows comparison of the sensitivity between different soils and matric heads a low cprs value indicates a low sensitivity of y to k h the output variables tested were matric head log transformed water content and flux throughout the soil profile and for the complete duration of the simulation cprs was calculated in every node and for every time step and its average weighted according to the spatial and time discretization 4 δ k h k h p f 5 cprs h δ y k h δ k h k h y k h δ k h y k h δ k h 2 δ k h k h 2 3 results the simulated water flux for the loam soil is shown in fig 2 a the two wetting fronts are clearly visible and reached the bottom of the soil profile within the 20 days simulation period the flux in the top layer shows that the evaporation rate after the infiltration events at t 1 d and 6 d was initially equal to the potential evaporation rate 0 7 cm d and dropped as it transitioned to the soil limited phase similarly the average cprs of water flux for the full range of k h is shown in fig 2b the sensitivity is highest in regions with high flux values in the infiltration front and near the soil surface but during the soil limited phase where it is governed by k u and not by the boundary condition figs 2c and d show the average cprs of water flux in function of time and h and h and depth respectively during the infiltration event a high sensitivity is observed over the full range of h values shortly after this event the sensitivity narrows to a region around h 100 cm similarly the sensitivity is large over a wide range of h values near the soil surface and narrows with depth the same tendencies were found for the sensitivity of water content and matric head the other soil types also showed the same trends although the zone with high cprs differed the simulations with loamy sand showed the highest sensitivity to k h in a narrow band around h 20 cm whereas the simulation with clay loam had a high sensitivity to k h in a wider region around h 150 cm this can be observed in fig 3 where the average cprs of log transformed matric head water content and water flux is plotted in function of h across all soil types tested water flow variables are most sensitive to k h for h between 10 cm and 1000 cm rather than to k h near saturation 3 functional evaluation to evaluate the value of measuring k s functional evaluation was done at six test sites in this evaluation three scenarios were tested in kskh all available lab data for θ h k u and k s is used for the combined fit of a θ h and k h model in ks the θ h model is fitted to θ h lab data and uses of k s as k 0 in the corresponding k h model with measured k s together with default values for other parameters this scenario represents the common practice in kh the lab measurements of θ h and k u are used for the combined fit of θ h and k h model the three scenarios are summarized in table 2 in this experiment design kskh is the reference scenario in which all available lab measurements are considered ks represents the common practice with a large uncertainty of k h in the unsaturated region to which water flow is the most sensitive kh is the scenario in which k s is not measured and k h near saturation is extrapolated based on the measured k u 3 1 experiment design and model the test sites were six agricultural fields in belgium which cover the major textural classes according to the belgian textural triangle i e sand z loamy sand s light sandy loam p heavy sandy loam l silt loam a clay e dondeyne et al 2012 in each site three soil layers were considered the topsoil 0 30 cm top a compacted subsoil layer 30 40 cm csub and the subsoil 40 80 cm sub the layer thicknesses were determined with penetrologger and visual assessment of the soil profile for each site individually in each layer six undisturbed samples were taken van der bolt et al 2016 one sample was used to measure θ h and k u with the evaporation method hyprop meter group and k s was measured on all six samples with ksat equipment meter group using the falling head method dane et al 2002 texture gee et al 1986 organic matter content walkley and black 1934 and bulk density dane et al 2002 were measured which allowed to use the vereecken pedotransfer function vereecken et al 1990 to predict an initial value of the parameter k s for the fit of the hydraulic conductivity model in the kh approach see further this pedotransfer function was chosen because it is developed for belgian soils and has a good accuracy cornelis et al 2001 the model used in this simulation was the bimodal peters durner iden pdi variant of the constrained van genuchten model the pdi model considers capillary and adsorptive water retention and capillary film and vapor conductivity peters 2013 iden et al 2014 peters 2014 unlike the unimodal van genuchten model an excellent fit was achieved for all soil samples with this model data shown in supplement together with k s three additional parameters τ ωand a link the hydraulic conductivity model to the water retention model τis a dimensionless empirical parameter related to pore tortuosity and connectivity ωis the dimensionless weight parameter for the contribution of film flow and a is the dimensionless slope of the film flow conductivity they are set to a default value of 0 5 10 4 and 1 5 respectively pertassek et al 2011 peters 2013 iden et al 2014 peters 2014 the combined fit was performed using sequential least squares programming algorithm kraft 1988 jones et al 2014 and a least square error objective function the initial estimation of k 0 for the fit in the kskh and kh scenario consists of the default parameter values and the measured kskh or predicted kh value of k s fig 4 shows an example of the available measured data for a sample in the csub layer of test site z and the resulting hydraulic models for the kskh ks and kh scenario measurements for k u usually spanned between 100 cm and 1000 cm the values for k s were inserted at matric head 0 1 cm during the fitting procedure this would imply according to the young laplace equation that all pores had a diameter 3 cm which was visually verified the hydraulic models that were fitted according to the three proposed methods resulted in k s values which were roughly around a tenfold smaller with kh compared to kskh and ks fig 5 see also fig 4 for 1 soil sample as k u was usually measured between 100 cm 1000 cm matric head the hydraulic conductivity of kh and kskh is similar in this zone whereas it was mostly overestimated in the ks scenario by several orders of magnitude at the six sites kskh ks and kh scenarios were run for a three year simulation period the groundwater table depth was monitored on an hourly basis between 10 2014 and 10 2017 with diver sensors eijkelkamp agrisearch equipment which were installed at 2 m depth in 2 1 m deep piezometers with 0 3 m sized filters after correction for atmospheric pressure measured with a baro diver the pressure of the water column above the diver and thus the depth of the groundwater table could be determined this was used as bottom boundary condition for the upper boundary condition rainfall and meteorological data were obtained from waterinfo be vlaamse mileumaatschppij with a 15 min resolution the potential evaporation flux was calculated with the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and the pressure head at the soil surface was limited to 10 5 cm šimůnek et al 2005 the slope at the test sites was negligible therefore no runoff was allowed and excess water could pond on the soil surface water flow was simulated with hydrus 1d the soil profile was 2 m in the model deep and was discretized with 5 10 3 m resolution similar to the model in the sensitivity analysis a variable time step was used 3 2 validation to validate the simulations under the three scenarios capacitance probes ec 5 decagon were installed horizontally in each layer at 10 cm 35 cm and 70 cm depth with some variation between the six test sites depending on the soil layering and monitored the water content with an hourly resolution at the corresponding depths and times water content was extracted from the simulations the sensors were used with the manufacturers calibration but maximum water contents observed in the field deviated from the saturated water content measured in the lab to overcome this issue water contents were converted to saturation degrees s the simulated s is the ratio of the water content over the θ s parameter which determines the water content at saturation of the water retention model and the observed s is the ratio of the water content over the maximum observed water content at some observation points 3 out of 18 no saturation was reached in those cases the θ s parameter of the kskh retention model was used instead of the maximum observed water content if the mean error me between the observed and all simulated s i e kskh ks and kh still exceeded 0 05 the observation point was omitted 2 out of 18 the sensor located in the sub layer of test site e was permanently below the ground water table and was excluded from the validation overall the validation was possible for 14 observation points across the six sites the validation indices used are mean error me root mean

results for all sites can be found in the supplement in general the largest similarities in simulated s were found in the kskh and kh scenario they follow similar and more pronounced trends in s as compared with the ks scenario which had a relatively low response to precipitation events the summer season data are shown as well in these graphs lighter color but not used for validation the simulated s is clearly higher in every summer due to the missing root water uptake the simulated s is plotted against the observations in fig 7 the range of s is limited 0 6 1 0 since only data from autumn and winter when soil wetness is above field capacity is used for validation validation indices per layer and site are given in table 3 overall the me and rmse of the simulations are lowest in the kh scenario simulations with in the ks scenario show the highest rmse despite that kskh has the highest absolute me r values were similar under the three scenarios despite the differences in validation indices per site and depth for the three scenarios significant differences wilcoxon signed rank test p 0 05 over the total dataset were only found for me p 0 011 and 0 011 for kskh ks and kskh kh respectively but not for rmse and r this can be largely attributed to the limited range in s during the simulation period used for validation nevertheless other interesting observations when comparing the kskh ks and kh scenarios could be made in fig 8 the pressure head and flux at the soil surface simulated under the kskh scenario are plotted against that under the kh fig 8a and c and ks fig 8a and c scenario for all sites together and the complete duration of the simulation including the summer periods the soil surface appears to be often around field capacity pressure head 100 cm under the ks scenario whereas it has reached the minimal value of 1 10 5 cm under the kskh scenario indicating that the evaporation flux in dry periods is more limited in the kskh scenario likewise the ks scenario systematically shows a higher evaporation rate positive flux than the kskh scenario this is a consequence of the overestimation of k u with ks fig 5 on the other hand the pressure head at the soil surface in kh indicates much more frequent ponding water events compared to kskh indeed k s in kh is more than tenfold smaller compared to the k s in kskh fig 5 and is at most sites smaller than the rainfall intensity 4 discussion the results of the sensitivity analysis indicate that the most important region of the hydraulic conductivity curve is at h between 10 cm and 1000 cm according to the young laplace equation this corresponds to the pore fraction with radius between 1 48 10 4 m and 1 48 10 6 m which excludes the macropore fraction this result strongly disagrees with the notion that preferential flow through macropores are responsible for the largest fraction of water flow alaoui and helbling 2006 jarvis et al 2012 even in unsaturated conditions lin et al 1996 preferential flow through macropores is of major importance in the simulation of solute transport e g pesticide leaching or extreme infiltration events there is convincing evidence that the classic richards model as used in this study is not suitable for the simulation of such processes beven and germann 2013 however such events or processes are not the focus of this study the presented results should be interpreted in the context where the richards equation is valid i e the simulation of water transport under non extreme meteorological conditions the functional evaluation of the three scenarios showed that the simulated s was least accurate in the ks scenario this is in accordance with the results of the sensitivity analysis since k h is consistently overestimated in the most sensitive region for the simulation of water flow however it was counter intuitive to find that the simulated s was more accurate in the kh scenario than in the kskh scenario a possible explanation is the lack of k u measurements between matric head 10 cm and 100 cm k h is likely overestimated in this region with the kskh scenario due to the high values of k s the evaporation method is not suitable to measure k h in this region other methods such as the mini disc infiltrometer need to be applied to bridge this gap jarvis and messing 1995 meadows et al 2005 furthermore the k s measured in the lab can be several orders of magnitude times higher than in the field due to blocked pores by entrapped air in particular for compacted soils peck 1965 koga 1987 even though differences in k h between kskh ks and kh were extreme in this study differences in the validation indices were not significant this can be largely attributed to the limited range in wetness during the validation period still it can be observed that common practice ks scenario leads to a significant overestimation of k u yielding larger differences during the summer period these results call for more research with validation during dryer periods the chosen scenario kskh ks or kh had a pronounced effect on the water flux and pressure head at the soil surface the evaporation flux in dry periods is likely overestimated in the ks scenario and the ponding water events are most frequent in the kh scenario the latter could have significant consequences when coupled to a different model e g surface flow or soil erosion however no measurements of evaporation or ponding water depth are available in this study to validate these observations 5 conclusion in the light of increasing availability of convenient methods to measure the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity the additional value of measuring k s was investigated measurements of k s are associated with a large variability whereas measurements of k u are more stable this study was performed in two steps firstly a sensitivity analysis of the simulation of vertical water transport to k h was executed for three soil types this indicated that the most important region of k h lies between matric head 10 cm and 1000 cm secondly a functional evaluation of k s was performed by simulating water flow in six test sites three scenarios were considered i e kskh ks and kh in which k h was determined with the measured k s and or k u it was found that in the ks scenario which represents the common practice in which k u is not measured the simulation of saturation degree at 10 cm 35 cm and 70 cm was the least accurate surprisingly the most accurate scenario was the kh scenario in which k s is not measured this indicated that k h in the range between saturation and 100 cm matric head i e the highest matric head of the measured k u with the evaporation method in this study was overestimated in the kskh scenario additional measurements of k h in this range with other methods such as the mini disc infiltrometer are needed to further improve the simulations the results of this study indicate that the measurement of k u is of greater importance for the simulation of water flow than the measurement of k s this is in contradiction with the notion that water flow is mainly governed by preferential flow through macropores further research with additional measurements of k h in the near saturated zone simulation of water flow during dryer periods and validation of evaporation and excess infiltration is recommended declaration of competing

6318,losing eight meters of water level over a 20 year period from 1996 to 2016 marked the lake urmia lu as one of the regional environmental crises this condition has threatened biota life intensified desertification around the lake and raised social concerns by adversely impacting the inhabitants health and economy in 2013 the urmia lake restoration national committee ulrnc started implementing certain management practices to stop the drying trend of lu resulted in the cease of water level drop and stabilization of lu condition in 2016 nevertheless the restoration actions have not yet raised the lake to the water level as planned by the roadmap this paper aims to describe and to assess the lu restoration plans by underscoring the ulrnc achievements challenges and shortcomings in particular we discuss how the value of data and data aided modeling has been underestimated by the lu restoration programs leading to still existing puzzles about the lake interaction with the involving physical processes governing its dynamics we show how the lu restoration timetable has not fulfilled the planned milestones as evidenced by the inability to capture the anticipated lake water levels which is partly attributed to the lack of field data and dynamic modeling that could predict the lake response in a more reliable and conservative manner the current restoration plans should also be revisited to ensure that any practice with the aim of reducing water consumption in the basin is not only environmentally sustainable but also feasible from the socioeconomic perspective the insights provided by this paper attempt to underscore the value of field data collection for establishing a reliable conceptual model and for executing pre and post monitoring of the lake so that the success or failure of the restoration actions taken by the policymakers can be appropriately evaluated keywords lake urmia restoration data driven modeling environmental sustainability socioeconomic 1 introduction models and data are two perspectives of the same scene that aim to portray a collective picture how interacting processes govern a system behavior the hydrogeology literature is replete with numerous modeling efforts to enhance our understanding of sophisticated processes taking place in the environment e g see fatichi et al 2016 and references therein this has been pursued by developing models with distinct assumptions uncertainty and complexity asking for information about landscape heterogeneity for parameter estimation e g rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2016 singh and frevert 2002 as well as certain computational resources depending on the size of the problem and the degree to which temporal and spatial information is needed to be resolved e g kollet et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 despite significant advances in computing technology and power models are still a simplified representation of reality that cannot ever completely convey the insight provided by field observations experiments and measurements e g rajabi et al 2018 silberstein 2006 nisbet et al 2014 quoted patrick crill that data without models are chaos but models without data are fantasy such a need has motivated the modern hydrogeology to aggressively strive for and invest in data collection helping increase the chance to get the right answers for the right reasons kirchner 2006 todini 2007 this paper seeks to exemplify the value of model data interaction by focusing on one environmental crisis of our era the lake urmia lu located in northwestern iran which lost nearly eight meters of water in 20 years between 1996 and 2016 such a drastic condition urged the country to take prompt actions against the decrease of the lu water level beginning in 2013 the urmia lake restoration ulrnc ulrnc started bringing stakeholders legislators and international collaborators together to design and implement a roadmap for first stabilizing and then restoring the lu to the minimum required ecological level that asks for about 15 bcm of water with reference to the 2016 condition however the restoration rate has been recorded smaller than that estimated by the action plan the reasons for this unforeseen deviation can be discussed from a wide range of viewpoints in this study we focus on one involving factor relating to the limited integrated data driven modeling efforts as well as minor investment in instrumenting the basin to collect field data that have resulted in a poor prediction of the lu water volume response to the water saving restoration actions we argue that any planning without appropriate data and model is gambling i e a reliable understanding of the system in the form of a holistic conceptual model fed by and validated against several field data types is a prerequisite before any plan is taken to implement to mention a few issues in this context are data deficiently for validating estimates of lake evaporation and basin evapotranspiration that account for the major water loss in the lu and lake urmia basin lub respectively contrasting modeling and experimental evidences about the hydrologic connectivity between the lake and groundwater lack of chemical and isotopic data to identify the mixing sources of flow and timescales of hydro chemical behavior of the lu and lub and non integrated modeling approaches to evaluating the socioeconomic impacts of the lake restoration actions it is worth mentioning that the significance of in situ observations and integrated modeling based on ground truth has already been demonstrated by the study of other internationally important environmental systems such as the lake chad in africa and the aral sea in central asia lemoalle et al 2012 micklin 2007 see also section 4 for further details on the contribution of model data interaction to the restoration of these two systems to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that outlines the lu restoration challenge from this perspective in particular we aim to 1 outline the lu restoration plans by underlining their achievements shortcomings and challenges 2 illustrate the gap between the observed and the anticipated lu water levels by ulrnc over the five year period 2013 2018 3 discuss the limitations of the so far developed physically based hydrological models in the lub in terms model structure and data deficiency required for calibration and validation purposes and 4 discuss what specific data for which specific modeling purposes should be collected across the lub for an appropriate understanding of the physical processes that control the lu response to natural stressors and human induced restoration interventions the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 gives an overview of the lu history by outlining the natural and anthropogenic changes in the lub over the past three decades the literature on the lake status based on the most recent available data is also updated section 3 assesses the lu restoration plans from the technical and socioeconomic aspects on section 4 we highlight the need for much aggressive data collection in lub with emphasis on certain current modeling challenges in this basin finally section 5 concludes with remarks about the lake restoration future perspective 2 lake urmia past and present 2 1 lake urmia basin lub the 51 876 km2 lub 37 44 n 45 23 e is one of the six major basins in iran that is closed and drained by 17 permanent and 12 seasonal rivers fig 1 lub lithology witnesses fingerprints from different geologic periods palaeozoic metamorphic rocks in the west dolomites sandstones quartzites and volcanic rocks from the infracambrian in the south mesozoic flysch rocks dominating in the eastern islands coralline limestones from the lower miocene along the northwestern shores and lower evaporite marl series and an upper red bed conglomerate series in the northern margin and northeastern hinterland kelts and shahrabi 1986 fig 2 a shows the lub topographical distribution with an altitude ranging from 1202 m to 3751 m above msl that is characterized with the lu 3 9 as of july 2017 with an average water level at 1270 49 m above msl and plains 31 1 surrounded by mountains 65 across the basin margin the basin climate is classified as cold semi arid with an average annual precipitation varying between 300 mm and 400 mm high air temperature fluctuations between 6 c and 31 2 c average relative humidity of 52 64 doe 2013 and average annual actual evapotranspiration of 421 mm between 2000 and 2016 rsrc 2017 the region faces four seasons with cold winters during december february and temperate summers during june august while 40 30 26 and 4 of annual precipitation falls in spring winter autumn and summer respectively lub is shared between east azerbaijan 43 4 west azerbaijan 47 7 and kurdistan 9 8 provinces fig 1 wherein the population has increased by 8 5 13 6 and 11 3 respectively from 2006 to 2016 statistical center of iran 2016 the basin currently suffers stress on water resources due to the increased demand for urban water and most importantly for the intensive agricultural development that accounts for more than 60 of renewable water resources use and 93 total water resources consumption in the entire basin doe 2014 the amount of water used for irrigation purposes proves an increase by more than 85 and 11 in 2010 compared to 1995 and 2014 respectively rsrc 2016a this unsustainable agricultural development has been accompanied by an increase in evapotranspiration and overuse of both surface and groundwater resources across the lub consequently the outflow from 14 rivers feeding the lake has decreased significantly by an average of 56 from 1966 1996 to 1997 2012 also the total number of deep and shallow wells in 2012 2013 is about four times greater than that in 1984 1985 i e there are on average seven wells per square kilometer in the basin fig 2b as a consequence the total amount of groundwater withdrawal jumped from 1200 mcm in 1984 1985 to 2200 mcm in 2012 2013 nevertheless the withdrawal rate from wells has decreased in recent years indicating the declining discharge capacity of aquifers due to overexploitation ulrp 2018 2 2 lake urmia lu lu is the terminal drainage point of 12 sub basins in lub that is known for its hypersalinity with salt concentration ranging from 140 g l to more than 380 g l zeinoddini et al 2009 designated as a national park 1971 a unesco biosphere reserve 1976 and a ramsar site https bit ly 2tccxma the lake used to be a home to more than 200 species of birds and a natural habitat to artemia that is a food source for migrating birds and can live in waters with high salinity agh 2007 the lake buffer zone has also been a reserve for artemia harvesting with medical purposes salt extraction and ecotourism e g khorshiddoust 2017 mahboob et al 2009 fig 3 a shows the lake water level fluctuations over a 50 year period indicating two contrasting trends between 1966 and 2016 fathian et al 2014 an increasing trend from 1966 to 1996 when the lake reached its maximum level at 1278 41 m in 1996 followed by a drastic continuous decreasing trend from 1996 to 2016 indeed the lake water level decreased by nearly eight meters in 20 years leading to a loss of almost 70 of the lake area i e 5816 km2 in 1996 vs 1802 km2 in 2016 fig 3b and c and 96 of lake volume i e 34 22 bcm in 1996 vs 1 24 bcm in 2016 fig 3c 2 3 climatic and anthropogenic impacts the trend analysis of the long term climatic variables indicates a significant increasing trend in annual temperature in the majority of stations throughout the lub fathian et al 2016 despite the increasing trend in temperature no significant trend was observed in the lake annual evaporation after 1995 which has been explained by the counteractive effect on the evaporation of increasing temperature and decreasing wind speed in the basin arkian et al 2018 also long term annual precipitation shows no significant trend in 75 of the stations while the remaining stations indicate both significant increasing or decreasing trends with different precipitation pattern depending on the location of a given station fathian et al 2015 fazel et al 2018 vaheddoost and aksoy 2017 given these pieces of evidence the degree of contribution to the decline of the lu water level by climate variability has been both controversial and accompanied by contrasting results for instance by studying circulation weather types in the lub during 1951 2005 jalili et al 2012 concluded that large scale atmospheric circulation patterns mediated by both precipitation and air temperature have been the main reason for seasonal changes in the lu water level also while arkian et al 2018 asserted that changes in precipitation play a larger role in controlling the lake water level than changes in temperature the correlation analysis between streamflow and climatic variable by fathian et al 2016 perceives the opposite in either case accusing climate change as the main cause of the lu shrinkage has been challenged by several other studies underscoring a much stronger impact of human induced activities on the lu drying than climate e g see khazaei et al 2019 and references therein the anthropogenic changes taken place in the lub can be summarized into a number of activities such as intensive agricultural development mehrian et al 2016 land cover change toward conversion of pasture to agricultural lands overexploitation of groundwater by a total 85 000 wells of which 50 are illegal promoting irrigated rather than rain fed cultivation following cropping patterns with high water demand and not considerable economic revenue stone 2015 imbalance between the availability of water resources and demand ashraf et al 2017 low agricultural productivity due to using outdated farming technology faramarzi 2012 disrespecting the environmental requirement of the lu by inappropriate operation of dams constructed over almost all the major rivers feeding the lake zeinoddini et al 2015 see also fig 2c overuse of surface water resources via illegal extractions water diversion structures for irrigation and low irrigation efficiency about 40 the cumulative effect of such human induced interventions has been demonstrated as the main reason for the desiccation of lu between 1996 and 2016 e g aghakouchak et al 2015 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2018 alizadeh choobari et al 2016 chaudhari et al 2018 hassanzadeh et al 2012 hosseini moghari et al 2018 khoshtinat et al 2015 3 lake urmia restoration plans and challenges 3 1 urmia lake restoration program ulrp the unsustainable use of water resources in lub followed by the desiccation of lu has introduced serious environmental socioeconomic and health related challenges in the region of the most important evidences are 18 increase in soil salinity due to the decline of groundwater level in miandoab plain iwrmc 2013 local saline dust storms from the lu bed as evidenced by a contribution of 57 6 to total suspended particles gholampour et al 2015 400 increase in soil albedo leading to enhanced reflected solar radiation causing eye diseases rsrc 2016b desertification around the lake that threatens 36 000 residential living within the radius of 10 km from the lake especially in jebel kandy area ulrp 2018 disruption of the lake biota for species like artemia and declining income from ecotourism riasi and pourmiri 2016 progression of desertification initiation of salt storms affecting nearly seven million populated areas within the radius of 250 km from the lake spread of ocular skin and respiratory diseases decreased agricultural activities and increased unemployment rate are predicted to further threaten the region if the lake continues to dry out completely garousi et al 2013 micklin 2007 sotoudeheian et al 2016 the raising concerns by regional inhabitants and international communities e g unep 2012 urged the government to prioritize a set of prompt actions against this environmental tragedy the urmia lake restoration national committee ulrnc was accordingly established in 2013 and made responsible for developing a roadmap for the restoration of lu consequently the urmia lake restoration program ulrp was assigned by ulrnc to make the necessary coordination among all the involving executive partners and regional stakeholders in order to implement and monitor the roadmap the first approved roadmap was a ten year program partitioned into three phases as shown in fig 4 i stabilization phase 2014 2016 to stop the declining trend of the lu water level and to diminish the adverse environmental consequences of the vast dried part of the lake ii restoration phase 2016 2023 to increase the lake water level by about 2 m reaching 1273 7 m in 2023 and iii sustainable restoration phase 2023 2024 to achieve the ecological water level i e 1274 1 m which is the minimum level required to revive the biota life such as artemia in the lake 3 2 lake urmia restoration plans fig 5 outlines the major objectives of the lu restoration roadmap in five categories i control and decrease of agricultural water use ii water supply for the lake from new resources as well as releases from dams iii control of illegal water withdrawal from surface and groundwater resources iv field data collection and model development for water resources planning and implementation of a decision support system and v stream restoration and renovation of hydraulic structures to enhance the delivering capacity of the streams feeding the lake ulrp 2018 fig 5 provides further details on the specific actions planned for each of the above major objectives as well as gives the relative contribution of those projects in supplying water for the lu restoration controlling and decreasing water consumption in the agricultural sector by 40 has the highest contribution to the lu restoration i e delivering 1340 mcm out of 4380 mcm water required to reach the lake ecological level this has been planned to accomplish via a set of specific actions outlined briefly as follows since september 2017 traditional irrigation has been replaced by more efficient systems like drip and sprinkler irrigation in some regions within the east and west azerbaijan to hopefully enhance the irrigation efficiency from 40 to about 75 it however should be noted that regardless of a general assertion about the significant water saving capacity of drip irrigation systems e g world bank 2006 their efficiency depends on the very specific spatial and temporal scale of application in the sense that drip irrigation efficiency at a plot scale cannot be extended to regional or basin scales van der kooij et al 2013 another project is the development of pressurized irrigation network in different parts of the basin such as agh tapeh and dashkasan in miandoab county from august 2015 to february 2017 downstream of norouzlou dam since june 2016 downstream of derik dam since april 2015 and abkhor nahrkhan arkhi in urmia county since august 2016 to decrease the current 40 50 loss in water transfer between surface water resources and farms traditional irrigation networks have been replaced by pipes in naghadeh oshnavieh bukan mahabad and urmia in west azerbaijan since july 2014 also modern drainage networks have been constructed in zola west azerbaijan since july 2014 as well as downstream of ardalan sarab dam in east azerbaijan since 2016 ulrp 2016 2015 other actions include confronting water flowing in canals during non agricultural seasons since 2016 installing 3714 smart water volume counters from july 2015 to march 2017 to monitor and control illegal withdrawal from wells blocking illegal wells from 2014 to 2017 vetoing any new dam constructions except cheraghveis and shahid madani dams with a total 810 mcm water capacity halting the former planned irrigation network development projects with a total 465 mcm water capacity and exclusive release of the water storage in madani dam s reservoir toward the lake among other activities ulrp 2018 3 3 lake urmia restoration assessment achievements and shortcomings needless to mention restructuring a complex water management plan in a mesoscale basin such as the lub requires considerable effort time budget and coordination among all stakeholders from policy makers to farmers to successfully implement the restoration plan in a timely manner accordingly ulrp has taken several constructive steps towards this goal over the past six years in this section we analyze the lu dynamics in response to only those water saving activities that directly pertain to the new management practices planned by ulrnc in this basin i e development of strategies to decrease water use and to control water withdrawal from surface and groundwater resources structural solutions that transfer water to the lake from inter or intra basin resources are not discussed since the relating projects have not been accomplished yet and hence no contribution to the lake water volume so far as of june 2019 fig 3a shows the most recent data on the lu water level it proves that the declining trend of the lu has ceased since 2014 and the lake water level increased by 0 23 m from 2014 to 2016 witnessing that the stabilization phase was accomplished successfully in 2016 however the lake water level has not yet reached those levels anticipated by ulrnc as shown in fig 4 also the cause of stabilization should be discussed with caution the lu water level has dropped by 10 cm during 2013 2017 that is considerably lower than the 170 cm and 120 cm drop during the 2005 2009 and 2009 2013 periods respectively this cannot be attributed to the change in precipitation since the basin average precipitation does not vary significantly between these periods i e 300 mm 340 mm and 270 mm in 2005 2009 2009 2013 and 2013 2017 respectively hence at first glance this considerable difference between the lake water level drops may seem promising from the restoration viewpoint and be merely attributed to the impact of the stabilization restoration activities taken place since 2013 nevertheless a few points are noteworthy about this observation first the change in water level should not be considered as a surrogate for the change in lake water volume regarding the complex bathymetry of the lu karimi et al 2016 second the significant increase in lake salinity during the drying period has decreased the lake evaporation which might be one involving reason for the decline in the lake water level drop third since the available groundwater capacity for consumption has been diminished during past years ulrp 2018 the lake water level may have responded positively to this new equilibrium condition for the sake of decrease in water loss due to irrigation in any case careful examination of these hypotheses is implausible unless sufficient spatiotemporal data on the lake bathymetry salinity and evaporation as well as basin water consumptions are available fig 4 also shows that the lake failed to hit those water levels marked in the restoration phase indicating neither significant decreasing nor increasing trend from 2016 to 2018 the delay in lake restoration pushed the ulrnc to revisit the roadmap and define the so called health threshold which is reached at the lake water level 1271 72 m and is planned to be achieved hopefully by 2022 this new restoration criterion ensures that nearly 90 of the potential dust generating source areas around the lake are covered with water rsrc 2016b thus protecting the residential areas surrounding the lake from the adverse health issues caused by the possible salt storms although reaching this new measure of restoration is important in terms of safeguarding the inhabitants in the region from saline dust related diseases the lake itself seems far from reaching its ecologically stable condition i e the water level at 1274 1 m here we note that as a result of the floods across the region in april 2019 the lu water level recorded 1271 52 m on april 23 2019 see fig 4 which is 77 cm higher than that observed at the same date on 2018 although such an abrupt increase in water level matters in terms of the lake restoration and is a fortunate episode it cannot be easily attributed to the impact of restoration plans determining the relative contribution of anthropogenic interventions in the basin to increase the outflows towards the lake such as stream dredging requires further study which would assist to examine the contributions and the pre assumptions of the restoration plans the gap between the observed and anticipated water levels in the lu since 2014 can be attributed to a wide range of technical social economic and administrative challenges ulrp acknowledges that budget limitation and the unstable economic condition has delayed or postponed the implementation of some restoration plans such as the treatment plant construction projects or the overdue payments to local officials responsible for monitoring the wells against illegal withdrawal has degraded their performance on the other hand blocking illegal wells as the main resource of those farmers whose livelihood only depends on income from agriculture has raised social tensions and perhaps unemployment rate in the region which in turn has brought about disagreements between political and executive officials to pursue such plans acknowledging these entangling challenges we emphasize that the initial restoration roadmap translated into fig 4 could be designed more conservatively if further supporting ground data and more reliable modeling results were available for the purpose of the lake level prediction also lack of uncertainty analysis of the lake water level estimations has not allowed the policymakers to dynamically update the predictions alborzi et al 2018 also echoed this important issue by highlighting that the lu recovery time can range from 3 to 16 years depending on the climatic condition the success of water withdrawal reduction plans and environmental releases section 4 presents a dynamic model data interaction framework in which we discuss what data should be collected in the lub to better understand and model the physical processes controlling the lu response to natural and anthropogenic stressors 4 model data interaction use in predicting the lake urmia dynamics the importance of information given by model data interaction for predicting the physical dynamics of a system has also been documented in the study of other endangered environments the loss of more than 90 of surface area over a 40 year period in lake chad located in africa and its split into the northern and southern lakes was believed to be mainly due to the persistent droughts and increased water withdrawals for irrigation okpara et al 2016 however by using a physical semi distributed model accounting for the lake bathymetry gao et al 2011 showed that the bathymetry itself exacerbated the lake chad split while increased precipitation and decreased irrigation would not solely guarantee to rejoin the splits into one single lake at all periods moreover lemoalle et al 2012 criticize how a lack of fundamental hydrologic data in this region has yet resulted in a contrasting understanding of the lake hydrology and its fluctuations the aral sea located in central asia is another example of environmental disasters that suffered limited supporting field data for process understanding and restoration planning despite longtime international attention toward the aral sea problem between 1960s and 1980s zavialov et al 2003 underscored that still few hydrological hydrochemical or biological data such as salinity temperature distribution density stratification and chemical composition of salts in the water were collected in the aral sea since the early 1990s leading to inaccurate model prediction of the lake dynamics this however triggered a group of international researchers to initiate a hydrophysical and hydrobiological survey in the uzbekistan deep western part of the aral sea to collect such information that would be beneficial to other researches see also micklin 2007 and references therein on the need for the value of long term monitoring and modeling of environmental changes in this region fig 6 illustrates the major components involving in a basin water planning and management from a holistic environmental socioeconomic and political perspective in the case of lub the relevant factors that collectively explain the deviation between the anticipated and observed lake water level include but not limited to continued agricultural development in some counties budget deficiency to renew agriculture technology and complete inter basin water transfer projects lack of proper enforcement to control the existing water use by farmers disagreement between policy makers to implement those restoration plans that may raise social tensions resistance by local communities to revisit their traditional farming schemes and lack of planning for alternate job opportunities so that farmers willingly diminish agricultural activities in addition to scrutinize the lu dynamics the lake and the draining basin shall be properly modeled and linked to data this component is further elaborated in fig 6 via a model data interaction workflow in which model and data establish a feedback loop in a way that while data support conceptual model development characterization and parameter estimation models propose tools for data fusion prediction uncertainty analysis and risk assessment e g beven 2009 kikuchi et al 2015 rajabi et al 2018 rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2016 reducing the uncertainty involved in the long term prediction of the lake water level tightly depends on how accurate the major physical processes controlling the lake dynamics i e surface runoff groundwater fluctuations lake evaporation basin evapotranspiration sedimentation and salt dissolution are understood and interactively modeled table 1 presents the major physically based hydrologic models that have been developed so far in the lub ahmadaali et al 2018 ahmadzadeh et al 2016 2014 akhavan and jodi hameze abad 2015 chaudhari et al 2018 emami and koch 2019 farokhnia et al 2018 ghodoosi et al 2014 gholizadeh et al 2017 japan international cooperation agency 2019 mansouri and ahmadzadeh 2015 rezaei zaman et al 2016 shadkam et al 2016 toloei et al 2015 it contains information about the model type domain extent simulated processes sources of in situ data used field data collection and uncertainty analysis of the results we note that this table only reports those models developed at the basin or sub basin scale and it does not include the hydrodynamic models for the lake itself the common shortcomings of the majority of these models can be summarized as follows first the developed models were calibrated against available streamflow data at single or multiple gauging stations however no validation exists for the simulated processes that individually impact the magnitude and timing of runoff such as snowmelt evapotranspiration and soil moisture this was not due to a missed opportunity but a direct result of lacking such data in the whole lub to pursuing this objective in this regard we argue that ulrp could plan more investment in instrumenting the basin to collect different high quality data types using e g climatologic or synoptic gauging stations eddy covariance flux tower soil moisture sensors snow depth gauges etc second the input precipitation data to these models were either assumed uniform across the domain extent spatially extrapolated using simple statistical methods or estimated from remotely sensed products that yield poor results at the daily scale third irrigation water was either ignored or presumed calibrated with a large degree of uncertainty in many of the developed models while one important component of water balance in this basin is the amount of irrigation water for which field data do not exist fourth no new field data collection has taken place by any of the studies mentioned in table 1 and finally land cover in many of these studies was considered static over the simulation period while significant land cover changes over the past two decades have been well documented in lub here we note a couple of further points first we acknowledge that the recently developed swat model by farokhnia et al 2018 is much more comprehensive than other existing models which seems a promising tool for further improvement and process exploration second limited investments in instrumentation and data collection campaigns provided by ulrnc ulrp personal communication has partly contributed to the continued high uncertainty of any model development efforts including those listed in table 1 regarding the above limitations in the following sub sections we explicitly outline what physical processes are needed to be carefully explored in the lub so that a reliable prediction of the lu dynamics can be achieved furthermore the specific data required for this purpose are discussed 4 1 surface runoff generation in the lub the observed precipitation rate in 17 stations located in the western part of the lub indicates that the total depth of precipitated water entering the basin in april and june 2017 was up to eight times greater than that in april and june 2016 however the lake water level during the same period showed a declining trend with a maximum drop of 25 cm this unexpected observation may be due to the reduction in surface runoff generated across the basin dissolution of salt at the lake bed leading to the increase in its depth less snowmelt and enhanced infiltration rate through the soil in the water year 2016 2017 and lower antecedent soil moisture content in the water year 2015 2016 examining any of these hypotheses is not feasible without the availability of sufficient field data pertaining to each phenomenon for instance exploring the mechanism of surface runoff generation requires long term data on soil moisture snow water equivalent groundwater level actual evapotranspiration land cover change change in soil conservation practices affecting percolation rate irrigation schemes and water consumptions e g bronstert et al 2002 lack of insight that could have been provided by such data has limited the ability to determine the changes in the characteristics of surface runoff generation due to e g water saving activities such as rain fed irrigation accordingly no adjustments can be made to the extent or type of the irrigation systems or drainage networks in order to optimize the water consumptions on one hand and the amount of water delivered to the lake via runoff on the other hand furthermore mapping the spatiotemporal dynamics of hot spots and hot moments for runoff generation across the basin needs a network of instruments collecting the aforementioned data e g bachmair and weiler 2014 unfortunately many of these data are either in low quality with respect to measurement bias and frequency not available inaccessible or not long enough for proper modeling calibration and validation purposes 4 2 lake urmia interaction with surface and groundwater resources the hydrochemical interaction between the lu and groundwater is still poorly understood and debated indeed deficiency of data on water stable isotope or chemical tracers does not allow for deciphering the mixing mechanisms flow pathways residence times and the source of water not only in lub but also across the country shamsi and kazemi 2014 to the best of our knowledge very few studies have so far conducted chemical and isotopic sampling i e 2h 3h 18o and cl in lub i e in shabestar azarshar and shiramin located in the eastern coast of the lu and in urmia aquifer located in the western side of the lu to explore the source of groundwater salinity and its possible connection to the lu amiri et al 2016 iaea 2015 although some isotopic analyses reject the intrusion of lu saline water into the nearby groundwater iaea 2015 they are confined to limited areas around the lake that are not representative of the whole basin lake interaction this necessitates the quest for much furtherspatially distributed and high temporal resolution isotopic data collection and analysis in this region which can provide insightful information about connectivity patterns relative contribution of different water sources to the lake i e surface runoff groundwater and snowmelt water age and timescale of exchange between the lake and the surrounding aquifers reliable hydrologic modeling is now well believed to be far away from hydrograph simulation and should be aided with tracer data so that the nonlinear threshold type non stationary and hysteresis driven nature of processes governing water and solute cycles can be appropriately modeled and studied birkel and soulsby 2015 therefore traditional hydrograph separation methods as used in vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 cannot be considered as reliable tools to identify the relative contribution of different water sources to streamflow on the interaction between the lu and the tributary surface water resources the underlying assumption of the restoration plans is that the water saved from reducing agricultural consumption within the basin or the environmental water released from dams would directly flow into the lake via the feeding rivers however due to the lu recession during recent years a vast margin of semi dry salty areas known as buffer zones fig 2d has been emerged where the outflow from rivers must first pass this zone before entering the lake although the critical role of the buffer zone in controlling the lake water budget seems clear its hydrologic functioning is yet poorly understood accordingly its impact on decreasing a portion of the surface water flowing towards the lake has not been considered in the restoration plans while predicting of the lu water volume this is important regarding the findings of a few studies in this context signifying the loss of about 1 bmc year from the buffer zone rezaei 2015 which is one third of the water volume required annually for the ecological restoration of the lake based on the ulrnc roadmap fig 4 on the other hand other studies have concluded that the amount of water reaching the lake is greater than the water volume entering the buffer zone highlighting the importance of surface runoff generation in this area that contributes to the lake input rsrc 2014 such contrasting clues thus necessitate careful exploration of the interactive impact of evaporation soil moisture dynamics and groundwater fluctuations in the buffer zone via field data and integrative modeling in order to unravel how it spatially and temporally controls the lake recharge from the incoming surface waters the developed framework for model data interaction in groundwater studies rajabi et al 2018 can be effectively employed here offering a basis for integrating multiple types of near surface and subsurface data resolving conflict between data by measuring instruments at different spatial and temporal scales detecting outliers arising from errors in measurements extracting information from various data types guiding groundwater data collection improving the performance of groundwater models facilitating an efficient model structure selection and parameter estimation process to new and previously untapped sources of information and examining sources of uncertainty for risk assessment and analysis 4 3 sedimentation and salt dissolution in the lake urmia to enhance the delivering capacity of streams flowing into the lu ulrp has planned several river stream restoration operations including dredging of simineh river 13 5 km long and 25 m wide dredging of mahabad chai 12 km long and 20 m wide dredging of gadar chai 8 km long and 25 m wide dredging of roze and barandouz river 14 5 km long and 20 m wide dredging of zola chai 12 km long and 20 m wide dredging of the rivers in salmas mahabad urmia total length of 3 5 km dredging of the creeks in urmia miandoad shahindezh naghadeh mahabad and salmas total length of 305 5 km in west azerbaijan dredging of the 3 5 km of zarrineh river in saqez in kurdistan and dredging of ajichai in east azerbaijan also due to the disconnection between the zarrineh river and the lu as a result of the lake recession zarrineh river has been connected to simineh river in order to reduce water loss via evaporation as well as to facilitate faster and larger delivery of water volume into the lake ulrp 2018 one immediate consequence of the above stream restoration practices is the increased sediment yield rate into the lake from all the southern western and eastern sides of the lake the disproportional sediment yield from rivers with different sediment rating curves makes the lake bed highly dynamic over time in addition the increased volume of water entering the lake may result in the dissolution of the salt deposits on the lake bed increasing the lake depth sporadically since both sedimentation and dissolution processes change the lake water level area volume relationship ulrnc should have updated and applied such curves required for an appropriate prediction the lake water level this clearly underscores the necessity for a hydro dynamic model so that continuous changes of the lake bathymetry in response to inflow and in lake processes can be tracked regarding the complex lake bed bathymetry validation of such a model requires intensive data collection describing the spatial distribution of salinity and flow velocity within the lake 4 4 lake evaporation and terrestrial evapotranspiration in addition to climatic variables evaporation in saline lakes like lu is also correlated to the salinity concentration over the past two decades the salinity gradient has intensified between the north and south sections of the lake due to the causeway construction increasing inputs to the lake either from direct precipitation falling onto the lake or river outflows increase the lake evaporation rate via both decreasing salinity and increasing surface area of the lake thus a lake evaporation model is needed to accurately estimate the spatiotemporal variability of evaporation by taking into account the related influences of the lake water volume and salinity concentration obviously this model would help improve the prediction of the lake water level in the upcoming years besides some efforts have been recently devoted to providing a reliable estimation of the basin evapotranspiration using remote sensing technology e g babajafari et al 2018 rsrc 2018 tourian et al 2015 nevertheless regarding the basin topography and land cover distribution field data from lysimeter or eddy covariance flux tower are necessary to calibrate and validate such models over a wide range of areas in the lub from mountains to pastures to agricultural land having rich spatial data on evapotranspiration across the lub also help identify those agricultural areas with high water consumption for irrigation where water consumption reducing policies can get focused on unfortunately these data are not available for this basin which do not allow for quantifying the uncertainty of model estimation that in turn prevent performing a proper sensitivity analysis of the estimated evapotranspiration to the model parameters also since the basin evapotranspiration including evaporation from the lake and evapotranspiration from the terrestrial part of the basin accounts for the major water loss in the lub and hence plays a critical role in controlling the lake water level it is important to develop a model that can estimate evapotranspiration with the least degree of uncertainty in summary the above discussion on the available data and process understanding in the lub clearly highlights the need for a much more investment in bridging the gap between appropriate data and modeling which can considerably mitigate the ambiguity on the lub hydrologic functioning and hopefully reduce the uncertainty of any restoration plan outcome 5 concluding remarks and future perspective exacerbated by long drought periods lu has experienced a long sever condition for more than 20 years due to the intense disruptive anthropogenic activities and mismanagement of water resources in lub several amendatory actions have been taken by ulrnc since 2013 to stabilize and restore the lake despite the lake water level stabilization in 2016 the lake has not been restored as planned by the ulrnc roadmap in this paper we focused on one of the components of the lu restoration planning and management which relates to the value of data and integrative modeling we underscored how data deficiency and limitations of the existing basin scale physically based hydrologic models have led to an inaccurate estimation of the lake water level and accordingly inaccurate restoration timetable in particular we outlined what specific data and data driven modeling are needed to improve our understanding of the physical processes and the underlying interactions that control the lake response to the natural or human induced stressors such as changes in surface runoff generation mechanisms due to land use land cover change interaction of the lake with groundwater lake evaporation terrestrial evapotranspiration lake sedimentation and salt dissolution and water and solute residence time distributions obviously signs of sustainable restoration as a result of the initiated best management practices in the lub may not emerge within a short period of time although positive steps towards reducing water consumption in agriculture such as improving irrigation efficiency changing cropping pattern and preventing overexploitation of surface and groundwater resources would certainly help manage the lub much more effective than before the socioeconomic consequences of such actions have been ignored in the restoration roadmap for instance a couple of suggested restoration actions in the roadmap are i reducing agriculture land areas by 20 000 ha to save 300 mcm of water per year and ii deauthorizing water right from farmers with an equivalent value of 500 mcm of water per year not surprisingly executing these actions would be accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate immigration and social tensions unless farmers can find alternative job opportunities to compensate their lost income from agriculture this clearly requires considerable investment in public training infrastructure development and multi organization coordination the lu restoration is thus a joint collaboration between environmentalists socioeconomists politicians and all the involving stakeholders in the region any restoration plan is condemned to failure unless viewpoints of and constraints by these four realms are holistically taken into account when such a plan is reached it shall be grasped and approved by all stakeholders to ensure long term system sustainability and hopefully improved condition for any stakeholders declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors express their appreciation to ali hajimoradi head of technical

6318,losing eight meters of water level over a 20 year period from 1996 to 2016 marked the lake urmia lu as one of the regional environmental crises this condition has threatened biota life intensified desertification around the lake and raised social concerns by adversely impacting the inhabitants health and economy in 2013 the urmia lake restoration national committee ulrnc started implementing certain management practices to stop the drying trend of lu resulted in the cease of water level drop and stabilization of lu condition in 2016 nevertheless the restoration actions have not yet raised the lake to the water level as planned by the roadmap this paper aims to describe and to assess the lu restoration plans by underscoring the ulrnc achievements challenges and shortcomings in particular we discuss how the value of data and data aided modeling has been underestimated by the lu restoration programs leading to still existing puzzles about the lake interaction with the involving physical processes governing its dynamics we show how the lu restoration timetable has not fulfilled the planned milestones as evidenced by the inability to capture the anticipated lake water levels which is partly attributed to the lack of field data and dynamic modeling that could predict the lake response in a more reliable and conservative manner the current restoration plans should also be revisited to ensure that any practice with the aim of reducing water consumption in the basin is not only environmentally sustainable but also feasible from the socioeconomic perspective the insights provided by this paper attempt to underscore the value of field data collection for establishing a reliable conceptual model and for executing pre and post monitoring of the lake so that the success or failure of the restoration actions taken by the policymakers can be appropriately evaluated keywords lake urmia restoration data driven modeling environmental sustainability socioeconomic 1 introduction models and data are two perspectives of the same scene that aim to portray a collective picture how interacting processes govern a system behavior the hydrogeology literature is replete with numerous modeling efforts to enhance our understanding of sophisticated processes taking place in the environment e g see fatichi et al 2016 and references therein this has been pursued by developing models with distinct assumptions uncertainty and complexity asking for information about landscape heterogeneity for parameter estimation e g rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2016 singh and frevert 2002 as well as certain computational resources depending on the size of the problem and the degree to which temporal and spatial information is needed to be resolved e g kollet et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 despite significant advances in computing technology and power models are still a simplified representation of reality that cannot ever completely convey the insight provided by field observations experiments and measurements e g rajabi et al 2018 silberstein 2006 nisbet et al 2014 quoted patrick crill that data without models are chaos but models without data are fantasy such a need has motivated the modern hydrogeology to aggressively strive for and invest in data collection helping increase the chance to get the right answers for the right reasons kirchner 2006 todini 2007 this paper seeks to exemplify the value of model data interaction by focusing on one environmental crisis of our era the lake urmia lu located in northwestern iran which lost nearly eight meters of water in 20 years between 1996 and 2016 such a drastic condition urged the country to take prompt actions against the decrease of the lu water level beginning in 2013 the urmia lake restoration ulrnc ulrnc started bringing stakeholders legislators and international collaborators together to design and implement a roadmap for first stabilizing and then restoring the lu to the minimum required ecological level that asks for about 15 bcm of water with reference to the 2016 condition however the restoration rate has been recorded smaller than that estimated by the action plan the reasons for this unforeseen deviation can be discussed from a wide range of viewpoints in this study we focus on one involving factor relating to the limited integrated data driven modeling efforts as well as minor investment in instrumenting the basin to collect field data that have resulted in a poor prediction of the lu water volume response to the water saving restoration actions we argue that any planning without appropriate data and model is gambling i e a reliable understanding of the system in the form of a holistic conceptual model fed by and validated against several field data types is a prerequisite before any plan is taken to implement to mention a few issues in this context are data deficiently for validating estimates of lake evaporation and basin evapotranspiration that account for the major water loss in the lu and lake urmia basin lub respectively contrasting modeling and experimental evidences about the hydrologic connectivity between the lake and groundwater lack of chemical and isotopic data to identify the mixing sources of flow and timescales of hydro chemical behavior of the lu and lub and non integrated modeling approaches to evaluating the socioeconomic impacts of the lake restoration actions it is worth mentioning that the significance of in situ observations and integrated modeling based on ground truth has already been demonstrated by the study of other internationally important environmental systems such as the lake chad in africa and the aral sea in central asia lemoalle et al 2012 micklin 2007 see also section 4 for further details on the contribution of model data interaction to the restoration of these two systems to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that outlines the lu restoration challenge from this perspective in particular we aim to 1 outline the lu restoration plans by underlining their achievements shortcomings and challenges 2 illustrate the gap between the observed and the anticipated lu water levels by ulrnc over the five year period 2013 2018 3 discuss the limitations of the so far developed physically based hydrological models in the lub in terms model structure and data deficiency required for calibration and validation purposes and 4 discuss what specific data for which specific modeling purposes should be collected across the lub for an appropriate understanding of the physical processes that control the lu response to natural stressors and human induced restoration interventions the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 gives an overview of the lu history by outlining the natural and anthropogenic changes in the lub over the past three decades the literature on the lake status based on the most recent available data is also updated section 3 assesses the lu restoration plans from the technical and socioeconomic aspects on section 4 we highlight the need for much aggressive data collection in lub with emphasis on certain current modeling challenges in this basin finally section 5 concludes with remarks about the lake restoration future perspective 2 lake urmia past and present 2 1 lake urmia basin lub the 51 876 km2 lub 37 44 n 45 23 e is one of the six major basins in iran that is closed and drained by 17 permanent and 12 seasonal rivers fig 1 lub lithology witnesses fingerprints from different geologic periods palaeozoic metamorphic rocks in the west dolomites sandstones quartzites and volcanic rocks from the infracambrian in the south mesozoic flysch rocks dominating in the eastern islands coralline limestones from the lower miocene along the northwestern shores and lower evaporite marl series and an upper red bed conglomerate series in the northern margin and northeastern hinterland kelts and shahrabi 1986 fig 2 a shows the lub topographical distribution with an altitude ranging from 1202 m to 3751 m above msl that is characterized with the lu 3 9 as of july 2017 with an average water level at 1270 49 m above msl and plains 31 1 surrounded by mountains 65 across the basin margin the basin climate is classified as cold semi arid with an average annual precipitation varying between 300 mm and 400 mm high air temperature fluctuations between 6 c and 31 2 c average relative humidity of 52 64 doe 2013 and average annual actual evapotranspiration of 421 mm between 2000 and 2016 rsrc 2017 the region faces four seasons with cold winters during december february and temperate summers during june august while 40 30 26 and 4 of annual precipitation falls in spring winter autumn and summer respectively lub is shared between east azerbaijan 43 4 west azerbaijan 47 7 and kurdistan 9 8 provinces fig 1 wherein the population has increased by 8 5 13 6 and 11 3 respectively from 2006 to 2016 statistical center of iran 2016 the basin currently suffers stress on water resources due to the increased demand for urban water and most importantly for the intensive agricultural development that accounts for more than 60 of renewable water resources use and 93 total water resources consumption in the entire basin doe 2014 the amount of water used for irrigation purposes proves an increase by more than 85 and 11 in 2010 compared to 1995 and 2014 respectively rsrc 2016a this unsustainable agricultural development has been accompanied by an increase in evapotranspiration and overuse of both surface and groundwater resources across the lub consequently the outflow from 14 rivers feeding the lake has decreased significantly by an average of 56 from 1966 1996 to 1997 2012 also the total number of deep and shallow wells in 2012 2013 is about four times greater than that in 1984 1985 i e there are on average seven wells per square kilometer in the basin fig 2b as a consequence the total amount of groundwater withdrawal jumped from 1200 mcm in 1984 1985 to 2200 mcm in 2012 2013 nevertheless the withdrawal rate from wells has decreased in recent years indicating the declining discharge capacity of aquifers due to overexploitation ulrp 2018 2 2 lake urmia lu lu is the terminal drainage point of 12 sub basins in lub that is known for its hypersalinity with salt concentration ranging from 140 g l to more than 380 g l zeinoddini et al 2009 designated as a national park 1971 a unesco biosphere reserve 1976 and a ramsar site https bit ly

lake buffer zone has also been a reserve for artemia harvesting with medical purposes salt extraction and ecotourism e g khorshiddoust 2017 mahboob et al 2009 fig 3 a shows the lake water level fluctuations over a 50 year period indicating two contrasting trends between 1966 and 2016 fathian et al 2014 an increasing trend from 1966 to 1996 when the lake reached its maximum level at 1278 41 m in 1996 followed by a drastic continuous decreasing trend from 1996 to 2016 indeed the lake water level decreased by nearly eight meters in 20 years leading to a loss of almost 70 of the lake area i e 5816 km2 in 1996 vs 1802 km2 in 2016 fig 3b and c and 96 of lake volume i e 34 22 bcm in 1996 vs 1 24 bcm in 2016 fig 3c 2 3 climatic and anthropogenic impacts the trend analysis of the long term climatic variables indicates a significant increasing trend in annual temperature in the majority of stations throughout the lub fathian et al 2016 despite the increasing trend in temperature no significant trend was observed in the lake annual evaporation after 1995 which has been explained by the counteractive effect on the evaporation of increasing temperature and decreasing wind speed in the basin arkian et al 2018 also long term annual precipitation shows no significant trend in 75 of the stations while the remaining stations indicate both significant increasing or decreasing trends with different precipitation pattern depending on the location of a given station fathian et al 2015 fazel et al 2018 vaheddoost and aksoy 2017 given these pieces of evidence the degree of contribution to the decline of the lu water level by climate variability has been both controversial and accompanied by contrasting results for instance by studying circulation weather types in the lub during 1951 2005 jalili et al 2012 concluded that large scale atmospheric circulation patterns mediated by both precipitation and air temperature have been the main reason for seasonal changes in the lu water level also while arkian et al 2018 asserted that changes in precipitation play a larger role in controlling the lake water level than changes in temperature the correlation analysis between streamflow and climatic variable by fathian et al 2016 perceives the opposite in either case accusing climate change as the main cause of the lu shrinkage has been challenged by several other studies underscoring a much stronger impact of human induced activities on the lu drying than climate e g see khazaei et al 2019 and references therein the anthropogenic changes taken place in the lub can be summarized into a number of activities such as intensive agricultural development mehrian et al 2016 land cover change toward conversion of pasture to agricultural lands overexploitation of groundwater by a total 85 000 wells of which 50 are illegal promoting irrigated rather than rain fed cultivation following cropping patterns with high water demand and not considerable economic revenue stone 2015 imbalance between the availability of water resources and demand ashraf et al 2017 low agricultural productivity due to using outdated farming technology faramarzi 2012 disrespecting the environmental requirement of the lu by inappropriate operation of dams constructed over almost all the major rivers feeding the lake zeinoddini et al 2015 see also fig 2c overuse of surface water resources via illegal extractions water diversion structures for irrigation and low irrigation efficiency about 40 the cumulative effect of such human induced interventions has been demonstrated as the main reason for the desiccation of lu between 1996 and 2016 e g aghakouchak et al 2015 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2018 alizadeh choobari et al 2016 chaudhari et al 2018 hassanzadeh et al 2012 hosseini moghari et al 2018 khoshtinat et al 2015 3 lake urmia restoration plans and challenges 3 1 urmia lake restoration program ulrp the unsustainable use of water resources in lub followed by the desiccation of lu has introduced serious environmental socioeconomic and health related challenges in the region of the most important evidences are 18 increase in soil salinity due to the decline of groundwater level in miandoab plain iwrmc 2013 local saline dust storms from the lu bed as evidenced by a contribution of 57 6 to total suspended particles gholampour et al 2015

desertification initiation of salt storms affecting nearly seven million populated areas within the radius of 250 km from the lake spread of ocular skin and respiratory diseases decreased agricultural activities and increased unemployment rate are predicted to further threaten the region if the lake continues to dry out completely garousi et al 2013 micklin 2007 sotoudeheian et al 2016 the raising concerns by regional inhabitants and international communities e g unep 2012 urged the government to prioritize a set of prompt actions against this environmental tragedy the urmia lake restoration national committee ulrnc was accordingly established in 2013 and made responsible for developing a roadmap for the restoration of lu consequently the urmia lake restoration program ulrp was assigned by ulrnc to make the necessary coordination among all the involving executive partners and regional stakeholders in order to implement and monitor the roadmap the first approved roadmap was a ten year program partitioned into three phases as shown in fig 4 i stabilization phase 2014 2016 to stop the declining trend of the lu water level and to diminish the adverse environmental consequences of the vast dried part of the lake ii restoration phase 2016 2023 to increase the lake water level by about 2 m reaching 1273 7 m in 2023 and iii sustainable restoration phase 2023 2024 to achieve the ecological water level i e 1274 1 m which is the minimum level required to revive the biota life such as artemia in the lake 3 2 lake urmia restoration plans fig 5 outlines the major objectives of the lu restoration roadmap in five categories i control and decrease of agricultural water use ii water supply for the lake from new resources as well as releases from dams iii control of illegal water withdrawal from surface and groundwater resources iv field data collection and model development for water resources planning and implementation of a decision support system and v stream restoration and renovation of hydraulic structures to enhance the delivering capacity of the streams feeding the lake ulrp 2018 fig 5 provides further details on the specific actions planned for each of the above major objectives as well as gives the relative contribution of those projects in supplying water for the lu restoration controlling and decreasing water consumption in the agricultural sector by 40 has the highest contribution to the lu restoration i e delivering 1340 mcm out of 4380 mcm water required to reach the lake ecological level this has been planned to accomplish via a set of specific actions outlined briefly as follows since september 2017 traditional irrigation has been replaced by more efficient systems like drip and sprinkler irrigation in some regions within the east and west azerbaijan to hopefully enhance the irrigation efficiency from 40 to about 75 it however should be noted that regardless of a general assertion about the significant water saving capacity of drip irrigation systems e g world bank 2006 their efficiency depends on the very specific spatial and temporal scale of application in the sense that drip irrigation efficiency at a plot scale cannot be extended to regional or basin scales van der kooij et al 2013 another project is the development of pressurized irrigation network in different parts of the basin such as agh tapeh and dashkasan in miandoab county from august 2015 to february 2017 downstream of norouzlou dam since june 2016 downstream of derik dam since april 2015 and abkhor nahrkhan arkhi in urmia county since august 2016 to decrease the current 40 50 loss in water transfer between surface water resources and farms traditional irrigation networks have been replaced by pipes in naghadeh oshnavieh bukan mahabad and urmia in west azerbaijan since july 2014 also modern drainage networks have been constructed in zola west azerbaijan since july 2014 as well as downstream of ardalan sarab dam in east azerbaijan since 2016 ulrp 2016 2015 other actions include confronting water flowing in canals during non agricultural seasons since 2016 installing 3714 smart water volume counters from july 2015 to march 2017 to monitor and control illegal withdrawal from wells blocking illegal wells from 2014 to 2017 vetoing any new dam constructions except cheraghveis and shahid madani dams with a total 810 mcm water capacity halting the former planned irrigation network development projects with a total 465 mcm water capacity and exclusive release of the water storage in madani dam s reservoir toward the lake among other activities ulrp 2018 3 3 lake urmia restoration assessment achievements and shortcomings needless to mention restructuring a complex water management plan in a mesoscale basin such as the lub requires considerable effort time budget and coordination among all stakeholders from policy makers to farmers to successfully implement the restoration plan in a timely manner accordingly ulrp has taken several constructive steps towards this goal over the past six years in this section we analyze the lu dynamics in response to only those water saving activities that directly pertain to the new management practices planned by ulrnc in this basin i e development of strategies to decrease water use and to control water withdrawal from surface and groundwater resources structural solutions that transfer water to the lake from inter or intra basin resources are not discussed since the relating projects have not been accomplished yet and hence no contribution to the lake water volume so far as of june 2019 fig 3a shows the most recent data on the lu water level it proves that the declining trend of the lu has ceased since 2014 and the lake water level increased by 0 23 m from 2014 to 2016 witnessing that the stabilization phase was accomplished successfully in 2016 however the lake water level has not yet reached those levels anticipated by ulrnc as shown in fig 4 also the cause of stabilization should be discussed with caution the lu water level has dropped by 10 cm during 2013 2017 that is considerably lower than the 170 cm and 120 cm drop during the 2005 2009 and 2009 2013 periods respectively this cannot be attributed to the change in precipitation since the basin average precipitation does not vary significantly between these periods i e 300 mm 340 mm and 270 mm in 2005 2009 2009 2013 and 2013 2017 respectively hence at first glance this considerable difference between the lake water level drops may seem promising from the restoration viewpoint and be merely attributed to the impact of the stabilization restoration activities taken place since 2013 nevertheless a few points are noteworthy about this observation first the change in water level should not be considered as a surrogate for the change in lake water volume regarding the complex bathymetry of the lu karimi et al 2016 second the significant increase in lake salinity during the drying period has decreased the lake evaporation which might be one involving reason for the decline in the lake water level drop third since the available groundwater capacity for consumption has been diminished during past years ulrp 2018 the lake water level may have responded positively to this new equilibrium condition for the sake of decrease in water loss due to irrigation in any case careful examination of these hypotheses is implausible unless sufficient spatiotemporal data on the lake bathymetry salinity and evaporation as well as basin water consumptions are available fig 4 also shows that the lake failed to hit those water levels marked in the restoration phase indicating neither significant decreasing nor increasing trend from 2016 to 2018 the delay in lake restoration pushed the ulrnc to revisit the roadmap and define the so called health threshold which is reached at the lake water level 1271 72 m and is planned to be achieved hopefully by 2022 this new restoration criterion ensures that nearly 90 of the potential dust generating source areas around the lake are covered with water rsrc 2016b thus protecting the residential areas surrounding the lake from the adverse health issues caused by the possible salt storms although reaching this new measure of restoration is important in terms of safeguarding the inhabitants in the region from saline dust related diseases the lake itself seems far from reaching its ecologically stable condition i e the water level at 1274 1 m here we note that as a result of the floods across the region in april 2019 the lu water level recorded 1271 52 m on april 23 2019 see fig 4 which is 77 cm higher than that observed at the same date on 2018 although such an abrupt increase in water level matters in terms of the lake restoration and is a fortunate episode it cannot be easily attributed to the impact of restoration plans determining the relative contribution of anthropogenic interventions in the basin to increase the outflows towards the lake such as stream dredging requires further study which would assist to examine the contributions and the pre assumptions of the restoration plans the gap between the observed and anticipated water levels in the lu since 2014 can be attributed to a wide range of technical social economic and administrative challenges ulrp acknowledges that budget limitation and the unstable economic condition has delayed or postponed the implementation of some restoration plans such as the treatment plant construction projects or the overdue payments to local officials responsible for monitoring the wells against illegal withdrawal has degraded their performance on the other hand blocking illegal wells as the main resource of those farmers whose livelihood only depends on income from agriculture has raised social tensions and perhaps unemployment rate in the region which in turn has brought about disagreements between political and executive officials to pursue such plans acknowledging these entangling challenges we emphasize that the initial restoration roadmap translated into fig 4 could be designed more conservatively if further supporting ground data and more reliable modeling results were available for the purpose of the lake level prediction also lack of uncertainty analysis of the lake water level estimations has not allowed the policymakers to dynamically update the predictions alborzi et al 2018 also echoed this important issue by highlighting that the lu recovery time can range from 3 to 16 years depending on the climatic condition the success of water withdrawal reduction plans and environmental releases section 4 presents a dynamic model data interaction framework in which we discuss what data should be collected in the lub to better understand and model the physical processes controlling the lu response to natural and anthropogenic stressors 4 model data interaction use in predicting the lake urmia dynamics the importance of information given by model data interaction for predicting the physical dynamics of a system has also been documented in the study of other endangered environments the loss of more than 90 of surface area over a 40 year period in lake chad located in africa and its split into the northern and southern lakes was believed to be mainly due to the persistent droughts and increased water withdrawals for irrigation okpara et al 2016 however by using a physical semi distributed model accounting for the lake bathymetry gao et al 2011 showed that the bathymetry itself exacerbated the lake chad split while increased precipitation and decreased irrigation would not solely guarantee to rejoin the splits into one single lake at all periods moreover lemoalle et al 2012 criticize how a lack of fundamental hydrologic data in this region has yet resulted in a contrasting understanding of the lake hydrology and its fluctuations the aral sea located in central asia is another example of environmental disasters that suffered limited supporting field data for process understanding and restoration planning despite longtime international attention toward the aral sea problem between 1960s and 1980s zavialov et al 2003 underscored that still few hydrological hydrochemical or biological data such as salinity temperature distribution density stratification and chemical composition of salts in the water were collected in the aral sea since the early 1990s leading to inaccurate model prediction of the lake dynamics this however triggered a group of international researchers to initiate a hydrophysical and hydrobiological survey in the uzbekistan deep western part of the aral sea to collect such information that would be beneficial to other researches see also micklin 2007 and references therein on the need for the value of long term monitoring and modeling of environmental changes in this region fig 6 illustrates the major components involving in a basin water planning and management from a holistic environmental socioeconomic and political perspective in the case of lub the relevant factors that collectively explain the deviation between the anticipated and observed lake water level include but not limited to continued agricultural development in some counties budget deficiency to renew agriculture technology and complete inter basin water transfer projects lack of proper enforcement to control the existing water use by farmers disagreement between policy makers to implement those restoration plans that may raise social tensions resistance by local communities to revisit their traditional farming schemes and lack of planning for alternate job opportunities so that farmers willingly diminish agricultural activities in addition to scrutinize the lu dynamics the lake and the draining basin shall be properly modeled and linked to data this component is further elaborated in fig 6 via a model data interaction workflow in which model and data establish a feedback loop in a way that while data support conceptual model development characterization and parameter estimation models propose tools for data fusion prediction uncertainty analysis and risk assessment e g beven 2009 kikuchi et al 2015 rajabi et al 2018 rajabi and ataie ashtiani 2016 reducing the uncertainty involved in the long term prediction of the lake water level tightly depends on how accurate the major physical processes controlling the lake dynamics i e surface runoff groundwater fluctuations lake evaporation basin evapotranspiration sedimentation and salt dissolution are understood and interactively modeled table 1 presents the major physically based hydrologic models that have been developed so far in the lub ahmadaali et al 2018 ahmadzadeh et al 2016 2014 akhavan and jodi hameze abad 2015 chaudhari et al 2018 emami and koch 2019 farokhnia et al 2018 ghodoosi et al 2014 gholizadeh et al 2017 japan international cooperation agency 2019 mansouri and ahmadzadeh 2015 rezaei zaman et al 2016 shadkam et al 2016 toloei et al 2015 it contains information about the model type domain extent simulated processes sources of in situ data used field data collection and uncertainty analysis of the results we note that this table only reports those models developed at the basin or sub basin scale and it does not include the hydrodynamic models for the lake itself the common shortcomings of the majority of these models can be summarized as follows first the developed models were calibrated against available streamflow data at single or multiple gauging stations however no validation exists for the simulated processes that individually impact the magnitude and timing of runoff such as snowmelt evapotranspiration and soil moisture this was not due to a missed opportunity but a direct result of lacking such data in the whole lub to pursuing this objective in this regard we argue that ulrp could plan more investment in instrumenting the basin to collect different high quality data types using e g climatologic or synoptic gauging stations eddy covariance flux tower soil moisture sensors snow depth gauges etc second the input precipitation data to these models were either assumed uniform across the domain extent spatially extrapolated using simple statistical methods or estimated from remotely sensed products that yield poor results at the daily scale third irrigation water was either ignored or presumed calibrated with a large degree of uncertainty in many of the developed models while one important component of water balance in this basin is the amount of irrigation water for which field data do not exist fourth no new field data collection has taken place by any of the studies mentioned in table 1 and finally land cover in many of these studies was considered static over the simulation period while significant land cover changes over the past two decades have been well documented in lub here we note a couple of further points first we acknowledge that the recently developed swat model by farokhnia et al 2018 is much more comprehensive than other existing models which seems a promising tool for further improvement and process exploration second limited investments in instrumentation and data collection campaigns provided by ulrnc ulrp personal communication has partly contributed to the continued high uncertainty of any model development efforts including those listed in table 1 regarding the above limitations in the following sub sections we explicitly outline what physical processes are needed to be carefully explored in the lub so that a reliable prediction of the lu dynamics can be achieved furthermore the specific data required for this purpose are discussed 4 1 surface runoff generation in the lub the observed precipitation rate in 17 stations located in the western part of the lub indicates that the total depth of precipitated water entering the basin in april and june 2017 was up to eight times greater than that in april and june 2016 however the lake water level during the same period showed a declining trend with a maximum drop of 25 cm this unexpected observation may be due to the reduction in surface runoff generated across the basin dissolution of salt at the lake bed leading to the increase in its depth less snowmelt and enhanced infiltration rate through the soil in the water year 2016 2017 and lower antecedent soil moisture content in the water year 2015 2016 examining any of these hypotheses is not feasible without the availability of sufficient field data pertaining to each phenomenon for instance exploring the mechanism of surface runoff generation requires long term data on soil moisture snow water equivalent groundwater level actual evapotranspiration land cover change change in soil conservation practices affecting percolation rate irrigation schemes and water consumptions e g bronstert et al 2002 lack of insight that could have been provided by such data has limited the ability to determine the changes in the characteristics of surface runoff generation due to e g water saving activities such as rain fed irrigation accordingly no adjustments can be made to the extent or type of the irrigation systems or drainage networks in order to optimize the water consumptions on one hand and the amount of water delivered to the lake via runoff on the other hand furthermore mapping the spatiotemporal dynamics of hot spots and hot moments for runoff generation across the basin needs a network of instruments collecting the aforementioned data e g bachmair and weiler 2014 unfortunately many of these data are either in low quality with respect to measurement bias and frequency not available inaccessible or not long enough for proper modeling calibration and validation purposes 4 2 lake urmia interaction with surface and groundwater resources the hydrochemical interaction between the lu and groundwater is still poorly understood and debated indeed deficiency of data on water stable isotope or chemical tracers does not allow for deciphering the mixing mechanisms flow pathways residence times and the source of water not only in lub but also across the country shamsi and kazemi 2014 to the best of our knowledge very few studies have so far conducted chemical and isotopic sampling i e 2h 3h 18o and cl in lub i e in shabestar azarshar and shiramin located in the eastern coast of the lu and in urmia aquifer located in the western side of the lu to explore the source of groundwater salinity and its possible connection to the lu amiri et al 2016 iaea 2015 although some isotopic analyses reject the intrusion of lu saline water into the nearby groundwater iaea 2015 they are confined to limited areas around the lake that are not representative of the whole basin lake interaction this necessitates the quest for much furtherspatially distributed and high temporal resolution isotopic data collection and analysis in this region which can provide insightful information about connectivity patterns relative contribution of different water sources to the lake i e surface runoff groundwater and snowmelt water age and timescale of exchange between the lake and the surrounding aquifers reliable hydrologic modeling is now well believed to be far away from hydrograph simulation and should be aided with tracer data so that the nonlinear threshold type non stationary and hysteresis driven nature of processes governing water and solute cycles can be appropriately modeled and studied birkel and soulsby 2015 therefore traditional hydrograph separation methods as used in vaheddoost and aksoy 2018 cannot be considered as reliable tools to identify the relative contribution of different water sources to streamflow on the interaction between the lu and the tributary surface water resources the underlying assumption of the restoration plans is that the water saved from reducing agricultural consumption within the basin or the environmental water released from dams would directly flow into the lake via the feeding rivers however due to the lu recession during recent years a vast margin of semi dry salty areas known as buffer zones fig 2d has been emerged where the outflow from rivers must first pass this zone before entering the lake although the critical role of the buffer zone in controlling the lake water budget seems clear its hydrologic functioning is yet poorly understood accordingly its impact on decreasing a portion of the surface water flowing towards the lake has not been considered in the restoration plans while predicting of the lu water volume this is important regarding the findings of a few studies in this context signifying the loss of about 1 bmc year from the buffer zone rezaei 2015 which is one third of the water volume required annually for the ecological restoration of the lake based on the ulrnc roadmap fig 4 on the other hand other studies have concluded that the amount of water reaching the lake is greater than the water volume entering the buffer zone highlighting the importance of surface runoff generation in this area that contributes to the lake input rsrc 2014 such contrasting clues thus necessitate careful exploration of the interactive impact of evaporation soil moisture dynamics and groundwater fluctuations in the buffer zone via field data and integrative modeling in order to unravel how it spatially and temporally controls the lake recharge from the incoming surface waters the developed framework for model data interaction in groundwater studies rajabi et al 2018 can be effectively employed here offering a basis for integrating multiple types of near surface and subsurface data resolving conflict between data by measuring instruments at different spatial and temporal scales detecting outliers arising from errors in measurements extracting information from various data types guiding groundwater data collection improving the performance of groundwater models facilitating an efficient model structure selection and parameter estimation process to new and previously untapped sources of information and examining sources of uncertainty for risk assessment and analysis 4 3 sedimentation and salt dissolution in the lake urmia to enhance the delivering capacity of streams flowing into the lu ulrp has planned several river stream restoration operations including dredging of simineh river 13 5 km long and 25 m wide dredging of mahabad chai 12 km long and 20 m wide dredging of gadar chai 8 km long and 25 m wide dredging of roze and barandouz river 14 5 km long and 20 m wide dredging of zola chai 12 km long and 20 m wide dredging of the rivers in salmas mahabad urmia total length of 3 5 km dredging of the creeks in urmia miandoad shahindezh naghadeh mahabad and salmas total length of 305 5 km in west azerbaijan dredging of the 3 5 km of zarrineh river in saqez in kurdistan and dredging of ajichai in east azerbaijan also due to the disconnection between the zarrineh river and the lu as a result of the lake recession zarrineh river has been connected to simineh river in order to reduce water loss via evaporation as well as to facilitate faster and larger delivery of water volume into the lake ulrp 2018 one immediate consequence of the above stream restoration practices is the increased sediment yield rate into the lake from all the southern western and eastern sides of the lake the disproportional sediment yield from rivers with different sediment rating curves makes the lake bed highly dynamic over time in addition the increased volume of water entering the lake may result in the dissolution of the salt deposits on the lake bed increasing the lake depth sporadically since both sedimentation and dissolution processes change the lake water level area volume relationship ulrnc should have updated and applied such curves required for an appropriate prediction the lake water level this clearly underscores the necessity for a hydro dynamic model so that continuous changes of the lake bathymetry in response to inflow and in lake processes can be tracked regarding the complex lake bed bathymetry validation of such a model requires intensive data collection describing the spatial distribution of salinity and flow velocity within the lake 4 4 lake evaporation and terrestrial evapotranspiration in addition to climatic variables evaporation in saline lakes like lu is also correlated to the salinity concentration over the past two decades the salinity gradient has intensified between the north and south sections of the lake due to the causeway construction increasing inputs to the lake either from direct precipitation falling onto the lake or river outflows increase the lake evaporation rate via both decreasing salinity and increasing surface area of the lake thus a lake evaporation model is needed to accurately estimate the spatiotemporal variability of evaporation by taking into account the related influences of the lake water volume and salinity concentration obviously this model would help improve the prediction of the lake water level in the upcoming years besides some efforts have been recently devoted to providing a reliable estimation of the basin evapotranspiration using remote sensing technology e g babajafari et al 2018 rsrc 2018 tourian et al 2015 nevertheless regarding the basin topography and land cover distribution field data from lysimeter or eddy covariance flux tower are necessary to calibrate and validate such models over a wide range of areas in the lub from mountains to pastures to agricultural land having rich spatial data on evapotranspiration across the lub also help identify those agricultural areas with high water consumption for irrigation where water consumption reducing policies can get focused on unfortunately these data are not available for this basin which do not allow for quantifying the uncertainty of model estimation that in turn prevent performing a proper sensitivity analysis of the estimated evapotranspiration to the model parameters also since the basin evapotranspiration including evaporation from the lake and evapotranspiration from the terrestrial part of the basin accounts for the major water loss in the lub and hence plays a critical role in controlling the lake water level it is important to develop a model that can estimate evapotranspiration with the least degree of uncertainty in summary the above discussion on the available data and process understanding in the lub clearly highlights the need for a much more investment in bridging the gap between appropriate data and modeling which can considerably mitigate the ambiguity on the lub hydrologic functioning and hopefully reduce the uncertainty of any restoration plan outcome 5 concluding remarks and future perspective exacerbated by long drought periods lu has experienced a long sever condition for more than 20 years due to the intense disruptive anthropogenic activities and mismanagement of water resources in lub several amendatory actions have been taken by ulrnc since 2013 to stabilize and restore the lake despite the lake water level stabilization in 2016 the lake has not been restored as planned by the ulrnc roadmap in this paper we focused on one of the components of the lu restoration planning and management which relates to the value of data and integrative modeling we underscored how data deficiency and limitations of the existing basin scale physically based hydrologic models have led to an inaccurate estimation of the lake water level and accordingly inaccurate restoration timetable in particular we outlined what specific data and data driven modeling are needed to improve our understanding of the physical processes and the underlying interactions that control the lake response to the natural or human induced stressors such as changes in surface runoff generation mechanisms due to land use land cover change interaction of the lake with groundwater lake evaporation terrestrial evapotranspiration lake sedimentation and salt dissolution and water and solute residence time distributions obviously signs of sustainable restoration as a result of the initiated best management practices in the lub may not emerge within a short period of time although positive steps towards reducing water consumption in agriculture such as improving irrigation efficiency changing cropping pattern and preventing overexploitation of surface and groundwater resources would certainly help manage the lub much more effective than before the socioeconomic consequences of such actions have been ignored in the restoration roadmap for instance a couple of suggested restoration actions in the roadmap are i reducing agriculture land areas by 20 000 ha to save 300 mcm of water per year and ii deauthorizing water right from farmers with an equivalent value of 500 mcm of water per year not surprisingly executing these actions would be accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate immigration and social tensions unless farmers can find alternative job opportunities to compensate their lost income from agriculture this clearly requires considerable investment in public training infrastructure development and multi organization coordination the lu restoration is thus a joint collaboration between environmentalists socioeconomists politicians and all the involving stakeholders in the region any restoration plan is condemned to failure unless viewpoints of and constraints by these four realms are holistically taken into account when such a plan is reached it shall be grasped and approved by all stakeholders to ensure long term system sustainability and hopefully improved condition for any stakeholders declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors express their appreciation to ali hajimoradi head of technical

6319,where surface and groundwater are managed conjunctively the stress on water supplies from climate change can significantly influence water use patterns as well as the economic value and sustainability of those uses however aquifer protection can be an expensive proposition because water uses that currently rely on aquifer pumping may produce considerable economic value that would be lost if protection measures are carried out evidence from climate stressed regions has attracted research addressing the costs and benefits of aquifer protection plans despite these efforts few peer reviewed papers have examined water use patterns that minimize the economic costs of aquifer protection this work presents an original approach to address that gap by developing and applying a basin scale hydroeconomic optimization model of north america s middle rio grande basin to explore impacts of new policies not yet implemented supporting aquifer protection it also gives model access to readers or stakeholders to experiment with their own scenarios to assess impacts of alternative aquifer protection plans the model accounts for surface and groundwater storage irrigation urban environmental and recreational demands surface water inflows under various climate scenarios groundwater pumping and recharge substitute water prices crop water use evaporation as well as institutional constraints governing water use the objective is implemented by finding the optimized discounted net present value of economic benefits summed over uses sectors and regions from use of surface water and connected aquifers results are shown for each of six water supply scenarios two substitute water prices and two system operation rules to address impacts of aquifer protection targets groundwater sustainability targets are specified and enforced as constraints for each of the region s two major aquifers we assess total and marginal cost of achieving two targeted aquifer protection levels by identifying optimized surface use and groundwater pumping for each of 24 scenarios results show that climate change in the form of reduced and highly variable inflows considerably drives up the cost of protecting aquifer sustainability amplified by the conjunctive nature of the system future work points to a need to assess economic performance of various water conservation measures as well as reducing costs of substitute water through measures such as technical advance in desalination recycling and reuse substitution of other resources for water better characterization of existing aquifers and development of new groundwater supplies keywords water management aquifer protection hydroeconomic optimization model optimal growth climate stress adaptation 1 background

issue in dry regions that demands for groundwater exceed renewable supplies famiglietti 2014 especially for regions that experience climate stressed inflow reductions increasingly common in our study region as groundwater aquifers become threatened decisionmakers are seeking to develop policies that protect or restore them many aquifer protection policies address water quality dimensions boucher et al 2012a there is also a long history of works focusing on analyzing and protecting groundwater quantities foster et al 2015 as one of many recent example in the us alone the us state of california in 2014 passed the sustainable groundwater management act kiparsky et al 2017 niles and wagner 2018 or sgma that act requires communities to develop plans to balance groundwater basins by 2040 in order to stabilize groundwater levels the recognition of groundwater as an essential resource to be managed as part of a river basin scale system is especially important for the middle rio grande basin where two u s states new mexico and texas and two countries u s and mexico share transboundary aquifers there is an established and extensive literature that has investigated questions of economically optimal conjunctive use management including hydroeconomic modelling that link groundwater protection and policy choices boucher et al 2012b divakar et al 2011 harou et al 2009a riegels

gutiérrez et al 2013 d agostino et al 2014 varela ortega et al 2011 yang et al 2013 while much has been published on principles and applications of hydroeconomic optimization models to inform policy design beven 2001 duan et al 1994 harou et al 2009b none to date has successfully met the challenge of discovering minimum economic cost adaption measures to reach long term aquifer protection targets for a range of potential climate futures substitute water costs and system operation rules still many have emphasized the importance of defining and implementing aquifer protection goals kahil et al 2016 furthermore impacts of a range of potential future climate water stress levels on the marginal and total cost of protecting aquifers are rarely addressed in hydroeconomic optimization investigations surface water supply variability across years and across climate stress scenarios can impact groundwater supplies and use since surface inflows to a river system are both influenced by climate as well as being an important control on recharge rates moreover among the hydroeconomic optimization models that have been published we have found few if any works that make models accessible to stakeholders to enable them to conduct their own policy experiments using both observed or user changeable input data however some works have emphasized the importance of two way communication with stakeholders heinz et al 2007 this stakeholder accessibility gap has made it difficult to guide public debate over impacts of aquifer protection policies in light of these gaps this paper s contribution is to develop and apply a hydroeconomic optimization framework to investigate impacts of new policies such as changes in costs of aquifer protection in a conjunctive use system the middle rio grande basin of north america an important objective is its use to discover economic costs of protecting the basin s major aquifers for each of six scenarios of climate stressed water supplies two system operation rules and two water importation costs the paper s originality comes from its development of a hydroeconomic optimization framework to support discovery and design of policies to minimize the cost of meeting targeted regional aquifer protection plans under each of several potential future scenarios it achieves this goal in several ways it presents a basin scale analysis that tracks and optimizes discounted net present value of economic benefits from water allocation and use from several sources for each use it respects regionally significant hydrologic economic agronomic and institutional constraints it shows results of least cost adaptions for protecting regional aquifers to reach stakeholder set minimum aquifer levels for each of a several climate surface water supplies system operation rules and substitute water prices it supplies regional water stakeholders with tools to run their own scenario analysis for desired aquifer protection levels and other assumptions selected by stakeholders this tool demonstrates a capacity to an audience of researchers who recognize the challenge of communicating results boucher et al 2012a of models in useable formats to skeptical stakeholders and policymakers seeking relevance our approach presents improved methods to discover measures to reduce costs of aquifer protection our approach can potentially be applied any place where water is scarce it can also be applied to humid regions with long dry seasons containing an extended period of low rainfall commonly experienced in the tropics 2 methods of

technical economic and institutional relations in the basin expressed numerically table 2 shows selected important kinds of data and sources used by the model math appendix table 3 shows the model inputs and choices accessible to the region s stakeholders and policymakers to compare to the historical period of record of water inflows into the top of our study basin we formulated an alternative scenario of several climate stress inflow scenarios producing a wide range of inflows discussed subsequently those alternative inflow levels are established math appendix block 7 for which the set w varies from historically observed inflows at the usgs san marcial gauges to five alternatives described below we consider six alternative scenarios for future climate generated hydrologic stress in our study area four of these climate scenarios listed as alternatives 2 5 in table 3 are derived from climate model simulations developed by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 with system surface inflows shown in table 4 water from a backstop technology bt or set of such technologies defined as a renewable substitute for existing water sources henriet 2012 solow 1974 could be supplied to meet increased demands when the cheaper but scarce local source rises in cost due to depletion the most likely bt for this basin is renewable desalinated water desal either for existing groundwater sources for newly developed aquifers or from imports after depletion from climate or policy occurs a bt could become more economically viable for our study region the three most important kinds of current everything but the bt sources are reservoir storage river flow and aquifer storage graphical appendix if bt costs fall from the range of 1400 1500 per acre foot from various local sources to a lower level defined by something in the range of four percent per year cost reduction we would expect a considerable increase in its use especially for urban use irrigation uptake of backstop sourced water requires a larger cost reduction unless heavily subsidized a sustainable long term renewable source for our study basin would require something like solar desalinated water samani 2000 from a coastal region a considerable distance from the rio grande basin even if legal and institutional constraints could be overcome those costs including transportation could run to 3000 per acre foot or more mo et al 2014 the backstop technology represents a substitute water supply to backup surface and groundwater sources if economically depleted math appendix block 33 for urban use and block 39 for irrigated agriculture 2 2 optimization model 2 2 1 model development like many other hydroeconomic models published in the peer reviewed literature hatfield dodds et al 2015 the model optimizes the economic objective of discounted net present value dnpv while respecting constraints both with and without climate stress as well as with and without policy measures to reduce the cost of adapting to that stress the dnpv objective is summed over uses locations and time periods the model solution identifies water conservation development flow storage and use patterns that maximize dnpv math appendix equation blocks 69 70 the model has several endogenous variables documented in the math appendix fig 2 shows the basin s network flow schematic table 1 shows the most important assumptions used by the model our paper focuses on the costs of aquifer protection measured as the dnpv displaced by measures that would secure that protection the aquifer protection requirement assures access to use of the aquifer s water supply for future generations we selected this approach partly because it is hard to reliably calculate what future groundwater use values are protected by reductions in current pumping or increases in groundwater recharge levels for our paper aquifer protection costs are measured as the least cost set of reductions in dnpv taken from all uses sectors locations and time periods needed to secure that protection the aquifer protection requirement was implemented by specifying a simple constraint requiring both important regional aquifers to return to at least 100 percent of their starting values at the terminal period of the model 2033 other percentages could have been used indeed by varying the percentages it is a straightforward exercise to sweep out an optimized system response to a series of potential terminal aquifer performance requirements sustaining any aquifer at a higher level or at an earlier terminal period reduces overall benefits over the time period of analysis but raises accessibility and supply of water for earlier future periods math appendix block 68 2 2 2 network flow schematic fig 2 shows the basin s network flow schematic including the most important sources and uses of water in the region of the rio grande basin from fig 1 the arrows show movement of water flows among the various elements for which the optimization code of the hydroeconomic model seeks to find the use pumping and recharge pattern that is most dynamically economically efficient 2 2 3 simulation to optimization the development of a validated river basin system simulation model maass et al 1962 teutschbein and seibert 2012 without optimization can be used with some confidence to experiment with impacts throughout the basin associated with a change in inflows the limitation of a basin scale simulation model even if validated is that its predictions for handling future climate stressed inflows carry no optimization properties that is it can provide no guidance on future water use patterns or policies that optimize dnpv of water use patterns nor would it be able to identify least cost measures to design potentially new system operating and institutional constraints all of which are needed to guide policy choices on measures for handling climate stressed inflows simulation models where validated with the facts can replicate history however where new system operation constraints need to be designed or tested such models are likely to provided only limited guidance because of the difficult interpretation problems it poses by lacking optimality properties the model addresses a three part objective consisting of economic efficiency equity and sustainability economic efficiency is the formal mathematical objective function for which constraints are imposed to address equity e g water sharing rules such as treaties and sustainability terminal year aquifer protection 2 2 4 variables each model run seeks water storage and use patterns that maximize dnpv of economic performance from among many possible linked water development consumption use and pricing trajectories the model has several endogenous variables math appendix for which their numerical values are determined by the solution to the constrained optimization 2 2 5 equations the model specifies several equations that connect sets data parameters and variables this structure permits a comprehensive water accounting exercise to allow an investigation of efficient climate water stress adaptation the model currently has 68 blocks of equations math appendix for which a few of the most prominent are briefly summarized here 2 2 5 1 agricultural land water and yield the economic value of water applied to cropped lands are the most important determinants of the scale of land and water use in irrigated agriculture as well as its distribution among crops and irrigation technologies potential growth in farm economic profitability through changes in price cost or yield will generally raise the scale of farmland irrigated math appendix blocks 1 5 containing five equation blocks that link farmland in production with surface and groundwater use as well as crop yield irrigated agriculture is the largest water consumer in the basin typical for the world s arid regions 2 2 5 2 surface water hydrology an accurate mathematical characterization of surface water hydrologic relations is important for many reasons including the fact that increased use of surface water at any one point in the basin typically reduces surface water supplies at another point or in another time giordano et al 2005 the structure math appendix blocks 6 18 account for surface water stocks and flows by location year climate water stress level and climate adaptation policy they describe numerous relationships characterizing surface water hydrology at the basin scale these relationships are defined for reservoir storage and for each of five river reaches graphical appendices 2 3 2 6 2 2 5 3 groundwater hydrology each of the two aquifers are treated as simple bathtubs or buckets filled with aquifer material each with a known plan view area starting storage and storage coefficient the simple bucket mass balance tracks aquifer depth by aquifer and year math appendix blocks 19 24 for each aquifer annual change in storage is net recharge minus net pumping both of which are determined by the constrained optimization 2 2 5 4 urban water use urban water use is typically the highest economic valued of the competing uses in the rio grande basin as well as most other watersheds where urban use is significant urban price elasticities of demand in the basin study area are typically low fullerton and elias 2004 as is the case for most of the developed world s water utilities that is for urban demands price changes can be expected to have little effect on use especially indoor use math appendix blocks 25 28 consumer surplus is the gain to urban water buyers resulting from a reduction in urban price or increase in supply reliability consumer surplus from affordable access to safe drinking water is economically and politically important in most places and even more so where a large percentage of the population is poor or faces unreliable water service as for much of the rio grande basin 2 2 5 5 economic elements numerous economic elements are required to completely characterize this hydroeconomic model s specification of water supply and demand as well as benefit and cost math appendix blocks 29 51 economic benefits and costs are associated with use reservoir level or instream flow level for environmental service provision for our model a water system adjustment to the status quo such as an institutional or infrastructure improvement or change in a law contributes to improved economic efficiency if the marginal benefits from the change exceed the marginal costs that is a change along any dimension such as adjusted timing sizing or sequencing must exceed the marginal cost to secure improvements in economic efficiency despite all of these properties it has long been recognized that water is different savenije 2002 because of its interacting institutional and technical complexities still any economically optimized set of program plans needs to be updated with new information on factors affecting benefits and costs such as emerging information on climate stressed system inflows the marginal opportunity cost of all these choices changes in time and space as resource availability demands and the willingness to pay of water users varies pulido velazquez et al 2012 2 2 6 institutional constraints several important institutional hydrologic economic and physical constraints set limits on how water can be used in most of the world s watersheds including our basin those constraints have an important influence on future adaptations to climate stress in many of the world s basins several are described below 2 2 6 1 2008 operating agreement after many years of negotiation and litigation the 2008 operating agreement oa for the rio grande project was established in march 2008 that agreement s point of departure was the historical operation of the rio grande project us bureau of reclamation 2016a with two major adjustments the first adjustment implemented in the oa established carryover accounting by which each of the two major us irrigation districts elephant butte irrigation district or ebid and el paso county water improvement district 1 had a right to store and recover its unused water in a given year for the following year the agreement effectively established a property right to conserved water assigned to the district for whom members invested in conservation measures prior to enactment of the oa the unused part of either district s annual water allocation was made available for use to both districts in the following year discouraging measures that could have been taken to promote conservation providing incentives for the classical tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 the carryover part of the oa was established to promote and reward water conservation in the rio grande project area by permitting each irrigation district to retain its saved nonuse in a given year up to an established upper bound in the following year net of evaporation losses the second adjustment implemented by the oa was to change in the annual allocations the two districts to reflect changes in the overall project s water delivery performance as reflected by a term known as the diversion ratio in conditions for which the diversion ratio was larger than 1 0 ebid typically secures an increase in water allocation compared to then historical project operations in conditions for which the diversion ration is less than 1 0 ebid typically receives a reduction in project allocation compared to historical operation of the project us bureau of reclamation 2016a the oa is an important institutional constraint math appendix blocks 52 55 it allocates water among two states several uses two countries and varies by water supply condition 2 2 6 2 us mexico treaty of 1906 under the u s mexico treaty of 1906 a constant 60 000 acre foot delivery to mexico by the united states was negotiated u s department of state 1906 with language stating when severe drought occurred u s deliveries to mexico could be reduced below the 60 000 acre foot level consistent with the language of that treaty with recent implementation details under the oa us bureau of reclamation 2016a deliveries to mexico are reduced in approximate proportion to the reduction of deliveries to u s lands math appendix block 56 2 2 6 3 historical acreage observed historical acreage for the 1994 2015 period is part of the water accounting balance this calibration assures that model predicted diversions pumping and cropping patterns approximately match observed data when the model is run in simulation non optimization mode for that period math appendix blocks 57 59 2 2 6 4 system physical structure several simple physical structural elements are included math appendix blocks 60 65 these account for relationships between irrigated acreage groundwater use stocks of reservoirs and aquifers and flows of various reaches of the river system modelling these physical constraints protects the integrity of conservation of mass 2 2 6 5 aquifer sustainability requirement an aquifer sustainability requirement protects access to use of the aquifer s water supply for future generations math appendix block 68 sustaining any aquifer at a higher level or at an earlier terminal period reduces overall benefits over the time period of analysis but water access for future generations the implementation and assessment of groundwater protection goals are more transparent understandable and possibly more acceptable if based on an economic assessment of the costs and benefits of securing different protection levels there continues to be growing need for methods of analysis to illustrate approaches for conducting a cost benefit analysis cba approach to guide groundwater protection programs rinaudo and aulong 2014 this paper uses the model to identify marginal as well as total costs of protecting the basin s two major aquifers by requiring that aquifer storage return to levels for a given past year by a given period considerable effort remains underway in our study basin as well as many of the world s arid basins to establish or improve measures for protecting aquifer viability for example in 2018 a year of severe water shortage paskus 2018 the rio grande basin saw several institutional technical and behavioral adjustments to water shortages including water trading conversion from urban water intensive lawns to water saving xeriscape and a reduced scale of crop production in lower valued forage cropping 2 2 6 6 objective the objective function is dnpv summed over uses locations and time periods math appendix blocks 67 68 the dnpv objective is used to discover through the optimization exercise water conservation development flow storage and use patterns that maximize dnpv for which a few relating to the costs of aquifer protection are shown in the results 2 3 scenarios the impact of climate variability on surface inflows into the top edge of our basin boundary is characterized by the two parallel gauging stations at san marcial for which inflows enter elephant butte eb reservoir fig 1 a 40 year time series of six sets of inflows into is secured by prescribing the time series of annual rio grande inflow into eb at the upstream end of the study area eb is the principal storage reservoir for surface water in the middle rio grande basin it is managed conjunctively with caballo reservoir much smaller in storage capacity a short distance downstream fig 1 releases from the outflow point of caballo reservoir are managed to serve the needs of water rights holders downstream at various locations we present five scenarios of annual inflows into eb based both on historical observations and on projected future time series adapted from various climate model simulations townsend et al 2018 scenario 1 table 4 replicates historical observed flows at the san marcial gauges through the year 2010 the final three years of the historical observation period used for our model 2011 2013 severe drought years on the rio grande are extended into future years through the last year used for our model 2033 to prescribe a scenario with projected water shortages corresponding to a severe and prolonged drought that is variability in annual flows after 2013 is achieved by simply repeating the three year sequence of flows for the period 2011 2013 table 4 scenarios 2 5 are derived from four different climate model simulations generated by the u s bureau of reclamation 2016 the u s bureau of reclamation has generated naturalized flows in major western rivers using climate model output from the cmip5 archive of global climate simulations forced by varying greenhouse gas emissions scenarios taylor et al 2012 the climate simulations extend from 1950 to 2005 based on historical climate forcing including observed greenhouse gas concentrations and are extended into future years using one of several prescribed greenhouse gas scenarios the u s bureau of reclamation has coupled the climate model output to a surface water model that simulates streamflow at selected gauge points along the rio grande u s bureau of reclamation 2016 we have normalized these projections of natural flow on the rio grande to account statistically for upstream impacts on natural flows defined by the rio grande compact the compact has influenced and continues to influence the size and scale of dams seepage evaporation diversions return flows all of which influence our accurately simulated flows at san marcial during both the historical and projected periods these normalized inflows are compatible with the terms of the current rio grande compact negotiated in 1938 at the bishop s lodge santa fe booker et al 2005 renegotiation of the compact has been discussed historically from time to time grant 2007 the normalization procedure modifies the simulated year to year mean and variance of flow at san marcial to match those statistics during a 50 year historical baseline period 1964 2013 thereby forcing the simulation to reproduce accurate means and variances of the observed distribution of total year to year annual flows we then apply the empirical constants needed to achieve this normalization in the historical period to projected future flows simulated by the same model producing future flows that match historical means and variances the same normalization procedure is repeated for each of the five scenario development methods for which the last four are described here as simulations as described in more detail below the names of simulations numbered 2 5 in table 4 refer to the cmip5 climate model name used to generate the streamflow simulation taylor et al 2012 u s bureau of reclamation 2016 1 obsdrought observed flows extended drought for the period 1950 2013 for which the later years are shown for our analysis as 1994 2013 table 4 observed daily streamflows at the pair of gauges at san marcial are summed to create annual flow values in 1000 af yr the final three years of this observational period 2011 2013 were low flow drought years for the period 2014 2033 we repeat the three year sequence of flows observed in 2011 2013 to create a synthetic permanent drought that extends through the future period of study table 4 shows that average annual flows for this simulation for our period 1994 2033 are 466 1000 af yr 2 acc85 model simulation based on output from the access1 0 rcp85 simulation forced by a high emissions greenhouse gas scenario rcp8 5 this simulation yields an extreme reduction of streamflow by the late 21st century although those flow reductions are not pronounced until about the year 2040 after the end of our model time horizon u s bureau of reclamation 2016 average annual flows for our model years 1994 2033 are 676 1000 af yr as seen in table 4 3 had85 model simulation based on output from the hadgem2 es rcp85 simulation forced by the same rcp8 5 high emissions greenhouse gas scenario as acc85 this simulation yields an intermediate reduction in streamflow starting in the mid 21st century for which its average annual flows are 633 1000 af yr as in table 4 4 had26 model simulation based on output from the hadgem2 es rcp26 simulation forced by a lower emissions greenhouse gas scenario rcp2 6 this simulation yields a more modest reduction in future streamflow compared to the had85 results had26 yields future streamflow close to the average of the all the reclamation simulations we have examined average annual inflows at the san marcial gauge for our model s time horizon are 622 1000 af yr shown in table 4 5 mir26 model simulation based on output from the miroc esm rcp26 simulation forced by the same lower emissions scenario used for had26 mir26 yields the highest streamflow projection of all the reclamation simulations for which average flows are 945 1000 af yr these five scenarios described above are used to illustrate the range of streamflow future supplies for the rio grande mainstem at the san marcial gauges included in the reclamation suite of model projections we do not present any of these simulations as a forecast with specified probabilities for this study we do not consider any of the model based simulations to be more probable than the others instead our goal is to investigate a wide but plausible range of future water supply futures as inputs to the optimized model influencing downstream users a flexible framework for understanding alternative climate futures should be adapted to a changing climate where possible nonstationary hydrologic variables are best understood and modeled stochastically to characterize the evolution of their probability density functions pdfs over time to characterize uncertainty eventually we would like to see methods developed to estimate model parameters that link historical and paleohydrologic measurements with forecasts of several climate models each driven by several climate forcing scenarios milly et al 2008 the climate scenarios for san marcial flow developed for this work represent an initial step toward a full stochastic development of the full probability density function for future flows that describes above the five simulations described above represent extreme high flow miroc extreme low flow access and two more moderate hadgem simulations in order to span the likely range of model projected flows each of these models exhibits a pronounced increase in temperature temperature projections are more consistent across the simulations than are precipitation projections the range of projected precipitation change is broadly correlated with the range of projected streamflow supplies more or less precipitation leads to higher or lower streamflow adjustments of existing or future anthropogenic influences on useable mainstem streamflow at san marcial are not considered in the bureau of reclamation s streamflow projections the simulations are based on different climate projections but all of them use the same land surface and hydrologic routing model so the differences between model simulations come from climate differences as stated above these are naturalized flow simulations without additional processing they are not suitable for prescribed upstream inflows for our study because roughly three quarters of the rio grande s natural flow is appropriated from the river for consumptive use before reaching san marcial under the terms of the rio grande compact the projected flows generated by the reclamation simulations are therefore much higher than actual gauged flow reaching elephant butte reservoir intra annual flow patterns are not considered in this study because the hydroeconomic model has an annual time step one question would ask why these adjustments are specified to stay the same in future time periods when the purpose of these inflow scenarios is to consider the effects of climate variability and change over time management of the river could change so that more or less than the approximately three quarters of natural flow would be taken from the river system upstream townsend and gutzler 2019 consideration of the range of new management scenarios and political decisions such as renegotiated interstate water sharing agreements in colorado and new mexico upstream from our study area while important for informing future management debates is beyond the scope of the analysis presented here our analysis focuses on the effects of comparatively near term climate stresses with no changes in water sharing institutions a sixth simulation is added to the first five it represents a bounded condition that would be lower than any part of the historical period of record for that simulation we set annual flow in all years to zero labelled zero flows at san marcial for the 40 year time horizon table 4 clearly it sets a lower bound on surface inflows over our model s time horizon far outside the range of any historical experience this scenario is designed to stress the system with the maximum possible shortage maximizing the need to find alternative substitute supplies or invest in alternative conservation measures there is nothing purely stochastic in our procedure for developing the time series of inflows at san marcial we are taking dynamical model output which is chaotic but not stochastic and modifying each model s time series to match the mean and variance of annual flows for a 50 year historical baseline period to account for upstream water management and institutions the climate scenarios do not present the full pdf of flows but have been selected to provide examples that span the range of high flow and low flow future simulations augmented by the synthetic scenarios described above as of today mid 2019 the complete pdf of future san marcial flows is unknown and it is certainly beyond the scope of this paper still by choosing a set of inflows that spans the range of available model simulations we have tried to illustrate a plausible range of conditions that merit water management planning in the near term 3 results 3 1 main messages results presented in tables 5 8 and in figs 3 and 4 show several messages the economic cost of aquifer protection is a special concept for an aquifer the marginal cost of its protection to a set level is the added cost of returning an aquifer to a given storage volume level by a given period measured as the change in discounted net present value dnpv of total economic benefits under base conditions compared to a more stringent set of conditions required our model assesses the marginal cost of aquifer protection by comparing the dnpv of economic benefits summed over basinwide uses locations sectors and periods while assuring that the aquifer reaches the minimum required storage level by the required year that dnpv is compared to the higher dnpv of water uses from requiring the aquifer to return to one lower unit of storage volume the added cost of the last unit of aquifer protection is the reduction in dnpv of other water uses displaced from raising the protection level from x 1 units of aquifer storage to x units of aquifer storage where x is 100 percent of 1994 aquifer levels the total cost of aquifer protection is the marginal cost defined over a larger increment of required aquifer protection it is the dnpv of total use values with no protection at all minus the dnpv of total use values with the aquifer protection selected by the stakeholder fig 3 shows that the marginal costs of aquifer protection vary widely for each of 24 conditions presented for each of the two aquifers generally it shows that marginal cost is higher when surface water inflows are low and that one aquifer supports higher levels of demand hueco bolson supports higher proportion of urban demand and has a higher cost of substitute surface water 3000 per acre foot rather than 1444 per acre foot the figure also shows that the marginal cost of aquifer protection is uniformly lower when the cost of substitute surface water imports is lower this is because the substitute water is an alternative for pumped water therefore its reduced price would take pressure off either aquifer the marginal cost of aquifer protection falls to zero as the price of renewable water imports falls beneath the price of the cheapest sustainable existing source not shown in the results if such a condition could occur in future years the cost of returning surface water riparian ecosystems to pre settlement levels if desired approaches zero fig 4 shows similar findings for total costs of aquifer protection total costs of protecting both regional aquifers increase with higher cost of substitute surface water presence of the 2008 oa and a greater shortage of surface inflows a higher cost surface import costs places greater stress on the aquifers as expected shown in table 7 requiring aquifer protection also expected raises optimized recharge averaged over both aquifers several measures could be applied to promote aquifer protection as shown in table 8 3 2 incremental economic costs of aquifer protection table 5 describes the marginal cost of the least cost set of measures needed to restore each of the basin s regional aquifers to their historically observed 1994 level by 2033 these marginal costs are shown by climate water stress inflow scenario system operation rule and unit cost of imported surface water for each aquifer 3 2 1 comparison between aquifers marginal costs of the last unit volume of water needed to restore the hueco bolson to 1994 levels by 2033 are typically higher than those of protecting the mesilla aquifer for the same conditions for which the hueco s cost is in the range of 45 per acre foot higher than the mesilla when considering the 24 conditions shown in table 5 these higher costs of protecting the hueco occurs because there is a much higher valued set of uses there as well as higher levels of competing pumping from two large cities in the hueco bolson namely el paso texas and cd juarez mexico than for the mesilla for the mesilla aquifer the greater share of use has for many years been assigned to irrigated agriculture for which a sizeable percentage is used for low valued livestock forage 3 2 2 effect of system operation results in table 5 show a marginal cost of protection about 55 lower without than with the oa than for the mesilla and 12 lower without than with the oa for the hueco that lower costs comes from a greater freedom to allocate shortages to their highest valued uses than permitted under the oa the oa specifies exacting rules for sharing surface flows among new mexico texas and mexico these rules would be replaced by water allocations moving water to its highest valued uses without the oa in place additionally in comparing with versus without the oa marginal costs of achieving both aquifer restorations are slightly different without the oa marginal costs of aquifer protection averages 118 16 for the mesilla and 161 15 for the hueco these costs without the oa are both higher than allocations with the oa since greater freedom to optimize without the oa allows water to move to highest valued uses raising the costs economic value displaced from aquifer protection with the oa marginal costs of aquifer protection are 53 41 for the mesilla and 111 46 for the hueco 3 2 3 influencing factors both surface water supplies and import prices matter as we expected higher average surface inflows as shown in table 5 tend to reduce the marginal cost of protecting the regional aquifers since greater amounts of surface water reduce demands for groundwater pumping as well as increasing aquifer recharge for the case of surface irrigation by far the most widely practiced irrigation technology in the region while table 5 shows a large number of factors affecting the marginal cost of restoring our two regional aquifers two stand out when multiplied together mean annual inflow shortage from any given climate stress surface inflow scenario times the price of surface water imports if made available table 5 shows 24 combinations of marginal costs of aquifer protection for each of our two aquifers these include six water supply conditions with mean annual shortages from full supplies listed for each also included are two operating agreement arrangements with and without and two surface water import prices the very wide fluctuations in those marginal costs shown shadow prices makes it clear that existing conditions make a considerable difference a simple linear regression equation was estimated to systematically investigate factors influencing those marginal cost elements shown in table 5 for which all 24 conditions for each aquifer with results of the regression in table 9 a that table shows that marginal costs in the hueco bolson are 46 44 per acre foot higher over all conditions than the mesilla the hueco is a smaller aquifer sees larger average starting pumping depths to water and is subject to a much higher percentage of urban use for which the elasticity of demand is low all of which combine to raise the marginal cost from its protection each one unit increase in the product of mean annual shortages in 1000 acre feet per year and cost of imports in 1000 per acre foot produces a 0 23 increase in the shadow price of aquifer protection for both aquifers taken together the mean value of that product term 575 28 over all 24 combinations when multiplied by 0 23 produces an increase in the marginal cost of aquifer protection of 132 31 table 9a shows that 90 percent of the variance in the marginal cost of protecting the aquifers is explained by these two variables table 5 contains all the data required to reproduce this regression 3 3 total economic costs of aquifer protection table 6 shows the discounted net present value of total basin wide economic costs of aquifer protection by climate stress scenario system operation rule cost of imported surface water and terminal period aquifer protection requirement in us 1000s not surprisingly it shows that total economic cost of protecting the two regional aquifers far right column like marginal cost is highly variable that total cost varies widely according to the basin s economic hydrologic and institutional conditions the lowest of those costs 9 0 million occurs with the wettest inflow scenario and zero associated shortage miroc rcp26 r1ip1 without the 2008 oa giving rise to greater flexibility in system operation over large changes in supply and with low surface water import costs impacts of low water import prices means can contribute to affordable alternatives to reduced aquifer pumping needed to protect aquifers the highest of those costs of aquifer protection 2 47 billion which is more than 270 times the lowest cost table 6 occurs with a series of conditions giving rise to high levels of water scarcity those conditions occur with zero maximum annual average shortage without the 2008 oa and high surface water import costs these conditions taken together make it economically difficult to find alternatives to aquifer pumping when the aquifers must be protected through reduced pumping table 9b shows results of a second linear regression to explain what influences the greatest share of total costs of aquifer protection not surprisingly the weighted combination of system inflow shortages multiplied by water import costs is the single largest predictor after trying several other combinations of predictors not shown a one unit increase in that variable labelled shortage import cost elevated by one unit for example from the current average of 557 56 to one unit higher of 558 56 raises the total cost of aquifer protection by 929 22 that parameter estimate is shown in table 9b many other results from the data shown in table 5 could be described but about 89 percent of the variance in total cost is explained by the intercept and this single predictor term 3 4 overarching findings several of our results illustrate important principles that can be applied to inform policy and management when surface water supplies fall groundwater pumping demands increase for all urban uses where conjunctive use is currently practiced and for all agricultural uses except the lowest valued forage crops not shown in the tables also aquifer protection costs increase fall with lower higher future surface water availability increased reduced costs of alternative substitute water sources and with more less flexible system operation rules for the data and model structure used our findings inform policy debates over a wide range of aquifer protection measures we considered while the detailed numerical results are valid only for the middle rio grande basin the approach could be used anywhere aquifers are under stress and for which protection is important to sustain long run use table 7 shows net aquifer recharge under several conditions table 8 addresses a remaining question that asks about the kinds of aquifer protection measures that could be implemented for our basin to achieve the efficient aquifer protection plans this paper described this table describes 22 aquifer protection measures that could be implemented alone or in combination costs shown earlier in tables 5 and 6 set a lower bound on the cost of protecting aquifers at this point we do not know which of the aquifer protection measures shown in table 8 would come closest to achieving the minimum cost aquifer protection measures shown in the earlier tables however several investigations since the 1950s applied to other resources such as commercial fisheries poos et al 2010 scott 1955 consistently suggest that use quotas or permits combined with marketability of those permits al azawi and ward 2017 would move pumping out of the lowest valued economic uses while securing resource protection levels at user set levels 4 discussion we have some confidence that the basin scale water accounting augmented by an optimization framework presented in this work can contribute to inform debates over the best way to handle ongoing challenges that face policymakers for controlling the costs of adapting to climate stress a similar approach as described in this work could be used to discover economically and financially viable measures to address climate mitigation as well as discovering measures by which those costs can be distributed in a politically acceptable way moss et al 2010 4 1 stakeholders since 2016 a user interface has been steadily under development to communicate model results as well as permitting policy experimentation for numerous groups of regional water stakeholders including agriculture government agencies environmental and social justice interests the interface is part of an ongoing effort to increase access to water sustainability models on the web garnica chavira et al 2018 currently accessible at https water cybershare utep edu swim home we are aware of few other integrated water resources optimization models accessible to non specialist stakeholders to conduct science based water management and policy experiments several stakeholder workshops and model outreach exercises were held throughout 2016 2018 pennington et al 2018 at those workshops various features of the model described in this article were presented including its capacity to simulate different scenario combinations and to present results intuitively for non specialized users these meetings were held in various locations in southern new mexico and west texas usa english as well as northern mexico spanish stakeholders were encouraged to experiment with different combinations of water supply water use and policy proposals as well as adjusting data from which they could observe model outputs in formats chosen by the user the workshops were held partly to inform stakeholders on development of a more comprehensive understanding of choices of water use patterns in agriculture urban and environmental uses as well as expanding their capacity to experiment with proposed policies as of mid 2019 a typical 40 year model scenario takes just under two minutes of clock time from the time it is submitted for execution to the loading of model results to a useable form this series of steps generates about 1 3 mb of formatted data for a single climate and a single policy scenario chosen by the user users are currently advised to run the model in pairs of scenarios in order that a base policy for handling a given climate water stress scenario can be compared to an alternative of their choice despite the favorable reception received at all the workshops to date garnica chavira et al 2018 participants have expressed a wish to see an improved and more compact and personalized listing of all model data and outputs without overwhelming the stakeholder with material extraneous to their immediate interests work continues on this improvement a well known challenge faced by developers of any large scale river basin analysis to inform policy debates fowler et al 2007 we anticipate the need to handle special challenges for addressing numerous groups of stakeholders many of which center around competing interests and highly varied preferences motivated by wide ranging personal or financial interests 4 2 scope the basin scale optimization approach described in this work presents an innovative approach to inform policy debates seeking solutions that adapt to altered water supplies in climate stressed water systems these costs are important factors and they will determine the type and design of measures chosen and the willingness to adopt and its speed this paper is one of the few to present an optimization framework to discover minimum cost plans to adapt to a climate stressed inflows to a river basin still our work has a limited scope results inform policy debates that need information on the marginal and total cost of aquifer protection despite a generally weak knowledge of the probability distributions of the parameters as well as limited knowledge of the functional forms that drive the model results another important limitation of this work is that substitute water was considered only at two costs 1444 texas water development board 2016 and 3000 per acre foot wilder et al 2016 based on adjusting seawater desalination costs in the san diego california region to the conveyance costs of transport to our study region water available at each of these substitute prices was modelled as whatever quantities buyers would use at those prices with no upper bound on use in fact quantities of each of these alternative water sources is highly limited and in many cases unknown ongoing work continues to establish research grade data to specify a stair step supply function in our model to address prices and quantities available for substitute water for which known limited quantities would be available at alternative prices taking pressure off regional sources and reducing the cost of protecting aquifers our current optimization model runs on an annual time step even with such a long time step there are more than half a million variables to optimize shortening the time step to monthly would raise an already large model by a factor of twelve despite the obvious advantages of a monthly or even shorter time step for assessing measures such as targeted well timed environmental flow protection we are limited from doing that until we can find a faster solver or more efficient code the model currently optimizes over a 40 year time horizon increasing that horizon to something like twice that would allow for a more sophisticated intertemporal adaptation to future climate stress scenarios that would not play out with as much insight over the comparatively short 40 year horizon we hope to be able to report on those longer term experiments by mid 2019 our model is a simple three bucket model containing one surface storage bucket two aquifer buckets and a network flow system connecting the various sources buckets and uses plans for an improved model are to incorporate a modflow harbaugh et al 2000 type exchange between the river and regional aquifers to handle the well known darcy s law according to that law the rate and direction of groundwater movement are proportional to and determined by the difference in head between the river and aquifer or hydraulic gradient dumars and minier 2004 which avoids the need for the use of simplifying response functions our model explores a range of future surface inflows generated from dynamical climate models it then assesses the sensitivity of the hydrological economic institutional system to that set of prescribed flows varying several but not all management variables in conjunction with the range of prescribed water supply futures we have not yet placed explicit probabilities on the various water future time series although we plan to undertake that kind of work for the future as a part of a more rigorous and comprehensive assessment of uncertainty for this work we have simply explored a wide plausible range of possibilities despite the advantages of using hydroeconomic optimization to more efficiently manage effects of climate and policy futures on the dynamics of water use patterns in the rio grande basin the model has limitations we plan to address in future work dynamic stochastic optimization cervellera et al 2006 would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of climate stress and of policies to promote resilience as well as uncertainties related to the economic and hydrological parameters that affect outcomes though the paper handles some of this while the data used for this paper are recent and more comprehensive than of previous published studies we were able to find data limitations with respect to variability over time and space will influence the results finally the model does not address the general equilibrium brouwer et al 2008 effects of urban and irrigation water use a computable general equilibrium analysis would reveal important economy wide secondary impacts not directly included in this model there is a natural desire to derive a set of rules that can be derived from modeling exercises such as ours to inform robust decisions under future influences gao et al 2009 such results would describe how the costs of aquifer protection can be calculated by running a very large number of optimization model runs then summarizing results compactly using regression models or their equivalent our results partly achieve that goal for which an illustration is described in the discussion of two regression model results in table 9 using the data from tables 5 and 6 for future work we plan to present results that describe optimized water use patterns under a wide range of climate water stress from which we hope to develop rule curve relations that extract as much information from which a few simple formulas would show optimized diversions as well as reservoir and aquifer discharge and storage levels 4 3 comparisons it is important to discuss our results compared to other studies or specific examples for other catchments regions with similar problems and potentially solutions every river basin has its unique characteristics so few numerical findings here are likely to transfer reliably elsewhere but the methods and interpretation could be expected to transfer widely unique features of the rio grande include system operation constraints treaty delivery requirements and endangered species requirements unique water supply and demand patterns and unique aquifer characteristics still our approach opens up considerable potential for generalizability many of the world s dry regions such as vast parts of the american west much of north africa parts of central asia and the majority of the middle east face similar water problems for which optimization modelling approaches such as ours could provide important insights into efficient groundwater protection measures what is needed to handle large scale analysis for the future are the kinds of hydroeconomic models with global generalizability with application to several regions of the world such as the recent innovation published in 2018 kahil et al 2018 4 4 variability in parameters the parameters data read by our model carry uncertainty especially when selected by stakeholders for future years the model structure itself also has uncertainty the link to our model described above permits stakeholders to run the model several times sequentially to discover impacts of varying data assumptions for which users can vary a single assumption or modify a series of assumptions systematically to trace out impacts of changed data assumptions for the model to read and re optimize stakeholders can currently run the model to produce a series of runs that assess the robustness of alternative aquifer protection proposals although deterministic not stochastic our model accounts for variability in the data in two ways neither of which attempt to discover probability density functions pdfs in the data results are based on inflows varying according to six climate model simulations that span the range from high future flows to lower future flows among a much larger set of available simulations each of these inflow scenarios is assessed with and without existing basin system operating rules and with varying water import prices stakeholders have access to a user interface allowing them to select any set of parameters desired many of which we have yet to conduct experiments an important question centers on how the variance of inflows as a stochastic process as well as other sources of uncertainty affect the cost minimization outcomes while this issue has been discussed in the results in describing tables 5 and 6 a more comprehensive approach is possible of which we would be most enthusiastic to see applied in the future we would also be enthusiastic to see a formal stochastic programming approach developed for future work to rigorously handle uncertainty in our hydrologic water supply as well as economic parameters affecting the economic value of water a few recent celebrated stochastic programming applications to water system optimization have been published nematian 2016 singh 2012 every parameter used to drive our model carries uncertainty much unknown of which there are about 1200 in total for our model one method to present impacts of uncertainties in all parameters is by calculating elements of a jacobian matrix of partial derivatives cockett et al 2018 that matrix expressed in elasticity form would provide a comprehensive assessment of uncertainty it can be measured as partial changes in optimized outcomes from changes in base values of each parameter driving the basin model when expressed in elasticity form these terms are y i x j multiplied by x j y i for each of i 1 n endogenous optimized variable of interest and each of j 1 m parameter that can be varied when complete the populated matrix showing those sensitivities has n rows and m columns and would require m 1 model runs if the uncertain parameters are varied one at a time for each alternative run the augmented jth parameter for which impacts of its change are desired should be set at a slightly higher level than the observed base level this exercise produces a base value for each endogenous variable of interest such as the cost of protecting the aquifer as well as a new value of the endogenous variable for a slightly higher by epsilon units value of the parameter such as an augmented price of substitute water this exercise requires m 1 separate model runs for which the results in elasticity form can be presented in a single large matrix the result is an n m matrix of discrete approximations to the classical newtonian n m set of partial derivatives if expressed in elasticity form it produces an elasticity matrix for which all elements are independent of measurement units where future probability assessments can be conducted potential changes in any unknown parameter can be multiplied by appropriate elasticity elements to identify changes to all endogenous variables that would result from our model elements of such an elasticity matrix can currently mid 2019 be approximated by stakeholders who access our model s website at https water cybershare utep edu swim home yet the conduct of this kind of exercise takes considerable patience it requires varying each of several parameters by a small amount then run the model keeping track of the impact of each varied parameter on a select number of optimized variables important to our stakeholders we have not yet developed an efficient method to generate these elasticity matrices one reason we have not yet developed the matrices is that the value of each n m matrix elements depends on starting numerical value of all parameters each set of starting conditions would produce a different elasticity matrix a more nearly linear system can be expected to produce elasticity matrix elements more nearly equal across alterative starting conditions the authors would also like to see development of graphical user interfaces where model users need not be modelling experts to build their own basin scale network flow models we have never seen such a thing published or posted still our vision is an interface in which stakeholders could specify their own network node structure watershed layout infrastructure capacity e g conveyance and purification capacity as well as data on hydrology agriculture and economics as well as institutional constraints governing how supplies shortages or surpluses are or could be shared among users time periods sectors or locations 4 5 takeaways this work has addressed the challenges of designing economically responsible groundwater protection measures for which ongoing debates of why and how it should be accomplished continue to occur internationally it is more defensible to design an aquifer protection plan with information on the total and marginal costs of aquifer protection information typically missing in the world s heavily used aquifers this work has presented an original approach to address widespread gaps of information worldwide on marginal and total cost of aquifer protection while the model developed and documented investigates much more than the cost of protecting aquifers those costs are the focus of this paper to address impacts of aquifer protection targets groundwater sustainability targets are both relaxed and enforced for each of the region s two major aquifers results show a rising marginal opportunity cost of aquifer protection measures from 1 more heavily stressed climate scenarios 2 higher substitute water prices and 3 without system operating rules in place our approach can be used to provide important information to guide the assessment of alternative aquifer protection plans in our basin as well as elsewhere 5 conclusions policymakers worldwide continue to take a growing interest in policies that would promote sustainable development and use of aquifers in the face of increased pumping stress to meet growing demands combined with climate stressed surface supplies in many dry parts of the world aquifer protection can be a costly proposition because water uses that currently rely on the aquifer may produce considerable economic value that would be lost if aquifer protection is required despite much previous work motivated by this problem few peer reviewed papers to date have examined water use patterns that minimize the economic costs of aquifer protection this work has addressed some existing gaps in the literature by presenting an original and innovative approach to formulate and applying a basin scale hydroeconomic optimization of north america s middle rio grande basin the economic cost minimization objective is implemented by finding the optimized discounted net present value of economic benefits summed over uses sectors and regions from use of surface water and conjunctively managed aquifers results were presented for each of six water supply scenarios two substitute water prices and two system operation rules long term aquifer sustainability targets were specified and enforced as constraints for each of the region s two major aquifers the mesilla and hueco the paper assessed economic costs of securing two targeted aquifer protection levels by identifying optimized surface and groundwater diversion pumping and use patterns for each of 24 surface water inflow system management and substitute water price scenarios results show a rising cost of aquifer protection with more stressed climate scenarios to secure a sustained level of aquifer protection future challenges point to a need to assess economic performance of various water conservation measures as well as reducing costs of substitute water through measures such as technical advance in desalination recycling and reuse substitution of other resources for water better characterization of existing aquifers and development of new wellfields results also point to a

6319,where surface and groundwater are managed conjunctively the stress on water supplies from climate change can significantly influence water use patterns as well as the economic value and sustainability of those uses however aquifer protection can be an expensive proposition because water uses that currently rely on aquifer pumping may produce considerable economic value that would be lost if protection measures are carried out evidence from climate stressed regions has attracted research addressing the costs and benefits of aquifer protection plans despite these efforts few peer reviewed papers have examined water use patterns that minimize the economic costs of aquifer protection this work presents an original approach to address that gap by developing and applying a basin scale hydroeconomic optimization model of north america s middle rio grande basin to explore impacts of new policies not yet implemented supporting aquifer protection it also gives model access to readers or stakeholders to experiment with their own scenarios to assess impacts of alternative aquifer protection plans the model accounts for surface and groundwater storage irrigation urban environmental and recreational demands surface water inflows under various climate scenarios groundwater pumping and recharge substitute water prices crop water use evaporation as well as institutional constraints governing water use the objective is implemented by finding the optimized discounted net present value of economic benefits summed over uses sectors and regions from use of surface water and connected aquifers results are shown for each of six water supply scenarios two substitute water prices and two system operation rules to address impacts of aquifer protection targets groundwater sustainability targets are specified and enforced as constraints for each of the region s two major aquifers we assess total and marginal cost of achieving two targeted aquifer protection levels by identifying optimized surface use and groundwater pumping for each of 24 scenarios results show that climate change in the form of reduced and highly variable inflows considerably drives up the cost of protecting aquifer sustainability amplified by the conjunctive nature of the system future work points to a need to assess economic performance of various water conservation measures as well as reducing costs of substitute water through measures such as technical advance in desalination recycling and reuse substitution of other resources for water better characterization of existing aquifers and development of new groundwater supplies keywords water management aquifer protection hydroeconomic optimization model optimal growth climate stress adaptation 1 background climate stressed river systems threaten food water and environmental security in many of the world s dry regions such as the middle east becker and lavee 2002 ward and becker 2015 southwestern north america and other dry places climate change has aggravated water scarcity around the world with water shortages expected to occur more often and with greater severity gober and kirkwood 2010 recent examples from severe and sustained droughts and their impacts on urban areas such as cape town maxmen 2018 point to challenges of developing quantitative approaches to guide planning for efficient adaptation to climate stress several physical and economic characteristics unique to water challenge the design of affordable climate adaptation and aquifer protection plans water seeps vogel et al 2015 leaks sobota et al 2015 transpires jackson et al 2001 and evaporates van dijk et al 2012 significantly water has a high ratio of weight to value steven et al 2008 as it moves through the hydrologic cycle a water problem exists when water is of the wrong quality sweeney et al 2004 quantity breshears et al 2005 timing ostrom 2007 location bird et al 2016 cost jacobson et al 2015 or price coppola et al 2003 moreover private water management choices in this basin and others often suffer from classic market failures including common property ostrom 2007 public goods milinski et al 2002 and externalities aburto oropeza et al 2008 north america s rio grande basin for which the middle section is shown in figs 1 and 2 is cited as the most climate stressed river systems in the us and the people who rely on the river system are among the nation s poorest dettinger et al 2015 water management in this basin presents both opportunities and challenges for managers political leaders and stakeholders the daily lives of about 6 million us bureau of reclamation 2016b depend on the water that the rio grande and its tributaries provide for urban use agriculture hydropower generation and ecosystem services all residents of the basin benefit from the rio grande and bear the costs of its supply extremes especially droughts and floods that periodically strike the region there is a growing recognition of the need to include groundwater in an integrated water management framework that recognizes impacts on groundwater use custodio 2002 harou and lund 2008 sophocleous 2002 wada et al 2010 from growth of water scarcity meixner et al 2016 several measures could be taken to include groundwater sustainability into an overall management framework all need to come to grips with the issue in dry regions that demands for groundwater exceed renewable supplies famiglietti 2014 especially for regions that experience climate stressed inflow reductions increasingly common in our study region as groundwater aquifers become threatened decisionmakers are seeking to develop policies that protect or restore them many aquifer protection policies address water quality dimensions boucher et al 2012a there is also a long history of works focusing on analyzing and protecting groundwater quantities foster et al 2015 as one of many recent example in the us alone the us state of california in 2014 passed the sustainable groundwater management act kiparsky et al 2017 niles and wagner 2018 or sgma that act requires communities to develop plans to balance groundwater basins by 2040 in order to stabilize groundwater levels the recognition of groundwater as an essential resource to be managed as part of a river basin scale system is especially important for the middle rio grande basin where two u s states new mexico and texas and two countries u s and mexico share transboundary aquifers there is an established and extensive literature that has investigated questions of economically optimal conjunctive use management including hydroeconomic modelling that link groundwater protection and policy choices boucher et al 2012b divakar et al 2011 harou et al 2009a riegels et al 2011 more recently a short list of integrated assessments linking climate water economics aquifers and policy has also been published momblanch et al 2016 other analyses of the connection between aquifer science and management also have been completed wang et al 2013 a wealth of hydroeconomic models address various climate adaptation challenges a short and partial list includes blanco gutiérrez et al 2013 d agostino et al 2014 varela ortega et al 2011 yang et al 2013 while much has been published on principles and applications of hydroeconomic optimization models to inform policy design beven 2001 duan et al 1994 harou et al 2009b none to date has successfully met the challenge of discovering minimum economic cost adaption measures to reach long term aquifer protection targets for a range of potential climate futures substitute water costs and system operation rules still many have emphasized the importance of defining and implementing aquifer protection goals kahil et al 2016 furthermore impacts of a range of potential future climate water stress levels on the marginal and total cost of protecting aquifers are rarely addressed in hydroeconomic optimization investigations surface water supply variability across years and across climate stress scenarios can impact groundwater supplies and use since surface inflows to a river system are both influenced by climate as well as being an important control on recharge rates moreover among the hydroeconomic optimization models that have been published we have found few if any works that make models accessible to stakeholders to enable them to conduct their own policy experiments using both observed or user changeable input data however some works have emphasized the importance of two way communication with stakeholders heinz et al 2007 this stakeholder accessibility gap has made it difficult to guide public debate over impacts of aquifer protection policies in light of these gaps this paper s contribution is to develop and apply a hydroeconomic optimization framework to investigate impacts of new policies such as changes in costs of aquifer protection in a conjunctive use system the middle rio grande basin of north america an important objective is its use to discover economic costs of protecting the basin s major aquifers for each of six scenarios of climate stressed water supplies two system operation rules and two water importation costs the paper s originality comes from its development of a hydroeconomic optimization framework to support discovery and design of policies to minimize the cost of meeting targeted regional aquifer protection plans under each of several potential future scenarios it achieves this goal in several ways it presents a basin scale analysis that tracks and optimizes discounted net present value of economic benefits from water allocation and use from several sources for each use it respects regionally significant hydrologic economic agronomic and institutional constraints it shows results of least cost adaptions for protecting regional aquifers to reach stakeholder set minimum aquifer levels for each of a several climate surface water supplies system operation rules and substitute water prices it supplies regional water stakeholders with tools to run their own scenario analysis for desired aquifer protection levels and other assumptions selected by stakeholders this tool demonstrates a capacity to an audience of researchers who recognize the challenge of communicating results boucher et al 2012a of models in useable formats to skeptical stakeholders and policymakers seeking relevance our approach presents improved methods to discover measures to reduce costs of aquifer protection our approach can potentially be applied any place where water is scarce it can also be applied to humid regions with long dry seasons containing an extended period of low rainfall commonly experienced in the tropics 2 methods of analysis 2 1 study area and data fig 1 shows watersheds aquifers irrigation districts countries and cities for the middle rio grande basin fig 2 presents a schematic diagram showing sources and uses of water in the basin this schematic reflects the model s network flow structure emphasizing the upstream downstream connections among model elements table 1 shows important data including important technical economic and institutional relations in the basin expressed numerically table 2 shows selected important kinds of data and sources used by the model math appendix table 3 shows the model inputs and choices accessible to the region s stakeholders and policymakers to compare to the historical period of record of water inflows into the top of our study basin we formulated an alternative scenario of several climate stress inflow scenarios producing a wide range of inflows discussed subsequently those alternative inflow levels are established math appendix block 7 for which the set w varies from historically observed inflows at the usgs san marcial gauges to five alternatives described below we consider six alternative scenarios for future climate generated hydrologic stress in our study area four of these climate scenarios listed as alternatives 2 5 in table 3 are derived from climate model simulations developed by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 with system surface inflows shown in table 4 water from a backstop technology bt or set of such technologies defined as a renewable substitute for existing water sources henriet 2012 solow 1974 could be supplied to meet increased demands when the cheaper but scarce local source rises in cost due to depletion the most likely bt for this basin is renewable desalinated water desal either for existing groundwater sources for newly developed aquifers or from imports after depletion from climate or policy occurs a bt could become more economically viable for our study region the three most important kinds of current everything but the bt sources are reservoir storage river flow and aquifer storage graphical appendix if bt costs fall from the range of 1400 1500 per acre foot from various local sources to a lower level defined by something in the range of four percent per year cost reduction we would expect a considerable increase in its use especially for urban use irrigation uptake of backstop sourced water requires a larger cost reduction unless heavily subsidized a sustainable long term renewable source for our study basin would require something like solar desalinated water samani 2000 from a coastal region a considerable distance from the rio grande basin even if legal and institutional constraints could be overcome those costs including transportation could run to 3000 per acre foot or more mo et al 2014 the backstop technology represents a substitute water supply to backup surface and groundwater sources if economically depleted math appendix block 33 for urban use and block 39 for irrigated agriculture 2 2 optimization model 2 2 1 model development like many other hydroeconomic models published in the peer reviewed literature hatfield dodds et al 2015 the model optimizes the economic objective of discounted net present value dnpv while respecting constraints both with and without climate stress as well as with and without policy measures to reduce the cost of adapting to that stress the dnpv objective is summed over uses locations and time periods the model solution identifies water conservation development flow storage and use patterns that maximize dnpv math appendix equation blocks 69 70 the model has several endogenous variables documented in the math appendix fig 2 shows the basin s network flow schematic table 1 shows the most important assumptions used by the model our paper focuses on the costs of aquifer protection measured as the dnpv displaced by measures that would secure that protection the aquifer protection requirement assures access to use of the aquifer s water supply for future generations we selected this approach partly because it is hard to reliably calculate what future groundwater use values are protected by reductions in current pumping or increases in groundwater recharge levels for our paper aquifer protection costs are measured as the least cost set of reductions in dnpv taken from all uses sectors locations and time periods needed to secure that protection the aquifer protection requirement was implemented by specifying a simple constraint requiring both important regional aquifers to return to at least 100 percent of their starting values at the terminal period of the model 2033 other percentages could have been used indeed by varying the percentages it is a straightforward exercise to sweep out an optimized system response to a series of potential terminal aquifer performance requirements sustaining any aquifer at a higher level or at an earlier terminal period reduces overall benefits over the time period of analysis but raises accessibility and supply of water for earlier future periods math appendix block 68 2 2 2 network flow schematic fig 2 shows the basin s network flow schematic including the most important sources and uses of water in the region of the rio grande basin from fig 1 the arrows show movement of water flows among the various elements for which the optimization code of the hydroeconomic model seeks to find the use pumping and recharge pattern that is most dynamically economically efficient 2 2 3 simulation to optimization the development of a validated river basin system simulation model maass et al 1962 teutschbein and seibert 2012 without optimization can be used with some confidence to experiment with impacts throughout the basin associated with a change in inflows the limitation of a basin scale simulation model even if validated is that its predictions for handling future climate stressed inflows carry no optimization properties that is it can provide no guidance on future water use patterns or policies that optimize dnpv of water use patterns nor would it be able to identify least cost measures to design potentially new system operating and institutional constraints all of which are needed to guide policy choices on measures for handling climate stressed inflows simulation models where validated with the facts can replicate history however where new system operation constraints need to be designed or tested such models are likely to provided only limited guidance because of the difficult interpretation problems it poses by lacking optimality properties the model addresses a three part objective consisting of economic efficiency equity and sustainability economic efficiency is the formal mathematical objective function for which constraints are imposed to address equity e g water sharing rules such as treaties and sustainability terminal year aquifer protection 2 2 4 variables each model run seeks water storage and use patterns that maximize dnpv of economic performance from among many possible linked water development consumption use and pricing trajectories the model has several endogenous variables math appendix for which their numerical values are determined by the solution to the constrained optimization 2 2 5 equations the model specifies several equations that connect sets data parameters and variables this structure permits a comprehensive water accounting exercise to allow an investigation of efficient climate water stress adaptation the model currently has 68 blocks of equations math appendix for which a few of the most prominent are briefly summarized here 2 2 5 1 agricultural land water and yield the economic value of water applied to cropped lands are the most important determinants of the scale of land and water use in irrigated agriculture as well as its distribution among crops and irrigation technologies potential growth in farm economic profitability through changes in price cost or yield will generally raise the scale of farmland irrigated math appendix blocks 1 5 containing five equation blocks that link farmland in production with surface and groundwater use as well as crop yield irrigated agriculture is the largest water consumer in the basin typical for the world s arid regions 2 2 5 2 surface water hydrology an accurate mathematical characterization of surface water hydrologic relations is important for many reasons including the fact that increased use of surface water at any one point in the basin typically reduces surface water supplies at another point or in another time giordano et al 2005 the structure math appendix blocks 6 18 account for surface water stocks and flows by location year climate water stress level and climate adaptation policy they describe numerous relationships characterizing surface water hydrology at the basin scale these relationships are defined for reservoir storage and for each of five river reaches graphical appendices 2 3 2 6 2 2 5 3 groundwater hydrology each of the two aquifers are treated as simple bathtubs or buckets filled with aquifer material each with a known plan view area starting storage and storage coefficient the simple bucket mass balance tracks aquifer depth by aquifer and year math appendix blocks 19 24 for each aquifer annual change in storage is net recharge minus net pumping both of which are determined by the constrained optimization 2 2 5 4 urban water use urban water use is typically the highest economic valued of the competing uses in the rio grande basin as well as most other watersheds where urban use is significant urban price elasticities of demand in the basin study area are typically low fullerton and elias 2004 as is the case for most of the developed world s water utilities that is for urban demands price changes can be expected to have little effect on use especially indoor use math appendix blocks 25 28 consumer surplus is the gain to urban water buyers resulting from a reduction in urban price or increase in supply reliability consumer surplus from affordable access to safe drinking water is economically and politically important in most places and even more so where a large percentage of the population is poor or faces unreliable water service as for much of the rio grande basin 2 2 5 5 economic elements numerous economic elements are required to completely characterize this hydroeconomic model s specification of water supply and demand as well as benefit and cost math appendix blocks 29 51 economic benefits and costs are associated with use reservoir level or instream flow level for environmental service provision for our model a water system adjustment to the status quo such as an institutional or infrastructure improvement or change in a law contributes to improved economic efficiency if the marginal benefits from the change exceed the marginal costs that is a change along any dimension such as adjusted timing sizing or sequencing must exceed the marginal cost to secure improvements in economic efficiency despite all of these properties it has long been recognized that water is different savenije 2002 because of its interacting institutional and technical complexities still any economically optimized set of program plans needs to be updated with new information on factors affecting benefits and costs such as emerging information on climate stressed system inflows the marginal opportunity cost of all these choices changes in time and space as resource availability demands and the willingness to pay of water users varies pulido velazquez et al 2012 2 2 6 institutional constraints several important institutional hydrologic economic and physical constraints set limits on how water can be used in most of the world s watersheds including our basin those constraints have an important influence on future adaptations to climate stress in many of the world s basins several are described below 2 2 6 1 2008 operating agreement after many years of negotiation and litigation the 2008 operating agreement oa for the rio grande project was established in march 2008 that agreement s point of departure was the historical operation of the rio grande project us bureau of reclamation 2016a with two major adjustments the first adjustment implemented in the oa established carryover accounting by which each of the two major us irrigation districts elephant butte irrigation district or ebid and el paso county water improvement district 1 had a right to store and recover its unused water in a given year for the following year the agreement effectively established a property right to conserved water assigned to the district for whom members invested in conservation measures prior to enactment of the oa the unused part of either district s annual water allocation was made available for use to both districts in the following year discouraging measures that could have been taken to promote conservation providing incentives for the classical tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 the carryover part of the oa was established to promote and reward water conservation in the rio grande project area by permitting each irrigation district to retain its saved nonuse in a given year up to an established upper bound in the following year net of evaporation losses the second adjustment implemented by the oa was to change in the annual allocations the two districts to reflect changes in the overall project s water delivery performance as reflected by a term known as the diversion ratio in conditions for which the diversion ratio was larger than 1 0 ebid typically secures an increase in water allocation compared to then historical project operations in conditions for which the diversion ration is less than 1 0 ebid typically receives a reduction in project allocation compared to historical operation of the project us bureau of reclamation 2016a the oa is an important institutional constraint math appendix blocks 52 55 it allocates water among two states several uses two countries and varies by water supply condition 2 2 6 2 us mexico treaty of 1906 under the u s mexico treaty of 1906 a constant 60 000 acre foot delivery to mexico by the united states was negotiated u s department of state 1906 with language stating when severe drought occurred u s deliveries to mexico could be reduced below the 60 000 acre foot level consistent with the language of that treaty with recent implementation details under the oa us bureau of reclamation 2016a deliveries to mexico are reduced in approximate proportion to the reduction of deliveries to u s lands math appendix block 56 2 2 6 3 historical acreage observed historical acreage for the 1994 2015 period is part of the water accounting balance this calibration assures that model predicted diversions pumping and cropping patterns approximately match observed data when the model is run in simulation non optimization mode for that period math appendix blocks 57 59 2 2 6 4 system physical structure several simple physical structural elements are included math appendix blocks 60 65 these account for relationships between irrigated acreage groundwater use stocks of reservoirs and aquifers and flows of various reaches of the river system modelling these physical constraints protects the integrity of conservation of mass 2 2 6 5 aquifer sustainability requirement an aquifer sustainability requirement protects access to use of the aquifer s water supply for future generations math appendix block 68 sustaining any aquifer at a higher level or at an earlier terminal period reduces overall benefits over the time period of analysis but water access for future generations the implementation and assessment of groundwater protection goals are more transparent understandable and possibly more acceptable if based on an economic assessment of the costs and benefits of securing different protection levels there continues to be growing need for methods of analysis to illustrate approaches for conducting a cost benefit analysis cba approach to guide groundwater protection programs rinaudo and aulong 2014 this paper uses the model to identify marginal as well as total costs of protecting the basin s two major aquifers by requiring that aquifer storage return to levels for a given past year by a given period considerable effort remains underway in our study basin as well as many of the world s arid basins to establish or improve measures for protecting aquifer viability for example in 2018 a year of severe water shortage paskus 2018 the rio grande basin saw several institutional technical and behavioral adjustments to water shortages including water trading conversion from urban water intensive lawns to water saving xeriscape and a reduced scale of crop production in lower valued forage cropping 2 2 6 6 objective the objective function is dnpv summed over uses locations and time periods math appendix blocks 67 68 the dnpv objective is used to discover through the optimization exercise water conservation development flow storage and use patterns that maximize dnpv for which a few relating to the costs of aquifer protection are shown in the results 2 3 scenarios the impact of climate variability on surface inflows into the top edge of our basin boundary is characterized by the two parallel gauging stations at san marcial for which inflows enter elephant butte eb reservoir fig 1 a 40 year time series of six sets of inflows into is secured by prescribing the time series of annual rio grande inflow into eb at the upstream end of the study area eb is the principal storage reservoir for surface water in the middle rio grande basin it is managed conjunctively with caballo reservoir much smaller in storage capacity a short distance downstream fig 1 releases from the outflow point of caballo reservoir are managed to serve the needs of water rights holders downstream at various locations we present five scenarios of annual inflows into eb based both on historical observations and on projected future time series adapted from various climate model simulations townsend et al 2018 scenario 1 table 4 replicates historical observed flows at the san marcial gauges through the year 2010 the final three years of the historical observation period used for our model 2011 2013 severe drought years on the rio grande are extended into future years through the last year used for our model 2033 to prescribe a scenario with projected water shortages corresponding to a severe and prolonged drought that is variability in annual flows after 2013 is achieved by simply repeating the three year sequence of flows for the period 2011 2013 table 4 scenarios 2 5 are derived from four different climate model simulations generated by the u s bureau of reclamation 2016 the u s bureau of reclamation has generated naturalized flows in major western rivers using climate model output from the cmip5 archive of global climate simulations forced by varying greenhouse gas emissions scenarios taylor et al 2012 the climate simulations extend from 1950 to 2005 based on historical climate forcing including observed greenhouse gas concentrations and are extended into future years using one of several prescribed greenhouse gas scenarios the u s bureau of reclamation has coupled the climate model output to a surface water model that simulates streamflow at selected gauge points along the rio grande u s bureau of reclamation 2016 we have normalized these projections of natural flow on the rio grande to account statistically for upstream impacts on natural flows defined by the rio grande compact the compact has influenced and continues to influence the size and scale of dams seepage evaporation diversions return flows all of which influence our accurately simulated flows at san marcial during both the historical and projected periods these normalized inflows are compatible with the terms of the current rio grande compact negotiated in 1938 at the bishop s lodge santa fe booker et al 2005 renegotiation of the compact has been discussed historically from time to time grant 2007 the normalization procedure modifies the simulated year to year mean and variance of flow at san marcial to match those statistics during a 50 year historical baseline period 1964 2013 thereby forcing the simulation to reproduce accurate means and variances of the observed distribution of total year to year annual flows we then apply the empirical constants needed to achieve this normalization in the historical period to projected future flows simulated by the same model producing future flows that match historical means and variances the same normalization procedure is repeated for each of the five scenario development methods for which the last four are described here as simulations as described in more detail below the names of simulations numbered 2 5 in table 4 refer to the cmip5 climate model name used to generate the streamflow simulation taylor et al 2012 u s bureau of reclamation 2016 1 obsdrought observed flows extended drought for the period 1950 2013 for which the later years are shown for our analysis as 1994 2013 table 4 observed daily streamflows at the pair of gauges at san marcial are summed to create annual flow values in 1000 af yr the final three years of this observational period 2011 2013 were low flow drought years for the period 2014 2033 we repeat the three year sequence of flows observed in 2011 2013 to create a synthetic permanent drought that extends through the future period of study table 4 shows that average annual flows for this simulation for our period 1994 2033 are 466 1000 af yr 2 acc85 model simulation based on output from the access1 0 rcp85 simulation forced by a high emissions greenhouse gas scenario rcp8 5 this simulation yields an extreme reduction of streamflow by the late 21st century although those flow reductions are not pronounced until about the year 2040 after the end of our model time horizon u s bureau of reclamation 2016 average annual flows for our model years 1994 2033 are 676 1000 af yr as seen in table 4 3 had85 model simulation based on output from the hadgem2 es rcp85 simulation forced by the same rcp8 5 high emissions greenhouse gas scenario as acc85 this simulation yields an intermediate reduction in streamflow starting in the mid 21st century for which its average annual flows are 633 1000 af yr as in table 4 4 had26 model simulation based on output from the hadgem2 es rcp26 simulation forced by a lower emissions greenhouse gas scenario rcp2 6 this simulation yields a more modest reduction in future streamflow compared to the had85 results had26 yields future streamflow close to the average of the all the reclamation simulations we have examined average annual inflows at the san marcial gauge for our model s time horizon are 622 1000 af yr shown in table 4 5 mir26 model simulation based on output from the miroc esm rcp26 simulation forced by the same lower emissions scenario used for had26 mir26 yields the highest streamflow projection of all the reclamation simulations for which average flows are 945 1000 af yr these five scenarios described above are used to illustrate the range of streamflow future supplies for the rio grande mainstem at the san marcial gauges included in the reclamation suite of model projections we do not present any of these simulations as a forecast with specified probabilities for this study we do not consider any of the model based simulations to be more probable than the others instead our goal is to investigate a wide but plausible range of future water supply futures as inputs to the optimized model influencing downstream users a flexible framework for understanding alternative climate futures should be adapted to a changing climate where possible nonstationary hydrologic variables are best understood and modeled stochastically to characterize the evolution of their probability density functions pdfs over time to characterize uncertainty eventually we would like to see methods developed to estimate model parameters that link historical and paleohydrologic measurements with forecasts of several climate models each driven by several climate forcing scenarios milly et al 2008 the climate scenarios for san marcial flow developed for this work represent an initial step toward a full stochastic development of the full probability density function for future flows that describes above the five simulations described above represent extreme high flow miroc extreme low flow access and two more moderate hadgem simulations in order to span the likely range of model projected flows each of these models exhibits a pronounced increase in temperature temperature projections are more consistent across the simulations than are precipitation projections the range of projected precipitation change is broadly correlated with the range of projected streamflow supplies more or less precipitation leads to higher or lower streamflow adjustments of existing or future anthropogenic influences on useable mainstem streamflow at san marcial are not considered in the bureau of reclamation s streamflow projections the simulations are based on different climate projections but all of them use the same land surface and hydrologic routing model so the differences between model simulations come from climate differences as stated above these are naturalized flow simulations without additional processing they are not suitable for prescribed upstream inflows for our study because roughly three quarters of the rio grande s natural flow is appropriated from the river for consumptive use before reaching san marcial under the terms of the rio grande compact the projected flows generated by the reclamation simulations are therefore much higher than actual gauged flow reaching elephant butte reservoir intra annual flow patterns are not considered in this study because the hydroeconomic model has an annual time step one question would ask why these adjustments are specified to stay the same in future time periods when the purpose of these inflow scenarios is to consider the effects of climate variability and change over time management of the river could change so that more or less than the approximately three quarters of natural flow would be taken from the river system upstream townsend and gutzler 2019 consideration of the range of new management scenarios and political decisions such as renegotiated interstate water sharing agreements in colorado and new mexico upstream from our study area while important for informing future management debates is beyond the scope of the analysis presented here our analysis focuses on the effects of comparatively near term climate stresses with no changes in water sharing institutions a sixth simulation is added to the first five it represents a bounded condition that would be lower than any part of the historical period of record for that simulation we set annual flow in all years to zero labelled zero flows at san marcial for the 40 year time horizon table 4 clearly it sets a lower bound on surface inflows over our model s time horizon far outside the range of any historical experience this scenario is designed to stress the system with the maximum possible shortage maximizing the need to find alternative substitute supplies or invest in alternative conservation measures there is nothing purely stochastic in our procedure for developing the time series of inflows at san marcial we are taking dynamical model output which is chaotic but not stochastic and modifying each model s time series to match the mean and variance of annual flows for a 50 year historical baseline period to account for upstream water management and institutions the climate scenarios do not present the full pdf of flows but have been selected to provide examples that span the range of high flow and low flow future simulations augmented by the synthetic scenarios described above as of today mid 2019 the complete pdf of future san marcial flows is unknown and it is certainly beyond the scope of this paper still by choosing a set of inflows that spans the range of available model simulations we have tried to illustrate a plausible range of conditions that merit water management planning in the near term 3 results 3 1 main messages results presented in tables 5 8 and in figs 3 and 4 show several messages the economic cost of aquifer protection is a special concept for an aquifer the marginal cost of its protection to a set level is the added cost of returning an aquifer to a given storage volume level by a given period measured as the change in discounted net present value dnpv of total economic benefits under base conditions compared to a more stringent set of conditions required our model assesses the marginal cost of aquifer protection by comparing the dnpv of economic benefits summed over basinwide uses locations sectors and periods while assuring that the aquifer reaches the minimum required storage level by the required year that dnpv is compared to the higher dnpv of water uses from requiring the aquifer to return to one lower unit of storage volume the added cost of the last unit of aquifer protection is the reduction in dnpv of other water uses displaced from raising the protection level from x 1 units of aquifer storage to x units of aquifer storage where x is 100 percent of 1994 aquifer levels the total cost of aquifer protection is the marginal cost defined over a larger increment of required aquifer protection it is the dnpv of total use values with no protection at all minus the dnpv of total use values with the aquifer protection selected by the stakeholder fig 3 shows that the marginal costs of aquifer protection vary widely for each of 24 conditions presented for each of the two aquifers generally it shows that marginal cost is higher when surface water inflows are low and that one aquifer supports higher levels of demand hueco bolson supports higher proportion of urban demand and has a higher cost of substitute surface water 3000 per acre foot rather than 1444 per acre foot the figure also shows that the marginal cost of aquifer protection is uniformly lower when the cost of substitute surface water imports is lower this is because the substitute water is an alternative for pumped water therefore its reduced price would take pressure off either aquifer the marginal cost of aquifer protection falls to zero as the price of renewable water imports falls beneath the price of the cheapest sustainable existing source not shown in the results if such a condition could occur in future years the cost of returning surface water riparian ecosystems to pre settlement levels if desired approaches zero fig 4 shows similar findings for total costs of aquifer protection total costs of protecting both regional aquifers increase with higher cost of substitute surface water presence of the 2008 oa and a greater shortage of surface inflows a higher cost surface import costs places greater stress on the aquifers as expected shown in table 7 requiring aquifer protection also expected raises optimized recharge averaged over both aquifers several measures could be applied to promote aquifer protection as shown in table 8 3 2 incremental economic costs of aquifer protection table 5 describes the marginal cost of the least cost set of measures needed to restore each of the basin s regional aquifers to their historically observed 1994 level by 2033 these marginal costs are shown by climate water stress inflow scenario system operation rule and unit cost of imported surface water for each aquifer 3 2 1 comparison between aquifers marginal costs of the last unit volume of water needed to restore the hueco bolson to 1994 levels by 2033 are typically higher than those of protecting the mesilla aquifer for the same conditions for which the hueco s cost is in the range of 45 per acre foot higher than the mesilla when considering the 24 conditions shown in table 5 these higher costs of protecting the hueco occurs because there is a much higher valued set of uses there as well as higher levels of competing pumping from two large cities in the hueco bolson namely el paso texas and cd juarez mexico than for the mesilla for the mesilla aquifer the greater share of use has for many years been assigned to irrigated agriculture for which a sizeable percentage is used for low valued livestock forage 3 2 2 effect of system operation results in table 5 show a marginal cost of protection about 55 lower without than with the oa than for the mesilla and 12 lower without than with the oa for the hueco that lower costs comes from a greater freedom to allocate shortages to their highest valued uses than permitted under the oa the oa specifies exacting rules for sharing surface flows among new mexico texas and mexico these rules would be replaced by water allocations moving water to its highest valued uses without the oa in place additionally in comparing with versus without the oa marginal costs of achieving both aquifer restorations are slightly different without the oa marginal costs of aquifer protection averages 118 16 for the mesilla and 161 15 for the hueco these costs without the oa are both higher than allocations with the oa since greater freedom to optimize without the oa allows water to move to highest valued uses raising the costs economic value displaced from aquifer protection with the oa marginal costs of aquifer protection are 53 41 for the mesilla and 111 46 for the hueco 3 2 3 influencing factors both surface water supplies and import prices matter as we expected higher average surface inflows as shown in table 5 tend to reduce the marginal cost of protecting the regional aquifers since greater amounts of surface water reduce demands for groundwater pumping as well as increasing aquifer recharge for the case of surface irrigation by far the most widely practiced irrigation technology in the region while table 5 shows a large number of factors affecting the marginal cost of restoring our two regional aquifers two stand out when multiplied together mean annual inflow shortage from any given climate stress surface inflow scenario times the price of surface water imports if made available table 5 shows 24 combinations of marginal costs of aquifer protection for each of our two aquifers these include six water supply conditions with mean annual shortages from full supplies listed for each also included are two operating agreement arrangements with and without and two surface water import prices the very wide fluctuations in those marginal costs shown shadow prices makes it clear that existing conditions make a considerable difference a simple linear regression equation was estimated to systematically investigate factors influencing those marginal cost elements shown in table 5 for which all 24 conditions for each aquifer with results of the regression in table 9 a that table shows that marginal costs in the hueco bolson are 46 44 per acre foot higher over all conditions than the mesilla the hueco is a smaller aquifer sees larger average starting pumping depths to water and is subject to a much higher percentage of urban use for which the elasticity of demand is low all of which combine to raise the marginal cost from its protection each one unit increase in the product of mean annual shortages in 1000 acre feet per year and cost of imports in 1000 per acre foot produces a 0 23 increase in the shadow price of aquifer protection for both aquifers taken together the mean value of that product term 575 28 over all 24 combinations when multiplied by 0 23 produces an increase in the marginal cost of aquifer protection of 132 31 table 9a shows that 90 percent of the variance in the marginal cost of protecting the aquifers is explained by these two variables table 5 contains all the data required to reproduce this regression 3 3 total economic costs of aquifer protection table 6 shows the discounted net present value of total basin wide economic costs of aquifer protection by climate stress scenario system operation rule cost of imported surface water and terminal period aquifer protection requirement in us 1000s not surprisingly it shows that total economic cost of protecting the two regional aquifers far right column like marginal cost is highly variable that total cost varies widely according to the basin s economic hydrologic and institutional conditions the lowest of those costs 9 0 million occurs with the wettest inflow scenario and zero associated shortage miroc rcp26 r1ip1 without the 2008 oa giving rise to greater flexibility in system operation over large changes in supply and with low surface water import costs impacts of low water import prices means can contribute to affordable alternatives to reduced aquifer pumping needed to protect aquifers the highest of those costs of aquifer protection 2 47 billion which is more than 270 times the lowest cost table 6 occurs with a series of conditions giving rise to high levels of water scarcity those conditions occur with zero maximum annual average shortage without the 2008 oa and high surface water import costs these conditions taken together make it economically difficult to find alternatives to aquifer pumping when the aquifers must be protected through reduced pumping table 9b shows results of a second linear regression to explain what influences the greatest share of total costs of aquifer protection not surprisingly the weighted combination of system inflow shortages multiplied by water import costs is the single largest predictor after trying several other combinations of predictors not shown a one unit increase in that variable labelled shortage import cost elevated by one unit for example from the current average of 557 56 to one unit higher of 558 56 raises the total cost of aquifer protection by 929 22 that parameter estimate is shown in table 9b many other results from the data shown in table 5 could be described but about 89 percent of the variance in total cost is explained by the intercept and this single predictor term 3 4 overarching findings several of our results illustrate important principles that can be applied to inform policy and management when surface water supplies fall groundwater pumping demands increase for all urban uses where conjunctive use is currently practiced and for all agricultural uses except the lowest valued forage crops not shown in the tables also aquifer protection costs increase fall with lower higher future surface water availability increased reduced costs of alternative substitute water sources and with more less flexible system operation rules for the data and model structure used our findings inform policy debates over a wide range of aquifer protection measures we considered while the detailed numerical results are valid only for the middle rio grande basin the approach could be used anywhere aquifers are under stress and for which protection is important to sustain long run use table 7 shows net aquifer recharge under several conditions table 8 addresses a remaining question that asks about the kinds of aquifer protection measures that could be implemented for our basin to achieve the efficient aquifer protection plans this paper described this table describes 22 aquifer protection measures that could be implemented alone or in combination costs shown earlier in tables 5 and 6 set a lower bound on the cost of protecting aquifers at this point we do not know which of the aquifer protection measures shown in table 8 would come closest to achieving the minimum cost aquifer protection measures shown in the earlier tables however several investigations since the 1950s applied to other resources such as commercial fisheries poos et al 2010 scott 1955 consistently suggest that use quotas or permits combined with marketability of those permits al azawi and ward 2017 would move pumping out of the lowest valued economic uses while securing resource protection levels at user set levels 4 discussion we have some confidence that the basin scale water accounting augmented by an optimization framework presented in this work can contribute to inform debates over the best way to handle ongoing challenges that face policymakers for controlling the costs of adapting to climate stress a similar approach as described in this work could be used to discover economically and financially viable measures to address climate mitigation as well as discovering measures by which those costs can be distributed in a politically acceptable way moss et al 2010 4 1 stakeholders since 2016 a user interface has been steadily under development to communicate model results as well as permitting policy experimentation for numerous groups of regional water stakeholders including agriculture government agencies environmental and social justice interests the interface is part of an ongoing effort to increase access to water sustainability models on the web garnica chavira et al 2018 currently accessible at https water cybershare utep edu swim home we are aware of few other integrated water resources optimization models accessible to non specialist stakeholders to conduct science based water management and policy experiments several stakeholder workshops and model outreach exercises were held throughout 2016 2018 pennington et al 2018 at those workshops various features of the model described in this article were presented including its capacity to simulate different scenario combinations and to present results intuitively for non specialized users these meetings were held in various locations in southern new mexico and west texas usa english as well as northern mexico spanish stakeholders were encouraged to experiment with different combinations of water supply water use and policy proposals as well as adjusting data from which they could observe model outputs in formats chosen by the user the workshops were held partly to inform stakeholders on development of a more comprehensive understanding of choices of water use patterns in agriculture urban and environmental uses as well as expanding their capacity to experiment with proposed policies as of mid 2019 a typical 40 year model scenario takes just under two minutes of clock time from the time it is submitted for execution to the loading of model results to a useable form this series of steps generates about 1 3 mb of formatted data for a single climate and a single policy scenario chosen by the user users are currently advised to run the model in pairs of scenarios in order that a base policy for handling a given climate water stress scenario can be compared to an alternative of their choice despite the favorable reception received at all the workshops to date garnica chavira et al 2018 participants have expressed a wish to see an improved and more compact and personalized listing of all model data and outputs without overwhelming the stakeholder with material extraneous to their immediate interests work continues on this improvement a well known challenge faced by developers of any large scale river basin analysis to inform policy debates fowler et al 2007 we anticipate the need to handle special challenges for addressing numerous groups of stakeholders many of which center around competing interests and highly varied preferences motivated by wide ranging personal or financial interests 4 2 scope the basin scale optimization approach described in this work presents an innovative approach to inform policy debates seeking solutions that adapt to altered water supplies in climate stressed water systems these costs are important factors and they will determine the type and design of measures chosen and the willingness to adopt and its speed this paper is one of the few to present an optimization framework to discover minimum cost plans to adapt to a climate stressed inflows to a river basin still our work has a limited scope results inform policy debates that need information on the marginal and total cost of aquifer protection despite a generally weak knowledge of the probability distributions of the parameters as well as limited knowledge of the functional forms that drive the model results another important limitation of this work is that substitute water was considered only at two costs 1444 texas water development board 2016 and 3000 per acre foot wilder et al 2016 based on adjusting seawater desalination costs in the san diego california region to the conveyance costs of transport to our study region water available at each of these substitute prices was modelled as whatever quantities buyers would use at those prices with no upper bound on use in fact quantities of each of these alternative water sources is highly limited and in many cases unknown ongoing work continues to establish research grade data to specify a stair step supply function in our model to address prices and quantities available for substitute water for which known limited quantities would be available at alternative prices taking pressure off regional sources and reducing the cost of protecting aquifers our current optimization model runs on an annual time step even with such a long time step there are more than half a million variables to optimize shortening the time step to monthly would raise an already large model by a factor of twelve despite the obvious advantages of a monthly or even shorter time step for assessing measures such as targeted well timed environmental flow protection we are limited from doing that until we can find a faster solver or more efficient code the model currently optimizes over a 40 year time horizon increasing that horizon to something like twice that would allow for a more sophisticated intertemporal adaptation to future climate stress scenarios that would not play out with as much insight over the comparatively short 40 year horizon we hope to be able to report on those longer term experiments by mid 2019 our model is a simple three bucket model containing one surface storage bucket two aquifer buckets and a network flow system connecting the various sources buckets and uses plans for an improved model are to incorporate a modflow harbaugh et al 2000 type exchange between the river and regional aquifers to handle the well known darcy s law according to that law the rate and direction of groundwater movement are proportional to and determined by the difference in head between the river and aquifer or hydraulic gradient dumars and minier 2004 which avoids the need for the use of simplifying response functions our model explores a range of future surface inflows generated from dynamical climate models it then assesses the sensitivity of the hydrological economic institutional system to that set of prescribed flows varying several but not all management variables in conjunction with the range of prescribed water supply futures we have not yet placed explicit probabilities on the various water future time series although we plan to undertake that kind of work for the future as a part of a more rigorous and comprehensive assessment of uncertainty for this work we have simply explored a wide plausible range of possibilities despite the advantages of using hydroeconomic optimization to more efficiently manage effects of climate and policy futures on the dynamics of water use patterns in the rio grande basin the model has limitations we plan to address in future work dynamic stochastic optimization cervellera et al 2006 would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of climate stress and of policies to promote resilience as well as uncertainties related to the economic and hydrological parameters that affect outcomes though the paper handles some of this while the data used for this paper are recent and more comprehensive than of previous published studies we were able to find data limitations with respect to variability over time and space will influence the results finally the model does not address the general equilibrium brouwer et al 2008 effects of urban and irrigation water use a computable general equilibrium analysis would reveal important economy wide secondary impacts not directly included in this model there is a natural desire to derive a set of rules that can be derived from modeling exercises such as ours to inform robust decisions under future influences gao et al 2009 such results would describe how the costs of aquifer protection can be calculated by running a very large number of optimization model runs then summarizing results compactly using regression models or their equivalent our results partly achieve that goal for which an illustration is described in the discussion of two regression model results in table 9 using the data from tables 5 and 6 for future work we plan to present results that describe optimized water use patterns under a wide range of climate water stress from which we hope to develop rule curve relations that extract as much information from which a few simple formulas would show optimized diversions as well as reservoir and aquifer discharge and storage levels 4 3 comparisons it is important to discuss our results compared to other studies or specific examples for other catchments regions with similar problems and potentially solutions every river basin has its unique characteristics so few numerical findings here are likely to transfer reliably elsewhere but the methods and interpretation could be expected to transfer widely unique features of the rio grande include system operation constraints treaty delivery requirements and endangered species requirements unique water supply and demand patterns and unique aquifer characteristics still our approach opens up considerable potential for generalizability many of the world s dry regions such as vast parts of the american west much of north africa parts of central asia and the majority of the middle east face similar water problems for which optimization modelling approaches such as ours could provide important insights into efficient groundwater protection measures what is needed to handle large scale analysis for the future are the kinds of hydroeconomic models with global generalizability with application to several regions of the world such as the recent innovation published in 2018 kahil et al 2018 4 4 variability in parameters the parameters data read by our model carry uncertainty especially when selected by stakeholders for future years the model structure itself also has uncertainty the link to our model described above permits stakeholders to run the model several times sequentially to discover impacts of varying data assumptions for which users can vary a single assumption or modify a series of assumptions systematically to trace out impacts of changed data assumptions for the model to read and re optimize stakeholders can currently run the model to produce a series of runs that assess the robustness of alternative aquifer protection proposals although deterministic not stochastic our model accounts for variability in the data in two ways neither of which attempt to discover probability density functions pdfs in the data results are based on inflows varying according to six climate model simulations that span the range from high future flows to lower future flows among a much larger set of available simulations each of these inflow scenarios is assessed with and without existing basin system operating rules and with varying water import prices stakeholders have access to a user interface allowing them to select any set of parameters desired many of which we have yet to conduct experiments an important question centers on how the variance of inflows as a stochastic process as well as other sources of uncertainty affect the cost minimization outcomes while this issue has been discussed in the results in describing tables 5 and 6 a more comprehensive approach is possible of which we would be most enthusiastic to see applied in the future we would also be enthusiastic to see a formal stochastic programming approach developed for future work to rigorously handle uncertainty in our hydrologic water supply as well as economic parameters affecting the economic value of water a few recent celebrated stochastic programming applications to water system optimization have been published nematian 2016 singh 2012 every parameter used to drive our model carries uncertainty much unknown of which there are about 1200 in total for our model one method to present impacts of uncertainties in all parameters is by calculating elements of a jacobian matrix of partial derivatives cockett et al 2018 that matrix expressed in elasticity form would provide a comprehensive assessment of uncertainty it can be measured as partial changes in optimized outcomes from changes in base values of each parameter driving the basin model when expressed in elasticity form these terms are y i x j multiplied by x j y i for each of i 1 n endogenous optimized variable of interest and each of j 1 m parameter that can be varied when complete the populated matrix showing those sensitivities has n rows and m columns and would require m 1 model runs if the uncertain parameters are varied one at a time for each alternative run the augmented jth parameter for which impacts of its change are desired should be set at a slightly higher level than the observed base level this exercise produces a base value for each endogenous variable of interest such as the cost of protecting the aquifer as well as a new value of the endogenous variable for a slightly higher by epsilon units value of the parameter such as an augmented price of substitute water this exercise requires m 1 separate model runs for which the results in elasticity form can be presented in a single large matrix the result is an n m matrix of discrete approximations to the classical newtonian n m set of partial derivatives if expressed in elasticity form it produces an elasticity matrix for which all elements are independent of measurement units where future probability assessments can be conducted potential changes in any unknown parameter can be multiplied by appropriate elasticity elements to identify changes to all endogenous variables that would result from our model elements of such an elasticity matrix can currently mid 2019 be approximated by stakeholders who access our model s website at https water cybershare utep edu swim home yet the conduct of this kind of exercise takes considerable patience it requires varying each of several parameters by a small amount then run the model keeping track of the impact of each varied parameter on a select number of optimized variables important to our stakeholders we have not yet developed an efficient method to generate these elasticity matrices one reason we have not yet developed the matrices is that the value of each n m matrix elements depends on starting numerical value of all parameters each set of starting conditions would produce a different elasticity matrix a more nearly linear system can be expected to produce elasticity matrix elements more nearly equal across alterative starting conditions the authors would also like to see development of graphical user interfaces where model users need not be modelling experts to build their own basin scale network flow models we have never seen such a thing published or posted still our vision is an interface in which stakeholders could specify their own network node structure watershed layout infrastructure capacity e g conveyance and purification capacity as well as data on hydrology agriculture and economics as well as institutional constraints governing how supplies shortages or surpluses are or could be shared among users time periods sectors or locations 4 5 takeaways this work has addressed the challenges of designing economically responsible groundwater protection measures for which ongoing debates of why and how it should be accomplished continue to occur internationally it is more defensible to design an aquifer protection plan with information on the total and marginal costs of aquifer protection information typically missing in the world s heavily used aquifers this work has presented an original approach to address widespread gaps of information worldwide on marginal and total cost of aquifer protection while the model developed and documented investigates much more than the cost of protecting aquifers those costs are the focus of this paper to address impacts of aquifer protection targets groundwater sustainability targets are both relaxed and enforced for each of the region s two major aquifers results show a rising marginal opportunity cost of aquifer protection measures from 1 more heavily stressed climate scenarios 2 higher substitute water prices and 3 without system operating rules in place our approach can be used to provide important information to guide the assessment of alternative aquifer protection plans in our basin as well as elsewhere 5 conclusions policymakers worldwide continue to take a growing interest in policies that would promote sustainable development and use of aquifers in the face of increased pumping stress to meet growing demands combined with climate stressed surface supplies in many dry parts of the world aquifer protection can be a costly proposition because water uses that currently rely on the aquifer may produce considerable economic value that would be lost if aquifer protection is required despite much previous work motivated by this problem few peer reviewed papers to date have examined water use patterns that minimize the economic costs of aquifer protection this work has addressed some existing gaps in the literature by presenting an original and innovative approach to formulate and applying a basin scale hydroeconomic optimization of north america s middle rio grande basin the economic cost minimization objective is implemented by finding the optimized discounted net present value of economic benefits summed over uses sectors and regions from use of surface water and conjunctively managed aquifers results were presented for each of six water supply scenarios two substitute water prices and two system operation rules long term aquifer sustainability targets were specified and enforced as constraints for each of the region s two major aquifers the mesilla and hueco the paper assessed economic costs of securing two targeted aquifer protection levels by identifying optimized surface and groundwater diversion pumping and use patterns for each of 24 surface water inflow system management and substitute water price scenarios results show a rising cost of aquifer protection with more stressed climate scenarios to secure a sustained level of aquifer protection future challenges point to a need to assess economic performance of various water conservation measures as well as reducing costs of substitute water through measures such as technical advance in desalination recycling and reuse substitution of other resources for water better characterization of existing aquifers and development of new wellfields results also point to a
