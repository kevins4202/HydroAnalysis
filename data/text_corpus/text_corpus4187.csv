complex project with a high degree of uncertainty mainly during the early phases when the reservoir properties data and information are scarce an efficient production system development requires subsea layout design pipeline network platform design production planning and investment planning sahebi et al 2014 silva and guedes soares 2019 layout design decisions define the number of wells and facilities as well as the ideal location and allocation that is which well is assigned to which facility pipeline network decisions depend on operational and risk considerations silva et al 2019 leading to pipeline diameters and routing adjusted to the geographical topology on the other hand the platform s design depends on the intended capacity of its facility production planning investigates the production behaviour during a certain period and its associated uncertainty according to wang et al 2019 the scheduling of well production and water injection are also considered as production planning decisions as part of the investment planning the decision makers attempt to anticipate how profitable the whole project will turn out to be the development decisions related with investment planning facility allocation and pipeline network are addressed by devine and lesso 1972 frair and devine 1975 iyer and grossmann 1998 wang et al 2019 in addition the decisions involving the subsea layout design are also discussed in the literature ebadat and karimaghaee 2012 hong et al 2018 lucena et al 2014 silva and camponogara 2014 silva et al 2019 wang et al 2012 2014a 2014b 2016 zhang et al 2017 the approaches of rodrigues et al 2016 rosa et al 2018 and silva and guedes soares 2019 combine the strategic decisions regarding the subsea layout design facility allocation and investment planning a more comprehensive review of these approaches and their applications can be found in silva and guedes soares 2019 as uncertainties are large in the development of an oilfield they need to be taken into account in the decisions gu and gudmestad 2011 pacheco and vellasco 2009 and redutskiy 2017 describe three general types of uncertainties during the development of an oilfield mainly technical economic and reservoir uncertainties not many research works highlight the importance of incorporating the value of technological flexibility during the early stage of an oilfield development gu and gudmestad 2011 lin et al 2013 moreover the economic uncertainty has also been addressed by abid and kaffel 2009 aseeri et al 2004 luo and zhao 2012 tang et al 2017 which tackle mostly the uncertainties of crude price the operating costs and the rate of investment meanwhile the focus of the present research lies on the design of the production system under reservoir production uncertainty crucial decisions related with the design of production system are based on the prediction of the reservoir production which affects the overall project performance the earlier work of haugen 1996 investigates the investment planning decisions concerning the structure of the pipeline network and the production planning under the production uncertainty however the developed decision tool does not incorporate the subsea layout and platform design decisions the research group of grossman at carnegie mellon university have made contributions at the planning level of oilfield development the strategic decisions discussed by goel and grossmann 2004 goel et al 2006 tarhan et al 2009 and gupta and grossmann 2014 involve the planning of oil and gas infrastructures by selecting the field to be produced the capacity of the platforms and the pipeline network goel and grossmann 2004 and goel et al 2006 consider that the decisions are dependent of field size and oil deliverability uncertainties while the model developed by gupta and grossmann 2014 deals with two more uncertainties the water oil ratio and gas oil ratio the uncertainties indicated by tarhan et al 2009 are the initial oil flowrate recoverable oil and water breakthrough time goel et al 2006 provided a significant reduction in the size of the model developed by goel and grossmann 2004 implementing a lagrangean duality algorithm gupta and grossmann 2014 addressed the fluid composition as important uncertainty parameter to consider thus tarhan et al 2009 increase the complexity of the model approaching the uncertainties resolution over the time however the decision regarding the spatial location number and capacity of the subsea components were not accomplished by these methodologies chang et al 2015 defined a quality map under geological uncertainties representing the amount of oil in place to assist the investment and the production planning decisions of well placement and type of well i e vertical or horizontal moreover the approach developed by redutskiy 2017 deals with the reservoir production the production decline rate and the water breakthrough time uncertainties the model seeks to define the production operation and scheduling the pipeline network and the platform capacity nevertheless both papers do not discuss about the design decisions of subsea production system from the works presented above it is possible to affirm that the design planning of the production system under production uncertainty is an unexplored research topic in addition most of the models discussed do not integrate all the most important decisions regarding the production system the present work attempts to provide a mathematical approach to select the production system that maximizes the oil production and minimizes investments cost while meeting subsea layout platform design production and investment planning decisions in a scenario of production uncertainty the aim of the present paper is to develop a mixed integer linear programming milp extending the optimization methodology provided in the previous work of silva and guedes soares 2019 the new optimization tool searches for the minimum pipeline cost installation and expansion of platform capacity installation and size of manifold as well as the flowrate requirements in terms of volume conservation during a specified period the production planning is coupled with a more detailed reservoir dynamic metrics which also can include the production of gas and water assisting engineers at the strategic level of oilfield development to investigate the impact of the production uncertainty in the selection of a production system 2 materials and methods the prediction of the reservoir production the uncertainty assessment of the production and the decision making tool are key issues of the problem discussed in this section 2 1 review of predictive methods of the reservoir production predictive methods are developed based on different levels of knowledge details and computational effort three main methods of quantitative models are distinguished namely the empirical analytical and numerical modelling to simulate the reservoir behaviour cremon et al 2020 adopt the numerical modelling while rana et al 2018 and silva et al 2017 propose an alternative methodology as considered by the authors the uncertainties of the reservoir model result from the lack of information and data hence to mitigate these uncertainties the authors used the monte carlo simulation to generate random samples of important reservoir parameters from the above literature descriptions one may argue that the main disadvantages of reservoir simulation are the need of huge amounts of reservoir data and processor capability haugen 1996 and lund 2000 propose a general production performance based on the analytical modelling which entails three simple production phases whose uncertainties stem from different sources haugen 1996 assumes that each phase of production profile has an associated probability density in addition for each project a different production profile is established implying that all projects may be defined as uncertain alternatively lund 2000 considers the uncertainty of the reservoir data by associating a probability distribution to it tarhan et al 2009 use the analytical modelling to establish the production curve of a single well the authors highlight three uncertain parameters that affect the behaviour of the production curve the initial maximum flowrate the amount of recoverable oil and the water breakthrough time thus probability distributions are associated to each parameter the analytical models described above provide some advantages as requiring less reservoir data and information in addition the uncertainties are considered on the production phases and their parameters however the probabilistic approaches have not been supported by sufficient experimental data the empirical method of predicting the porosity of the reservoir is applied by karacan 2019 who estimates the average value of the porosity data according to a specific dataset and evaluates the uncertainty of the response and new measurements the empirical modelling increases the level of accuracy in the final result using data from analogous reservoirs to define a statistically based relationship the present paper combines the analytical and empirical modelling to predict the production level and to assess the uncertainty of the oilfield production life the main idea is to use the final production history from a collection of analogous nearby oilfields to evaluate the accuracy of the production decline curve a representative sample of production history offers real life data increasing the accuracy of the predictive approach 2 2 reservoir production performance the performance estimation of the reservoir production allows the setting up of technical concepts of field development which in turn feeds into the associated economic value net present value or profit of each project alternative the acquisition of additional reservoir data and information result in a better understanding of the reservoir behaviour most of the research works apply analytical methods predicting a general production profile of the reservoir along the entire oilfield life cycle the general profile provides a standard production behaviour which follows three simple stages build up plateau and decline even the approaches of haugen 1996 and lund 2000 which handle the production uncertainty of each production phases do not represent the real production performance of a reservoir fig 1 depicts the general production profile the respective production phases and uncertainties 2 2 1 production decline curve analysis the production decline curve analysis pdca is an analytical method used to predict the most probable well or reservoir life according to arps 1945 the pdca is normally used at the appraisal phase during the well test analysis at this project stage sufficient data are not available to perform the numerical reservoir simulations the flowrate and pressure data are collected for each day allowing the identification of the production decline trends the main idea is to extrapolate the trend of the production rate resulting it in a gentle curve toward the origin arps 1945 the decline curve analysis is a conventional method which mainly assumes that the past production performance drives the mathematical relationship of the estimated production life moreover it is also assumed that the method deals with an ideal case of a reservoir where the production decline laws are at a constant bottom hole pressure and in a complete boundary dominated flow period arps 1945 defines three types of decline curves namely exponential hyperbolic and harmonic curves in the exponential decline curve the production drops over a given constant interval in a fixed fraction of the production rate in the hyperbolic and harmonic decline curves the loss ratio is not constant and are governed by the b exponent which is considered as the first differential of the loss ratio whether the b exponent is greater than zero and lower than one the loss ratio assumes the hyperbolic decline thus when the b exponent equals one the loss ratio assumes the harmonic decline satter and iqbal 2016 present five main production parameters which are possible to evaluate using the arps decline curve analysis loss

steps gathering data normalizing data optimizing the decline curve parameters and assessing the uncertainty fig 2 presents the methodology steps a sample of production history of nearby oilfields establishes a reasonable database to define a statistically based relationship the data is normalized by the peak of the production as it is considered the beginning of the production decline phase additionally a short data period of the real production history is used to perform the optimization approach from the equations presented in section 2 3 only two parameters can be optimized the b exponent and the decline rate d for the exponential and harmonic curves the b exponent equals zero and one respectively as a result only the decline rate parameter can be adjusted for these two curves in the case of the hyperbolic decline curve both parameters can be optimized the value of each decline curve parameter that minimizes the error between the predicted data and the observed initial data is defined as the optimization criterion to evaluate each parameter four error measures are applied e g mean absolute error mea mean absolute percentage error mape mean squared error mse and root mean square error rmse using the optimized parameters the three decline curves are employed to forecast the production behaviour of each oilfield in the sample the decline curve that best fits the whole observed data is chosen for the next methodology step as part of the fourth step the uncertainty of each curve is assessed comparing the estimated production and the observed production data the mean absolute percentage error mape is the metric used to assess this uncertainty 2 4 production system optimization model the present paper extends the optimization approach provided by silva and guedes soares 2019 the previous optimization model works with a simple and static reservoir parameter which is the production plateau to demonstrate the reservoir behaviour therefore the aim of the new model is to integrate the production forecast with the facilities requirements and economic optimization the extension proposed is to include the dynamics of the oil production during a certain amount of time as well as the dynamics of the gas and water production nevertheless the other model assumptions are discussed in detail by silva and guedes soares 2019 and summarized below 1 the wells are considered geographically separated allowing the model to take the assignment decisions of each well directly to platform or connected by a manifold 2 the platform capacity stores a maximum oil production during a limited period 3 there are a maximum number of wells that can be connected to the manifolds 4 the pipeline routes are considered as straight lines assuming flexible jumpers 5 there are no topographic limitations to laying pipelines and manifolds 6 the pipeline supports are previously installed on the seafloor to raise and support the crossing pipe over the crossed pipe the proposed optimization model uses the linear equations to represent the problem and combines the continuous and discrete variables to assume values and decisions mixed integer linear programming milp the current milp model extends the group of main decision variables by including the production variables of oil gas and water flowrates during a certain amount of time and the cumulative production at the end of the production time the new conceptual milp model is structured as follows given 1 length of risers 2 maximum number of wells 3 volume of original hydrocarbon in place 4 maximum flowrate that manifolds can receive from the wells 5 constant price of oil barrel 6 cost of pipelines 7 cost of platform p of size s 8 cost of manifold m according to the slot capacity 9 manifold slot size 10 maximum platform capacity size as described in section 1 the present paper deals only with the uncertainty of reservoir predictions hence the price of the oil barrel and cost of the facilities are assumed as constant because it is influenced by political or market factors and considered as economic uncertainties preprocessing phase generates 1 distance between the touch down point of platform p

calculation the structure of the proposed methodology can be represented as an input output process due to an optimization model that aims to best use the scarce input resources to obtain the desired output a pre processing data phase is an important step to construct the data structure of the model the production rate and the assessment of the respective uncertainty is the most important parameter to be determined therefore the platform and manifold possible locations and the infrastructure distances are essential parameters for the implementation of the present model fig 3 represents the flowchart of the developed approach in accordance with the discussion presented in section 2 for the present work the methodology to estimate the production rate is performed by applying the empirical and analytical methods of reservoir production the empirical method aims to increase the level of accuracy of the analytical method in summary using the initial data of each production history in the sample of nearby oilfields the empirical method obtains the main parameters of each decline curve approaches analytical method finding the values that minimize the error between the predicted and observed data afterwards using these optimal parameters the analytical approach estimates the production decline curves of each oilfield in the sample the empirical method is applied again to assess the uncertainty between the predicted curves and the production histories as a result at the early step of a new oilfield development the uncertainty is used during the estimation of the decline production curve tables 1 4 provide the pseudo codes of the matlab routine to represent the main steps of the production estimation and uncertainty methodology a safety distance margin of the subsea layout is a requirement to locate the production facility aiming to prevent dropped objects to do not cause any structural failure on subsea equipment and components lu et al 2018 silva and guedes soares 2019 additionally the arithmetic mean of the coordinate of wells finds the centroid point of the well clustering division which results as a possible manifold location 58 c x x w 1 x w 2 x w n k 59 c y y w 1 y w 2 y w n k where x and y represent the x axis and y axis of a coordinate point and w means the well index moreover as the last parameter to be determined the infrastructure distances can be evaluated using the euclidian distance equation between the cartesian coordinates x y plane of the facilities 60 d i s t x y x i x j 2 y i y j 2 where i represents the set of end points and j the set of initial points after the pre processing data phase the mathematical model given in eqs 16 57 is implemented and processed using the ibm ilog cplex optimization studio environment 3 1 model verification in order to verify whether the solution provided by the model satisfies the specific constraints a small example is described in this section four wells two possible manifold locations and one platform location represents the development of a small production system the manifold number one can only be a two slots manifold and the manifold number two is a four slots manifold the only type of platform considered is a semi submersible where there are three available capacity sizes 15 000 bb d size one 20 000 bb d size two and 25 000 bbl d size three thus it is assumed that the costs of platform vary in accordance with the capacity which increases approximately 1 5 times from size one to three table 5 shown the calculated euclidian distances between the main infrastructures wells manifolds and touch down point of the platform fig 4 presents the oil production decline curve of each well for the first step of the model verification it is considered that all the wells start the production at the same time from the solution 1 presented in fig 5 the model chooses the clustered satellite well system as the optimal subsea layout guaranteeing the minimum distances thus reducing the pipeline cost table 6 summarizes the conservation of the oil production flowrate from wells to platform during the time accordingly it confirms that the manifold two m2 joints all the production from the wells and delivery to the platform thus the received flowrate at the platform did not exceed the chosen platform capacity of 20 000 bbl d s2 therefore there is no direct production from the wells to platform as a second step of the model verification consider that instead of 10 km between the well one w1 and the platform the distance is now only 1 km 1 km the new solution 2 fig 5 confirms what was discussed by silva and guedes soares 2019 that the one of the main benefits of the model is not to be closed into one subsea layout clustered satellite well system or satellite well system because now the model chooses to assign one well direct to the platform and clustered three wells w2 w3 and w4 using the manifold two m2 table 7 presents the new solution of the oil production flowrate variables and it is possible to verify that the total produced oil at the platform is the summation of the production directly assigned and the joint production of the manifold the analysis of the impact of the reservoir dynamics on the production system is an essential aspect to develop the strategic plan of the field accordingly for a new step of the model verification the effect of the schedule of well production is analysed the third step of the model verification assumes that the production of well one w1 starts only at time five considering that the distances between the infrastructures are the same as the verification step number two the subsea layout solution is the same as the solution 2 shown in fig 5 however as presented in table 8 the produced oil flowrate directly assigned from wells to platform differs from step two because the schedule of the production of well one starts at time five thus the peak of the oilfield production 15 259 00 bbl d is not at the first year of production as well as in step one and two for the present verification step the chosen capacity size is still the size two because the new peak of production at year five exceeds the capacity of size one 15 000 bbl d this solution can be presented as a strategy solution of the production plan attempting to develop the oilfield in different production phases besides considering the same infrastructure distances and the schedule of the oil production of well one w1 as presented in the step three the new step of the model verification estimates that for well one and two w1 and w2 there are production of gas and water during the field lifetime fig 6 shows the production rate of oil gas and water for the well 2 in comparison with the production of well one the only difference is due to the oil production rate of well one is scheduled to starts at time five the new solution presents a subsea layout equal to the solution 2 of fig 5 and the solution of the oil production variables are the same as presented in table 8 however the solution of the gas and water production variables is show in table 9 in accordance with the presented results it is possible to estimate the necessary capacity of gas and water at the platform and to note that the total produced gas and water at the platform is the summation of the directly assigned production of well one w1 and the joint production of manifold two m2 which clustered the well two w2 with the wells three and four w3 and w4 attempting to recognize the effect of the production uncertainty into the production system for the next step of the model verification implementing the uncertainty methodology presented in above three production scenarios are established predicted optimist and pessimist production curves fig 7 moreover it is assumed the same infrastructure distances as presented in step two and it is considered that all the production of wells starts at the beginning of the production life and there are no production of gas and water for each production scenario a new solution is encountered for all three solutions the subsea layout is the same as presented in fig 5 solution 2 the oil production variables of the predicted scenario are similar to table 7 being the amount of oil flowrate the only difference between the three production scenario table 10 and table 11 consequently the solution about the capacity size of the platform changes from size one 15 000 bbl d for the pessimist scenario size two 20 000 bbl d for the predicted scenario and size three for the optimist scenario 25 000 bbl d through the verification process it is possible to validate that all the requirements of the production system are satisfied in every solution presented the developed model as an extension of the model presented by silva and guedes soares 2019 improves the system level performance because integrates the dynamics of the reservoir during the field lifetime with the design of subsea and surface facilities 4 results and discussion the development of a new offshore oilfield is presented as a case scenario to implement the proposed methodology of uncertainty assessment and the mathematical tool moreover the respective results are presented and discussed 4 1 case study a hypothetical offshore oilfield located in brazil is the case study scenario to investigate the impact of the production uncertainty into the design of the production system a sample of production history from 20 post salt oilfields located in campos basin was collected to establish a reasonable database for uncertainty assessment the campos s basin is considered by the brazilian state controlled oil company as a mature basin that is in production for 52 years the main fluid in the hypothetical reservoir is the heavy oil meaning that as the production starts the single liquid phase remains liquid in other words there is no production of gas at the reservoir condition and no water influx acting as primary drive mechanism as the mean water depth of the oilfield location is 95 m the free hanging catenary was adopted as the riser configuration the riser is considered as flexible and the respective length is 114 m 1 2 times the value of the mean water depth was used for safety of all risers the predicted number of production wells is 10 and the well clustering division is evaluated for manifolds with 2 and 4 slots moreover only one possible platform location and type is considered nevertheless the standardized capacities of platforms are 40 000 50 000 and 70 000 bbl d the gross cost estimations of each floating and subsea infrastructure are presented in table 12 the wells and platform positions and possible manifolds locations are presented in fig 8 4 2 uncertainty assessment of the production decline curve analysis pdca in the sample of oilfields analysed some take longer time during the first oil to production decline which means a longer time in build up or plateau phase before the production starts to decline therefore as part of the second step of the methodology the data normalization is performed by the peak of the production a short period of each oilfield production data is used to optimize each decline curve parameter the b exponent and the decline rate d applying a matlab routine the results of the uncertainty assessment indicated that the exponential decline curve has a minimum mape in 11 oilfields therefore the mape average for the exponential curves equals 28 the average of the standard deviation was 25 and the average of the coefficient of variation was 90 in nine cases the minimum mape was achieved by the hyperbolic decline curve as a result the mape average the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation are 46 51 and 119 respectively moreover the harmonic decline curve does not predict curves with a minimum error as do the exponential and hyperbolic decline curves from the assessment analysis it is possible to note that there is a high uncertainty between the predicted and the observed data on one hand it is necessary to point out that the error evaluation is made point to point comparing each predicted and observed data resulting in a higher error on the other hand the decline curve estimates the production decline tendency and does not forecast the precise flowrate of each year of production moreover as described in section 2 2 1 when the research works adopt the decline curve analysis it is assumed that the future behaviour of the estimated curve will follow the decline trend of the past production performance therefore the method assumes a strictly empirical basis without planning any pressure maintenance of the reservoir along the production time or without preventing any production problems these assumptions make the results sometimes inferior or superior diverging of the real production of an oilfield fig 9 presents three cases from the sample of oilfields where the optimized parameters estimate a more precise decline tendency other three different cases are presented in fig 10 where the estimated production best fit the initial production data however when a new peak of production or an abrupt decline occurs in the real production data the decline curves do not overlap the production history as a result the exponential decline curve is applied on the gathered initial oil production data of the hypothetical oilfield the previously assessed uncertainty is applied in the predicted production decline curve to generate two more uncertainty scenarios the optimist and the pessimist production curves fig 11 presents the three estimated decline curves 4 3 mathematical model results and discussions only 12 years of production of each decline curve are used as input data for the mathematical model to reduce the computational effort the predicted optimist and pessimist production scenarios are evaluated table 13 summarizes the main features of the optimal solutions provided by the model including the cost results combinatorial size of the model and computational time the milp model is solved by the ibm ilog cplex studio optimization and ran in a workstation with 4 gb ram and pentium dual core of 3 ghz the optimal design solution of the production system for all scenarios defined one platform and two manifolds the manifolds of 4 slots clustered eight wells and two wells are directly assigned to the platform the subsea layout has the same infrastructures and spatial configuration because the distances of the wells the manifolds and the platform do not change for each production scenario the total cost of the subsea production system is also similar therefore the model defines different platform capacity ultimately oil recovery and project revenue for all three scenarios fig 12 presents the optimal subsea layout for all three scenarios for the predicted scenario the model determined that the capacity of the platform equals 50 000 bbl d the ultimately oil recovery of the entire production time is 377 million of barrels and the project revenue equals us 2 64 10 07 in addition for the optimist scenario the platform capacity changes to 70 000 bbl d the ultimately oil recovery increases to 473 million of barrels and the project revenue is approximately 1 3 times bigger than the predicted scenario for the pessimist scenario the model defines that the minimum platform capacity equals 40 000 bbl d the ultimately oil recovery decreases to 281 million of barrels and the project revenue is approximately 1 3 times lower than the predicted scenario see table 13 in this case study the model s variables named the cumulative gas production and the cumulative water production are equal to zero because the reservoir oil production is not influenced by the gas and or water production however for other scenario both variables can be considered of assistance to engineers the variables establish the total of gas and water produced in a defined period it allows the engineers to design the properly platform capacity for processing and storage the gas and water all production systems provided by the model are the most economic and technically feasible solutions of each evaluated scenario meeting all the constraints requirements in a reasonable timeframe the assessment of the production uncertainty and the integration of the production planning allows the model to search for the optimal design decisions concerning the number location assignment and capacity of facilities e g subsea and surface facilities while searching for the optimal investment planning of the capital costs of facilities and equipment the developed decision tool accomplished all the main decision of the production system considering the uncertainty about the production estimations the present approach improves the system level performance provided by silva and guedes soares 2019 and the described above research works another important discussion about the present work regards the comparison between the present model and the previous one provided by silva and guedes soares 2019 table 14 summarizes the main differences of the model structure and combinatorial results analysing the combinatorial results it is possible to note that the present model as an extension of the previous one directly increases the mathematical complexity when increases the number of variables constraints group set indexes and changes the objective function on one hand as presented in the combinatorial results of the previous case study tested table 14 the number of binary variables is greater due the higher number of wells and possible platform and manifold locations as the binary variables represent the decisions regarding platform and manifold installation and size as well as the well assignment to these facilities on the other hand due the insertion of the dynamic behaviour of the reservoir in terms of production of wells during time the new model presents higher number of other variables nonnegative variables the new model also results in a greater number of constraints mainly because of the insertion of a new constraint group set index of time and six new continuous variables to represent the production flow of the system therefore the new mathematical decision model demands greater computational time and effort to search for the optimal solution due to the complex combinatorial optimization structure 5 conclusions the proposed work provides a mathematical approach to select the production system that integrates the facilities requirements subsea layout platform design economic aspects maximization of the oil production and minimization of investments cost and production forecast in a scenario of production uncertainty the production estimation and the assessment of the respective uncertainty is the main contribution when comparing with the previous works the model verification process is also included as a subsection to highlight that the developed model improves the performance of the system level solution because integrates the dynamics of the reservoir during the field lifetime with the design of subsea and surface facilities the validation process allows to analyse the effect of the infrastructure distances into the subsea layout the scheduling of a well production as a strategic plan during the development of the production lifetime the production of gas and water when estimating the necessary capacity of gas and water at the platform and the production uncertainty into the production system a case study scenario is performed to implement the respective mathematical approach and uncertainty methodology the model solutions provide overall pictures of the production system without spending a huge computational effort and time the model defines the project revenue and infrastructure costs considering the decisions of technology selection facilities and wells assignments under production uncertainty analysing the structure of the developed model the only infrastructure that can suffer any impact with the production uncertainty is the platform system as the distances of the wells the manifolds and the platform do not change according to the uncertainty in the production life the subsea layout has the same infrastructures and spatial configuration besides the production uncertainty defines different total ultimately oil recovery varying the project revenue and the cost of platform in accordance with the chosen capacity therefore the present methodology advances the state of the art solutions due to the integration of all the main strategic production system decisions of platforms design and its subsea layout and the investment planning while considering the uncertainty about the production estimation credit authorship contribution statement l m r silva methodology formal analysis

complex project with a high degree of uncertainty mainly during the early phases when the reservoir properties data and information are scarce an efficient production system development requires subsea layout design pipeline network platform design production planning and investment planning sahebi et al 2014 silva and guedes soares 2019 layout design decisions define the number of wells and facilities as well as the ideal location and allocation that is which well is assigned to which facility pipeline network decisions depend on operational and risk considerations silva et al 2019 leading to pipeline diameters and routing adjusted to the geographical topology on the other hand the platform s design depends on the intended capacity of its facility production planning investigates the production behaviour during a certain period and its associated uncertainty according to wang et al 2019 the scheduling of well production and water injection are also considered as production planning decisions as part of the investment planning the decision makers attempt to anticipate how profitable the whole project will turn out to be the development decisions related with investment planning facility allocation and pipeline network are addressed by devine and lesso 1972 frair and devine 1975 iyer and grossmann 1998 wang et al 2019 in addition the decisions involving the subsea layout design are also discussed in the literature ebadat and karimaghaee 2012 hong et al 2018 lucena et al 2014 silva and camponogara 2014 silva et al 2019 wang et al 2012 2014a 2014b 2016 zhang et al 2017 the approaches of rodrigues et al 2016 rosa et al 2018 and silva and guedes soares 2019 combine the strategic decisions regarding the subsea layout design facility allocation and investment planning a more comprehensive review of these approaches and their applications can be found in silva and guedes soares 2019 as uncertainties are large in the development of an oilfield they need to be taken into account in the decisions gu and gudmestad 2011 pacheco and vellasco 2009 and redutskiy 2017 describe three general types of uncertainties during the development of an oilfield mainly technical economic and reservoir uncertainties not many research works highlight the importance of incorporating the value of technological flexibility during the early stage of an oilfield development gu and gudmestad 2011 lin et al 2013 moreover the economic uncertainty has also been addressed by abid and kaffel 2009 aseeri et al 2004 luo and zhao 2012 tang et al 2017 which tackle mostly the uncertainties of crude price the operating costs and the rate of investment meanwhile the focus of the present research lies on the design of the production system under reservoir production uncertainty crucial decisions related with the design of production system are based on the prediction of the reservoir production which affects the overall project performance the earlier work of haugen 1996 investigates the investment planning decisions concerning the structure of the pipeline network and the production planning under the production uncertainty however the developed decision tool does not incorporate the subsea layout and platform design decisions the research group of grossman at carnegie mellon university have made contributions at the planning level of oilfield development the strategic decisions discussed by goel and grossmann 2004 goel et al 2006 tarhan et al 2009 and gupta and grossmann 2014 involve the planning of oil and gas infrastructures by selecting the field to be produced the capacity of the platforms and the pipeline network goel and grossmann 2004 and goel et al 2006 consider that the decisions are dependent of field size and oil deliverability uncertainties while the model developed by gupta and grossmann 2014 deals with two more uncertainties the water oil ratio and gas oil ratio the uncertainties indicated by tarhan et al 2009 are the initial oil flowrate recoverable oil and water breakthrough time goel et al 2006 provided a significant reduction in the size of the model developed by goel and grossmann 2004 implementing a lagrangean duality algorithm gupta and grossmann 2014 addressed the fluid composition as important uncertainty parameter to consider thus tarhan et al 2009 increase the complexity of the model approaching the uncertainties resolution over the time however the decision regarding the spatial location number and capacity of the subsea components were not accomplished by these methodologies chang et al 2015 defined a quality map under geological uncertainties representing the amount of oil in place to assist the investment and the production planning decisions of well placement and type of well i e vertical or horizontal moreover the approach developed by redutskiy 2017 deals with the reservoir production the production decline rate and the water breakthrough time uncertainties the model seeks to define the production operation and scheduling the pipeline network and the platform capacity nevertheless both papers do not discuss about the design decisions of subsea production system from the works presented above it is possible to affirm that the design planning of the production system under production uncertainty is an unexplored research topic in addition most of the models discussed do not integrate all the most important decisions regarding the production system the present work attempts to provide a mathematical approach to select the production system that maximizes the oil production and minimizes investments cost while meeting subsea layout platform design production and investment planning decisions in a scenario of production uncertainty the aim of the present paper is to develop a mixed integer linear programming milp extending the optimization methodology provided in the previous work of silva and guedes soares 2019 the new optimization tool searches for the minimum pipeline cost installation and expansion of platform capacity installation and size of manifold as well as the flowrate requirements in terms of volume conservation during a specified period the production planning is coupled with a more detailed reservoir dynamic metrics which also can include the production of gas and water assisting engineers at the strategic level of oilfield development to investigate the impact of the production uncertainty in the selection of a production system 2 materials and methods the prediction of the reservoir production the uncertainty assessment of the production and the decision making tool are key issues of the problem discussed in this section 2 1 review of predictive methods of the reservoir production predictive methods are developed based on different levels of knowledge details and computational effort three main methods of quantitative models are distinguished namely the empirical analytical and numerical modelling to simulate the reservoir behaviour cremon et al 2020 adopt the numerical modelling while rana et al 2018 and silva et al 2017 propose an alternative methodology as considered by the authors the uncertainties of the reservoir model result from the lack of information and data hence to mitigate these uncertainties the authors used the monte carlo simulation to generate random samples of important reservoir parameters from the above literature descriptions one may argue that the main disadvantages of reservoir simulation are the need of huge amounts of reservoir data and processor capability haugen 1996 and lund 2000 propose a general production performance based on the analytical modelling which entails three simple production phases whose uncertainties stem from different sources haugen 1996 assumes that each phase of production profile has an associated probability density in addition for each project a different production profile is established implying that all projects may be defined as uncertain alternatively lund 2000 considers the uncertainty of the reservoir data by associating a probability distribution to it tarhan et al 2009 use the analytical modelling to establish the production curve of a single well the authors highlight three uncertain parameters that affect the behaviour of the production curve the initial maximum flowrate the amount of recoverable oil and the water breakthrough time thus probability distributions are associated to each parameter the analytical models described above provide some advantages as requiring less reservoir data and information in addition the uncertainties are considered on the production phases and their parameters however the probabilistic approaches have not been supported by sufficient experimental data the empirical method of predicting the porosity of the reservoir is applied by karacan 2019 who estimates the average value of the porosity data according to a specific dataset and evaluates the uncertainty of the response and new measurements the empirical modelling increases the level of accuracy in the final result using data from analogous reservoirs to define a statistically based relationship the present paper combines the analytical and empirical modelling to predict the production level and to assess the uncertainty of the oilfield production life the main idea is to use the final production history from a collection of analogous nearby oilfields to evaluate the accuracy of the production decline curve a representative sample of production history offers real life data increasing the accuracy of the predictive approach 2 2 reservoir production performance the performance estimation of the reservoir production allows the setting up of technical concepts of field development which in turn feeds into the associated economic value net present value or profit of each project alternative the acquisition of additional reservoir data and information result in a better understanding of the reservoir behaviour most of the research works apply analytical methods predicting a general production profile of the reservoir along the entire oilfield life cycle the general profile provides a standard production behaviour which follows three simple stages build up plateau and decline even the approaches of haugen 1996 and lund 2000 which handle the production uncertainty of each production phases do not represent the real production performance of a reservoir fig 1 depicts the general production profile the respective production phases and uncertainties 2 2 1 production decline curve analysis the production decline curve analysis pdca is an analytical method used to predict the most probable well or reservoir life according to arps 1945 the pdca is normally used at the appraisal phase during the well test analysis at this project stage sufficient data are not available to perform the numerical reservoir simulations the flowrate and pressure data are collected for each day allowing the identification of the production decline trends the main idea is to extrapolate the trend of the production rate resulting it in a gentle curve toward the origin arps 1945 the decline curve analysis is a conventional method which mainly assumes that the past production performance drives the mathematical relationship of the estimated production life moreover it is also assumed that the method deals with an ideal case of a reservoir where the production decline laws are at a constant bottom hole pressure and in a complete boundary dominated flow period arps 1945 defines three types of decline curves namely exponential hyperbolic and harmonic curves in the exponential decline curve the production drops over a given constant interval in a fixed fraction of the production rate in the hyperbolic and harmonic decline curves the loss ratio is not constant and are governed by the b exponent which is considered as the first differential of the loss ratio whether the b exponent is greater than zero and lower than one the loss ratio assumes the hyperbolic decline thus when the b exponent equals one the loss ratio assumes the harmonic decline satter and iqbal 2016 present five main production parameters which are possible to evaluate using the arps decline curve analysis loss

steps gathering data normalizing data optimizing the decline curve parameters and assessing the uncertainty fig 2 presents the methodology steps a sample of production history of nearby oilfields establishes a reasonable database to define a statistically based relationship the data is normalized by the peak of the production as it is considered the beginning of the production decline phase additionally a short data period of the real production history is used to perform the optimization approach from the equations presented in section 2 3 only two parameters can be optimized the b exponent and the decline rate d for the exponential and harmonic curves the b exponent equals zero and one respectively as a result only the decline rate parameter can be adjusted for these two curves in the case of the hyperbolic decline curve both parameters can be optimized the value of each decline curve parameter that minimizes the error between the predicted data and the observed initial data is defined as the optimization criterion to evaluate each parameter four error measures are applied e g mean absolute error mea mean absolute percentage error mape mean squared error mse and root mean square error rmse using the optimized parameters the three decline curves are employed to forecast the production behaviour of each oilfield in the sample the decline curve that best fits the whole observed data is chosen for the next methodology step as part of the fourth step the uncertainty of each curve is assessed comparing the estimated production and the observed production data the mean absolute percentage error mape is the metric used to assess this uncertainty 2 4 production system optimization model the present paper extends the optimization approach provided by silva and guedes soares 2019 the previous optimization model works with a simple and static reservoir parameter which is the production plateau to demonstrate the reservoir behaviour therefore the aim of the new model is to integrate the production forecast with the facilities requirements and economic optimization the extension proposed is to include the dynamics of the oil production during a certain amount of time as well as the dynamics of the gas and water production nevertheless the other model assumptions are discussed in detail by silva and guedes soares 2019 and summarized below 1 the wells are considered geographically separated allowing the model to take the assignment decisions of each well directly to platform or connected by a manifold 2 the platform capacity stores a maximum oil production during a limited period 3 there are a maximum number of wells that can be connected to the manifolds 4 the pipeline routes are considered as straight lines assuming flexible jumpers 5 there are no topographic limitations to laying pipelines and manifolds 6 the pipeline supports are previously installed on the seafloor to raise and support the crossing pipe over the crossed pipe the proposed optimization model uses the linear equations to represent the problem and combines the continuous and discrete variables to assume values and decisions mixed integer linear programming milp the current milp model extends the group of main decision variables by including the production variables of oil gas and water flowrates during a certain amount of time and the cumulative production at the end of the production time the new conceptual milp model is structured as follows given 1 length of risers 2 maximum number of wells 3 volume of original hydrocarbon in place 4 maximum flowrate that manifolds can receive from the wells 5 constant price of oil barrel 6 cost of pipelines 7 cost of platform p of size s 8 cost of manifold m according to the slot capacity 9 manifold slot size 10 maximum platform capacity size as described in section 1 the present paper deals only with the uncertainty of reservoir predictions hence the price of the oil barrel and cost of the facilities are assumed as constant because it is influenced by political or market factors and considered as economic uncertainties preprocessing phase generates 1 distance between the touch down point of platform p

parameter to be determined therefore the platform and manifold possible locations and the infrastructure distances are essential parameters for the implementation of the present model fig 3 represents the flowchart of the developed approach in accordance with the discussion presented in section 2 for the present work the methodology to estimate the production rate is performed by applying the empirical and analytical methods of reservoir production the empirical method aims to increase the level of accuracy of the analytical method in summary using the initial data of each production history in the sample of nearby oilfields the empirical method obtains the main parameters of each decline curve approaches analytical method finding the values that minimize the error between the predicted and observed data afterwards using these optimal parameters the analytical approach estimates the production decline curves of each oilfield in the sample the empirical method is applied again to assess the uncertainty between the predicted curves and the production histories as a result at the early step of a new oilfield development the uncertainty is used during the estimation of the decline production curve tables 1 4 provide the pseudo codes of the matlab routine to represent the main steps of the production estimation and uncertainty methodology a safety distance margin of the subsea layout is a requirement to locate the production facility aiming to prevent dropped objects to do not cause any structural failure on subsea equipment and components lu et al 2018 silva and guedes soares 2019 additionally the arithmetic mean of the coordinate of wells finds the centroid point of the well clustering division which results as a possible manifold location 58 c x x w 1 x w 2 x w n k 59 c y y w 1 y w 2 y w n k where x and y represent the x axis and y axis of a coordinate point and w means the well index moreover as the last parameter to be determined the infrastructure distances can be evaluated using the euclidian distance equation between the cartesian coordinates x y plane of the facilities 60 d i s t x y x i x j 2 y i y j 2 where i represents the set of end points and j the set of initial points after the pre processing data phase the mathematical model given in eqs 16 57 is implemented and processed using the ibm ilog cplex optimization studio environment 3 1 model verification in order to verify whether the solution provided by the model satisfies the specific constraints a small example is described in this section four wells two possible manifold locations and one platform location represents the development of a small production system the manifold number one can only be a two slots manifold and the manifold number two is a four slots manifold the only type of platform considered is a semi submersible where there are three available capacity sizes 15 000 bb d size one 20 000 bb d size two and 25 000 bbl d size three thus it is assumed that the costs of platform vary in accordance with the capacity which increases approximately 1 5 times from size one to three table 5 shown the calculated euclidian distances between the main infrastructures wells manifolds and touch down point of the platform fig 4 presents the oil production decline curve of each well for the first step of the model verification it is considered that all the wells start the production at the same time from the solution 1 presented in fig 5 the model chooses the clustered satellite well system as the optimal subsea layout guaranteeing the minimum distances thus reducing the pipeline cost table 6 summarizes the conservation of the oil production flowrate from wells to platform during the time accordingly it confirms that the manifold two m2 joints all the production from the wells and delivery to the platform thus the received flowrate at the platform did not exceed the chosen platform capacity of 20 000 bbl d s2 therefore there is no direct production from the wells to platform as a second step of the model verification consider that instead of 10 km between the well one w1 and the platform the distance is now only 1 km 1 km the new solution 2 fig 5 confirms what was discussed by silva and guedes soares 2019 that the one of the main benefits of the model is not to be closed into one subsea layout clustered satellite well system or satellite well system because now the model chooses to assign one well direct to the platform and clustered three wells w2 w3 and w4 using the manifold two m2 table 7 presents the new solution of the oil production flowrate variables and it is possible to verify that the total produced oil at the platform is the summation of the production directly assigned and the joint production of the manifold the analysis of the impact of the reservoir dynamics on the production system is an essential aspect to develop the strategic plan of the field accordingly for a new step of the model verification the effect of the schedule of well production is analysed the third step of the model verification assumes that the production of well one w1 starts only at time five considering that the distances between the infrastructures are the same as the verification step number two the subsea layout solution is the same as the solution 2 shown in fig 5 however as presented in table 8 the produced oil flowrate directly assigned from wells to platform differs from step two because the schedule of the production of well one starts at time five thus the peak of the oilfield production 15 259 00 bbl d is not at the first year of production as well as in step one and two for the present verification step the chosen capacity size is still the size two because the new peak of production at year five exceeds the capacity of size one 15 000 bbl d this solution can be presented as a strategy solution of the production plan attempting to develop the oilfield in different production phases besides considering the same infrastructure distances and the schedule of the oil production of well one w1 as presented in the step three the new step of the model verification estimates that for well one and two w1 and w2 there are production of gas and water during the field lifetime fig 6 shows the production rate of oil gas and water for the well 2 in comparison with the production of well one the only difference is due to the oil production rate of well one is scheduled to starts at time five the new solution presents a subsea layout equal to the solution 2 of fig 5 and the solution of the oil production variables are the same as presented in table 8 however the solution of the gas and water production variables is show in table 9 in accordance with the presented results it is possible to estimate the necessary capacity of gas and water at the platform and to note that the total produced gas and water at the platform is the summation of the directly assigned production of well one w1 and the joint production of manifold two m2 which clustered the well two w2 with the wells three and four w3 and w4 attempting to recognize the effect of the production uncertainty into the production system for the next step of the model verification implementing the uncertainty methodology presented in above three production scenarios are established predicted optimist and pessimist production curves fig 7 moreover it is assumed the same infrastructure distances as presented in step two and it is considered that all the production of wells starts at the beginning of the production life and there are no production of gas and water for each production scenario a new solution is encountered for all three solutions the subsea layout is the same as presented in fig 5 solution 2 the oil production variables of the predicted scenario are similar to table 7 being the amount of oil flowrate the only difference between the three production scenario table 10 and table 11 consequently the solution about the capacity size of the platform changes from size one 15 000 bbl d for the pessimist scenario size two 20 000 bbl d for the predicted scenario and size three for the optimist scenario 25 000 bbl d through the verification process it is possible to validate that all the requirements of the production system are satisfied in every solution presented the developed model as an extension of the model presented by silva and guedes soares 2019 improves the system level performance because integrates the dynamics of the reservoir during the field lifetime with the design of subsea and surface facilities 4 results and discussion the development of a new offshore oilfield is presented as a case scenario to implement the proposed methodology of uncertainty assessment and the mathematical tool moreover the respective results are presented and discussed 4 1 case study a hypothetical offshore oilfield located in brazil is the case study scenario to investigate the impact of the production uncertainty into the design of the production system a sample of production history from 20 post salt oilfields located in campos basin was collected to establish a reasonable database for uncertainty assessment the campos s basin is considered by the brazilian state controlled oil company as a mature basin that is in production for 52 years the main fluid in the hypothetical reservoir is the heavy oil meaning that as the production starts the single liquid phase remains liquid in other words there is no production of gas at the reservoir condition and no water influx acting as primary drive mechanism as the mean water depth of the oilfield location is 95 m the free hanging catenary was adopted as the riser configuration the riser is considered as flexible and the respective length is 114 m 1 2 times the value of the mean water depth was used for safety of all risers the predicted number of production wells is 10 and the well clustering division is evaluated for manifolds with 2 and 4 slots moreover only one possible platform location and type is considered nevertheless the standardized capacities of platforms are 40 000 50 000 and 70 000 bbl d the gross cost estimations of each floating and subsea infrastructure are presented in table 12 the wells and platform positions and possible manifolds locations are presented in fig 8 4 2 uncertainty assessment of the production decline curve analysis pdca in the sample of oilfields analysed some take longer time during the first oil to production decline which means a longer time in build up or plateau phase before the production starts to decline therefore as part of the second step of the methodology the data normalization is performed by the peak of the production a short period of each oilfield production data is used to optimize each decline curve parameter the b exponent and the decline rate d applying a matlab routine the results of the uncertainty assessment indicated that the exponential decline curve has a minimum mape in 11 oilfields therefore the mape average for the exponential curves equals 28 the average of the standard deviation was 25 and the average of the coefficient of variation was 90 in nine cases the minimum mape was achieved by the hyperbolic decline curve as a result the mape average the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation are 46 51 and 119 respectively moreover the harmonic decline curve does not predict curves with a minimum error as do the exponential and hyperbolic decline curves from the assessment analysis it is possible to note that there is a high uncertainty between the predicted and the observed data on one hand it is necessary to point out that the error evaluation is made point to point comparing each predicted and observed data resulting in a higher error on the other hand the decline curve estimates the production decline tendency and does not forecast the precise flowrate of each year of production moreover as described in section 2 2 1 when the research works adopt the decline curve analysis it is assumed that the future behaviour of the estimated curve will follow the decline trend of the past production performance therefore the method assumes a strictly empirical basis without planning any pressure maintenance of the reservoir along the production time or without preventing any production problems these assumptions make the results sometimes inferior or superior diverging of the real production of an oilfield fig 9 presents three cases from the sample of oilfields where the optimized parameters estimate a more precise decline tendency other three different cases are presented in fig 10 where the estimated production best fit the initial production data however when a new peak of production or an abrupt decline occurs in the real production data the decline curves do not overlap the production history as a result the exponential decline curve is applied on the gathered initial oil production data of the hypothetical oilfield the previously assessed uncertainty is applied in the predicted production decline curve to generate two more uncertainty scenarios the optimist and the pessimist production curves fig 11 presents the three estimated decline curves 4 3 mathematical model results and discussions only 12 years of production of each decline curve are used as input data for the mathematical model to reduce the computational effort the predicted optimist and pessimist production scenarios are evaluated table 13 summarizes the main features of the optimal solutions provided by the model including the cost results combinatorial size of the model and computational time the milp model is solved by the ibm ilog cplex studio optimization and ran in a workstation with 4 gb ram and pentium dual core of 3 ghz the optimal design solution of the production system for all scenarios defined one platform and two manifolds the manifolds of 4 slots clustered eight wells and two wells are directly assigned to the platform the subsea layout has the same infrastructures and spatial configuration because the distances of the wells the manifolds and the platform do not change for each production scenario the total cost of the subsea production system is also similar therefore the model defines different platform capacity ultimately oil recovery and project revenue for all three scenarios fig 12 presents the optimal subsea layout for all three scenarios for the predicted scenario the model determined that the capacity of the platform equals 50 000 bbl d the ultimately oil recovery of the entire production time is 377 million of barrels and the project revenue equals us 2 64 10 07 in addition for the optimist scenario the platform capacity changes to 70 000 bbl d the ultimately oil recovery increases to 473 million of barrels and the project revenue is approximately 1 3 times bigger than the predicted scenario for the pessimist scenario the model defines that the minimum platform capacity equals 40 000 bbl d the ultimately oil recovery decreases to 281 million of barrels and the project revenue is approximately 1 3 times lower than the predicted scenario see table 13 in this case study the model s variables named the cumulative gas production and the cumulative water production are equal to zero because the reservoir oil production is not influenced by the gas and or water production however for other scenario both variables can be considered of assistance to engineers the variables establish the total of gas and water produced in a defined period it allows the engineers to design the properly platform capacity for processing and storage the gas and water all production systems provided by the model are the most economic and technically feasible solutions of each evaluated scenario meeting all the constraints requirements in a reasonable timeframe the assessment of the production uncertainty and the integration of the production planning allows the model to search for the optimal design decisions concerning the number location assignment and capacity of facilities e g subsea and surface facilities while searching for the optimal investment planning of the capital costs of facilities and equipment the developed decision tool accomplished all the main decision of the production system considering the uncertainty about the production estimations the present approach improves the system level performance provided by silva and guedes soares 2019 and the described above research works another important discussion about the present work regards the comparison between the present model and the previous one provided by silva and guedes soares 2019 table 14 summarizes the main differences of the model structure and combinatorial results analysing the combinatorial results it is possible to note that the present model as an extension of the previous one directly increases the mathematical complexity when increases the number of variables constraints group set indexes and changes the objective function on one hand as presented in the combinatorial results of the previous case study tested table 14 the number of binary variables is greater due the higher number of wells and possible platform and manifold locations as the binary variables represent the decisions regarding platform and manifold installation and size as well as the well assignment to these facilities on the other hand due the insertion of the dynamic behaviour of the reservoir in terms of production of wells during time the new model presents higher number of other variables nonnegative variables the new model also results in a greater number of constraints mainly because of the insertion of a new constraint group set index of time and six new continuous variables to represent the production flow of the system therefore the new mathematical decision model demands greater computational time and effort to search for the optimal solution due to the complex combinatorial optimization structure 5 conclusions the proposed work provides a mathematical approach to select the production system that integrates the facilities requirements subsea layout platform design economic aspects maximization of the oil production and minimization of investments cost and production forecast in a scenario of production uncertainty the production estimation and the assessment of the respective uncertainty is the main contribution when comparing with the previous works the model verification process is also included as a subsection to highlight that the developed model improves the performance of the system level solution because integrates the dynamics of the reservoir during the field lifetime with the design of subsea and surface facilities the validation process allows to analyse the effect of the infrastructure distances into the subsea layout the scheduling of a well production as a strategic plan during the development of the production lifetime the production of gas and water when estimating the necessary capacity of gas and water at the platform and the production uncertainty into the production system a case study scenario is performed to implement the respective mathematical approach and uncertainty methodology the model solutions provide overall pictures of the production system without spending a huge computational effort and time the model defines the project revenue and infrastructure costs considering the decisions of technology selection facilities and wells assignments under production uncertainty analysing the structure of the developed model the only infrastructure that can suffer any impact with the production uncertainty is the platform system as the distances of the wells the manifolds and the platform do not change according to the uncertainty in the production life the subsea layout has the same infrastructures and spatial configuration besides the production uncertainty defines different total ultimately oil recovery varying the project revenue and the cost of platform in accordance with the chosen capacity therefore the present methodology advances the state of the art solutions due to the integration of all the main strategic production system decisions of platforms design and its subsea layout and the investment planning while considering the uncertainty about the production estimation credit authorship contribution statement l m r silva methodology formal analysis

20936,numerical simulation of a far field underwater explosion undex and its interaction with a large ship structure is a computationally intensive task requiring the discretization of a large fluid domain this paper explores surrogate non numerical approaches to approximate surface ship structural response to far field undex based on a now classic shock factor approach proposed by keil keil 1961 instead of the entire time domain history this work focuses on peak structural responses which may provide valuable information to guide equipment arrangement in early stage ship design to minimize shock effects the shock factor response equation as proposed by keil is refined to improve its performance in predicting peak structural responses at different locations in the ship this refinement is accomplished by a regression analysis using ship structural responses obtained from numerical simulation and their corresponding shock factor values the results show that the refined relationship between shock factor and peak structural response is promising as a result the shock factor may be employed to approximate peak structural response also the feasibility of using an analytical model to obtain data for regression in replacement of the numerical model is assessed lastly an application example using the shock factor is presented keywords undex early stage ship design surrogate model shock factor statistical analysis 1 introduction underwater explosion undex events can be generally classified as near field and far field in near field undex the explosive is large and sufficiently close to the ship hull that large plastic deformation and potential rupture are induced by the shock wave and explosion gas bubble since the energy is mostly absorbed by the hull through deformation the destructive effect is typically local but severe in far field undex where the explosive is located far enough from the ship and or the charge weight is small the structural deformation is elastic and the major undex effect comes from the shock wave and its impact on personnel and equipment inside the ship although no plastic deformation occurs a significant amount of energy is passed into the ship as a stress wave causing sudden motion of structural foundations where critical equipment may be installed keil 1961 another assumption of the far field undex is that the propagation speed of the shock wave has become constant and thus can be treated as a linear acoustic wave with a discontinuous profile this assumption holds true beyond 2 3 charge radii from the charge center costanzo 2011 far field undex also creates local cavitation caused by the inward motion of plate panel under shock and bulk cavitation caused by the reflection of the shock wave from the free surface in this work we focus on this far field undex problem in order to assess the vulnerability of surface ships to far field undex shock trials are sometimes conducted to understand the structural response to various shocks at different locations onboard due to the expensive and environmentally unfriendly nature of shock trials and their very limited value in early stage design recent attention has been largely given to the numerical simulation of the undex events koli et al 2020 liu et al 2018 lu and brown 2019a wu et al 2019 these investigations attempt to capture the shock wave and cavitation by numerical discretization approaches such as finite element method and discontinuous galerkin method however despite their high accuracy numerical simulations can be computationally expensive and require detail not available in early stage design ship concept exploration requires the consideration of potentially thousands of designs at a very limited level of detail using a numerical model to investigate undex shock effects in each design variant is difficult or impossible in related early studies peak structural response has been used as a metric to quantify the level of shock response of the ship structure e g bradbeer and andrews 2012 e w clements 1972 in early stage ship design peak structural response may provide useful information to guide equipment arrangement location although researchers are trying to make numerical simulation more efficient e g lu and brown 2019b shin 2004 sprague and geers 2006 non numerical methods can provide a reasonable approach until more effective and efficient methods are available keil 1961 proposed a conceptual shock factor as a function of charge weight orientation relative to the ship distance from the ship ship type onboard location and installation type his expression is based on the energy density in the shock wave arriving at the ship hull keil stated that the structural velocity response can be linearly scaled by this shock factor later the shock factor was simplified to be only a function of charge weight and charge location and commonly used to quantify the shock severity on surface ships under different shock attacks jin and ding 2011 liang and tai 2006 o hara and cunniff 1993 reid 1996 zhang et al 2011 similar structural response magnitude is expected given the same shock factor value modifications of the shock factor have been made to cater more specific applications zhang zhang and jiang 2015 proposed a modified shock factor for small cylindrical objects to account for the shock wave scattering effect yao yao et al 2009 extended the original shock factor which is only applicable to plane shock wave to be used for spherical shock wave by calculating the shock energy sheltered by the structure based on the geometry of shock wave and structure this extended shock factor is validated in a cylindrical shell problem where similar structural response magnitude is found under equal shock factor conditions it was adopted by guo guo et al 2017 2019 for more complicated ship structures in a most recent study hu hu et al 2020 improved sheltered shock energy calculation to better quantify the shock energy variation along the widths of the structure an air backed plate is used to validate the shock factor by hu and a proportional relationship between the structural response and the shock factor was found despite the aforementioned modifications the shock factors nowadays still mainly serve as a metric to quantify the shock severity and compare the magnitude of global structural response under different shock attacks the generalized shock factor originally conceptualized by keil for the surface ship that can be used to scale and thus predict local structural responses at different locations throughout the ship has never been fully explored which is the key motivation of this study in order to evaluate the potential linear relationship between the surface ship structural response and the shock factor regression analyses are performed in this work a coupled fluid structure interaction fsi solver employing a cavitating acoustic spectral element case fluid solver and an abaqus structural solver built by lu and brown 2019a is used to collect structural response data for regression this fsi solver has been validated in two canonical undex benchmark problems with analytical solutions i e a bleich sandler problem bleich and sandler 1970 and an underwater spherical shell problem zhang and geers 1993 and cross verified with the abaqus structural acoustic solver in the surface ship configuration assessed in this paper lu and brown 2019a 2019b in this work the scattered field formulation of the case approach is used in which case an analytical pressure profile of the incident shock wave is imposed as boundary condition on the structure wetted surface and the scattered field is numerically solved for although more efficient than its counterparts the case fluid solver is still computationally expensive if used to run a large number of cases g i taylor 1941 proposed one of the first analytical schemes to model the fsi effect for a structure interacting with an underwater shock wave specifically an infinite air backed rigid plate under plane shock wave impact is analyzed the fluid domain is modeled by assuming it is perfectly acoustic and thus the effect of the fluid can be prescribed as a structural boundary condition this taylor plate model is much faster than numerical models which require spatial discretization of the fluid domain the taylor plate model has been used to build simplified models to calculate the momentum transmission and fsi effect of a sandwich plate under shock impact e g fleck and deshpande 2004 mcshane et al 2010 the taylor plate model was also extended to a water backed plate by liu liu and young 2008 to understand the shock response of a submerged structure it is used to study undex effects on a rigid floating shock platform fsp by sebert 1984 with results compared to experimental data reasonable results for the velocity time history were obtained in the first few milliseconds after which the taylor plate solution deteriorates because of the inception of cavitation making the fluid no longer entirely acoustic the taylor plate model is usually not used for underwater explosion simulations due to the existence of more sophisticated numerical models however the peak response often occurs in the early time of the response possibly making the need to use more sophisticated models unnecessary mathew 2018 compared the structural velocity response of an elastic fsp obtained using the taylor plate model to results using the case fluid solver excellent agreement is found in the structural velocity response for the first few milliseconds however this performance cannot be generalized for surface ships which are much larger and more structurally complex if the peak structural response when the taylor plate model is employed in surface ships is sufficient to generate data for regression the numerical fluid model e g case which consumes more computational resources and time could be replaced once keil s linear relationship for one ship design is established it may be applicable to similar ships therefore numerical or taylor plate analyses may only be required for a single baseline design for significantly different designs additional numerical or taylor plate analyses would likely be required making the possible use of the taylor plate approach even more advantageous in the following sections we first present the shock factor formulation for peak structural response then the assumed linear relationship is determined and assessed using two benchmark problems with the structural response data generated using the case abaqus coupled fsi solver then the feasibility of replacing the case fluid model with the taylor plate model is evaluated finally an application example of the shock factor is presented 2 shock factor and modifications in section 2 1 the original shock factor defined by keil 1961 and an approach to improve correlation with peak velocity response is described the idea of the shock factor is then extended in section 2 2 to consider peak acceleration response which is another essential factor to quantify shock severity the shock factor introduced in this section is devised only for the far field undex where only linear elastic response occurs no plastic damage also it is assumed that the peak structural response is not affected by the local cavitation which is triggered after the structure is displaced to a certain extent 2 1 peak velocity shock factor in the original description keil defined shock factor as 1 s f 0 x c w w 1 2 r 0 c o s θ 0 to describe the shock wave energy density applied on the ship hull surface x c and w represent the charge center and charge weight r 0 is the distance from the charge to a reference point x 0 on the ship usually defined at mid keel by keil and others and θ 0 is the orientation of charge relative to the reference point x 0 see fig 1 the velocity profile of the ship structure at a particular structural point i is expressed as 2 v i t c v t s f 0 x c w where c is a linear coefficient depending on ship type onboard location and installation type v t is a normalized velocity profile assuming the ship type and installation type are fixed c only varies with location thus the peak velocity at the structural point i is only proportional to the shock factor s f 0 calculated at a specified reference point 3 v i p e a k v p e a k c i s f 0 x c w where v p e a k is the peak velocity of the normalized velocity profile v t and c i is the linear coefficient at the point i to better understand and apply this equation we present a possible derivation of the shock factor which is missing from the original keil s paper based on the empirical formulation by cole 1948 the energy density of the shock wave front normal to the hull surface can be expressed as 4 e f 1 ρ c p t c o s θ 2 d t κ w 1 3 w 1 3 r γ cos 2 θ where κ and γ are constant coefficients given in cole 1948 κ 2 41 e 3 and γ 2 05 for tnt ρ and c are the fluid density and sound speed which are then blended into κ θ is the angle between the shock wave propagation direction and the inward pointing normal of the hull surface and r is the distance from the charge center to the point on the hull the energy that enters the ship is assumed to be a constant fraction of the total wave energy and thus the energy density could be expressed as μ e f for a rigid body if the initial velocity is zero its peak velocity can be expressed as v p e a k 2 e m where e is the energy acting on the body and m is the body mass based on a simple kinetic energy definition e 1 2 m v 2 assuming the structure is locally rigid combining this expression with eq 4 and plugging in γ the peak velocity at a specific structural point i on the external submerged hull surface may be approximated by 5 v i p e a k 2 s i μ e f m i 2 s i μ κ m i w 1 016 r i 1 025 c o s θ i 2 s i μ κ m i w r i c o s θ i where m i is proposed as the effective mass or inertia for point i and s i is the effective area to convert the energy density to energy if θ i 90 the peak velocity v i p e a k would become zero however this is not physically correct since the wave still excites the structure at a glancing angle to account for the transient wave excitation when the shock wave is oblique large θ i the angle function in eq 5 is modified as in keil 1961 6 v i p e a k 2 s i μ κ m i w r i η 1 η c o s θ i where η is a constant coefficient to be determined from experiment the modified angle function is designed such that it does not become zero at glancing angle θ i 90 and reverts back to 1 at normal angle θ i 0 defining a velocity shock factor as 7 s f i x c w w r i η 1 η c o s θ i based on the location of the structural point i and with l i 2 s i μ κ m i eq 6 becomes 8 v i p e a k l i s f i based on the derivation the reference point where r i and θ i are defined should be based on the location of the structural point i instead of being a single point x 0 for all structural points as in the original shock factor see fig 1 in the modified shock factor used hereafter the reference point x 0 i is defined depending on the location of the individual structural point i for a structural point on the hull surface the reference point coincides with the structural point itself for the points on the inner bottom and decks above the selection of hull reference points is proposed and discussed in section 2 3 the peak velocity v i p e a k at structural point i may be estimated by the shock factor s f i once the linear coefficient l i is determined 2 2 peak acceleration shock factor following the example of the velocity shock factor derivation described in section 2 1 the acceleration shock factor is defined if the peak acceleration is desired the peak pressure p m similitude expression found in cole 1948 is used 9 p m ε w 1 3 r τ where ε and τ are constant coefficients given in cole 1948 ε 2 16 e 4 and τ 1 13 for tnt and p m is the peak pressure of the shock wave the maximum nodal force acting on structural point i can be estimated by 10 f i m p i m s i s i ε w 1 3 r i τ η 1 η c o s θ i where s i is the effective area of point i to convert nodal pressure to nodal force the definition of r i θ i and η follows that in section 2 1 the peak acceleration a i p e a k at the structural point i becomes 11 a i p e a k f i m m i s i ε m i w 1 3 r i τ η 1 η c o s θ i assuming the structure is locally rigid defining the acceleration shock factor as 12 s f a i x c w w 1 3 r i τ η 1 η c o s θ i and with q i s i ε m i the peak acceleration at the structural point i can be estimated as 13 a i p e a k q i s f a i linear coefficients l i and q i can then be determined via linear curve fitting using the structural response results and the shock factor values the derivation of the peak velocity and acceleration expression in eq 5 and eq 11 relies on the assumption that the structure is rigid which aligns with the original shock factor proposed by keil while this assumption deviates from the realistic situation where elastic structural deformation is present it does allow us to estimate the peak response with an analytical expression of the shock factor since the deformation is typically small within elastic regime in the far field undex problem the strain energy stored in the deformation may be insignificant compared to the kinetic energy the effect of this assumption on the performance of the shock factor will be discussed in section 3 2 3 categorizing the structural locations for clarity a point on the ship hull bottom has been used as an example to derive the shock factor in sections 2 1 and 2 2 however equipment sensitive to shock may be located throughout the ship the shock response can vary significantly between decks hwee and jeremy 2013 even on the same deck the response is different for instance the inner bottom location on top of the longitudinal girder or floor see fig 2 is vertically connected directly to the hull surface which is directly exposed to the fluid shock excitation as a result the structural response in this location shows an almost immediate kick off motion as soon as the fluid shock wave arrives followed by a rebound and oscillation caused by the local cavitation the oscillation is then gradually damped by the fluid however away from the primary structural members the structure is not vertically connected to the hull surface the stress wave path instead comes from the side hull and adjacent bulkhead horizontally within the same grillage due to the longer and more complicated stress wave path the energy load that reaches the structure is significantly smaller because of this and the smaller vertical stiffness the kick off motion is not as strong and instantaneous as at the location supported by primary structural members on the decks above the inner bottom the stress wave path is even more complicated due to the greater distance from the fluid the fluid damping barely affects the damping on the decks above which leads to prolonged oscillation the points on the decks above the inner bottom can also be categorized into the locations supported by longitudinal girders or frames and locations only supported by regular stiffeners since the response pattern can be different due to the different stiffness hereafter we call locations supported by primary structural members i e girders floors frames primary locations and those supported only by secondary structural members plates and stiffeners secondary locations due to the different response features and excitation paths at these different characteristic locations they are treated separately in terms of evaluating the linear relationship between the shock factor and the peak structural response referring to eq 5 and fig 1 the reference point x 0 i can be defined depending on where the structural point is on the hull surface the hull reference point shares the same location as the structural point because the structure is directly exposed to fluid the internal structural points however are indirectly excited as mentioned before a variation of the shock factor prediction model eq 8 and eq 13 may be defined as 14 v i p e a k j 1 n l i j s f j 15 a i p e a k j 1 n q i j s f a j to estimate the peak response of structural point i by a linear combination of the shock factor at the reference points in eq 14 and eq 15 i denotes the structural point n is the number of hull reference points represented by j and l i j and q i j are linear coefficients the reference points may be chosen at the intersection of deck hull surface and bulkhead where the majority of the shock wave enters the ship see fig 3 in this work we use a simpler and more physics based approach which defines a few hull reference points in the vicinity of the internal structural point i the shock factors on the reference points are interpolated to form the final shock factor s f i for the structural point i the hull reference points are defined at the locations where the stress wave paths intersect with the hull surface the intersection is assumed to be the direct path point where the shock wave that reaches the internal structural point enters the ship since an internal point might be excited by more than one wave paths there can be several reference points to demonstrate the selection of reference points for shock factor calculation at different characteristic locations a ship section bounded by two bulkheads is used for demonstration fig 5 to fig 8 in sections 2 3 1 to 2 3 4 the decks are numbered as shown in fig 4 the selection of reference points for these different cases was largely guided and assessed by their ability to achieve the best correlation between the shock factor function prediction result and the actual numerical results 2 3 1 deck 4 primary location for the deck 4 inner bottom primary location see fig 5 the hull surface point vertically connected to the structural point by girder floor is used as one of the reference points point 3 to account for the shock wave entering horizontally into the deck two points on the hull surface with the same longitudinal location as the structural point are used as the reference point as well point 1 2 the stress wave path is shown in red dotted line the resultant shock factor on structural point i is calculated by inverse distance interpolation of the shock factor s f j on the reference points 16 s f i j 1 3 h j s f j j 1 3 h j 17 h j 1 h j where h j is the distance from the reference point j to the structural point i and h j is the interpolation weight 2 3 2 deck 4 secondary location for structure points not on the primary structural parts see fig 6 the load path is more complicated the reference points in the transverse direction point 1 2 are defined as the same as the primary location since the bulkhead tends to be stiffer than the floors and thus carries more energy load the reference point in the longitudinal direction is chosen on the intersection of bulkhead and hull surface point 3 4 note that h 3 and h 4 consider the distance traveled on both the bulkhead and the deck 2 3 3 deck 3 primary and secondary location for the deck 3 first deck above the inner bottom shown in fig 7 both the primary and secondary locations share the same set of reference points which is defined similarly to the inner bottom secondary location because the structural point is not directly connected to the hull surface vertically 2 3 4 deck 2 primary and secondary location for the deck 3 we assume that the waterline is above the deck as a result the reference point 1 and 2 are directly exposed to the shock wave from the surrounding fluid however if the deck is above the waterline the wave path is slightly different the deck 2 second deck above the inner bottom shown in fig 8 serves as an example when the deck is above the waterline in this case the transverse reference points point 1 2 on the side hull shell are located on the uppermost submerged lower deck for the rest of the decks above the free surface the rules of reference point selection follow the deck 2 therefore we focus on validating the linear relationship between the shock factor and peak structural response on deck 2 deck 3 and deck 4 in this research 3 assessment of shock factor in this section the linear relationship between the shock factor described in section 2 and the structural peak response is determined and assessed by statistical regression in two undex problems specifically the shock factor prediction model in eq 8 peak velocity or eq 13 peak acceleration are fitted to the structural peak responses and the corresponding shock factor values the abaqus case coupled fsi solver is used to generate the structural response data for regression the strength of the linear relationship is quantified by the coefficient of determination 18 r 2 1 i y i f i 2 i y i y 2 100 where y i is the actual response y is the mean actual response f i is the predicted response it shows how well the predicted response by the fitted shock factor prediction model correlates with the actual simulation data therefore high r 2 reflects a strong linear relationship between the structural peak response and the shock factor once the l i and q i are obtained with satisfactory r 2 eq 8 and eq 13 can be used to predict the peak response for any charge configuration i e charge location and charge weight 3 1 bleich sandler problem in this section we test the validity of the modified shock factor using a bleich sandler problem which involves an air backed rigid plate under plane incident shock wave attack with a step exponential pressure profile see fig 9 for the plate and fluid domain 19 p i x t p m e x p t x x f c τ c h t x x f c where p m is the peak pressure calculated by eq 9 c is the sound speed τ c is the decay constant which depends on charge weight and distance from the charge center similitude equation available in cole 1948 x f is the location of the wave front where p m and τ c are defined and h represents the heaviside function the plate is 0 1 m in length and width and weights 144 kg the fluid domain is 3 8 m in depth with a non reflective boundary nrb at the domain bottom the plate is free to move with no boundary constraint the detailed numerical simulation case setup can be found in lu and brown 2019a the bleich sandler problem can be considered as a simplified undex problem six charge cases are used to generate the data for regression the charges are put at a depth ranging from 40 m to 15 m with a 5 m interval the charge weight is set as 27 2 kg 60 lb the peak velocity and acceleration are obtained for each charge configuration the plate velocity and acceleration response time history under the first charge is shown in fig 10 as an example the plate is first kicked off by the shock wave the maximum velocity zero acceleration is reached as the shock wave is almost past and the gradually decreasing fluid pressure due to the upward plate motion and plate gravity sum to a zero total force on the plate cavitation is generated below the plate as the total fluid pressure drops below vapor pressure the velocity and acceleration shock factor prediction model eq 8 and eq 13 are fitted to the shock factor values calculated from the charge weight and charge distance to the plate and the peak structural responses collected from the simulation the coefficients l i and q i are obtained by the linear curve fitting η in the shock factor expression eq 7 and eq 12 is set to 0 since the direction of the plane shock wave in this problem is normal to the plate the fitting results are shown in fig 11 where the x and y axes represent the actual response and the predicted response calculated by the fitted eq 8 and eq 13 with l i 13 2 m s and q i 507226 2 m s 2 the data points represent the structure response to the five charges if all the data points fall on the diagonal line red on the actual by prediction plot the fitted model perfectly predicts the actual data which implies r 2 100 fig 11 shows the peak structural velocity and the acceleration response are well predicted by the fitted shock factor prediction model this reflects a strong linear relationship between the peak velocity and peak acceleration and their corresponding shock factor which is further supported by the calculated r 2 value shown in table 1 the almost perfect behavior of the shock factor in the bleich sandler case can be attributed to the fact that the plate is rigid which agrees with the assumption of eq 5 and eq 11 also it suggests that the cavitation does not affect the peak structural response which provides more confidence for the surface ship case assessed in the next section at least for hull surface panels 3 2 ship problem in this section the linear relationship between the peak structural response and the shock factor is assessed in a surface ship undex problem the surface ship model is 143 m in length 21 m in width and 14 m in depth with 8 decks and 12 bulkheads floors girders and frames are arranged every 2 m each continuous plate is stiffened every 0 8 m see fig 2 for structural part visualization linear elastic material with a density of 7831 k g m 3 and young s modulus of 204 1 gpa is used for the ship structure 30 charges with different weights and locations in the far field regime i e over 2 3 charge radii to the hull are selected using a latin hypercube approach and placed around the hull see fig 12 the ship is under the impact of spherical incident shock wave with a step exponential pressure profile 20 p i x t p m e x p t r r f c τ c h t r r f c where r is the distance from the charge center to location x and r f is the distance from the charge center to the wave front where p m and τ c are defined the ship is free to move without boundary constraints during the fsi process fluid nodal force and structural displacement are exchanged on the coupling surface more details about the case setup for the numerical simulation can be found in lu and brown 2019b the structural response time history of 30 ms from when the shock wave first touches the ship hull is sampled at a number of points at primary fig 13 a c e and secondary locations fig 13 b d f throughout the ship in addition to the time history the frequency response is also sampled using a shock response spectrum srs the srs is a plot of the peak response of a system of single dof spring mass oscillators with various natural frequencies to the shock input it reflects how equipment with different natural frequencies would respond to the shock the velocity and acceleration shock factor prediction models eq 8 and eq 13 are fitted to the shock factor values and the peak structural responses collected from the simulation at each sampled point the coefficient η is set to be 0 2 in the shock factor expression eq 7 and eq 12 because it systematically yields the strongest linear correlation between the peak structural response and the shock factors since the spherical shock wave generated by the sampled 30 charges covers almost all possible attack angles the chosen η in this work may serve as a guideline for future investigations nevertheless readers are encouraged to calibrate it themselves when conducting similar studies to assess the degree of linear relationship an average r 2 comparing the actual and predicted values of all the sampled points at each characteristic location is calculated the charge and sampled structural point parameters can be found in appendix a 3 2 1 velocity shock factor first the predicted results of fitting the modified velocity shock factor prediction model eq 8 to the time history peak velocities and the velocity shock factor are presented the actual by prediction plots for the sampled primary points on deck 4 inner bottom are shown as an example fig 14 data points on each location plot represent the response of 30 charge cases the averaged r 2 values of the sampled points for each characteristic location are listed in table 2 the fitting results using the original shock factor eq 1 with the midship keel point as the reference point are also presented in fig 15 and table 2 for comparison as reflected by the r 2 in table 2 second column the original shock factor barely correlates with the peak structural velocity negative r 2 indicates the fitted model is worse than using the mean value based on eq 18 which is anticipated due to its fixed reference point given the poor behavior of the original shock factor we only focus on the modified shock factor hereafter the relationship between the modified shock factor and the peak velocity is not perfectly linear as in the bleich sandler problem because the structure is no longer rigid as assumed by eq 5 and the structure is more complicated than a single plate nevertheless the linearity is overall strong with r 2 75 which justifies the validity of the rigid structure assumption among all the characteristic locations the structural responses at the deck 4 primary locations have the strongest linear relationship with the shock factor among all the characteristic locations the relationship becomes significantly weaker at the deck 4 secondary locations this is because the primary locations are directly excited by the fluid shock wave via the girders floors vertically connected to the hull surface whereas the secondary locations are excited by a more complicated wave path from the edges of the grillage the wave path plotted in fig 6 is only one of the routes the wave may take in the structure for instance the wave can also keep propagating upward when it reaches the intersection between the bulkhead and deck 4 as a result the shock factor does not estimate the shock wave energy at the secondary location as accurately as at the primary location the weaker linear relationship at the secondary location may also be caused by the smaller stiffness which allows more shock energy to transform into the strain energy on deck 2 and deck 3 decks above the inner bottom the r 2 of the primary and secondary locations is not as high as their counterparts on deck 4 which may again be explained by the less accurate shock factor energy estimation due to a longer and more complex wave path next the velocity shock response spectrum srs is calculated using the data response time history as input after plotting the srs velocity responses to all the test charge cases it is found that the peak response happens at approximately the same frequency see fig 16 for the srs plot at an example structural point to assess the strength of the linear relationship between the srs peak velocity and the shock factor linear regression is performed as before the actual by prediction plot for the deck 4 primary location sampled points is shown in fig 17 the regression result in table 3 shows a similar trend to the time history peak velocity result in table 2 but with slightly lower r 2 weaker linear relationship the peak response in srs is also subject to the influence of the local cavitation generated after the shock wave passes because the srs is calculated using the entire 30 ms response time history therefore the velocity shock factor prediction model eq 8 does not approximate the srs peak velocity as well as the time history peak velocity despite this the correlation between the predicted result and the actual result is still significant in design applications a linearly rise to the maximum response from the response at the first sample frequency of the same profile that yields the max response and then flat profile solid red line in fig 16 envelopes the entire srs and could serve as an equipment design spectrum with the natural frequency either from modal analysis or induction from the actual simulation data a design spectrum can be generated it should be noted however that the design spectrum by this approach does not consider the spectrum dip effect alexander 2009 which is caused by the interaction between the equipment and its structural foundation however in early stage ship design the details of the equipment installation are not yet available the peak srs response obtained can be used to compare the relative response strength throughout the ship which may be useful to guide equipment arrangement 3 2 2 acceleration shock factor in the acceleration time history there is no clear single peak value as in the velocity time history due to the high frequency nature of the acceleration response see fig 18 for a velocity and acceleration time history example to mitigate the uncertainty the average of the one third highest peak accelerations is used to quantify the acceleration magnitude instead of the absolute peak value we call this the significant acceleration the significant acceleration also makes more sense in assessing the destructive effect of the shock wave since the absolute peak acceleration is just a transient event based on the regression results in table 4 the significant accelerations at all characteristic locations exhibits a strong linear relationship with the shock factor r 2 80 with the acceleration srs the absolute peak is sampled instead of the significant value since the srs peak is more distinguishable see fig 19 for an srs example the overall r 2 see table 5 shares similar values with the peak srs velocity regression results presented in table 3 in general both the peak structural velocity and acceleration are considered to have a reasonably strong linear relationship with their corresponding shock factor r 2 70 given the assumptions made in the shock factor derivation and the complex structural response behavior therefore using the fitted shock factor prediction model eq 8 and eq 13 to approximate the peak structural response is a reasonable approach for early stage design 4 taylor plate model in section 3 the peak structural response data for regression is generated by using the case model as the fluid solver in this section we evaluate the feasibility of substituting the taylor plate model for the case model the structural response and the shock factor regression results when the fluid is modeled by the taylor plate model are presented and compared to the results for the case model the coefficient η in shock factor expressions eq 7 and eq 12 is set to be 0 2 following the configuration in section 3 if the taylor plate result does not differ significantly from the case result the computational time to collect the data for regression can be significantly shortened by using the taylor plate model 4 1 description of the taylor plate model the taylor plate model taylor 1941 does not explicitly model the whole fluid domain as in the case model instead it assumes that the fluid is a perfect acoustic medium that allows the fluid particle displacement to be determined from the pressure of the shock wave when it reaches the structural wetted surface in this model an infinite air backed rigid plate is excited by a plane shock wave see fig 20 resulting in an upward motion with velocity v s the incident wave with pressure p i is then reflected from the plate with pressure p r the continuity relation of the fluid particle on the plate wetted surface requires that 21 v i c o s α v r c o s α v s where the v i and v r are the fluid particle velocity caused by the incident and reflected wave respectively α is the incident angle of the wave the particle velocity can be related to the fluid pressure by the plan wave approximation p ρ c v thus eq 21 becomes 22 p i c o s α ρ c p r c o s α ρ c v s which can be rearranged as 23 p r p i ρ c v s c o s α the total pressure at the plate wetted surface is thus related to the plate velocity as 24 p t p i p r 2 p i ρ c v s c o s α eq 24 solves for the fluid structure interaction between the shock wave and the plate in the original taylor plate model cavitation is not considered the total pressure on the plate can become infinitely low which is not physical here we add a cut off condition to stop the total pressure on the wetted surface from dropping below vapor pressure when the water is cavitated 25 p t 2 p i ρ c v s c o s α p t p c a v p c a v p t p c a v where p c a v is the vapor pressure which is small enough to be considered zero the taylor plate model can be applied locally on the surface ship hull surface as a fluid pressure generator for the fem structural solvers since the cavitation effect is only considered using a cut off condition and no actual fluid is modeled the later cavitation growth and closure which significantly affect the structural response are not captured therefore the result is only valid for the first few milliseconds during the shock wave impact however in terms of capturing the peak structural response this may be sufficient the plane wave approximation pwa used to relate the fluid particle velocity and wave pressure in the taylor plate model is identical to the early time approximation eta in the classic first order doubly asymptotic approximation daa1 geers 1971 which also includes a late time approximation lta to deal with the added mass effect at late time since the peak structural response typically happens at early time lta may not be necessary nevertheless the high order etas in more advanced daa formulations i e daa2 geers 1978 and daa3 geers and toothaker 2000 that provide improved early time accuracy remains to be assessed in the taylor plate model 4 2 taylor plate structural response results in this section the velocity time history of the structure response generated using the taylor plate fluid model is compared to that using the case fluid model which is considered as the benchmark the same abaqus structural solver is coupled the structural response to charge 1 is used as an example the closest structural sample points to the charge at primary and secondary locations are chosen for demonstration in fig 21 since the response is typically the strongest for the deck 4 inner bottom primary location see fig 21 a the peak velocity happens instantly as the wave arrives since the structural point is connected directly to the hull surface by a primary structural member the taylor plate model produces almost the same peak velocity and a similar velocity trend to the case model in the first few milliseconds after the wave arrives after the shock wave is passed and the local cavitation effect starts to kick in the velocity history by the taylor plate model begins to deviate from the case model result this is because the taylor plate model is only able to predict the cavitation inception time by the cut off condition eq 24 but unable to model the growth shrinking and eventual collapse of the cavitation as the case model does in the taylor plate model the local cavitation persists after it is generated which causes the taylor plate solution to deteriorate for the response at the other characteristic locations see fig 21 b f the peak velocity may not happen within the first few milliseconds after the wave arrives due to longer and more complex stress wave path therefore the taylor plate result may not be able to capture the peak velocity correctly since it may not occur before the response starts to degrade e g fig 21 b 4 3 taylor plate shock factor prediction model regression result in this section the shock factor prediction models eq 8 and eq 13 are fitted to the peak structural velocity and acceleration generated using the taylor plate model and their corresponding shock factor the charge configuration and the sampled structural points used in this section are the same as in section 3 2 since the taylor plate results are only valid for a limited amount of time the time history used to sample the peak response is shortened specifically the deck 4 inner bottom primary location uses a 5 ms time history after the wave arrives and the secondary locations use a 10 ms time history for the locations on deck 3 and deck 2 a 15 ms history is used because the peak response captured by the taylor plate model is not necessarily correct the case result is used as the actual data y to calculate the r 2 eq 18 the averaged r 2 value of the peak velocity and acceleration at different characteristic locations are presented in tables 6 9 along with the case regression result tables 2 5 for comparison for the time history peak velocity table 6 the taylor plate result at the deck 4 primary location has comparable r 2 to the case result however for the rest of the locations the r 2 of the taylor plate result is significantly smaller the less satisfactory performance of the shock factor prediction model fitted by taylor plate data may be explained by the observation made in section 4 2 for the deck 4 primary location the peak response happens as soon as the wave arrives thus it is not as affected by the cavitation which the taylor plate model cannot accurately model for the other characteristic locations especially those on the upper decks the peak response occurs much later when the taylor plate result becomes inaccurate as for the time history significant acceleration shown in table 7 the degradation of r 2 is not as remarkable as in the peak velocity case because the highest acceleration response takes place earlier than the highest velocity response thus it is more possible to happen before the taylor plate solution degrades as for the peak response in the velocity table 8 and acceleration srs table 9 the r 2 of the taylor plate model result is significantly lower than the case result except for the deck 4 primary location the poor performance of the taylor plate data fitted shock factor prediction model is because the srs is generated by only partial time history in which the peak response is not guaranteed to be included instead of the entire time history used in case regression results overall the taylor plate model is not recommended to collect the srs peak response data for regression given the more acceptable correlation between the response predicted by the taylor plate fitted shock factor prediction model and the actual response the taylor plate model may be used to obtain the time history peak response for regression in place of the case model with a little sacrifice of accuracy 5 application of the shock factor in this section we present a simplified notional application of shock factor in the ship design problem in order to arrange onboard equipment with different shock resistance capability the strength of the structural shock response throughout the ship should be known based on the discussion so far the fitted shock factor prediction model eq 8 and eq 13 for a specified structural point could be used to predict the structural response to specified undex scenarios ships are typically divided into subdivision blocks sdbs bounded by two adjacent bulkheads decks and side hull surfaces see the red box in fig 22 for an example sdb in early stage ship design components e g equipment are assigned to sdbs instead of particular structural locations because the variation of structural response between sdbs is typically larger than the variation within individual sdbs to make arrangement decisions it is sufficient to know the relative structural response of the sdbs if the structural response of representative points e g bottom center primary or secondary in each sdb may be used to represent shock response intensity for the entire sdb then the shock factor prediction model may be used to calculate this intensity to check this idea the significant accelerations of the bottom center or the closest point to the bottom center primary and secondary location points in each sdb sampled from the numerical results by case model are compared to the mean significant acceleration of all primary and secondary bottom location points in each sdb the correlation between the center response a c and the mean response a is evaluated by a ratio λ a c a if the λ is close to 1 the structural response at the bottom center may be considered to represent the entire subdivision block bottom the structural responses for three different charges are collected charge 1 is right below the midship keel x 64 4 m y 20 m z 0 m charge 2 is also below the keel but close to the ship stern x 88 m y 20 m z 0 m and charge 3 is close to the midship but with a large transverse standoff x 64 4 m y 5 5 m z 20 m all three charges have a 60 lb weight the deck and section numbering convention is shown in fig 22 for each row in table 10 that represents a deck the standard deviations of the significant acceleration response to charge 1 at primary bottom points of each sdb σ s d b are listed column 2 8 along with the standard deviation of the mean significant acceleration of all the sdbs on this deck σ d e c k last column calculated by eq 26 and eq 27 26 σ s d b n d k a k n d a n d 2 p t n d 27 σ d e c k d n a n d a n d 2 n d where n and d represent sections and decks which together determine a specific sdb a k n d is the significant acceleration of the structural point k in each sdb a n d is the mean significant acceleration of each sdb and a n d is the average of those means on deck d p t is the number of points of each sdb bottom and n d is the number of sections on deck d the standard deviation values indicate the variation of the significant acceleration between sdbs is larger than the variation within individual sdbs on each deck σ d e c k d σ s d b n d except for section 5 on deck 4 which confirms the idea of assigning components to sdb instead of structural points then we assess if the bottom center point is sufficient to represent the entire sdb contours of the structural significant acceleration response to charge 1 case numerical result for primary location points in deck 4 sdbs are plotted in fig 23 center points are indicated with a green dot and average responses are represented by a plane surface a comparison between the center points structural response obtained from the case results and the predictions by the shock factor model fitted by the case and taylor plate results i e structural response to charges in fig 12 is shown in fig 24 a decent agreement between the shock factor predicted results and numerical results is found in both magnitude and trend the λ of the sdbs on all decks calculated by the response at the primary location to charge 1 is listed in table 11 the largest λ is for deck 4 section 5 which is caused by the high acceleration gradient due to the close proximity to the charge center further away from the charge center the acceleration distribution becomes more even and λ becomes closer to 1 for the response at the secondary location to charge 1 and the response to charge 2 and charge 3 the λ distribution follows a similar trend the average and standard deviation of λ of all the sdbs are calculated and listed in table 12 for all the charge cases assessed the structural response at the block bottom center correlates fairly well with the mean response even when the shock wave is highly oblique to the ship charge 3 therefore the shock factor prediction function at the primary and secondary location bottom center of each sdb may be sufficient to approximate the response of the entire ship the provisional technical routine described above is more pertinent to the early stage ship design if the deployment of the components is settled at a later design stage shock factor prediction function may only need to be fitted where the components are supposed to be placed the shock factor function could also be fitted at a number of points for each characteristic location throughout the ship and the shock factor coefficient i e l i and q i at an arbitrary point may be interpolated from the obtained coefficients at the sampled points if the standard deviation of the obtained shock factor coefficients is small the averaged value could even be used for the future investigation experiments should be performed to determine if the shock factor prediction models obtained for a specified ship can also be applied to ships with similar topologies furthermore a coefficient c as a function of ship dimensions may be added to the shock factor prediction models eq 8 and eq 13 to accommodate ships with very different topologies 28 v i p e a k c l b d l i s f i 29 a i p e a k c l b d q i s f a i where l b and d represent ship length width and depth 6 conclusion in this work the shock factor concept proposed by keil 1961 is refined extended to predict surface ship peak structural response to undex the modified shock factor is developed to be linearly correlated with the local structural peak response instead of the global ship response as in the original shock factor the linear relationship between the peak structural response and the modified shock factor is assessed by regression analysis with the response data generated by a case abaqus coupled fsi solver for peak time history velocity response the strongest linear relationship is found on deck 4 inner bottom primary location at the other types of characteristic locations not directly connected to the ship hull the linear relationship becomes weaker since the shock factor cannot estimate the shock wave energy as well as at the deck 4 primary location as for the time history acceleration response similarly strong linear relationship is found between the significant peak acceleration and the shock factor at all assessed characteristic locations both peak velocity and acceleration in the srs show a weaker linear relationship with their corresponding shock factor than the time history peak response because the time history input used to generate the srs is influenced not only by the shock wave but also the local cavitation given the overall reasonably high r 2 values the fitted linear shock factor prediction models eq 8 and eq 13 can be used to approximate the peak structural response in both time history and srs in place of the numerical solver which significantly saves computational effort the feasibility of substituting the taylor plate model for the case model to generate the data for regression is also evaluated based on the correlation between the fitted shock factor prediction function and the actual response the taylor plate model is only recommended to obtain the time history peak structural response as for the application in the surface ship design the structural response at the subdivision block bottom center is shown to represent the response of the entire block fairly well as a result the shock factor prediction model obtained at the bottom center of each subdivision block can be used to approximate the structural response across the ship and potentially as a metric for locating equipment in early stage ship design provisional applications of the shock factor in later stage ship design are also discussed despite the fact that the proposed modified shock factor could be adapted to general ship structure its good behavior found in the specific surface ship evaluated in this paper may only exist in the ships with similar geometry therefore the modified shock factor remains to be assessed in more types of surface ships such as the multi hulls in the future work credit

20936,numerical simulation of a far field underwater explosion undex and its interaction with a large ship structure is a computationally intensive task requiring the discretization of a large fluid domain this paper explores surrogate non numerical approaches to approximate surface ship structural response to far field undex based on a now classic shock factor approach proposed by keil keil 1961 instead of the entire time domain history this work focuses on peak structural responses which may provide valuable information to guide equipment arrangement in early stage ship design to minimize shock effects the shock factor response equation as proposed by keil is refined to improve its performance in predicting peak structural responses at different locations in the ship this refinement is accomplished by a regression analysis using ship structural responses obtained from numerical simulation and their corresponding shock factor values the results show that the refined relationship between shock factor and peak structural response is promising as a result the shock factor may be employed to approximate peak structural response also the feasibility of using an analytical model to obtain data for regression in replacement of the numerical model is assessed lastly an application example using the shock factor is presented keywords undex early stage ship design surrogate model shock factor statistical analysis 1 introduction underwater explosion undex events can be generally classified as near field and far field in near field undex the explosive is large and sufficiently close to the ship hull that large plastic deformation and potential rupture are induced by the shock wave and explosion gas bubble since the energy is mostly absorbed by the hull through deformation the destructive effect is typically local but severe in far field undex where the explosive is located far enough from the ship and or the charge weight is small the structural deformation is elastic and the major undex effect comes from the shock wave and its impact on personnel and equipment inside the ship although no plastic deformation occurs a significant amount of energy is passed into the ship as a stress wave causing sudden motion of structural foundations where critical equipment may be installed keil 1961 another assumption of the far field undex is that the propagation speed of the shock wave has become constant and thus can be treated as a linear acoustic wave with a discontinuous profile this assumption holds true beyond 2 3 charge radii from the charge center costanzo 2011 far field undex also creates local cavitation caused by the inward motion of plate panel under shock and bulk cavitation caused by the reflection of the shock wave from the free surface in this work we focus on this far field undex problem in order to assess the vulnerability of surface ships to far field undex shock trials are sometimes conducted to understand the structural response to various shocks at different locations onboard due to the expensive and environmentally unfriendly nature of shock trials and their very limited value in early stage design recent attention has been largely given to the numerical simulation of the undex events koli et al 2020 liu et al 2018 lu and brown 2019a wu et al 2019 these investigations attempt to capture the shock wave and cavitation by numerical discretization approaches such as finite element method and discontinuous galerkin method however despite their high accuracy numerical simulations can be computationally expensive and require detail not available in early stage design ship concept exploration requires the consideration of potentially thousands of designs at a very limited level of detail using a numerical model to investigate undex shock effects in each design variant is difficult or impossible in related early studies peak structural response has been used as a metric to quantify the level of shock response of the ship structure e g bradbeer and andrews 2012 e w clements 1972 in early stage ship design peak structural response may provide useful information to guide equipment arrangement location although researchers are trying to make numerical simulation more efficient e g lu and brown 2019b shin 2004 sprague and geers 2006 non numerical methods can provide a reasonable approach until more effective and efficient methods are available keil 1961 proposed a conceptual shock factor as a function of charge weight orientation relative to the ship distance from the ship ship type onboard location and installation type his expression is based on the energy density in the shock wave arriving at the ship hull keil stated that the structural velocity response can be linearly scaled by this shock factor later the shock factor was simplified to be only a function of charge weight and charge location and commonly used to quantify the shock severity on surface ships under different shock attacks jin and ding 2011 liang and tai 2006 o hara and cunniff 1993 reid 1996 zhang et al 2011 similar structural response magnitude is expected given the same shock factor value modifications of the shock factor have been made to cater more specific applications zhang zhang and jiang 2015 proposed a modified shock factor for small cylindrical objects to account for the shock wave scattering effect yao yao et al 2009 extended the original shock factor which is only applicable to plane shock wave to be used for spherical shock wave by calculating the shock energy sheltered by the structure based on the geometry of shock wave and structure this extended shock factor is validated in a cylindrical shell problem where similar structural response magnitude is found under equal shock factor conditions it was adopted by guo guo et al 2017 2019 for more complicated ship structures in a most recent study hu hu et al 2020 improved sheltered shock energy calculation to better quantify the shock energy variation along the widths of the structure an air backed plate is used to validate the shock factor by hu and a proportional relationship between the structural response and the shock factor was found despite the aforementioned modifications the shock factors nowadays still mainly serve as a metric to quantify the shock severity and compare the magnitude of global structural response under different shock attacks the generalized shock factor originally conceptualized by keil for the surface ship that can be used to scale and thus predict local structural responses at different locations throughout the ship has never been fully explored which is the key motivation of this study in order to evaluate the potential linear relationship between the surface ship structural response and the shock factor regression analyses are performed in this work a coupled fluid structure interaction fsi solver employing a cavitating acoustic spectral element case fluid solver and an abaqus structural solver built by lu and brown 2019a is used to collect structural response data for regression this fsi solver has been validated in two canonical undex benchmark problems with analytical solutions i e a bleich sandler problem bleich and sandler 1970 and an underwater spherical shell problem zhang and geers 1993 and cross verified with the abaqus structural acoustic solver in the surface ship configuration assessed in this paper lu and brown 2019a 2019b in this work the scattered field formulation of the case approach is used in which case an analytical pressure profile of the incident shock wave is imposed as boundary condition on the structure wetted surface and the scattered field is numerically solved for although more efficient than its counterparts the case fluid solver is still computationally expensive if used to run a large number of cases g i taylor 1941 proposed one of the first analytical schemes to model the fsi effect for a structure interacting with an underwater shock wave specifically an infinite air backed rigid plate under plane shock wave impact is analyzed the fluid domain is modeled by assuming it is perfectly acoustic and thus the effect of the fluid can be prescribed as a structural boundary condition this taylor plate model is much faster than numerical models which require spatial discretization of the fluid domain the taylor plate model has been used to build simplified models to calculate the momentum transmission and fsi effect of a sandwich plate under shock impact e g fleck and deshpande 2004 mcshane et al 2010 the taylor plate model was also extended to a water backed plate by liu liu and young 2008 to understand the shock response of a submerged structure it is used to study undex effects on a rigid floating shock platform fsp by sebert 1984 with results compared to experimental data reasonable results for the velocity time history were obtained in the first few milliseconds after which the taylor plate solution deteriorates because of the inception of cavitation making the fluid no longer entirely acoustic the taylor plate model is usually not used for underwater explosion simulations due to the existence of more sophisticated numerical models however the peak response often occurs in the early time of the response possibly making the need to use more sophisticated models unnecessary mathew 2018 compared the structural velocity response of an elastic fsp obtained using the taylor plate model to results using the case fluid solver excellent agreement is found in the structural velocity response for the first few milliseconds however this performance cannot be generalized for surface ships which are much larger and more structurally complex if the peak structural response when the taylor plate model is employed in surface ships is sufficient to generate data for regression the numerical fluid model e g case which consumes more computational resources and time could be replaced once keil s linear relationship for one ship design is established it may be applicable to similar ships therefore numerical or taylor plate analyses may only be required for a single baseline design for significantly different designs additional numerical or taylor plate analyses would likely be required making the possible use of the taylor plate approach even more advantageous in the following sections we first present the shock factor formulation for peak structural response then the assumed linear relationship is determined and assessed using two benchmark problems with the structural response data generated using the case abaqus coupled fsi solver then the feasibility of replacing the case fluid model with the taylor plate model is evaluated finally an application example of the shock factor is presented 2 shock factor and modifications in section 2 1 the original shock factor defined by keil 1961 and an approach to improve correlation with peak velocity response is described the idea of the shock factor is then extended in section 2 2 to consider peak acceleration response which is another essential factor to quantify shock severity the shock factor introduced in this section is devised only for the far field undex where only linear elastic response occurs no plastic damage also it is assumed that the peak structural response is not affected by the local cavitation which is triggered after the structure is displaced to a certain extent 2 1 peak velocity shock factor in the original description keil defined shock factor as 1 s f 0 x c w w 1 2 r 0 c o s θ 0 to describe the shock wave energy density applied on the ship hull surface x c and w represent the charge center and charge weight r 0 is the distance from the charge to a reference point x 0 on the ship usually defined at mid keel by keil and others and θ 0 is the orientation of charge relative to the reference point x 0 see fig 1 the velocity profile of the ship structure at a particular structural point i is expressed as 2 v i t c v t s f 0 x c w where c is a linear coefficient depending on ship type onboard location and installation type v t is a normalized velocity profile assuming the ship type and installation type are fixed c only varies with location thus the peak velocity at the structural point i is only proportional to the shock factor s f 0 calculated at a specified reference point 3 v i p e a k v p e a k c i s f 0 x c w where v p e a k is the peak velocity of the normalized velocity profile v t and c i is the linear coefficient at the point i to better understand and apply this equation we present a possible derivation of the shock factor which is missing from the original keil s paper based on the empirical formulation by cole 1948 the energy density of the shock wave front normal to the hull surface can be expressed as 4 e f 1 ρ c p t c o s θ 2 d t κ w 1 3 w 1 3 r γ cos 2 θ where κ and γ are constant coefficients given in cole 1948 κ 2 41 e 3 and γ 2 05 for tnt ρ and c are the fluid density and sound speed which are then blended into κ θ is the angle between the shock wave propagation direction and the inward pointing normal of the hull surface and r is the distance from the charge center to the point on the hull the energy that enters the ship is assumed to be a constant fraction of the total wave energy and thus the energy density could be expressed as μ e f for a rigid body if the initial velocity is zero its peak velocity can be expressed as v p e a k 2 e m where e is the energy acting on the body and m is the body mass based on a simple kinetic energy definition e 1 2 m v 2 assuming the structure is locally rigid combining this expression with eq 4 and plugging in γ the peak velocity at a specific structural point i on the external submerged hull surface may be approximated by 5 v i p e a k 2 s i μ e f m i 2 s i μ κ m i w 1 016 r i 1 025 c o s θ i 2 s i μ κ m i w r i c o s θ i where m i is proposed as the effective mass or inertia for point i and s i is the effective area to convert the energy density to energy if θ i 90 the peak velocity v i p e a k would become zero however this is not physically correct since the wave still excites the structure at a glancing angle to account for the transient wave excitation when the shock wave is oblique large θ i the angle function in eq 5 is modified as in keil 1961 6 v i p e a k 2 s i μ κ m i w r i η 1 η c o s θ i where η is a constant coefficient to be determined from experiment the modified angle function is designed such that it does not become zero at glancing angle θ i 90 and reverts back to 1 at normal angle θ i 0 defining a velocity shock factor as 7 s f i x c w w r i η 1 η c o s θ i based on the location of the structural point i and with l i 2 s i μ κ m i eq 6 becomes 8 v i p e a k l i s f i based on the derivation the reference point where r i and θ i are defined should be based on the location of the structural point i instead of being a single point x 0 for all structural points as in the original shock factor see fig 1 in the modified shock factor used hereafter the reference point x 0 i is defined depending on the location of the individual structural point i for a structural point on the hull surface the reference point coincides with the structural point itself for the points on the inner bottom and decks above the selection of hull reference points is proposed and discussed in section 2 3 the peak velocity v i p e a k at structural point i may be estimated by the shock factor s f i once the linear coefficient l i is determined 2 2 peak acceleration shock factor following the example of the velocity shock factor derivation described in section 2 1 the acceleration shock factor is defined if the peak acceleration is desired the peak pressure p m similitude expression found in cole 1948 is used 9 p m ε w 1 3 r τ where ε and τ are constant coefficients given in cole 1948 ε 2 16 e 4 and τ 1 13 for tnt and p m is the peak pressure of the shock wave the maximum nodal force acting on structural point i can be estimated by 10 f i m p i m s i s i ε w 1 3 r i τ η 1 η c o s θ i where s i is the effective area of point i to convert nodal pressure to nodal force the definition of r i θ i and η follows that in section 2 1 the peak acceleration a i p e a k at the structural point i becomes 11 a i p e a k f i m m i s i ε m i w 1 3 r i τ η 1 η c o s θ i assuming the structure is locally rigid defining the acceleration shock factor as 12 s f a i x c w w 1 3 r i τ η 1 η c o s θ i and with q i s i ε m i the peak acceleration at the structural point i can be estimated as 13 a i p e a k q i s f a i linear coefficients l i and q i can then be determined via linear curve fitting using the structural response results and the shock factor values the derivation of the peak velocity and acceleration expression in eq 5 and eq 11 relies on the assumption that the structure is rigid which aligns with the original shock factor proposed by keil while this assumption deviates from the realistic situation where elastic structural deformation is present it does allow us to estimate the peak response with an analytical expression of the shock factor since the deformation is typically small within elastic regime in the far field undex problem the strain energy stored in the deformation may be insignificant compared to the kinetic energy the effect of this assumption on the performance of the shock factor will be discussed in section 3 2 3 categorizing the structural locations for clarity a point on the ship hull bottom has been used as an example to derive the shock factor in sections 2 1 and 2 2 however equipment sensitive to shock may be located throughout the ship the shock response can vary significantly between decks hwee and jeremy 2013 even on the same deck the response is different for instance the inner bottom location on top of the longitudinal girder or floor see fig 2 is vertically connected directly to the hull surface which is directly exposed to the fluid shock excitation as a result the structural response in this location shows an almost immediate kick off motion as soon as the fluid shock wave arrives followed by a rebound and oscillation caused by the local cavitation the oscillation is then gradually damped by the fluid however away from the primary structural members the structure is not vertically connected to the hull surface the stress wave path instead comes from the side hull and adjacent bulkhead horizontally within the same grillage due to the longer and more complicated stress wave path the energy load that reaches the structure is significantly smaller because of this and the smaller vertical stiffness the kick off motion is not as strong and instantaneous as at the location supported by primary structural members on the decks above the inner bottom the stress wave path is even more complicated due to the greater distance from the fluid the fluid damping barely affects the damping on the decks above which leads to prolonged oscillation the points on the decks above the inner bottom can also be categorized into the locations supported by longitudinal girders or frames and locations only supported by regular stiffeners since the response pattern can be different due to the different stiffness hereafter we call locations supported by primary structural members i e girders floors frames primary locations and those supported only by secondary structural members plates and stiffeners secondary locations due to the different response features and excitation paths at these different characteristic locations they are treated separately in terms of evaluating the linear relationship between the shock factor and the peak structural response referring to eq 5 and fig 1 the reference point x 0 i can be defined depending on where the structural point is on the hull surface the hull reference point shares the same location as the structural point because the structure is directly exposed to fluid the internal structural points however are indirectly excited as mentioned before a variation of the shock factor prediction model eq 8 and eq 13 may be defined as 14 v i p e a k j 1 n l i j s f j 15 a i p e a k j 1 n q i j s f a j to estimate the peak response of structural point i by a linear combination of the shock factor at the reference points in eq 14 and eq 15 i denotes the structural point n is the number of hull reference points represented by j and l i j and q i j are linear coefficients the reference points may be chosen at the intersection of deck hull surface and bulkhead where the majority of the shock wave enters the ship see fig 3 in this work we use a simpler and more physics based approach which defines a few hull reference points in the vicinity of the internal structural point i the shock factors on the reference points are interpolated to form the final shock factor s f i for the structural point i the hull reference points are defined at the locations where the stress wave paths intersect with the hull surface the intersection is assumed to be the direct path point where the shock wave that reaches the internal structural point enters the ship since an internal point might be excited by more than one wave paths there can be several reference points to demonstrate the selection of reference points for shock factor calculation at different characteristic locations a ship section bounded by two bulkheads is used for demonstration fig 5 to fig 8 in sections 2 3 1 to 2 3 4 the decks are numbered as shown in fig 4 the selection of reference points for these different cases was largely guided and assessed by their ability to achieve the best correlation between the shock factor function prediction result and the actual numerical results 2 3 1 deck 4 primary location for the deck 4 inner bottom primary location see fig 5 the hull surface point vertically connected to the structural point by girder floor is used as one of the reference points point 3 to account for the shock wave entering horizontally into the deck two points on the hull surface with the same longitudinal location as the structural point are used as the reference point as well point 1 2 the stress wave path is shown in red dotted line the resultant shock factor on structural point i is calculated by inverse distance interpolation of the shock factor s f j on the reference points 16 s f i j 1 3 h j s f j j 1 3 h j 17 h j 1 h j where h j is the distance from the reference point j to the structural point i and h j is the interpolation weight 2 3 2 deck 4 secondary location for structure points not on the primary structural parts see fig 6 the load path is more complicated the reference points in the transverse direction point 1 2 are defined as the same as the primary location since the bulkhead tends to be stiffer than the floors and thus carries more energy load the reference point in the longitudinal direction is chosen on the intersection of bulkhead and hull surface point 3 4 note that h 3 and h 4 consider the distance traveled on both the bulkhead and the deck 2 3 3 deck 3 primary and secondary location for the deck 3 first deck above the inner bottom shown in fig 7 both the primary and secondary locations share the same set of reference points which is defined similarly to the inner bottom secondary location because the structural point is not directly connected to the hull surface vertically 2 3 4 deck 2 primary and secondary location for the deck 3 we assume that the waterline is above the deck as a result the reference point 1 and 2 are directly exposed to the shock wave from the surrounding fluid however if the deck is above the waterline the wave path is slightly different the deck 2 second deck above the inner bottom shown in fig 8 serves as an example when the deck is above the waterline in this case the transverse reference points point 1 2 on the side hull shell are located on the uppermost submerged lower deck for the rest of the decks above the free surface the rules of reference point selection follow the deck 2 therefore we focus on validating the linear relationship between the shock factor and peak structural response on deck 2 deck 3 and deck 4 in this research 3 assessment of shock factor in this section the linear relationship between the shock factor described in section 2 and the structural peak response is determined and assessed by statistical regression in two undex problems specifically the shock factor prediction model in eq 8 peak velocity or eq 13 peak acceleration are fitted to the structural peak responses and the corresponding shock factor values the abaqus case coupled fsi solver is used to generate the structural response data for regression the strength of the linear relationship is quantified by the coefficient of determination 18 r 2 1 i y i f i 2 i y i y 2 100 where y i is the actual response y is the mean actual response f i is the predicted response it shows how well the predicted response by the fitted shock factor prediction model correlates with the actual simulation data therefore high r 2 reflects a strong linear relationship between the structural peak response and the shock factor once the l i and q i are obtained with satisfactory r 2 eq 8 and eq 13 can be used to predict the peak response for any charge configuration i e charge location and charge weight 3 1 bleich sandler problem in this section we test the validity of the modified shock factor using a bleich sandler problem which involves an air backed rigid plate under plane incident shock wave attack with a step exponential pressure profile see fig 9 for the plate and fluid domain 19 p i x t p m e x p t x x f c τ c h t x x f c where p m is the peak pressure calculated by eq 9 c is the sound speed τ c is the decay constant which depends on charge weight and distance from the charge center similitude equation available in cole 1948 x f is the location of the wave front where p m and τ c are defined and h represents the heaviside function the plate is 0 1 m in length and width and weights 144 kg the fluid domain is 3 8 m in depth with a non reflective boundary nrb at the domain bottom the plate is free to move with no boundary constraint the detailed numerical simulation case setup can be found in lu and brown 2019a the bleich sandler problem can be considered as a simplified undex problem six charge cases are used to generate the data for regression the charges are put at a depth ranging from 40 m to 15 m with a 5 m interval the charge weight is set as 27 2 kg 60 lb the peak velocity and acceleration are obtained for each charge configuration the plate velocity and acceleration response time history under the first charge is shown in fig 10 as an example the plate is first kicked off by the shock wave the maximum velocity zero acceleration is reached as the shock wave is almost past and the gradually decreasing fluid pressure due to the upward plate motion and plate gravity sum to a zero total force on the plate cavitation is generated below the plate as the total fluid pressure drops below vapor pressure the velocity and acceleration shock factor prediction model eq 8 and eq 13 are fitted to the shock factor values calculated from the charge weight and charge distance to the plate and the peak structural responses collected from the simulation the coefficients l i and q i are obtained by the linear curve fitting η in the shock factor expression eq 7 and eq 12 is set to 0 since the direction of the plane shock wave in this problem is normal to the plate the fitting results are shown in fig 11 where the x and y axes represent the actual response and the predicted response calculated by the fitted eq 8 and eq 13 with l i 13 2 m s and q i 507226 2 m s 2 the data points represent the structure response to the five charges if all the data points fall on the diagonal line red on the actual by prediction plot the fitted model perfectly predicts the actual data which implies r 2 100 fig 11 shows the peak structural velocity and the acceleration response are well predicted by the fitted shock factor prediction model this reflects a strong linear relationship between the peak velocity and peak acceleration and their corresponding shock factor which is further supported by the calculated r 2 value shown in table 1 the almost perfect behavior of the shock factor in the bleich sandler case can be attributed to the fact that the plate is rigid which agrees with the assumption of eq 5 and eq 11 also it suggests that the cavitation does not affect the peak structural response which provides more confidence for the surface ship case assessed in the next section at least for hull surface panels 3 2 ship problem in this section the linear relationship between the peak structural response and the shock factor is assessed in a surface ship undex problem the surface ship model is 143 m in length 21 m in width and 14 m in depth with 8 decks and 12 bulkheads floors girders and frames are arranged every 2 m each continuous plate is stiffened every 0 8 m see fig 2 for structural part visualization linear elastic material with a density of 7831 k g m 3 and young s modulus of 204 1 gpa is used for the ship structure 30 charges with different weights and locations in the far field regime i e over 2 3 charge radii to the hull are selected using a latin hypercube approach and placed around the hull see fig 12 the ship is under the impact of spherical incident shock wave with a step exponential pressure profile 20 p i x t p m e x p t r r f c τ c h t r r f c where r is the distance from the charge center to location x and r f is the distance from the charge center to the wave front where p m and τ c are defined the ship is free to move without boundary constraints during the fsi process fluid nodal force and structural displacement are exchanged on the coupling surface more details about the case setup for the numerical simulation can be found in lu and brown 2019b the structural response time history of 30 ms from when the shock wave first touches the ship hull is sampled at a number of points at primary fig 13 a c e and secondary locations fig 13 b d f throughout the ship in addition to the time history the frequency response is also sampled using a shock response spectrum srs the srs is a plot of the peak response of a system of single dof spring mass oscillators with various natural frequencies to the shock input it reflects how equipment with different natural frequencies would respond to the shock the velocity and acceleration shock factor prediction models eq 8 and eq 13 are fitted to the shock factor values and the peak structural responses collected from the simulation at each sampled point the coefficient η is set to be 0 2 in the shock factor expression eq 7 and eq 12 because it systematically yields the strongest linear correlation between the peak structural response and the shock factors since the spherical shock wave generated by the sampled 30 charges covers almost all possible attack angles the chosen η in this work may serve as a guideline for future investigations nevertheless readers are encouraged to calibrate it themselves when conducting similar studies to assess the degree of linear relationship an average r 2 comparing the actual and predicted values of all the sampled points at each characteristic location is calculated the charge and sampled structural point parameters can be found in appendix a 3 2 1 velocity shock factor first the predicted results of fitting the modified velocity shock factor prediction model eq 8 to the time history peak velocities and the velocity shock factor are presented the actual by prediction plots for the sampled primary points on deck 4 inner bottom are shown as an example fig 14 data points on each location plot represent the response of 30 charge cases the averaged r 2 values of the sampled points for each characteristic location are listed in table 2 the fitting results using the original shock factor eq 1 with the midship keel point as the reference point are also presented in fig 15 and table 2 for comparison as reflected by the r 2 in table 2 second column the original shock factor barely correlates with the peak structural velocity negative r 2 indicates the fitted model is worse than using the mean value based on eq 18 which is anticipated due to its fixed reference point given the poor behavior of the original shock factor we only focus on the modified shock factor hereafter the relationship between the modified shock factor and the peak velocity is not perfectly linear as in the bleich sandler problem because the structure is no longer rigid as assumed by eq 5 and the structure is more complicated than a single plate nevertheless the linearity is overall strong with r 2 75 which justifies the validity of the rigid structure assumption among all the characteristic locations the structural responses at the deck 4 primary locations have the strongest linear relationship with the shock factor among all the characteristic locations the relationship becomes significantly weaker at the deck 4 secondary locations this is because the primary locations are directly excited by the fluid shock wave via the girders floors vertically connected to the hull surface whereas the secondary locations are excited by a more complicated wave path from the edges of the grillage the wave path plotted in fig 6 is only one of the routes the wave may take in the structure for instance the wave can also keep propagating upward when it reaches the intersection between the bulkhead and deck 4 as a result the shock factor does not estimate the shock wave energy at the secondary location as accurately as at the primary location the weaker linear relationship at the secondary location may also be caused by the smaller stiffness which allows more shock energy to transform into the strain energy on deck 2 and deck 3 decks above the inner bottom the r 2 of the primary and secondary locations is not as high as their counterparts on deck 4 which may again be explained by the less accurate shock factor energy estimation due to a longer and more complex wave path next the velocity shock response spectrum srs is calculated using the data response time history as input after plotting the srs velocity responses to all the test charge cases it is found that the peak response happens at approximately the same frequency see fig 16 for the srs plot at an example structural point to assess the strength of the linear relationship between the srs peak velocity and the shock factor linear regression is performed as before the actual by prediction plot for the deck 4 primary location sampled points is shown in fig 17 the regression result in table 3 shows a similar trend to the time history peak velocity result in table 2 but with slightly lower r 2 weaker linear relationship the peak response in srs is also subject to the influence of the local cavitation generated after the shock wave passes because the srs is calculated using the entire 30 ms response time history therefore the velocity shock factor prediction model eq 8 does not approximate the srs peak velocity as well as the time history peak velocity despite this the correlation between the predicted result and the actual result is still significant in design applications a linearly rise to the maximum response from the response at the first sample frequency of the same profile that yields the max response and then flat profile solid red line in fig 16 envelopes the entire srs and could serve as an equipment design spectrum with the natural frequency either from modal analysis or induction from the actual simulation data a design spectrum can be generated it should be noted however that the design spectrum by this approach does not consider the spectrum dip effect alexander 2009 which is caused by the interaction between the equipment and its structural foundation however in early stage ship design the details of the equipment installation are not yet available the peak srs response obtained can be used to compare the relative response strength throughout the ship which may be useful to guide equipment arrangement 3 2 2 acceleration shock factor in the acceleration time history there is no clear single peak value as in the velocity time history due to the high frequency nature of the acceleration response see fig 18 for a velocity and acceleration time history example to mitigate the uncertainty the average of the one third highest peak accelerations is used to quantify the acceleration magnitude instead of the absolute peak value we call this the significant acceleration the significant acceleration also makes more sense in assessing the destructive effect of the shock wave since the absolute peak acceleration is just a transient event based on the regression results in table 4 the significant accelerations at all characteristic locations exhibits a strong linear relationship with the shock factor r 2 80 with the acceleration srs the absolute peak is sampled instead of the significant value since the srs peak is more distinguishable see fig 19 for an srs example the overall r 2 see table 5 shares similar values with the peak srs velocity regression results presented in table 3 in general both the peak structural velocity and acceleration are considered to have a reasonably strong linear relationship with their corresponding shock factor r 2 70 given the assumptions made in the shock factor derivation and the complex structural response behavior therefore using the fitted shock factor prediction model eq 8 and eq 13 to approximate the peak structural response is a reasonable approach for early stage design 4 taylor plate model in section 3 the peak structural response data for regression is generated by using the case model as the fluid solver in this section we evaluate the feasibility of substituting the taylor plate model for the case model the structural response and the shock factor regression results when the fluid is modeled by the taylor plate model are presented and compared to the results for the case model the coefficient η in shock factor expressions eq 7 and eq 12 is set to be 0 2 following the configuration in section 3 if the taylor plate result does not differ significantly from the case result the computational time to collect the data for regression can be significantly shortened by using the taylor plate model 4 1 description of the taylor plate model the taylor plate model taylor 1941 does not explicitly model the whole fluid domain as in the case model instead it assumes that the fluid is a perfect acoustic medium that allows the fluid particle displacement to be determined from the pressure of the shock wave when it reaches the structural wetted surface in this model an infinite air backed rigid plate is excited by a plane shock wave see fig 20 resulting in an upward motion with velocity v s the incident wave with pressure p i is then reflected from the plate with pressure p r the continuity relation of the fluid particle on the plate wetted surface requires that 21 v i c o s α v r c o s α v s where the v i and v r are the fluid particle velocity caused by the incident and reflected wave respectively α is the incident angle of the wave the particle velocity can be related to the fluid pressure by the plan wave approximation p ρ c v thus eq 21 becomes 22 p i c o s α ρ c p r c o s α ρ c v s which can be rearranged as 23 p r p i ρ c v s c o s α the total pressure at the plate wetted surface is thus related to the plate velocity as 24 p t p i p r 2 p i ρ c v s c o s α eq 24 solves for the fluid structure interaction between the shock wave and the plate in the original taylor plate model cavitation is not considered the total pressure on the plate can become infinitely low which is not physical here we add a cut off condition to stop the total pressure on the wetted surface from dropping below vapor pressure when the water is cavitated 25 p t 2 p i ρ c v s c o s α p t p c a v p c a v p t p c a v where p c a v is the vapor pressure which is small enough to be considered zero the taylor plate model can be applied locally on the surface ship hull surface as a fluid pressure generator for the fem structural solvers since the cavitation effect is only considered using a cut off condition and no actual fluid is modeled the later cavitation growth and closure which significantly affect the structural response are not captured therefore the result is only valid for the first few milliseconds during the shock wave impact however in terms of capturing the peak structural response this may be sufficient the plane wave approximation pwa used to relate the fluid particle velocity and wave pressure in the taylor plate model is identical to the early time approximation eta in the classic first order doubly asymptotic approximation daa1 geers 1971 which also includes a late time approximation lta to deal with the added mass effect at late time since the peak structural response typically happens at early time lta may not be necessary nevertheless the high order etas in more advanced daa formulations i e daa2 geers 1978 and daa3 geers and toothaker 2000 that provide improved early time accuracy remains to be assessed in the taylor plate model 4 2 taylor plate structural response results in this section the velocity time history of the structure response generated using the taylor plate fluid model is compared to that using the case fluid model which is considered as the benchmark the same abaqus structural solver is coupled the structural response to charge 1 is used as an example the closest structural sample points to the charge at primary and secondary locations are chosen for demonstration in fig 21 since the response is typically the strongest for the deck 4 inner bottom primary location see fig 21 a the peak velocity happens instantly as the wave arrives since the structural point is connected directly to the hull surface by a primary structural member the taylor plate model produces almost the same peak velocity and a similar velocity trend to the case model in the first few milliseconds after the wave arrives after the shock wave is passed and the local cavitation effect starts to kick in the velocity history by the taylor plate model begins to deviate from the case model result this is because the taylor plate model is only able to predict the cavitation inception time by the cut off condition eq 24 but unable to model the growth shrinking and eventual collapse of the cavitation as the case model does in the taylor plate model the local cavitation persists after it is generated which causes the taylor plate solution to deteriorate for the response at the other characteristic locations see fig 21 b f the peak velocity may not happen within the first few milliseconds after the wave arrives due to longer and more complex stress wave path therefore the taylor plate result may not be able to capture the peak velocity correctly since it may not occur before the response starts to degrade e g fig 21 b 4 3 taylor plate shock factor prediction model regression result in this section the shock factor prediction models eq 8 and eq 13 are fitted to the peak structural velocity and acceleration generated using the taylor plate model and their corresponding shock factor the charge configuration and the sampled structural points used in this section are the same as in section 3 2 since the taylor plate results are only valid for a limited amount of time the time history used to sample the peak response is shortened specifically the deck 4 inner bottom primary location uses a 5 ms time history after the wave arrives and the secondary locations use a 10 ms time history for the locations on deck 3 and deck 2 a 15 ms history is used because the peak response captured by the taylor plate model is not necessarily correct the case result is used as the actual data y to calculate the r 2 eq 18 the averaged r 2 value of the peak velocity and acceleration at different characteristic locations are presented in tables 6 9 along with the case regression result tables 2 5 for comparison for the time history peak velocity table 6 the taylor plate result at the deck 4 primary location has comparable r 2 to the case result however for the rest of the locations the r 2 of the taylor plate result is significantly smaller the less satisfactory performance of the shock factor prediction model fitted by taylor plate data may be explained by the observation made in section 4 2 for the deck 4 primary location the peak response happens as soon as the wave arrives thus it is not as affected by the cavitation which the taylor plate model cannot accurately model for the other characteristic locations especially those on the upper decks the peak response occurs much later when the taylor plate result becomes inaccurate as for the time history significant acceleration shown in table 7 the degradation of r 2 is not as remarkable as in the peak velocity case because the highest acceleration response takes place earlier than the highest velocity response thus it is more possible to happen before the taylor plate solution degrades as for the peak response in the velocity table 8 and acceleration srs table 9 the r 2 of the taylor plate model result is significantly lower than the case result except for the deck 4 primary location the poor performance of the taylor plate data fitted shock factor prediction model is because the srs is generated by only partial time history in which the peak response is not guaranteed to be included instead of the entire time history used in case regression results overall the taylor plate model is not recommended to collect the srs peak response data for regression given the more acceptable correlation between the response predicted by the taylor plate fitted shock factor prediction model and the actual response the taylor plate model may be used to obtain the time history peak response for regression in place of the case model with a little sacrifice of accuracy 5 application of the shock factor in this section we present a simplified notional application of shock factor in the ship design problem in order to arrange onboard equipment with different shock resistance capability the strength of the structural shock response throughout the ship should be known based on the discussion so far the fitted shock factor prediction model eq 8 and eq 13 for a specified structural point could be used to predict the structural response to specified undex scenarios ships are typically divided into subdivision blocks sdbs bounded by two adjacent bulkheads decks and side hull surfaces see the red box in fig 22 for an example sdb in early stage ship design components e g equipment are assigned to sdbs instead of particular structural locations because the variation of structural response between sdbs is typically larger than the variation within individual sdbs to make arrangement decisions it is sufficient to know the relative structural response of the sdbs if the structural response of representative points e g bottom center primary or secondary in each sdb may be used to represent shock response intensity for the entire sdb then the shock factor prediction model may be used to calculate this intensity to check this idea the significant accelerations of the bottom center or the closest point to the bottom center primary and secondary location points in each sdb sampled from the numerical results by case model are compared to the mean significant acceleration of all primary and secondary bottom location points in each sdb the correlation between the center response a c and the mean response a is evaluated by a ratio λ a c a if the λ is close to 1 the structural response at the bottom center may be considered to represent the entire subdivision block bottom the structural responses for three different charges are collected charge 1 is right below the midship keel x 64 4 m y 20 m z 0 m charge 2 is also below the keel but close to the ship stern x 88 m y 20 m z 0 m and charge 3 is close to the midship but with a large transverse standoff x 64 4 m y 5 5 m z 20 m all three charges have a 60 lb weight the deck and section numbering convention is shown in fig 22 for each row in table 10 that represents a deck the standard deviations of the significant acceleration response to charge 1 at primary bottom points of each sdb σ s d b are listed column 2 8 along with the standard deviation of the mean significant acceleration of all the sdbs on this deck σ d e c k last column calculated by eq 26 and eq 27 26 σ s d b n d k a k n d a n d 2 p t n d 27 σ d e c k d n a n d a n d 2 n d where n and d represent sections and decks which together determine a specific sdb a k n d is the significant acceleration of the structural point k in each sdb a n d is the mean significant acceleration of each sdb and a n d is the average of those means on deck d p t is the number of points of each sdb bottom and n d is the number of sections on deck d the standard deviation values indicate the variation of the significant acceleration between sdbs is larger than the variation within individual sdbs on each deck σ d e c k d σ s d b n d except for section 5 on deck 4 which confirms the idea of assigning components to sdb instead of structural points then we assess if the bottom center point is sufficient to represent the entire sdb contours of the structural significant acceleration response to charge 1 case numerical result for primary location points in deck 4 sdbs are plotted in fig 23 center points are indicated with a green dot and average responses are represented by a plane surface a comparison between the center points structural response obtained from the case results and the predictions by the shock factor model fitted by the case and taylor plate results i e structural response to charges in fig 12 is shown in fig 24 a decent agreement between the shock factor predicted results and numerical results is found in both magnitude and trend the λ of the sdbs on all decks calculated by the response at the primary location to charge 1 is listed in table 11 the largest λ is for deck 4 section 5 which is caused by the high acceleration gradient due to the close proximity to the charge center further away from the charge center the acceleration distribution becomes more even and λ becomes closer to 1 for the response at the secondary location to charge 1 and the response to charge 2 and charge 3 the λ distribution follows a similar trend the average and standard deviation of λ of all the sdbs are calculated and listed in table 12 for all the charge cases assessed the structural response at the block bottom center correlates fairly well with the mean response even when the shock wave is highly oblique to the ship charge 3 therefore the shock factor prediction function at the primary and secondary location bottom center of each sdb may be sufficient to approximate the response of the entire ship the provisional technical routine described above is more pertinent to the early stage ship design if the deployment of the components is settled at a later design stage shock factor prediction function may only need to be fitted where the components are supposed to be placed the shock factor function could also be fitted at a number of points for each characteristic location throughout the ship and the shock factor coefficient i e l i and q i at an arbitrary point may be interpolated from the obtained coefficients at the sampled points if the standard deviation of the obtained shock factor coefficients is small the averaged value could even be used for the future investigation experiments should be performed to determine if the shock factor prediction models obtained for a specified ship can also be applied to ships with similar topologies furthermore a coefficient c as a function of ship dimensions may be added to the shock factor prediction models eq 8 and eq 13 to accommodate ships with very different topologies 28 v i p e a k c l b d l i s f i 29 a i p e a k c l b d q i s f a i where l b and d represent ship length width and depth 6 conclusion in this work the shock factor concept proposed by keil 1961 is refined extended to predict surface ship peak structural response to undex the modified shock factor is developed to be linearly correlated with the local structural peak response instead of the global ship response as in the original shock factor the linear relationship between the peak structural response and the modified shock factor is assessed by regression analysis with the response data generated by a case abaqus coupled fsi solver for peak time history velocity response the strongest linear relationship is found on deck 4 inner bottom primary location at the other types of characteristic locations not directly connected to the ship hull the linear relationship becomes weaker since the shock factor cannot estimate the shock wave energy as well as at the deck 4 primary location as for the time history acceleration response similarly strong linear relationship is found between the significant peak acceleration and the shock factor at all assessed characteristic locations both peak velocity and acceleration in the srs show a weaker linear relationship with their corresponding shock factor than the time history peak response because the time history input used to generate the srs is influenced not only by the shock wave but also the local cavitation given the overall reasonably high r 2 values the fitted linear shock factor prediction models eq 8 and eq 13 can be used to approximate the peak structural response in both time history and srs in place of the numerical solver which significantly saves computational effort the feasibility of substituting the taylor plate model for the case model to generate the data for regression is also evaluated based on the correlation between the fitted shock factor prediction function and the actual response the taylor plate model is only recommended to obtain the time history peak structural response as for the application in the surface ship design the structural response at the subdivision block bottom center is shown to represent the response of the entire block fairly well as a result the shock factor prediction model obtained at the bottom center of each subdivision block can be used to approximate the structural response across the ship and potentially as a metric for locating equipment in early stage ship design provisional applications of the shock factor in later stage ship design are also discussed despite the fact that the proposed modified shock factor could be adapted to general ship structure its good behavior found in the specific surface ship evaluated in this paper may only exist in the ships with similar geometry therefore the modified shock factor remains to be assessed in more types of surface ships such as the multi hulls in the future work credit

20937,a non hydrostatic model is developed to predict internal wave generations and propagations the model employs a semi implicit fractional step algorithm to solve the governing equations based on the cartesian grid system immersed boundary method is incorporated to deal with the complex geometry of uneven bottoms the combination of the z level vertical coordinate and the immersed boundary method enables the model to treat uneven bottoms and meanwhile to avoid numerical errors in the calculation of the baroclinic pressure force to consider the effect of stratification a variant of the smagorinsky sub grid scale model is employed to calculate the eddy viscosity and diffusivity the capability of the model in resolving internal wave generation by tidal forcing over an idealized gaussian shaped topography is firstly validated by comparing the developed model with a terrain following non hydrostatic model then two laboratory scale test cases involving internal solitary wave propagations over variable topographies are considered it can be found that the model captures the main characteristics of waveform evolution including internal hydraulic jump wave breaking and waveform inversion thus the proposed model provide an alternative to simulate internal wave generations and propagations keywords non hydrostatic model internal wave immersed boundary method variable topography vortex evolution 1 introduction many field observations azevedo et al 2006 klymak and gregg 2004 nash et al 2006 vázquez et al 2008 zhao et al 2004 have confirmed that internal waves are ubiquitous in oceanic environment the life cycle of an internal wave typically consists of three general stages including generations propagations and dissipations internal waves are generated by either tidal forcing over bottom topography or wind forcing at the free surface wunsch 1998 in the propagation stage internal waves usually encounter variable topographies which may induce strong turbulent mixing and has important effect on local oceanic ecological environment moreover the transmitted waves may propagate shoreward and affect coastal or oceanic structures over the past several decades many numerical simulations have been conducted to investigate the generation khatiwala 2003 lai et al 2010 legg and klymak 2008 shaw et al 2009 vlasenko and stashchuk 2006 zhang et al 2011 and propagation chen et al 2016 cheng et al 2009 guo and chen 2012 hsieh et al 2015 2016 keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 lynett and liu 2002 zhang et al 2011 zhu et al 2016 of internal waves among these numerical simulations numerical models developed based on navier stokes equations nse have attracted more attention from researchers because they can accurately predict the whole life cycle of an internal wave with acceptable time expense in the nse based models there are mainly three methods to deal with the free surface including the rigid lid approximation garcia et al 2019 shaw et al 2009 zhu et al 2016 the volume of fluid vof method chen et al 2016 hsieh et al 2015 2016 and the free surface equation method ai and ding 2016 keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 lai et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 non hydrostatic models just employ the free surface equation to capture the moving free surface in the development of non hydrostatic models they are usually based upon a vertical terrain following coordinate system e g σ coordinate system which can better fit the bottom topography however in the simulation of internal waves involving steep bottom topography the terrain following coordinate system may induce large errors due to the discretization of the baroclinic pressure gradient force berntsen et al 2015 to address this issue researchers have proposed different methods berntsen 2011 berntsen and oey 2010 stelling and van kester 1994 however these methods cannot eliminate the errors of the terrain following coordinate system completely and meanwhile may reduce the model efficiency an option for developing a numerical model in which there is no need to treat the baroclinic pressure gradient force particularly is to incorporate a z level vertical coordinate into the model although the baroclinic pressure gradient force can be accurately estimated in models based upon the z level vertical coordinate an artificial vertical structure of the flow berntsen et al 2006 kleptsova et al 2010 can be introduced by the presence of uneven bottoms to avoid such an artificial flow a remapping procedure kleptsova et al 2010 for z levels should be employed in addition to enable the z coordinate models to deal with uneven bottoms immersed boundary ib method is also an option in the implementation of ib method variable topographies are treated as virtual solids and replaced by ib forces therefore ib method can be easily incorporated into any z coordinate models and has been widely applied in the simulation of surface wave structure interactions ai et al 2018 2019a kang et al 2015 ma et al 2016 2019 however there are a few numerical models incorporating the ib method for predicting internal waves zhu et al 2016 and zhu et al 2017 studied the internal solitary wave propagation over an underwater ridge and shoaling broad crested internal solitary waves respectively their numerical model is based upon the nse but imposes the rigid lid approximation on the free surface in this paper we present a free surface non hydrostatic model incorporating the ib method to simulate internal wave generations and propagations a semi implicit fractional step algorithm is used to solve the unsteady nse following former works ai et al 2018 ai and ding 2016 a cartesian grid framework is employed in the model compared with the model developed by ai et al 2018 which aims to predict surface wave interaction with a floating suspended structure the main works of the present paper are to 1 present a free surface non hydrostatic model incorporating the ib method for predicting internal waves 2 incorporate a density equation to predict the density variable and employ a high resolution finite volume method to solve it 3 validate the developed model by using test cases involving internal wave generations or propagations although the same ib method and semi implicit algorithm are implemented in the present model and the model proposed by ai et al 2018 the poisson equation in this model has the same form as that in the model not incorporating the ib method because only variable topographies are considered however the poisson equation in the former model ai et al 2018 is disturbed by the implementation of ib method and needs to be solved with higher computational cost the model developed by ai and ding 2016 employs an orthogonal unstructured grid system to cover the horizontal computational domain and a boundary fitted coordinate system to discretize the vertical domain because of the incorporation of the vertical boundary fitted coordinate system the model introduced a nonlinear interpolation method developed by stelling and van kester 1994 to deal with the baroclinic pressure gradient force however the model can induce more numerical errors in the calculation of the baroclinic term in the presence of steep bottom topography the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents governing equations numerical discretizations the ib method and the overall solution procedure are given in section 3 in section 4 corresponding results of three test cases to assess the performance of the developed model are provided finally we draw some conclusions in section 5 2 governing equations the non hydrostatic model is developed based upon the following mass and momentum conservation equations which can be expressed in the two dimensional vertical 2dv plane as follows 1 u x w z 0 2 u t u 2 x u w z g η x q x g x z η ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 d ζ x a h u x z a v u z 3 w t u w x w 2 z q z x a h w x z a v w z where u and w are velocity components in the horizontal x and vertical z directions respectively t is time η is the free surface elevation q is the non hydrostatic pressure component g is the gravitational acceleration ρ is the water density ρ 0 denotes a constant reference density a h and a v are horizontal and vertical eddy viscosities respectively actually the developed model is based upon three dimensional governing equations however for the sake of brevity only 2dv governing equations are given above since the following numerical approximations can be extended straightforwardly to 3d problems in eqs 2 and 3 the pressure p has been decomposed into the sum of its hydrostatic and non hydrostatic components as follows 4 p ρ g η z ρ g z η ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 d ζ ρ q where the first and second terms on the right hand side are the barotropic and baroclinic contributions to the hydrostatic pressure respectively correspondingly the third term on the right hand side of eq 2 represents the baroclinic pressure gradient force the governing equation for the density transport can be expressed by the following equation 5 ρ t ρ u x ρ w z x k h ρ x z k v ρ z where k h and k v are the horizontal and vertical diffusivity coefficients respectively in this study eddy viscosities and diffusivity coefficients are set to constant values for internal wave generations for internal solitary wave propagations the horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficient are determined by the following classic smagorinsky subgrid scale model smagorinsky 1963 6 a h k h l s 2 2 s i j s i j l s c s δ x δ z 1 2 where c s 0 2 is used in the simulation δ x and δ z are the horizontal and vertical grid sizes respectively see fig 1 and s i j is the rate of strain to consider the effect of stratification the vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficient are computed by the following modified version of smagorinsky model 7 a v k v f r i l s 2 2 s i j s i j where f r i is a function of the richardson number r i and is calculated as follows 8 f r i 1 1 r i r i c 0 for r i 0 for 0 r i r i c for r i r i c with 9 r i n 2 u z 2 where n g ρ 0 ρ z is the buoyancy frequency and r i c 0 25 is the critical threshold finally the free surface elevation η is determined by the following so called free surface equation which is obtained by integrating the continuity eq 1 and meanwhile considering kinematic boundary conditions at the free surface and the bottom 10 η t x z d z η u d z 0 where z d is the bottom surface notably in this study d is a constant value because the variable topography is treated as the immersed boundary 3 numerical approximations before discretizing equations 1 3 and 5 and 10 the 2dv computational domain is covered by a rectangular grid system which has a set of n x and n z cells in the x and z directions respectively by introducing i and k as the grid indexes in the x and z directions respectively variables are defined in the following way as shown in fig 1 the horizontal velocity component u is stored at the vertical face centers of a cell i 1 2 k the vertical velocity component w and the density variable ρ are defined at the cell centers i k the non hydrostatic pressure component is located at the horizontal face centers of a cell i k 1 2 3 1 discretizations of the momentum equations following the former work ai et al 2018 the continuity eq 1 and the momentum eqs 2 and 3 are solved by using an explicit projection method which can be divided into the following two major steps the first step is to calculate intermediate velocities u i 1 2 k n 1 2 and w i k n 1 2 by solving eqs 2 and 3 in which the non hydrostatic pressure components are neglected yielding 11 u i 1 2 k n 1 2 u i 1 2 k n δ t a d v u i 1 2 k n g η x i 1 2 n θ b c i 1 2 n d i f f u i 1 2 k n 12 w i k n 1 2 w i k n δ t a d v w i k n d i f f w i k n where a d v u i 1 2 k n and a d v w i k n represent advection terms for the horizontal and vertical momentum equations respectively d i f f u i 1 2 k n and d i f f w i k n are diffusion terms for the horizontal and vertical momentum equations respectively the advection terms are discretized by a finite volume method more details about this can be referred to ai et al 2011 the diffusion terms can be easily discretized by the central difference method the free surface gradient term in eq 11 is discretized by a semi implicit method this yields 13 η x i 1 2 n θ 1 θ η i 1 n η i n δ x i θ η i 1 n 1 η i n 1 δ x i where θ is an implicitness factor and is chosen to be 0 55 for stability b c represents the baroclinic pressure gradient force and can be discretized in the following way 14 b c i 1 2 n g x z η ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 d ζ i 1 2 n g δ x i ρ 0 l k n z β l ρ i 1 l n ρ i l n δ z l n where β k 1 2 and β l 1 l k 1 k 2 n z in this second step by correcting the intermediate values the following new velocities u i 1 2 k n 1 and w i k n 1 can be calculated 15 u i 1 2 k n 1 u i 1 2 k n 1 2 δ t q x i 1 2 k n 1 f i b f u i 1 2 k 16 w i k n 1 w i k n 1 2 δ t q z i k n 1 f i b f w i k the finite difference approximations of the non hydrostatic pressure gradient terms in eqs 15 and 16 are given as follows 17 q x i 1 2 k n 1 q i 1 k 1 n 1 q i 1 k n 1 q i k 1 n 1 q i k n 1 2 δ x i 18 q z i k n 1 q i k 1 n 1 q i k n 1 δ z k the ib forces f i b f u i 1 2 k and f i b f w i k have been included in eqs 15 and 16 the treatments of them will be described in section 3 4 notably eqs 2 and 3 are directly discretized and solved by using the explicit projection method in this model this is different from the numerical algorithm presented in ai et al 2018 in which before discretizing the continuity and momentum equations an integration procedure is applied because a boundary fitted vertical coordinate system ai et al 2014 is employed in their model 3 2 discretizations of the continuity and the free surface equations a semi implicit finite difference approximation of the continuity eq 1 is 19 u x i k 1 2 n θ w z i k 1 2 n θ 0 for k 2 n z 20 u x i k 1 2 n θ 1 θ u i 1 2 k 1 2 n u i 1 2 k 1 2 n δ x i θ u i 1 2 k 1 2 n 1 u i 1 2 k 1 2 n 1 δ x i 1 θ u i 1 2 k 1 n u i 1 2 k n u i 1 2 k 1 n u i 1 2 k n 2 δ x i θ u i 1 2 k 1 n

2011 and ai et al 2019b this yields 22 u x i 1 2 n θ 1 θ u i 1 2 1 n u i 1 2 1 n δ x i θ u i 1 2 1 n 1 u i 1 2 1 n 1 δ x i 23 w z i 1 2 n θ 1 θ w i 1 n θ w i 1 n 1 δ z 1 2 a semi implicit finite volume approximation of the free surface eq 10 is 24 η i n 1 η i n δ t 1 δ x i k k i b n z u i 1 2 k n θ δ z i 1 2 k k k i b n z u i 1 2 k n θ δ z i 1 2 k 0 3 3 discretization of the density equation the density equation is discretized by a high resolution finite volume method which is proposed by casulli and zanolli 2005 this gives 25 δ x i δ z k ρ i k n 1 ρ i k n δ t δ z i 1 2 k u i 1 2 k n θ ρ i 1 k n ρ i k n 2 δ z i 1 2 k u i 1 2 k n θ ρ i k n ρ i 1 k n 2 1 2 φ i 1 2 k δ z i 1 2 k u i 1 2 k n θ ρ i 1 k n ρ i k n φ i 1 2 k δ z i 1 2 k u i 1 2 k n θ ρ i k n ρ i 1 k n δ x i w i k 1 2 n θ ρ i

θ 1 θ w i k 1 2 n θ w i k 1 2 n 1 and 26 φ 1 φ r where φ r is the flux limiter function φ r 0 corresponds to an upwind scheme and φ r 1 corresponds to the second order central difference scheme the determination of φ r can be referred to casulli and zanolli 2005 notably eq 25 satisfies the conservation of mass and is monotonicity preserving for each cell the set of equation 25 form a linear tridiagonal system which is solved by using the thomas algorithm 3 4 the implementation of immersed boundary method in eqs 15 and 16 the ib forces f i b f u i 1 2 k and f i b f w i k can be expressed as follows 27 f i b f u i 1 2 k u i 1 2 k n 1 u i 1 2 k n 1 2 δ t q x i 1 2 k n 1 on or near the ib 0 elsewhere 28 f i b f w i k w i k n 1 w i k n 1 2 δ t q z i k n 1 on or near the ib 0 elsewhere where u i 1 2 k n 1 and w i k n 1 are ib velocities as shown in fig 2 to impose a no slip boundary condition at the uneven bottom the ib velocities are calculated by the following linear interpolation method proposed by fadlun et al 2000 29 u i 1 2 k n 1 δ x δ x i δ x u i 1 2 k n 1 2 30 w i 1 k n 1 δ z δ z k δ z k 1 2 δ z w i 1 k n 1 2 where δ x and δ z are the horizontal and vertical distances between the ib velocity points and the uneven bottom boundary respectively in the implementation of the ib method the ib velocities are imposed as an internal boundary condition so that all the variables inside the uneven bottom are not involved in the computation 3 5 solution procedure at each time step the new flow variables u i 1 2 k n 1 w i k n 1 and η i n 1 and the density variable ρ i k n 1 are computed by solving corresponding equations the main solution procedure is summarized as follows 1 substitute eqs 11 and 12 and eqs 15 and 16 into eq 24 yielding a strongly diagonally dominant system for η i n 1 which is solved by the gauss seidel iterative method by neglecting the non hydrostatic pressure terms 2 compute the intermediate velocities u i 1 2 k n 1 2 and w i k n 1 2 by solving eqs 11 and 12 3 substitute eqs 15 and 16 into eq 19 and consider the zero pressure condition at the free surface q i n z 1 2 n 1 0 yielding the poisson equation for q i k 1 2 n 1 which is also a symmetric system and is solved by the conjugate gradient method notably the coefficient matrix of the poisson equation presented in ai et al 2018 is not symmetric because their model was developed for wave interactions with a floating suspended structure 4 compute the new velocities u i 1 2 k n 1 and w i k n 1 by solving eqs 15 and 16 5 repeat steps 1 to 4 until the convergence of the free surface elevation is reached 6 compute the density variable ρ i k n 1 by solving eq 25 4 numerical experiments the capabilities of the developed model are evaluated by considering three test cases the first test case concerns internal wave generation by tidal flow over an idealized gaussian shaped topography which is a real scale test case the last two test cases are laboratory scale test cases involving internal solitary wave propagations over variable topography 4 1 internal waves induced by tidal flow over an idealized topography internal waves are typically induced by the interaction between barotropic tidal flow and topography many numerical simulations mentioned before have been conducted to investigate the generation process similar to other works shaw et al 2009 xie et al 2011 an idealized gaussian shaped ridge defined by eq 31 is considered in this study 31 h x h 0 h m exp x 2 2 w 2 where h m 600 m and w 15000 m are the height and the scale width of the ridge respectively as shown in fig 3 the computational domain ranges from 200 km to 200 km in the x direction the still water depth is h 0 800 m the initial density distribution is given according to 32 ρ z ρ 0 δ ρ 2 1 tanh z z 0 d where δ ρ 6 kg m3 is the density difference z 0 50 m is the center of the pycnocline and d 120 m is the pycnocline thickness a m 2 tide is generated by specifying an external velocity on the left boundary 33 u t l e f t u 0 sin ω m 2 t where u 0 0 1 m s and ω m 2 0 000140526 rad s at the right boundary x r 200 km following keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 an external velocity is imposed to allow the tide to propagate through the computational domain 34 u z t r i g h t 1 10 x x r 10 δ x x r u x z t d x for this test case the coriolis force is included in the model and the coriolis parameter is fixed at f 5 1 10 5 rad s constant values of horizontal and vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity are used namely a h 1 0 10 1 m2 s a v 1 0 10 3 m2 s and k h k v 1 0 10 7 m2 s in this computation the horizontal and vertical grid sizes are set to δ x 200 m and δ z 10 m respectively for the present model for comparison numerical results obtained by the vertical boundary fitted non hydrostatic model hereafter called the bfnh model ai and ding 2016 was provided to discretize the horizontal computational domain the bfnh model adopts an orthogonal unstructured grid system in which the segment joining the centers of two adjacent cells is orthogonal to the side shared by the two cells examples of such a grid system are triangular grids rectangular grids and even hybrid grids comprising rectangular and triangular grids in this study we only use rectangular grids with the grid size of δ x 200 m to discretize the horizontal domain in the vertical direction 80 equidistant layers are employed fig 4 shows a schematic diagram to compare the two computational grid systems fig 5 depicts comparisons of internal wave generation process between the present model results and the bfnh model results in which t 2 π ω m 2 is the tidal period it can be found that the two model results are very similar both models show that upstream and downstream internal wave packets are produced due to the interaction between tidal flow and the localized topography at t 0 5 t a depression in the pycnocline first forms in the lee side of the ridge by the tidal flow then at t 1 0 t the depression passes over the ridge as the tide reverses from t 1 0 t to 1 5 t the upstream depression departs from the ridge and transforms to an internal bore due to nonlinear wave steepening at t 1 75 t the upstream internal wave packet has produced and subsequently induces more rank ordered internal waves at t 2 25 t in addition it can be seen that another depression in the lee side of the ridge has formed at t 1 25 t afterwards it propagates in the downstream direction and also transforms to an internal bore at t 1 75 t finally the bore evolves into the downstream internal wave packet at t 2 25 t 4 2 internal solitary wave propagation over a triangular ridge chen 2007 conducted a series of physical experiments to investigate an internal solitary wave isw propagating over a triangular ridge these experiments have been used for the validation of a few numerical models hsieh et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 in this study as shown in fig 6 the numerical wave flume is 12 m long and contains a two layered fluid the overall depth of the two layers is 0 5 m the ratio of the depth of the upper layer to that of the lower layer is h 1 h 2 1 4 the upper and lower fluid densities are 996 kg m3 and 1030 kg m3 respectively the height of the ridge h s is 0 3 m both sides of the wave flume are solid walls the isw of depression is generated in the right side of the computational domain by using the gravity collapse method kao et al 1985 and then propagates along the negative x direction the interface between the two layered fluids is initialized by a hyperbolic tangent density profile the amplitude of the incident isw is 0 056 m the horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficient are computed by eq 6 while the vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficient are calculated by eq 7 the effects of grid sizes and the interface thickness δ on the calculated interface displacement are firstly investigated comparisons of the interface displacement among the three sets of numerical results with different grid sizes and the experimental data are plotted in fig 7 three computational meshes as shown in table 1 are considered and all the numerical results are obtained by setting δ 0 02 m the numerical results obtained by the three computational meshes are quite similar demonstrating grid convergence has been achieved all the numerical results overestimate the leading wave trough at station g2 however the model results are in generally good agreement with the measured data and the model captures generally well wave propagation over the ridge fig 8 shows the sensitivity of the calculated interface displacement to the interface thickness the interface thickness has a certain effect on the interface displacement especially for the stations g2 g3 and g5 overall the model results with δ 0 02 and 0 03 m are slightly better than those obtained by δ 0 01 m fig 9 compares the present model results with other two model results the bfnh model also uses the same horizontal grid size to discretize the domain but in the vertical direction adopts a boundary fitted coordinate system with 100 equidistant layers in the vof model results by hsieh et al 2015 a grid system of 1200 250 is employed and the k ε model is used for the turbulent closure at station g2 both the present model and the bfnh model overestimate the leading wave trough while the vof model behaves well for the bfnh model unphysical oscillation can be observed at stations g2 and g3 this is caused by the fact that the bfnh model can induce more numerical errors in the calculation of the baroclinic term in the presence of steep bottom topography however after the isw propagated over the ridge the oscillation gets smaller at station g4 and even disappears at station g5 this may be because the strong mixing between the upper and lower layer fluids induced by the wave breaking suppressed the oscillation fig 10 depicts the calculated density fields obtained by mesh 1 and δ 0 02 m around the triangular ridge at several representative times the corresponding vorticity fields and velocity fields are also shown in fig 9 at the time t 0 s the wave front arrives on the slope and there is almost no change in the waveform see fig 10 a the main characteristics of the isw can be detected from figs 10 a and fig 11 a which show a density depression with an anticlockwise vortex in fig 10 b the wave front tends to parallel to the front slope of the ridge and the pycnocline of the wave front becomes thinner as the same time downward sloping velocities between the wave front and the slope increase dramatically see fig 11 b after that an internal hydraulic jump has been formed as shown in fig 10 c subsequently wave breaking occurs see fig 10 d and induces the following strong mixing between the upper and lower layer fluids see fig 10 e and f from fig 11 b f it can be found that during the isw propagating over the ridge a strong anticlockwise vortex always persists near the apex of the ridge the intensity of which is even larger than that of the vortex embedded in the isw 4 3 internal solitary wave propagation over a slope shelf topography the final test case concerns an isw propagating over a slope shelf topography cheng and hsu 2010 conducted a series of physical experiments to investigate the propagation process then a few numerical simulations cheng et al 2011 hsieh et al 2016 were carried out to study this process the numerical wave flume and gauge stations are presented in fig 12 the computational domain has a length of 14 0 m the depth of the upper layer is h 1 0 14 m and in the lower layer the depth h 2 0 41 m the height of the slope shelf topography is h s 0 37 m and the length of the slope is l s 1 5 m similar to the previous test case the upper and lower fluid densities are taken as 996 kg m3 and 1030 kg m3 respectively the interface between the two layered fluids is also initialized by a hyperbolic tangent density profile with a thickness of 0 02 m both sides of the wave flume are also solid walls an isw with an amplitude of 0 05 m is generated in the right side of the domain following the gravity collapse method we also adopted a grid system with δ x 0 01 m and δ z 0 005 m to cover the 2dv computational domain the eddy viscosities and diffusivity coefficients are also determined following the former test case fig 13 shows the comparisons of the interface displacement among the three sets of numerical results and experimental data at five gauge stations in the bfnh model the horizontal domain is discretized using δ x 0 01 m and 110 equidistance layers are employed in the vertical direction the vof model adopts δ x 0 01 m and δ z 0 002 m to cover the 2dv domain and employs the k ε model for the turbulent closure the present model underestimates the main waveform at station g2 and overestimates it at station g4 the vof model predicts the main waveform at stations g2 and g4 very well overall the present model shows generally good agreement with the experiment and captures the main evolution of the waveform during the propagation of the isw over slope shelf topography the agreement between the bfnh model results and experimental data are also generally good at stations g1 g2 and g3 however very poor results at stations g4 and g5 are obtained by the bfnh model this is mainly due to the aforementioned fact that large errors can be induced by the bfnh model in the presence of steep bottom topography fig 14 displays the calculated density fields at several representative times the corresponding vorticity fields and velocity fields are shown in fig 15 at the time t 0 s the waveform begins to deform see fig 14 a while the isw approaches the slope the thickness of the bottom layer at the upper reach of the slope becomes thinner see fig 14 b and downward sloping velocities between the wave front and the upper reach of the slope increase see fig 15 a and b as a result the wave front is blocked and the rear of the isw becomes steeper this leads to the formation of an internal hydraulic jump as shown in fig 14 c with the development of the internal hydraulic jump a bore with a clockwise vortex forms see figs 14 d and fig 15 d during the bore propagating over the shoulder of the slope shelf topography an elevated waveform is gradually produced see fig 14 d f and the intensity of the clockwise vortex becomes larger see fig 15 d f hereafter the elevated waveform disintegrates into two elevated waveforms and accordingly the stronger vortex is split into two vortices with the same direction 5 conclusions this paper presents a non hydrostatic model for predicting internal wave generations and propagations the model addresses variable topographies with the implementation of ib method the governing equations are solved by a semi implicit fractional step algorithm based on the cartesian grid system the model not only avoid numerical errors in the calculation of the baroclinic pressure gradient force but also can deal with any complex uneven bottoms due to the incorporation of the z level vertical coordinate and ib method the eddy viscosity and diffusivity are evaluated by a variant of the smagorinsky sub grid scale model which takes into account the effect of stratification for the test case concerning internal wave generations the developed model accurately captures the process of the internal wave generation compared with the bfnh model demonstrating the capability of the model in resolving internal waves induced by tidal flow over a topography in the last two examples involving internal wave propagations the present model results of the interface displacement show generally good agreement with experimental data and the present model can reproduce the waveform evolution including internal hydraulic jump wave breaking and waveform inversion these demonstrate that the present model is capable of predicting internal wave propagations over variable topographies moreover the present model also can reasonably resolve the vortex evolution during the isw propagating over a variable topography however the bfnh model behaves not well in the last two examples because it can induce more numerical errors in the calculation of the baroclinic term in the presence of steep bottom topography in general the developed model can be viewed as an alternative to accurately predict internal wave generations and propagations credit authorship contribution statement congfang ai methodology software

20937,a non hydrostatic model is developed to predict internal wave generations and propagations the model employs a semi implicit fractional step algorithm to solve the governing equations based on the cartesian grid system immersed boundary method is incorporated to deal with the complex geometry of uneven bottoms the combination of the z level vertical coordinate and the immersed boundary method enables the model to treat uneven bottoms and meanwhile to avoid numerical errors in the calculation of the baroclinic pressure force to consider the effect of stratification a variant of the smagorinsky sub grid scale model is employed to calculate the eddy viscosity and diffusivity the capability of the model in resolving internal wave generation by tidal forcing over an idealized gaussian shaped topography is firstly validated by comparing the developed model with a terrain following non hydrostatic model then two laboratory scale test cases involving internal solitary wave propagations over variable topographies are considered it can be found that the model captures the main characteristics of waveform evolution including internal hydraulic jump wave breaking and waveform inversion thus the proposed model provide an alternative to simulate internal wave generations and propagations keywords non hydrostatic model internal wave immersed boundary method variable topography vortex evolution 1 introduction many field observations azevedo et al 2006 klymak and gregg 2004 nash et al 2006 vázquez et al 2008 zhao et al 2004 have confirmed that internal waves are ubiquitous in oceanic environment the life cycle of an internal wave typically consists of three general stages including generations propagations and dissipations internal waves are generated by either tidal forcing over bottom topography or wind forcing at the free surface wunsch 1998 in the propagation stage internal waves usually encounter variable topographies which may induce strong turbulent mixing and has important effect on local oceanic ecological environment moreover the transmitted waves may propagate shoreward and affect coastal or oceanic structures over the past several decades many numerical simulations have been conducted to investigate the generation khatiwala 2003 lai et al 2010 legg and klymak 2008 shaw et al 2009 vlasenko and stashchuk 2006 zhang et al 2011 and propagation chen et al 2016 cheng et al 2009 guo and chen 2012 hsieh et al 2015 2016 keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 lynett and liu 2002 zhang et al 2011 zhu et al 2016 of internal waves among these numerical simulations numerical models developed based on navier stokes equations nse have attracted more attention from researchers because they can accurately predict the whole life cycle of an internal wave with acceptable time expense in the nse based models there are mainly three methods to deal with the free surface including the rigid lid approximation garcia et al 2019 shaw et al 2009 zhu et al 2016 the volume of fluid vof method chen et al 2016 hsieh et al 2015 2016 and the free surface equation method ai and ding 2016 keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 lai et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 non hydrostatic models just employ the free surface equation to capture the moving free surface in the development of non hydrostatic models they are usually based upon a vertical terrain following coordinate system e g σ coordinate system which can better fit the bottom topography however in the simulation of internal waves involving steep bottom topography the terrain following coordinate system may induce large errors due to the discretization of the baroclinic pressure gradient force berntsen et al 2015 to address this issue researchers have proposed different methods berntsen 2011 berntsen and oey 2010 stelling and van kester 1994 however these methods cannot eliminate the errors of the terrain following coordinate system completely and meanwhile may reduce the model efficiency an option for developing a numerical model in which there is no need to treat the baroclinic pressure gradient force particularly is to incorporate a z level vertical coordinate into the model although the baroclinic pressure gradient force can be accurately estimated in models based upon the z level vertical coordinate an artificial vertical structure of the flow berntsen et al 2006 kleptsova et al 2010 can be introduced by the presence of uneven bottoms to avoid such an artificial flow a remapping procedure kleptsova et al 2010 for z levels should be employed in addition to enable the z coordinate models to deal with uneven bottoms immersed boundary ib method is also an option in the implementation of ib method variable topographies are treated as virtual solids and replaced by ib forces therefore ib method can be easily incorporated into any z coordinate models and has been widely applied in the simulation of surface wave structure interactions ai et al 2018 2019a kang et al 2015 ma et al 2016 2019 however there are a few numerical models incorporating the ib method for predicting internal waves zhu et al 2016 and zhu et al 2017 studied the internal solitary wave propagation over an underwater ridge and shoaling broad crested internal solitary waves respectively their numerical model is based upon the nse but imposes the rigid lid approximation on the free surface in this paper we present a free surface non hydrostatic model incorporating the ib method to simulate internal wave generations and propagations a semi implicit fractional step algorithm is used to solve the unsteady nse following former works ai et al 2018 ai and ding 2016 a cartesian grid framework is employed in the model compared with the model developed by ai et al 2018 which aims to predict surface wave interaction with a floating suspended structure the main works of the present paper are to 1 present a free surface non hydrostatic model incorporating the ib method for predicting internal waves 2 incorporate a density equation to predict the density variable and employ a high resolution finite volume method to solve it 3 validate the developed model by using test cases involving internal wave generations or propagations although the same ib method and semi implicit algorithm are implemented in the present model and the model proposed by ai et al 2018 the poisson equation in this model has the same form as that in the model not incorporating the ib method because only variable topographies are considered however the poisson equation in the former model ai et al 2018 is disturbed by the implementation of ib method and needs to be solved with higher computational cost the model developed by ai and ding 2016 employs an orthogonal unstructured grid system to cover the horizontal computational domain and a boundary fitted coordinate system to discretize the vertical domain because of the incorporation of the vertical boundary fitted coordinate system the model introduced a nonlinear interpolation method developed by stelling and van kester 1994 to deal with the baroclinic pressure gradient force however the model can induce more numerical errors in the calculation of the baroclinic term in the presence of steep bottom topography the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents governing equations numerical discretizations the ib method and the overall solution procedure are given in section 3 in section 4 corresponding results of three test cases to assess the performance of the developed model are provided finally we draw some conclusions in section 5 2 governing equations the non hydrostatic model is developed based upon the following mass and momentum conservation equations which can be expressed in the two dimensional vertical 2dv plane as follows 1 u x w z 0 2 u t u 2 x u w z g η x q x g x z η ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 d ζ x a h u x z a v u z 3 w t u w x w 2 z q z x a h w x z a v w z where u and w are velocity components in the horizontal x and vertical z directions respectively t is time η is the free surface elevation q is the non hydrostatic pressure component g is the gravitational acceleration ρ is the water density ρ 0 denotes a constant reference density a h and a v are horizontal and vertical eddy viscosities respectively actually the developed model is based upon three dimensional governing equations however for the sake of brevity only 2dv governing equations are given above since the following numerical approximations can be extended straightforwardly to 3d problems in eqs 2 and 3 the pressure p has been decomposed into the sum of its hydrostatic and non hydrostatic components as follows 4 p ρ g η z ρ g z η ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 d ζ ρ q where the first and second terms on the right hand side are the barotropic and baroclinic contributions to the hydrostatic pressure respectively correspondingly the third term on the right hand side of eq 2 represents the baroclinic pressure gradient force the governing equation for the density transport can be expressed by the following equation 5 ρ t ρ u x ρ w z x k h ρ x z k v ρ z where k h and k v are the horizontal and vertical diffusivity coefficients respectively in this study eddy viscosities and diffusivity coefficients are set to constant values for internal wave generations for internal solitary wave propagations the horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficient are determined by the following classic smagorinsky subgrid scale model smagorinsky 1963 6 a h k h l s 2 2 s i j s i j l s c s δ x δ z 1 2 where c s 0 2 is used in the simulation δ x and δ z are the horizontal and vertical grid sizes respectively see fig 1 and s i j is the rate of strain to consider the effect of stratification the vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficient are computed by the following modified version of smagorinsky model 7 a v k v f r i l s 2 2 s i j s i j where f r i is a function of the richardson number r i and is calculated as follows 8 f r i 1 1 r i r i c 0 for r i 0 for 0 r i r i c for r i r i c with 9 r i n 2 u z 2 where n g ρ 0 ρ z is the buoyancy frequency and r i c 0 25 is the critical threshold finally the free surface elevation η is determined by the following so called free surface equation which is obtained by integrating the continuity eq 1 and meanwhile considering kinematic boundary conditions at the free surface and the bottom 10 η t x z d z η u d z 0 where z d is the bottom surface notably in this study d is a constant value because the variable topography is treated as the immersed boundary 3 numerical approximations before discretizing equations 1 3 and 5 and 10 the 2dv computational domain is covered by a rectangular grid system which has a set of n x and n z cells in the x and z directions respectively by introducing i and k as the grid indexes in the x and z directions respectively variables are defined in the following way as shown in fig 1 the horizontal velocity component u is stored at the vertical face centers of a cell i 1 2 k the vertical velocity component w and the density variable ρ are defined at the cell centers i k the non hydrostatic pressure component is located at the horizontal face centers of a cell i k 1 2 3 1 discretizations of the momentum equations following the former work ai et al 2018 the continuity eq 1 and the momentum eqs 2 and 3 are solved by using an explicit projection method which can be divided into the following two major steps the first step is to calculate intermediate velocities u i 1 2 k n 1 2 and w i k n 1 2 by solving eqs 2 and 3 in which the non hydrostatic pressure components are neglected yielding 11 u i 1 2 k n 1 2 u i 1 2 k n δ t a d v u i 1 2 k n g η x i 1 2 n θ b c i 1 2 n d i f f u i 1 2 k n 12 w i k n 1 2 w i k n δ t a d v w i k n d i f f w i k n where a d v u i 1 2 k n and a d v w i k n represent advection terms for the horizontal and vertical momentum equations respectively d i f f u i 1 2 k n and d i f f w i k n are diffusion terms for the horizontal and vertical momentum equations respectively the advection terms are discretized by a finite volume method more details about this can be referred to ai et al 2011 the diffusion terms can be easily discretized by the central difference method the free surface gradient term in eq 11 is discretized by a semi implicit method this yields 13 η x i 1 2 n θ 1 θ η i 1 n η i n δ x i θ η i 1 n 1 η i n 1 δ x i where θ is an implicitness factor and is chosen to be 0 55 for stability b c represents the baroclinic pressure gradient force and can be discretized in the following way 14 b c i 1 2 n g x z η ρ ρ 0 ρ 0 d ζ i 1 2 n g δ x i ρ 0 l k n z β l ρ i 1 l n ρ i l n δ z l n where β k 1 2 and β l 1 l k 1 k 2 n z in this second step by correcting the intermediate values the following new velocities u i 1 2 k n 1 and w i k n 1 can be calculated 15 u i 1 2 k n 1 u i 1 2 k n 1 2 δ t q x i 1 2 k n 1 f i b f u i 1 2 k 16 w i k n 1 w i k n 1 2 δ t q z i k n 1 f i b f w i k the finite difference approximations of the non hydrostatic pressure gradient terms in eqs 15 and 16 are given as follows 17 q x i 1 2 k n 1 q i 1 k 1 n 1 q i 1 k n 1 q i k 1 n 1 q i k n 1 2 δ x i 18 q z i k n 1 q i k 1 n 1 q i k n 1 δ z k the ib forces f i b f u i 1 2 k and f i b f w i k have been included in eqs 15 and 16 the treatments of them will be described in section 3 4 notably eqs 2 and 3 are directly discretized and solved by using the explicit projection method in this model this is different from the numerical algorithm presented in ai et al 2018 in which before discretizing the continuity and momentum equations an integration procedure is applied because a boundary fitted vertical coordinate system ai et al 2014 is employed in their model 3 2 discretizations of the continuity and the free surface equations a semi implicit finite difference approximation of the continuity eq 1 is 19 u x i k 1 2 n θ w z i k 1 2 n θ 0 for k 2 n z 20 u x i k 1 2 n θ 1 θ u i 1 2 k 1 2 n u i 1 2 k 1 2 n δ x i θ u i 1 2 k 1 2 n 1 u i 1 2 k 1 2 n 1 δ x i 1 θ u i 1 2 k 1 n u i 1 2 k n u i 1 2 k 1 n u i 1 2 k n 2 δ x i θ u i 1 2 k 1 n

2011 and ai et al 2019b this yields 22 u x i 1 2 n θ 1 θ u i 1 2 1 n u i 1 2 1 n δ x i θ u i 1 2 1 n 1 u i 1 2 1 n 1 δ x i 23 w z i 1 2 n θ 1 θ w i 1 n θ w i 1 n 1 δ z 1 2 a semi implicit finite volume approximation of the free surface eq 10 is 24 η i n 1 η i n δ t 1 δ x i k k i b n z u i 1 2 k n θ δ z i 1 2 k k k i b n z u i 1 2 k n θ δ z i 1 2 k 0 3 3 discretization of the density equation the density equation is discretized by a high resolution finite volume method which is proposed by casulli and zanolli 2005 this gives 25 δ x i δ z k ρ i k n 1 ρ i k n δ t δ z i 1 2 k u i 1 2 k n θ ρ i 1 k n ρ i k n 2 δ z i 1 2 k u i 1 2 k n θ ρ i k n ρ i 1 k n 2 1 2 φ i 1 2 k δ z i 1 2 k u i 1 2 k n θ ρ i 1 k n ρ i k n φ i 1 2 k δ z i 1 2 k u i 1 2 k n θ ρ i k n ρ i 1 k n δ x i w i k 1 2 n θ ρ i

θ 1 θ w i k 1 2 n θ w i k 1 2 n 1 and 26 φ 1 φ r where φ r is the flux limiter function φ r 0 corresponds to an upwind scheme and φ r 1 corresponds to the second order central difference scheme the determination of φ r can be referred to casulli and zanolli 2005 notably eq 25 satisfies the conservation of mass and is monotonicity preserving for each cell the set of equation 25 form a linear tridiagonal system which is solved by using the thomas algorithm 3 4 the implementation of immersed boundary method in eqs 15 and 16 the ib forces f i b f u i 1 2 k and f i b f w i k can be expressed as follows 27 f i b f u i 1 2 k u i 1 2 k n 1 u i 1 2 k n 1 2 δ t q x i 1 2 k n 1 on or near the ib 0 elsewhere 28 f i b f w i k w i k n 1 w i k n 1 2 δ t q z i k n 1 on or near the ib 0 elsewhere where u i 1 2 k n 1 and w i k n 1 are ib velocities as shown in fig 2 to impose a no slip boundary condition at the uneven bottom the ib velocities are calculated by the following linear interpolation method proposed by fadlun et al 2000 29 u i 1 2 k n 1 δ x δ x i δ x u i 1 2 k n 1 2 30 w i 1 k n 1 δ z δ z k δ z k 1 2 δ z w i 1 k n 1 2 where δ x and δ z are the horizontal and vertical distances between the ib velocity points and the uneven bottom boundary respectively in the implementation of the ib method the ib velocities are imposed as an internal boundary condition so that all the variables inside the uneven bottom are not involved in the computation 3 5 solution procedure at each time step the new flow variables u i 1 2 k n 1 w i k n 1 and η i n 1 and the density variable ρ i k n 1 are computed by solving corresponding equations the main solution procedure is summarized as follows 1 substitute eqs 11 and 12 and eqs 15 and 16 into eq 24 yielding a strongly diagonally dominant system for η i n 1 which is solved by the gauss seidel iterative method by neglecting the non hydrostatic pressure terms 2 compute the intermediate velocities u i 1 2 k n 1 2 and w i k n 1 2 by solving eqs 11 and 12 3 substitute eqs 15 and 16 into eq 19 and consider the zero pressure condition at the free surface q i n z 1 2 n 1 0 yielding the poisson equation for q i k 1 2 n 1 which is also a symmetric system and is solved by the conjugate gradient method notably the coefficient matrix of the poisson equation presented in ai et al 2018 is not symmetric because their model was developed for wave interactions with a floating suspended structure 4 compute the new velocities u i 1 2 k n 1 and w i k n 1 by solving eqs 15 and 16 5 repeat steps 1 to 4 until the convergence of the free surface elevation is reached 6 compute the density variable ρ i k n 1 by solving eq 25 4 numerical experiments the capabilities of the developed model are evaluated by considering three test cases the first test case concerns internal wave generation by tidal flow over an idealized gaussian shaped topography which is a real scale test case the last two test cases are laboratory scale test cases involving internal solitary wave propagations over variable topography 4 1 internal waves induced by tidal flow over an idealized topography internal waves are typically induced by the interaction between barotropic tidal flow and topography many numerical simulations mentioned before have been conducted to investigate the generation process similar to other works shaw et al 2009 xie et al 2011 an idealized gaussian shaped ridge defined by eq 31 is considered in this study 31 h x h 0 h m exp x 2 2 w 2 where h m 600 m and w 15000 m are the height and the scale width of the ridge respectively as shown in fig 3 the computational domain ranges from 200 km to 200 km in the x direction the still water depth is h 0 800 m the initial density distribution is given according to 32 ρ z ρ 0 δ ρ 2 1 tanh z z 0 d where δ ρ 6 kg m3 is the density difference z 0 50 m is the center of the pycnocline and d 120 m is the pycnocline thickness a m 2 tide is generated by specifying an external velocity on the left boundary 33 u t l e f t u 0 sin ω m 2 t where u 0 0 1 m s and ω m 2 0 000140526 rad s at the right boundary x r 200 km following keilegavlen and berntsen 2009 an external velocity is imposed to allow the tide to propagate through the computational domain 34 u z t r i g h t 1 10 x x r 10 δ x x r u x z t d x for this test case the coriolis force is included in the model and the coriolis parameter is fixed at f 5 1 10 5 rad s constant values of horizontal and vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity are used namely a h 1 0 10 1 m2 s a v 1 0 10 3 m2 s and k h k v 1 0 10 7 m2 s in this computation the horizontal and vertical grid sizes are set to δ x 200 m and δ z 10 m respectively for the present model for comparison numerical results obtained by the vertical boundary fitted non hydrostatic model hereafter called the bfnh model ai and ding 2016 was provided to discretize the horizontal computational domain the bfnh model adopts an orthogonal unstructured grid system in which the segment joining the centers of two adjacent cells is orthogonal to the side shared by the two cells examples of such a grid system are triangular grids rectangular grids and even hybrid grids comprising rectangular and triangular grids in this study we only use rectangular grids with the grid size of δ x 200 m to discretize the horizontal domain in the vertical direction 80 equidistant layers are employed fig 4 shows a schematic diagram to compare the two computational grid systems fig 5 depicts comparisons of internal wave generation process between the present model results and the bfnh model results in which t 2 π ω m 2 is the tidal period it can be found that the two model results are very similar both models show that upstream and downstream internal wave packets are produced due to the interaction between tidal flow and the localized topography at t 0 5 t a depression in the pycnocline first forms in the lee side of the ridge by the tidal flow then at t 1 0 t the depression passes over the ridge as the tide reverses from t 1 0 t to 1 5 t the upstream depression departs from the ridge and transforms to an internal bore due to nonlinear wave steepening at t 1 75 t the upstream internal wave packet has produced and subsequently induces more rank ordered internal waves at t 2 25 t in addition it can be seen that another depression in the lee side of the ridge has formed at t 1 25 t afterwards it propagates in the downstream direction and also transforms to an internal bore at t 1 75 t finally the bore evolves into the downstream internal wave packet at t 2 25 t 4 2 internal solitary wave propagation over a triangular ridge chen 2007 conducted a series of physical experiments to investigate an internal solitary wave isw propagating over a triangular ridge these experiments have been used for the validation of a few numerical models hsieh et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 in this study as shown in fig 6 the numerical wave flume is 12 m long and contains a two layered fluid the overall depth of the two layers is 0 5 m the ratio of the depth of the upper layer to that of the lower layer is h 1 h 2 1 4 the upper and lower fluid densities are 996 kg m3 and 1030 kg m3 respectively the height of the ridge h s is 0 3 m both sides of the wave flume are solid walls the isw of depression is generated in the right side of the computational domain by using the gravity collapse method kao et al 1985 and then propagates along the negative x direction the interface between the two layered fluids is initialized by a hyperbolic tangent density profile the amplitude of the incident isw is 0 056 m the horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficient are computed by eq 6 while the vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficient are calculated by eq 7 the effects of grid sizes and the interface thickness δ on the calculated interface displacement are firstly investigated comparisons of the interface displacement among the three sets of numerical results with different grid sizes and the experimental data are plotted in fig 7 three computational meshes as shown in table 1 are considered and all the numerical results are obtained by setting δ 0 02 m the numerical results obtained by the three computational meshes are quite similar demonstrating grid convergence has been achieved all the numerical results overestimate the leading wave trough at station g2 however the model results are in generally good agreement with the measured data and the model captures generally well wave propagation over the ridge fig 8 shows the sensitivity of the calculated interface displacement to the interface thickness the interface thickness has a certain effect on the interface displacement especially for the stations g2 g3 and g5 overall the model results with δ 0 02 and 0 03 m are slightly better than those obtained by δ 0 01 m fig 9 compares the present model results with other two model results the bfnh model also uses the same horizontal grid size to discretize the domain but in the vertical direction adopts a boundary fitted coordinate system with 100 equidistant layers in the vof model results by hsieh et al 2015 a grid system of 1200 250 is employed and the k ε model is used for the turbulent closure at station g2 both the present model and the bfnh model overestimate the leading wave trough while the vof model behaves well for the bfnh model unphysical oscillation can be observed at stations g2 and g3 this is caused by the fact that the bfnh model can induce more numerical errors in the calculation of the baroclinic term in the presence of steep bottom topography however after the isw propagated over the ridge the oscillation gets smaller at station g4 and even disappears at station g5 this may be because the strong mixing between the upper and lower layer fluids induced by the wave breaking suppressed the oscillation fig 10 depicts the calculated density fields obtained by mesh 1 and δ 0 02 m around the triangular ridge at several representative times the corresponding vorticity fields and velocity fields are also shown in fig 9 at the time t 0 s the wave front arrives on the slope and there is almost no change in the waveform see fig 10 a the main characteristics of the isw can be detected from figs 10 a and fig 11 a which show a density depression with an anticlockwise vortex in fig 10 b the wave front tends to parallel to the front slope of the ridge and the pycnocline of the wave front becomes thinner as the same time downward sloping velocities between the wave front and the slope increase dramatically see fig 11 b after that an internal hydraulic jump has been formed as shown in fig 10 c subsequently wave breaking occurs see fig 10 d and induces the following strong mixing between the upper and lower layer fluids see fig 10 e and f from fig 11 b f it can be found that during the isw propagating over the ridge a strong anticlockwise vortex always persists near the apex of the ridge the intensity of which is even larger than that of the vortex embedded in the isw 4 3 internal solitary wave propagation over a slope shelf topography the final test case concerns an isw propagating over a slope shelf topography cheng and hsu 2010 conducted a series of physical experiments to investigate the propagation process then a few numerical simulations cheng et al 2011 hsieh et al 2016 were carried out to study this process the numerical wave flume and gauge stations are presented in fig 12 the computational domain has a length of 14 0 m the depth of the upper layer is h 1 0 14 m and in the lower layer the depth h 2 0 41 m the height of the slope shelf topography is h s 0 37 m and the length of the slope is l s 1 5 m similar to the previous test case the upper and lower fluid densities are taken as 996 kg m3 and 1030 kg m3 respectively the interface between the two layered fluids is also initialized by a hyperbolic tangent density profile with a thickness of 0 02 m both sides of the wave flume are also solid walls an isw with an amplitude of 0 05 m is generated in the right side of the domain following the gravity collapse method we also adopted a grid system with δ x 0 01 m and δ z 0 005 m to cover the 2dv computational domain the eddy viscosities and diffusivity coefficients are also determined following the former test case fig 13 shows the comparisons of the interface displacement among the three sets of numerical results and experimental data at five gauge stations in the bfnh model the horizontal domain is discretized using δ x 0 01 m and 110 equidistance layers are employed in the vertical direction the vof model adopts δ x 0 01 m and δ z 0 002 m to cover the 2dv domain and employs the k ε model for the turbulent closure the present model underestimates the main waveform at station g2 and overestimates it at station g4 the vof model predicts the main waveform at stations g2 and g4 very well overall the present model shows generally good agreement with the experiment and captures the main evolution of the waveform during the propagation of the isw over slope shelf topography the agreement between the bfnh model results and experimental data are also generally good at stations g1 g2 and g3 however very poor results at stations g4 and g5 are obtained by the bfnh model this is mainly due to the aforementioned fact that large errors can be induced by the bfnh model in the presence of steep bottom topography fig 14 displays the calculated density fields at several representative times the corresponding vorticity fields and velocity fields are shown in fig 15 at the time t 0 s the waveform begins to deform see fig 14 a while the isw approaches the slope the thickness of the bottom layer at the upper reach of the slope becomes thinner see fig 14 b and downward sloping velocities between the wave front and the upper reach of the slope increase see fig 15 a and b as a result the wave front is blocked and the rear of the isw becomes steeper this leads to the formation of an internal hydraulic jump as shown in fig 14 c with the development of the internal hydraulic jump a bore with a clockwise vortex forms see figs 14 d and fig 15 d during the bore propagating over the shoulder of the slope shelf topography an elevated waveform is gradually produced see fig 14 d f and the intensity of the clockwise vortex becomes larger see fig 15 d f hereafter the elevated waveform disintegrates into two elevated waveforms and accordingly the stronger vortex is split into two vortices with the same direction 5 conclusions this paper presents a non hydrostatic model for predicting internal wave generations and propagations the model addresses variable topographies with the implementation of ib method the governing equations are solved by a semi implicit fractional step algorithm based on the cartesian grid system the model not only avoid numerical errors in the calculation of the baroclinic pressure gradient force but also can deal with any complex uneven bottoms due to the incorporation of the z level vertical coordinate and ib method the eddy viscosity and diffusivity are evaluated by a variant of the smagorinsky sub grid scale model which takes into account the effect of stratification for the test case concerning internal wave generations the developed model accurately captures the process of the internal wave generation compared with the bfnh model demonstrating the capability of the model in resolving internal waves induced by tidal flow over a topography in the last two examples involving internal wave propagations the present model results of the interface displacement show generally good agreement with experimental data and the present model can reproduce the waveform evolution including internal hydraulic jump wave breaking and waveform inversion these demonstrate that the present model is capable of predicting internal wave propagations over variable topographies moreover the present model also can reasonably resolve the vortex evolution during the isw propagating over a variable topography however the bfnh model behaves not well in the last two examples because it can induce more numerical errors in the calculation of the baroclinic term in the presence of steep bottom topography in general the developed model can be viewed as an alternative to accurately predict internal wave generations and propagations credit authorship contribution statement congfang ai methodology software

20938,there is increasing concern that the locally resonant phononic crystals lrpcs are used to reduce low frequency noise and vibration in ship and ocean engineering in this work the vertical velocity amplitude spectrums in changjing 9 are measured following the iso international standards according to the low frequency mechanical vibration generated by the power systems on the ship a single phase spiral shaped phononic crystal is designed and analyzed based on the locally resonant modes the vibration characteristics of the phononic crystal plates with different boundary conditions and loads are numerically simulated and groups of experimental tests are conducted to verify the abilities of vibration isolation for three kinds of phononic crystals furthermore a vibration isolation platform installed on a steel plate is also studied by numerical simulations and experiments the results show that the spiral phononic crystal has good adaptability for a wide range of low frequency band around 15 45 hz by altering the cylinders conveniently the lrpc has a potential application to isolate vibration for protecting electronic devices and precision instruments despite the complex vibration sources and boundaries on the ship in short this work is an active exploration of putting the lrpcs into the field of ship vibration and noise control keywords ship vibration phononic crystal local resonance flexural wave vibration isolation 1 introduction the low frequency vibrations caused by the power engines relentlessly radiate outward in the hull structure if the machine s power or the structural resonance caused by an unreasonable design increase the incremental vibration energy will bring about some adverse impact for example 1 the vibration on the ground would affect the working performance of precision instruments and electrical devices especially the high accuracy optical instruments 2 the structure borne noise excited by the vibration would interfere with the signal acquisition equipment such as sonars 3 the structure borne noise also have an influence on the comfort and sleeping quality of crews and passengers 4 the vibration of engines would produce underwater radiation noise that impacts the lives of marine animals through the shell of the ships and submarines he and xu 2013 xiahou et al 2019 daley et al 2004 therefore to relieve or even eliminate these adverse influences it is necessary to develop vibration isolation materials and structures that can be used to control the mechanical vibration on ships for shipbuilding the essential construction materials are the structural steel plates and the powerful machinery and equipment often produce low frequency flexural waves less than 50 hz on the steel plates during working the low frequency vibration various vibration sources and complex boundaries bring difficulties to design and manufacture vibration isolation materials and structures in recent years a kind of structure called locally resonant phononic crystal lrpc provides a new approach to design vibration isolation materials zhao et al 2015 2016 yun et al 2011 cajic et al 2020 the locally resonant phononic crystal which is a kind of elastic metamaterials miranda et al 2020 li et al 2020a bilal et al 2020 is usually a periodic structure made of several materials or porous media based on the local resonance of scatterer qian and shi 2016 2017 xiao et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 this kind of structure has low frequency bandgaps that the elastic wave cannot propagate through the structure in a specific frequency band liu et al 2000 li et al 2019a goh and kallivokas 2020 gao et al 2015 due to the advantages of the small structure and low frequency vibration suppression ability it has developed rapidly in the academic field banerjee et al 2019 pennec et al 2010a li and wang 2012 li et al 2020b in ship engineering there are complex forms of mechanical vibration sources and boundaries it is necessary to overcome these difficulties to use the advantages of lrpcs in the field of ship vibration control qin and yang 2019 as for the traditional vibration isolation of floating raft it always isolates the vibration at a certain point without considering the periodic arrangement and its isolating frequency band is influenced by the weights of protected objects the lrpc has periodic characteristics and its isolation frequency band is not difficult to predict song et al 2013 used the periodic theory to control the vibration and noise radiation in a raft system and calculated the dispersion relationships of the periodic structure in 2019 li et al 2019b studied the flexural wave bandgap of a stiffened plate that is often used in the ships based on the concept of phononic crystals and they experimentally verified that the stiffened plate has a bragg bandgap of 835 1198 hz the bragg bandgap which is not applicable for isolating low frequency mechanical vibration is much higher than the locally resonant bandgap in order to obtain the low frequency bandgap they li et al 2019c added the blocking mass on the steel plate to generate local resonance in the periodic structure and obtained a locally resonant bandgap about 150 250 hz aiming at the vibration reduction of the hull structure sun et al sun and li 2016 numerically simulated the bandgaps of a stiffened plate composed of l shaped ribs and analyzed the influence of geometric parameters on the bandgap shen et al 2017 summarized the research progress of the application of phononic crystals in the marine pipeline system these people have obtained beneficial results for the application of phononic crystals in the field of vibration isolation on the ships but there are still few reports about the vibration isolation of precise instruments and electronic devices on the ships using phononic crystals in order to adapt to the low frequency vibration lrpcs need to reduce the equivalent stiffness of the elastic layer or increase the equivalent weight of mass element to obtain a lower bandgap but reducing the equivalent stiffness of the elastic layer would be limited by the material wu et al 2013 firstly studied the bandgap characteristics of the spiral phononic crystals which can obtain the locally resonant bandgap by adjusting the geometrical parameters besides the material properties in 2018 morvaridi et al 2018 theoretically analyzed the bandgap properties of the spiral phononic crystal which has a very narrow bandgap but the structure is an ideal design that can t take many extra mass elements into account actually so it is not practical on the ships wu et al 2013 and morvaridi et al 2018 all made great contributions to the spiral phononic crystals this work will do further theoretical analysis experimental research and application exploration based on these researchers the ship named changjing 9 which is a 13800 m3 self propelled trailing suction dredger with a length of 145 m a width of 29 2 m and a depth of 11 m is selected to be the research object as shown in fig 1 a it has two wärtsilä propulsion machinery with a rated power of 9120 kw and a rated speed of 600 r min the rated power and rated speed of two auxiliary generators are 640 kw and 1500 r min respectively the rated power and revolution speed of the mud pumps are 6000 kw and around 300 r min respectively fig 1 b shows the vertical velocity amplitude spectrum which is measured on the forecastle deck and the power distribution room s deck at the stern the measurements abide by the international recommendation standards iso 6954 2000 mechanical vibration guid 2000 the vibration of the forecastle deck is mainly caused by the two mud pumps and its vibration frequency is around 20 hz the vibration frequencies in the power distribution room are near 25 hz and 40 hz which are primarily caused by the propulsion system and auxiliary engines respectively the changjing 9 has a variety of low frequency vibration sources with high power so it is suitable for scientific research for the low frequency mechanical vibration the spiral phononic crystals have great advantages of tunability for different vibration sources to protect precise instruments and electronic devices however as progress in the engineering application some new physical and mechanical problems have been encountered therefore we redesigned and studied the spiral shaped phononic crystals according to the low frequency mechanical vibration on the ship in this article the vibration mechanisms of spiral shaped phononic crystals are theoretically studied based on eigenmodes then the vibration isolation capacities of the lrpc pate with different boundary conditions and different loads are numerically simulated and experimentally verified furthermore a vibration isolation platform which has potential applications for protecting precise instruments and electronic devices from low frequency mechanical vibration is designed simulated and tested 2 theoretical analysis of spiral phononic crystal 2 1 analogous models of phononic crystal fig 2 depicts a unit cell of spiral shaped lrpc which is composed of three parts cylinders spiral beam and matrix the length and width of the unit cell are a as a lattice constant the radius of the cylinders is r the spiral beam whose width is b is drawn by two archimedes spiral lines the starting point of the spiral beam is pa and the distance between pa and center coordinate origin is r 1 the ending point is pb and the distance between pb and center is r 2 the vector t and n respectively represent the tangent direction and the normal direction of the spiral beam fig 2 b is the front view of the unit cell includes the upper and lower cylinders the height of each cylinder is h 1 and the thickness of the matrix is h 2 the spiral shaped lrpc is a single phase structure only made of structural steel whose density young s modulus and poisson s ratio of steel are ρ 7850 kg m3 e 200 gpa and υ 0 3 respectively the central line of the spiral beam starts from pa to pb so the total length of the spiral beam can be obtained by integration along the variable θ in polar coordinates 1 l 0 ϕ r θ 2 r θ 2 d θ where r θ is the radius from coordinate origin to the point at helical angle θ r θ is the derivative of r θ with respect to θ and ϕ is the total helical angle of the spiral beam from pa to pb r θ can be given by 2 r θ r θ r 1 r 2 r 1 θ ϕ where r θ is the vector from coordinate origin to the position at angle θ which can be expressed in cartesian coordinate as 3 r θ r x θ r y θ r θ cos θ r θ sin θ if the point pa at the end of the spiral beam is applied by a vertical unit force f the total moment m θ is 4 m θ r θ r 0 f the tangent direction of the spiral beam t θ can be obtained by the following formula 5 t θ r θ d s 1 d s r x θ r y θ where ds is the increased arc length per unit angle and its value is 6 d s r θ 2 r θ 2 since the tangent vector t θ and the normal vector n θ are perpendicular to each other t θ n θ 0 the normal direction at θ can be obtained by the equation as 7 n θ 1 d s r y θ r x θ therefore the bending moment of the spiral beam m b at θ can be expressed as 8 m b m θ n θ the torsional moment m t can be expressed as 9 m t m θ t θ to obtain the equivalent stiffness of the spiral beam the edge at position pb is approximately regarded as a fixed boundary and the unit force f is applied on the edge at pa based on the principle of virtual work the total vertical displacement at the point pa is 10 w 0 ϕ m b θ 2 e i b m t θ 2 μ i t f 2 μ a r θ 2 r θ 2 d θ where i b bh 2 3 12 μ e 2 1 υ and a 5bh 2 6 are the cross section moment of inertia shear modulus and effective shear area of the section respectively when the aspect ratio of the rectangular section is b h 2 10 the torsional moment of inertia i t can be estimated by the following equation 11 i t b 2 h 2 2 3 16 3 3 36 h 2 b 1 h 2 4 12 b 4 in this work the real thickness of the matrix is h 2 1 94 mm and other geometric parameters are design parameters r 1 23 24 mm r 2 41 94 mm φ 4 25π b 7 12 mm and a 10 cm after calculating the vertical displacement w at point pb through eq 10 which can be solved by the trapezoidal integral method or simpson integral method the equivalent stiffness of the spiral beam k eff f w 1 558 n mm can be obtained in order to validate the theoretical calculation the equivalent stiffness is numerically calculated by the mechanical module of comsol multiphysics structural mechanics module user s guide which is a finite element method software fem as for simulation the edge at the ending point p b is fixed and a vertical force f 1 n is applied on the edge at starting point pa the geometry is meshed by triangular elements whose size is 1 mm then we obtained that the equivalent stiffness is 1 574 n mm more details about the fem model are provided in the supplementary material the experiments are also conducted as demonstrated in fig 3 a the spiral beam is fixed by a g clamp and then different numbers of weights are used to hang at the interior end of the spiral beam the vertical displacement at pa is measured with a laser displacement sensor by calculating the average value of measurements the experimental equivalent stiffness is ultimately 1 431 n mm there are acceptable errors between the theoretical calculations numerical simulations and experiments so the theoretical results of equivalent stiffness are credible wang et al 2006 proposed that an accurate evaluation method to predict the starting frequency and cut off frequency for the bandgap of the lrpc which can be regarded as a spring mass model and a mass spring mass model as illustrated in fig 3 b according to these two analogous models the bandgap of the spiral phononic crystal can be estimated the starting frequency can be calculated by the following equation 12 f 1 1 2 π k e f f m 1 where m 1 is the equivalent mass of the interior objects the cut off frequency of the bandgap is 13 f 2 1 2 π k e f f m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 where m 2 is the equivalent mass of the matrix obviously the equivalent mass m 1 2ρh 1πr xiahou et al 2019 s 1 h 2 consists of the two cylinders and the interior slice around the cylinders the area of the interior thin plate is s 1 and the irregular area s 1 1596 60 mm2 can be directly obtained through any cad software the mass of the matrix is m 2 s 2 h 2 where s 2 4229 43 mm2 is the area of matrix beyond point pb the equivalent stiffness k eff of the spiral beam is treated as the spring constant of the analogous model the spiral phononic crystal that is similar to the mosquito coil can obtain different equivalent stiffness by adjusting the width and total helical angle of the spiral beam without material limitation 2 2 bandgap characteristics of the spiral phononic crystal fig 4 a is a real sample of the lrpc the phononic crystal is composed of the periodically arranged unit cells as the lattice constant a the unit cell in the red dashed box corresponds to that in fig 2 a compared with the traditional vibration isolation structure the phononic crystals have an obvious periodic characteristic so the phononic crystal satisfies the floquet bloch theorem cao et al 2004 liu and gao 2007 collet et al 2011 which indicates that the physical field u r t can be expressed as 14 u r t u k r e i k r ω t where r x y is the spatial vector and u k is the amplitude of harmonic function which has the same periodicity as the spatial lattice k k x k y is the structural wave vector in the brillouin zone of the periodic structure the time and the angular frequency are denoted by t and ω respectively based on the bloch theorem u k is defined as 15 u k r u k r r where r n 1 a n 2 a is the translation vector and n 1 and n 2 are integers eq 15 describes that the physical field is periodic in the periodic structure therefore the dispersion properties of the phononic crystal for the elastic wave usually only need to be analyzed through a unit cell fig 4 b is a sketch of the simple square reciprocal lattice of the unit cell in the first brillouin zone the reciprocal lattice is obtained by the fourier transform of spatial function because the structure is periodic kittel 2005 and the shaded zone is the irreducible brillouin zone of the reciprocal lattice γ 0 0 x 0 π a and m π a π a are the high symmetry points of the irreducible brillouin zone conventionally γ x x m and γ m are three directions to describe the band structure of a periodic structure jensen 2003 pennec et al 2010b however due to the anisotropy shape of the spiral structure the whole first brillouin zone is calculated the wavenumber in x and y directions respectively are k x and k y and their intervals are both π a π a the bloch periodic boundary conditions including eq 14 and eq 15 are applied on the four edges of the unit cell then the eigenvalue equations with different wave vectors k can be solved as 16 k ω 2 m u k 0 where k and m are the stiffness matrix and the mass matrix respectively by solving eq 16 the eigenfrequencies as a function of wave vectors k which is called bandstructure can be obtained the band structure of the first brillouin zone is shown in fig 5 a observing the isofrequency of the first band it can be concluded that the elastic wave has weak anisotropic dispersion properties the eigenfrequencies along the path m γ x m are extracted as demonstrated in fig 5 b which can basically represent the characteristics of band structure for the spiral phononic crystal the gray area is a bandgap of both bending wave and torsional wave which means that the elastic waves cannot pass the phononic crystals this article focuses on the low frequency bending wave because the bending wave is the dominating mechanical vibration on the ships based on the band structure the states of elastic waves in the periodic structure can be definitely distinguished fig 6 demonstrates the localized eigenmodes corresponding to different wave numbers k in fig 5 b when the k in the first band is close to the γ point the vibration form is mode a1 as demonstrated in fig 6 a in this state the matrix primarily is a torsional vibration with a few vertical components but the cylinders are mainly vertical vibration so the whole unit cell is in a coupled state of torsional and bending vibration when the wave number is gradually away from the γ point the torsional vibration becomes less and less but the vertical vibration is more and more obvious then the vibration mode gradually becomes the mode a2 that is exactly analogous to the spring mass model in fig 3 b the matrix is static and the cylinders and the spiral beam vibrates in the z direction the flexural wave bandgap is created because of the strong resonance between the unit cell and the transmitted flexural wave the modes b1 and c1 which are horizontal shear vibration have the same vibration forms in the second and third bands around the γ point as shown in fig 6 c the only difference is that the vibration direction of mode b1 is towards x direction while the mode c1 is towards y direction the mode b2 is the vibration form of the second band at the flat stage near the γ point the matrix and the cylinders are primally vertical vibration which exactly corresponds to the mass spring mass model in fig 3 b and the blue parts in the middle of the spiral beam are the stationary position that is same as the mass spring mass model for this eigenmode the flexural wave bandgap is closed because the matrix begins to vibrate when k in the second band moves away from the γ point the component of the bending vibration progressively decreases but the component of the torsional vibration gradually increases until it completely becomes the torsional vibration as shown in the mode b3 in fig 6 e the vibration form of mode b3 in the flat part zhang et al 2018 is similar to that of mode c2 in the third band except for the twist axis in the flat stage of the fourth and fifth band the vibrator exhibits horizontal shear vibration which is strongly coupled with the transmitted longitudinal wave in this work the influence of the height h 1 and radius r of the cylinders on the bandgap is investigated because the cylinders are the most flexible to be replaced on demand during engineering design fig 7 a shows the trend of the bandgap with the height of the cylinders h 1 the black lines and red lines are the starting and cut off frequencies of the bandgap respectively for each color the solid line is extracted from the band structure using comsol structural mechanics module user s guide and the dashed one is calculated by the simplified model as eq 12 and eq 13 the results show that the range of bandgap gradually declines when the height increases fig 7 b shows the tendency of bandgap as a function of the cylinder s radius r the bandgap also gradually becomes lower as the cylinder s radius increases these changes are contributed to the growth of the mass element m 1 of the unit cell as the weight of the cylinders increases the bandgap of the spiral shaped phononic crystals becomes lower and widen but the cylinders cannot be too heavy because heavy cylinders will lead to large gravity deformation in these figures as regards the initial frequency of the bandgap the numerical simulation and the simplified model are in good agreement but the error of the cut off frequency is relatively greater the reason is that only the vertical vibration is considered in the theoretical calculation of the equivalent stiffness k eff but the mode b2 at the cut off frequency always contains the component of torsional vibration as shown in fig 6 d by contrast the mode a2 at the beginning of the bandgap is almost vertical vibration so the starting frequency by numerical simulation is in good agreement with the theoretical calculation the simplified models directly explain the vibration mechanism of the lower and upper edges of the bandgap but the simplified models also have limitations when the ratio of height and radius increases or the mass element m 1 is primarily provided by the interior light slice around the cylinders the spiral structure tends to torsional vibration which causes the prediction error of the simplified model 3 numerical simulations and experiments of vibration isolation 3 1 vibration characteristics of phononic crystal plate because of the complicated boundary conditions and vibration forms of the hull structure the vibration isolation structure is required to have high flexibility the spiral phononic crystal fortunately has such advantages as shown in table 1 three types of phononic crystals are designed including type ⅰ type ⅱ and type ⅲ for the mechanical vibration of engines at 40 hz 25 hz and 20 hz moreover type ⅱ and type ⅲ have two versions including a single cylinder and double cylinders when the phononic crystals are type ⅱ single and type ⅲ single the phononic crystal has only the upper cylinders when the phononic crystals are type ⅱ double and type ⅲ double as shown in fig 2 b the phononic crystals have both upper and lower cylinders fig 8 demonstrates the numerical simulation of the three kinds of phononic crystals with different working conditions the phononic crystals are designed in the middle of a steel plate in the numerical simulation the cylinders are meshed by solid elements of 3 mm and the steel plate is meshed by shell elements of 10 mm the total edge load or point load is 50 n the torsional moment on the edge is 10 n m considering the influence of the boundary conditions fig 8 a and b respectively show the two cases of type ⅰ that the four edges of the steel plate are free and two ends of the steel plate are fixed the thickness of the whole plate is equal to h 2 and the total length is 2 m the left of the phononic crystal is the vibration excitation area where a uniformly distributed load is applied and the right side is the vibration protected area the figures show that the boundary conditions don t affect the vibration isolation capabilities of the phononic crystal it means that the vibration isolation structure can be installed in a complex environment without limitation of foundation considering the influence of loading distribution a point load applied in the excitation area as shown in fig 8 c combined with fig 8 a the results suggested that the phononic crystal plate has no requirement for the loading distribution and it also proves that the bandgap of the phononic crystal is a complete bandgap xiao et al 2012 then fig 8 d shows the plate with a torsional moment and the phononic crystal structure also has the capabilities of isolating the torsional vibration these results indicate that the phononic crystal structure can isolate most vibrations caused by the mechanical loads in the ships fig 8 e and f are the results of type ii and type ⅲ phononic crystal plates with a distributed load in the excitation area except for the isolating frequency range other results are similar to type i so the working conditions for type ii and type ⅲ are not discussed in detail again in addition all results show that the vibration direction of the cylinders and spiral beam is generally opposite to that of the matrix which creates the bandgap of lrpc because of the antiphase vibration in order to verify that the isolation range of the phononic crystal is the bandgap fig 10 a shows the transmission spectrum obtained by the numerical simulation when phononic crystal is type ii double with different periodicities and the two ends of the steel plate are fixed the length of the steel plates on both sides of the phononic crystal keeps 0 75 m when the number of periodicities is changed the transmission spectrum can be calculated by the following equation 17 t d b 20 lg u o u t u i n where u out and u in are the maximum vertical velocity amplitude in the right protected area and the left excitation area respectively the transmission spectrums directly show the difference between the two areas the shaded region in fig 10 is the bandgap of the phononic crystal it can be seen that the transmission spectrum drops rapidly at the starting frequency of the bandgap the lines return to near zero at the cut off frequency the results obviously show that the vibration amplitude in the right vibration isolation area is much smaller than that in the left excitation area in the bandgap furthermore this figure suggests that the vibration isolation structure has better performance when the periods of the phononic crystal increase and the frequency range of vibration isolation is closer to the bandgap of phononic crystal according to the above simulation results the experimental setup is determined as illustrated in fig 9 the phononic crystal is in the red dashed box and the periodicity of phononic crystal is six the entire experimental structure is suspended by elastic strings the vibration generator below the left end of the steel plate is connected to the power amplifier and the signal generator sends a continuous sinusoidal signal with a steady amplitude to the power amplifier a laser doppler vibrometer which connected to the control box and the computer is settled on the right in the experiment the velocity amplitude u out and u in is measured at point c and point a respectively point a and point c are located at the midpoint along the width direction at both ends and the two measuring points must be symmetric with each other in the experimental structure to avoid measurement discrepancy because the elastic waves form a stable standing wave in the experimental structure for a very short time when we observed the performance of vibration isolation the vibration generator can be placed anywhere on the left area because the spiral phononic crystal can isolate both bending wave and torsional wave in observation a mouse is placed at the vibration isolation area on the right to act as a protected object by carrying out the experiment in fig 9 the transmission spectrum of type ⅰ type ⅱ double and type ⅲ double are obtained as the red solid lines shown in fig 10 b c and d the purple and green lines are the simulation results when the four edges of the steel plates are free and the two ends are fixed respectively the results show that the bandgaps by the experiments agree well with that the numerical simulations and the range of the bandgap is not influenced by the boundary conditions in a finite area however due to the heavy experimental structure and the low frequency vibration the elastic strings cause an unavoidable disturbance that the resonant frequency of the entire structure during the experimental tests is somewhat different from the numerical simulation results despite such an interference the vibration isolation abilities of the phononic crystal structure are still prominent in the experiments and the frequency band of vibration isolation corresponding to the bandgap is not affected by the elastic strings the results further prove that the phononic crystals can adapt to the complex engineering boundaries in the ships 3 2 vibration characteristics of the isolation platform the above mentioned phononic crystal structure cannot be directly used on the hull structure of a ship so this work also studies a vibration isolation platform made of the phononic crystals installing on a host plate as shown in fig 11 and fig 12 there is a steel plate with type ⅱ single phononic crystals 5 4 periods on the two sides the vibration isolation platform has a protected area in the middle and is installed on a host plate with two subpanels whose height and thickness are 4 5 cm and 1 94 mm respectively the overall length and thickness of the host plate are 2 6 m and 1 94 mm similar to the simulations in figs 8 and 11 a and b demonstrate the vibration isolation performance when the two ends of the host plate are free and fixed respectively the frequency of the load applied on the host plate is 25 hz fig 11 c and d are the results that the host plate is acted by a point load and torsional moment respectively it can be seen that the elastic wave propagates in the host plate but it doesn t affect the vibration isolation area above if a distributed load is applied in the middle area of the vibration isolation platform as shown in fig 11 e the elastic wave is trapped in the protected area and the elastic wave hardly propagates into the underneath host plate except that the loading frequency is the resonant frequency of the whole structure fig 11 f removes the phononic crystal on the right side of the vibration isolation platform since the vibration isolation area is no longer enclosed by the phononic crystal the vibration on the host plate quickly propagates into the protected area through the subpanel on the right side of the vibration isolation platform the results reveal that the vibration isolation protection must meet that the protected area is enclosed by phononic crystals in order to observe the working performance of this vibration isolation platform this article also does experimental tests for the vibration isolation platform as shown in fig 12 the vibration isolation platform made of phononic crystals is installed on the host plate the measured point b is located at the center of the protected area point a and point c are on the left and right ends of the host plate respectively the three graphs in fig 13 are the experimental results of type i type ii single and type iii single phononic crystal via low pass filtering respectively the black red and blue lines represent the time history response at three points a b and c respectively all the results clearly show that the vibration at point b is much smaller than that at point a and point c particularly the upper vibration isolation area does not require the weights of protection objects because the bandgap is independent of the protection objects weights in contrast the traditional vibration isolation floating raft is affected by the weights of the protection objects using phononic crystal can easily isolate the vibration amplitude by more than 80 but it should be noted that the vibration isolation effect would become worse if the loading frequency is the resonant frequency of the whole structure and the spiral phononic crystal is easy to appear multiple frequency vibration phenomenon in the experiments which may be caused by the improper cylinders assembling and subpanels welding during the sample fabrication to show the efficiency of the vibration isolation system the average velocity amplitudes for ten periods at point a point b and point c are calculated and measured respectively in the numerical simulation the vibration energy which is analyzed in the frequency domain can be given by 18 e e p e k 1 4 ρ ω 2 v a z 2 where e p e k ρ and v az are the potential energy kinetic energy mass density and amplitude of z direction velocity respectively the experimental measurements

conclusions in conclusion this work measures the velocity amplitude frequency spectrum in changjing 9 based on the vibration spectrum a single phase and spiral shaped phononic crystal is designed and its locally resonant mechanism is comprehensively studied next the phononic crystal plate and a vibration isolation platform made of the phononic crystals with different boundary conditions and loading forms are numerically simulated and tested by groups of experiments the results in the frequency domain and time domain both show that the spiral phononic crystal only manufactured by structural steel has good adaptability and flexibility for broadband frequency and various types of load the frequency band of vibration isolation can cover from 15 hz to 45 hz by using standardized cylinders and the loading forms can be distributed loads point loads and torsional moment particularly the frequency band of vibration isolation is not limited by the weights of the protected objects making full use of these advantages the phononic crystals can be used to protect precise instruments and electronic devices on ships that have many complex engineering boundaries and low frequency vibration sources despite the promising results some unsettled issues also existed for example the minimum size of the unit cell should be not small than 1 10 wavelength of the plate wave the vibration isolation effect will decrease when the loading frequency is the resonant frequency of the entire structure the spiral phononic crystal is easy to produce high order harmonics vibrations and it cannot be a supporting structure future work may focus on these issues more especially for the broadband low frequency phononic crystals with high bending strength which may be a challenge for a

20938,there is increasing concern that the locally resonant phononic crystals lrpcs are used to reduce low frequency noise and vibration in ship and ocean engineering in this work the vertical velocity amplitude spectrums in changjing 9 are measured following the iso international standards according to the low frequency mechanical vibration generated by the power systems on the ship a single phase spiral shaped phononic crystal is designed and analyzed based on the locally resonant modes the vibration characteristics of the phononic crystal plates with different boundary conditions and loads are numerically simulated and groups of experimental tests are conducted to verify the abilities of vibration isolation for three kinds of phononic crystals furthermore a vibration isolation platform installed on a steel plate is also studied by numerical simulations and experiments the results show that the spiral phononic crystal has good adaptability for a wide range of low frequency band around 15 45 hz by altering the cylinders conveniently the lrpc has a potential application to isolate vibration for protecting electronic devices and precision instruments despite the complex vibration sources and boundaries on the ship in short this work is an active exploration of putting the lrpcs into the field of ship vibration and noise control keywords ship vibration phononic crystal local resonance flexural wave vibration isolation 1 introduction the low frequency vibrations caused by the power engines relentlessly radiate outward in the hull structure if the machine s power or the structural resonance caused by an unreasonable design increase the incremental vibration energy will bring about some adverse impact for example 1 the vibration on the ground would affect the working performance of precision instruments and electrical devices especially the high accuracy optical instruments 2 the structure borne noise excited by the vibration would interfere with the signal acquisition equipment such as sonars 3 the structure borne noise also have an influence on the comfort and sleeping quality of crews and passengers 4 the vibration of engines would produce underwater radiation noise that impacts the lives of marine animals through the shell of the ships and submarines he and xu 2013 xiahou et al 2019 daley et al 2004 therefore to relieve or even eliminate these adverse influences it is necessary to develop vibration isolation materials and structures that can be used to control the mechanical vibration on ships for shipbuilding the essential construction materials are the structural steel plates and the powerful machinery and equipment often produce low frequency flexural waves less than 50 hz on the steel plates during working the low frequency vibration various vibration sources and complex boundaries bring difficulties to design and manufacture vibration isolation materials and structures in recent years a kind of structure called locally resonant phononic crystal lrpc provides a new approach to design vibration isolation materials zhao et al 2015 2016 yun et al 2011 cajic et al 2020 the locally resonant phononic crystal which is a kind of elastic metamaterials miranda et al 2020 li et al 2020a bilal et al 2020 is usually a periodic structure made of several materials or porous media based on the local resonance of scatterer qian and shi 2016 2017 xiao et al 2012 zhu et al 2014 this kind of structure has low frequency bandgaps that the elastic wave cannot propagate through the structure in a specific frequency band liu et al 2000 li et al 2019a goh and kallivokas 2020 gao et al 2015 due to the advantages of the small structure and low frequency vibration suppression ability it has developed rapidly in the academic field banerjee et al 2019 pennec et al 2010a li and wang 2012 li et al 2020b in ship engineering there are complex forms of mechanical vibration sources and boundaries it is necessary to overcome these difficulties to use the advantages of lrpcs in the field of ship vibration control qin and yang 2019 as for the traditional vibration isolation of floating raft it always isolates the vibration at a certain point without considering the periodic arrangement and its isolating frequency band is influenced by the weights of protected objects the lrpc has periodic characteristics and its isolation frequency band is not difficult to predict song et al 2013 used the periodic theory to control the vibration and noise radiation in a raft system and calculated the dispersion relationships of the periodic structure in 2019 li et al 2019b studied the flexural wave bandgap of a stiffened plate that is often used in the ships based on the concept of phononic crystals and they experimentally verified that the stiffened plate has a bragg bandgap of 835 1198 hz the bragg bandgap which is not applicable for isolating low frequency mechanical vibration is much higher than the locally resonant bandgap in order to obtain the low frequency bandgap they li et al 2019c added the blocking mass on the steel plate to generate local resonance in the periodic structure and obtained a locally resonant bandgap about 150 250 hz aiming at the vibration reduction of the hull structure sun et al sun and li 2016 numerically simulated the bandgaps of a stiffened plate composed of l shaped ribs and analyzed the influence of geometric parameters on the bandgap shen et al 2017 summarized the research progress of the application of phononic crystals in the marine pipeline system these people have obtained beneficial results for the application of phononic crystals in the field of vibration isolation on the ships but there are still few reports about the vibration isolation of precise instruments and electronic devices on the ships using phononic crystals in order to adapt to the low frequency vibration lrpcs need to reduce the equivalent stiffness of the elastic layer or increase the equivalent weight of mass element to obtain a lower bandgap but reducing the equivalent stiffness of the elastic layer would be limited by the material wu et al 2013 firstly studied the bandgap characteristics of the spiral phononic crystals which can obtain the locally resonant bandgap by adjusting the geometrical parameters besides the material properties in 2018 morvaridi et al 2018 theoretically analyzed the bandgap properties of the spiral phononic crystal which has a very narrow bandgap but the structure is an ideal design that can t take many extra mass elements into account actually so it is not practical on the ships wu et al 2013 and morvaridi et al 2018 all made great contributions to the spiral phononic crystals this work will do further theoretical analysis experimental research and application exploration based on these researchers the ship named changjing 9 which is a 13800 m3 self propelled trailing suction dredger with a length of 145 m a width of 29 2 m and a depth of 11 m is selected to be the research object as shown in fig 1 a it has two wärtsilä propulsion machinery with a rated power of 9120 kw and a rated speed of 600 r min the rated power and rated speed of two auxiliary generators are 640 kw and 1500 r min respectively the rated power and revolution speed of the mud pumps are 6000 kw and around 300 r min respectively fig 1 b shows the vertical velocity amplitude spectrum which is measured on the forecastle deck and the power distribution room s deck at the stern the measurements abide by the international recommendation standards iso 6954 2000 mechanical vibration guid 2000 the vibration of the forecastle deck is mainly caused by the two mud pumps and its vibration frequency is around 20 hz the vibration frequencies in the power distribution room are near 25 hz and 40 hz which are primarily caused by the propulsion system and auxiliary engines respectively the changjing 9 has a variety of low frequency vibration sources with high power so it is suitable for scientific research for the low frequency mechanical vibration the spiral phononic crystals have great advantages of tunability for different vibration sources to protect precise instruments and electronic devices however as progress in the engineering application some new physical and mechanical problems have been encountered therefore we redesigned and studied the spiral shaped phononic crystals according to the low frequency mechanical vibration on the ship in this article the vibration mechanisms of spiral shaped phononic crystals are theoretically studied based on eigenmodes then the vibration isolation capacities of the lrpc pate with different boundary conditions and different loads are numerically simulated and experimentally verified furthermore a vibration isolation platform which has potential applications for protecting precise instruments and electronic devices from low frequency mechanical vibration is designed simulated and tested 2 theoretical analysis of spiral phononic crystal 2 1 analogous models of phononic crystal fig 2 depicts a unit cell of spiral shaped lrpc which is composed of three parts cylinders spiral beam and matrix the length and width of the unit cell are a as a lattice constant the radius of the cylinders is r the spiral beam whose width is b is drawn by two archimedes spiral lines the starting point of the spiral beam is pa and the distance between pa and center coordinate origin is r 1 the ending point is pb and the distance between pb and center is r 2 the vector t and n respectively represent the tangent direction and the normal direction of the spiral beam fig 2 b is the front view of the unit cell includes the upper and lower cylinders the height of each cylinder is h 1 and the thickness of the matrix is h 2 the spiral shaped lrpc is a single phase structure only made of structural steel whose density young s modulus and poisson s ratio of steel are ρ 7850 kg m3 e 200 gpa and υ 0 3 respectively the central line of the spiral beam starts from pa to pb so the total length of the spiral beam can be obtained by integration along the variable θ in polar coordinates 1 l 0 ϕ r θ 2 r θ 2 d θ where r θ is the radius from coordinate origin to the point at helical angle θ r θ is the derivative of r θ with respect to θ and ϕ is the total helical angle of the spiral beam from pa to pb r θ can be given by 2 r θ r θ r 1 r 2 r 1 θ ϕ where r θ is the vector from coordinate origin to the position at angle θ which can be expressed in cartesian coordinate as 3 r θ r x θ r y θ r θ cos θ r θ sin θ if the point pa at the end of the spiral beam is applied by a vertical unit force f the total moment m θ is 4 m θ r θ r 0 f the tangent direction of the spiral beam t θ can be obtained by the following formula 5 t θ r θ d s 1 d s r x θ r y θ where ds is the increased arc length per unit angle and its value is 6 d s r θ 2 r θ 2 since the tangent vector t θ and the normal vector n θ are perpendicular to each other t θ n θ 0 the normal direction at θ can be obtained by the equation as 7 n θ 1 d s r y θ r x θ therefore the bending moment of the spiral beam m b at θ can be expressed as 8 m b m θ n θ the torsional moment m t can be expressed as 9 m t m θ t θ to obtain the equivalent stiffness of the spiral beam the edge at position pb is approximately regarded as a fixed boundary and the unit force f is applied on the edge at pa based on the principle of virtual work the total vertical displacement at the point pa is 10 w 0 ϕ m b θ 2 e i b m t θ 2 μ i t f 2 μ a r θ 2 r θ 2 d θ where i b bh 2 3 12 μ e 2 1 υ and a 5bh 2 6 are the cross section moment of inertia shear modulus and effective shear area of the section respectively when the aspect ratio of the rectangular section is b h 2 10 the torsional moment of inertia i t can be estimated by the following equation 11 i t b 2 h 2 2 3 16 3 3 36 h 2 b 1 h 2 4 12 b 4 in this work the real thickness of the matrix is h 2 1 94 mm and other geometric parameters are design parameters r 1 23 24 mm r 2 41 94 mm φ 4 25π b 7 12 mm and a 10 cm after calculating the vertical displacement w at point pb through eq 10 which can be solved by the trapezoidal integral method or simpson integral method the equivalent stiffness of the spiral beam k eff f w 1 558 n mm can be obtained in order to validate the theoretical calculation the equivalent stiffness is numerically calculated by the mechanical module of comsol multiphysics structural mechanics module user s guide which is a finite element method software fem as for simulation the edge at the ending point p b is fixed and a vertical force f 1 n is applied on the edge at starting point pa the geometry is meshed by triangular elements whose size is 1 mm then we obtained that the equivalent stiffness is 1 574 n mm more details about the fem model are provided in the supplementary material the experiments are also conducted as demonstrated in fig 3 a the spiral beam is fixed by a g clamp and then different numbers of weights are used to hang at the interior end of the spiral beam the vertical displacement at pa is measured with a laser displacement sensor by calculating the average value of measurements the experimental equivalent stiffness is ultimately 1 431 n mm there are acceptable errors between the theoretical calculations numerical simulations and experiments so the theoretical results of equivalent stiffness are credible wang et al 2006 proposed that an accurate evaluation method to predict the starting frequency and cut off frequency for the bandgap of the lrpc which can be regarded as a spring mass model and a mass spring mass model as illustrated in fig 3 b according to these two analogous models the bandgap of the spiral phononic crystal can be estimated the starting frequency can be calculated by the following equation 12 f 1 1 2 π k e f f m 1 where m 1 is the equivalent mass of the interior objects the cut off frequency of the bandgap is 13 f 2 1 2 π k e f f m 1 m 2 m 1 m 2 where m 2 is the equivalent mass of the matrix obviously the equivalent mass m 1 2ρh 1πr xiahou et al 2019 s 1 h 2 consists of the two cylinders and the interior slice around the cylinders the area of the interior thin plate is s 1 and the irregular area s 1 1596 60 mm2 can be directly obtained through any cad software the mass of the matrix is m 2 s 2 h 2 where s 2 4229 43 mm2 is the area of matrix beyond point pb the equivalent stiffness k eff of the spiral beam is treated as the spring constant of the analogous model the spiral phononic crystal that is similar to the mosquito coil can obtain different equivalent stiffness by adjusting the width and total helical angle of the spiral beam without material limitation 2 2 bandgap characteristics of the spiral phononic crystal fig 4 a is a real sample of the lrpc the phononic crystal is composed of the periodically arranged unit cells as the lattice constant a the unit cell in the red dashed box corresponds to that in fig 2 a compared with the traditional vibration isolation structure the phononic crystals have an obvious periodic characteristic so the phononic crystal satisfies the floquet bloch theorem cao et al 2004 liu and gao 2007 collet et al 2011 which indicates that the physical field u r t can be expressed as 14 u r t u k r e i k r ω t where r x y is the spatial vector and u k is the amplitude of harmonic function which has the same periodicity as the spatial lattice k k x k y is the structural wave vector in the brillouin zone of the periodic structure the time and the angular frequency are denoted by t and ω respectively based on the bloch theorem u k is defined as 15 u k r u k r r where r n 1 a n 2 a is the translation vector and n 1 and n 2 are integers eq 15 describes that the physical field is periodic in the periodic structure therefore the dispersion properties of the phononic crystal for the elastic wave usually only need to be analyzed through a unit cell fig 4 b is a sketch of the simple square reciprocal lattice of the unit cell in the first brillouin zone the reciprocal lattice is obtained by the fourier transform of spatial function because the structure is periodic kittel 2005 and the shaded zone is the irreducible brillouin zone of the reciprocal lattice γ 0 0 x 0 π a and m π a π a are the high symmetry points of the irreducible brillouin zone conventionally γ x x m and γ m are three directions to describe the band structure of a periodic structure jensen 2003 pennec et al 2010b however due to the anisotropy shape of the spiral structure the whole first brillouin zone is calculated the wavenumber in x and y directions respectively are k x and k y and their intervals are both π a π a the bloch periodic boundary conditions including eq 14 and eq 15 are applied on the four edges of the unit cell then the eigenvalue equations with different wave vectors k can be solved as 16 k ω 2 m u k 0 where k and m are the stiffness matrix and the mass matrix respectively by solving eq 16 the eigenfrequencies as a function of wave vectors k which is called bandstructure can be obtained the band structure of the first brillouin zone is shown in fig 5 a observing the isofrequency of the first band it can be concluded that the elastic wave has weak anisotropic dispersion properties the eigenfrequencies along the path m γ x m are extracted as demonstrated in fig 5 b which can basically represent the characteristics of band structure for the spiral phononic crystal the gray area is a bandgap of both bending wave and torsional wave which means that the elastic waves cannot pass the phononic crystals this article focuses on the low frequency bending wave because the bending wave is the dominating mechanical vibration on the ships based on the band structure the states of elastic waves in the periodic structure can be definitely distinguished fig 6 demonstrates the localized eigenmodes corresponding to different wave numbers k in fig 5 b when the k in the first band is close to the γ point the vibration form is mode a1 as demonstrated in fig 6 a in this state the matrix primarily is a torsional vibration with a few vertical components but the cylinders are mainly vertical vibration so the whole unit cell is in a coupled state of torsional and bending vibration when the wave number is gradually away from the γ point the torsional vibration becomes less and less but the vertical vibration is more and more obvious then the vibration mode gradually becomes the mode a2 that is exactly analogous to the spring mass model in fig 3 b the matrix is static and the cylinders and the spiral beam vibrates in the z direction the flexural wave bandgap is created because of the strong resonance between the unit cell and the transmitted flexural wave the modes b1 and c1 which are horizontal shear vibration have the same vibration forms in the second and third bands around the γ point as shown in fig 6 c the only difference is that the vibration direction of mode b1 is towards x direction while the mode c1 is towards y direction the mode b2 is the vibration form of the second band at the flat stage near the γ point the matrix and the cylinders are primally vertical vibration which exactly corresponds to the mass spring mass model in fig 3 b and the blue parts in the middle of the spiral beam are the stationary position that is same as the mass spring mass model for this eigenmode the flexural wave bandgap is closed because the matrix begins to vibrate when k in the second band moves away from the γ point the component of the bending vibration progressively decreases but the component of the torsional vibration gradually increases until it completely becomes the torsional vibration as shown in the mode b3 in fig 6 e the vibration form of mode b3 in the flat part zhang et al 2018 is similar to that of mode c2 in the third band except for the twist axis in the flat stage of the fourth and fifth band the vibrator exhibits horizontal shear vibration which is strongly coupled with the transmitted longitudinal wave in this work the influence of the height h 1 and radius r of the cylinders on the bandgap is investigated because the cylinders are the most flexible to be replaced on demand during engineering design fig 7 a shows the trend of the bandgap with the height of the cylinders h 1 the black lines and red lines are the starting and cut off frequencies of the bandgap respectively for each color the solid line is extracted from the band structure using comsol structural mechanics module user s guide and the dashed one is calculated by the simplified model as eq 12 and eq 13 the results show that the range of bandgap gradually declines when the height increases fig 7 b shows the tendency of bandgap as a function of the cylinder s radius r the bandgap also gradually becomes lower as the cylinder s radius increases these changes are contributed to the growth of the mass element m 1 of the unit cell as the weight of the cylinders increases the bandgap of the spiral shaped phononic crystals becomes lower and widen but the cylinders cannot be too heavy because heavy cylinders will lead to large gravity deformation in these figures as regards the initial frequency of the bandgap the numerical simulation and the simplified model are in good agreement but the error of the cut off frequency is relatively greater the reason is that only the vertical vibration is considered in the theoretical calculation of the equivalent stiffness k eff but the mode b2 at the cut off frequency always contains the component of torsional vibration as shown in fig 6 d by contrast the mode a2 at the beginning of the bandgap is almost vertical vibration so the starting frequency by numerical simulation is in good agreement with the theoretical calculation the simplified models directly explain the vibration mechanism of the lower and upper edges of the bandgap but the simplified models also have limitations when the ratio of height and radius increases or the mass element m 1 is primarily provided by the interior light slice around the cylinders the spiral structure tends to torsional vibration which causes the prediction error of the simplified model 3 numerical simulations and experiments of vibration isolation 3 1 vibration characteristics of phononic crystal plate because of the complicated boundary conditions and vibration forms of the hull structure the vibration isolation structure is required to have high flexibility the spiral phononic crystal fortunately has such advantages as shown in table 1 three types of phononic crystals are designed including type ⅰ type ⅱ and type ⅲ for the mechanical vibration of engines at 40 hz 25 hz and 20 hz moreover type ⅱ and type ⅲ have two versions including a single cylinder and double cylinders when the phononic crystals are type ⅱ single and type ⅲ single the phononic crystal has only the upper cylinders when the phononic crystals are type ⅱ double and type ⅲ double as shown in fig 2 b the phononic crystals have both upper and lower cylinders fig 8 demonstrates the numerical simulation of the three kinds of phononic crystals with different working conditions the phononic crystals are designed in the middle of a steel plate in the numerical simulation the cylinders are meshed by solid elements of 3 mm and the steel plate is meshed by shell elements of 10 mm the total edge load or point load is 50 n the torsional moment on the edge is 10 n m considering the influence of the boundary conditions fig 8 a and b respectively show the two cases of type ⅰ that the four edges of the steel plate are free and two ends of the steel plate are fixed the thickness of the whole plate is equal to h 2 and the total length is 2 m the left of the phononic crystal is the vibration excitation area where a uniformly distributed load is applied and the right side is the vibration protected area the figures show that the boundary conditions don t affect the vibration isolation capabilities of the phononic crystal it means that the vibration isolation structure can be installed in a complex environment without limitation of foundation considering the influence of loading distribution a point load applied in the excitation area as shown in fig 8 c combined with fig 8 a the results suggested that the phononic crystal plate has no requirement for the loading distribution and it also proves that the bandgap of the phononic crystal is a complete bandgap xiao et al 2012 then fig 8 d shows the plate with a torsional moment and the phononic crystal structure also has the capabilities of isolating the torsional vibration these results indicate that the phononic crystal structure can isolate most vibrations caused by the mechanical loads in the ships fig 8 e and f are the results of type ii and type ⅲ phononic crystal plates with a distributed load in the excitation area except for the isolating frequency range other results are similar to type i so the working conditions for type ii and type ⅲ are not discussed in detail again in addition all results show that the vibration direction of the cylinders and spiral beam is generally opposite to that of the matrix which creates the bandgap of lrpc because of the antiphase vibration in order to verify that the isolation range of the phononic crystal is the bandgap fig 10 a shows the transmission spectrum obtained by the numerical simulation when phononic crystal is type ii double with different periodicities and the two ends of the steel plate are fixed the length of the steel plates on both sides of the phononic crystal keeps 0 75 m when the number of periodicities is changed the transmission spectrum can be calculated by the following equation 17 t d b 20 lg u o u t u i n where u out and u in are the maximum vertical velocity amplitude in the right protected area and the left excitation area respectively the transmission spectrums directly show the difference between the two areas the shaded region in fig 10 is the bandgap of the phononic crystal it can be seen that the transmission spectrum drops rapidly at the starting frequency of the bandgap the lines return to near zero at the cut off frequency the results obviously show that the vibration amplitude in the right vibration isolation area is much smaller than that in the left excitation area in the bandgap furthermore this figure suggests that the vibration isolation structure has better performance when the periods of the phononic crystal increase and the frequency range of vibration isolation is closer to the bandgap of phononic crystal according to the above simulation results the experimental setup is determined as illustrated in fig 9 the phononic crystal is in the red dashed box and the periodicity of phononic crystal is six the entire experimental structure is suspended by elastic strings the vibration generator below the left end of the steel plate is connected to the power amplifier and the signal generator sends a continuous sinusoidal signal with a steady amplitude to the power amplifier a laser doppler vibrometer which connected to the control box and the computer is settled on the right in the experiment the velocity amplitude u out and u in is measured at point c and point a respectively point a and point c are located at the midpoint along the width direction at both ends and the two measuring points must be symmetric with each other in the experimental structure to avoid measurement discrepancy because the elastic waves form a stable standing wave in the experimental structure for a very short time when we observed the performance of vibration isolation the vibration generator can be placed anywhere on the left area because the spiral phononic crystal can isolate both bending wave and torsional wave in observation a mouse is placed at the vibration isolation area on the right to act as a protected object by carrying out the experiment in fig 9 the transmission spectrum of type ⅰ type ⅱ double and type ⅲ double are obtained as the red solid lines shown in fig 10 b c and d the purple and green lines are the simulation results when the four edges of the steel plates are free and the two ends are fixed respectively the results show that the bandgaps by the experiments agree well with that the numerical simulations and the range of the bandgap is not influenced by the boundary conditions in a finite area however due to the heavy experimental structure and the low frequency vibration the elastic strings cause an unavoidable disturbance that the resonant frequency of the entire structure during the experimental tests is somewhat different from the numerical simulation results despite such an interference the vibration isolation abilities of the phononic crystal structure are still prominent in the experiments and the frequency band of vibration isolation corresponding to the bandgap is not affected by the elastic strings the results further prove that the phononic crystals can adapt to the complex engineering boundaries in the ships 3 2 vibration characteristics of the isolation platform the above mentioned phononic crystal structure cannot be directly used on the hull structure of a ship so this work also studies a vibration isolation platform made of the phononic crystals installing on a host plate as shown in fig 11 and fig 12 there is a steel plate with type ⅱ single phononic crystals 5 4 periods on the two sides the vibration isolation platform has a protected area in the middle and is installed on a host plate with two subpanels whose height and thickness are 4 5 cm and 1 94 mm respectively the overall length and thickness of the host plate are 2 6 m and 1 94 mm similar to the simulations in figs 8 and 11 a and b demonstrate the vibration isolation performance when the two ends of the host plate are free and fixed respectively the frequency of the load applied on the host plate is 25 hz fig 11 c and d are the results that the host plate is acted by a point load and torsional moment respectively it can be seen that the elastic wave propagates in the host plate but it doesn t affect the vibration isolation area above if a distributed load is applied in the middle area of the vibration isolation platform as shown in fig 11 e the elastic wave is trapped in the protected area and the elastic wave hardly propagates into the underneath host plate except that the loading frequency is the resonant frequency of the whole structure fig 11 f removes the phononic crystal on the right side of the vibration isolation platform since the vibration isolation area is no longer enclosed by the phononic crystal the vibration on the host plate quickly propagates into the protected area through the subpanel on the right side of the vibration isolation platform the results reveal that the vibration isolation protection must meet that the protected area is enclosed by phononic crystals in order to observe the working performance of this vibration isolation platform this article also does experimental tests for the vibration isolation platform as shown in fig 12 the vibration isolation platform made of phononic crystals is installed on the host plate the measured point b is located at the center of the protected area point a and point c are on the left and right ends of the host plate respectively the three graphs in fig 13 are the experimental results of type i type ii single and type iii single phononic crystal via low pass filtering respectively the black red and blue lines represent the time history response at three points a b and c respectively all the results clearly show that the vibration at point b is much smaller than that at point a and point c particularly the upper vibration isolation area does not require the weights of protection objects because the bandgap is independent of the protection objects weights in contrast the traditional vibration isolation floating raft is affected by the weights of the protection objects using phononic crystal can easily isolate the vibration amplitude by more than 80 but it should be noted that the vibration isolation effect would become worse if the loading frequency is the resonant frequency of the whole structure and the spiral phononic crystal is easy to appear multiple frequency vibration phenomenon in the experiments which may be caused by the improper cylinders assembling and subpanels welding during the sample fabrication to show the efficiency of the vibration isolation system the average velocity amplitudes for ten periods at point a point b and point c are calculated and measured respectively in the numerical simulation the vibration energy which is analyzed in the frequency domain can be given by 18 e e p e k 1 4 ρ ω 2 v a z 2 where e p e k ρ and v az are the potential energy kinetic energy mass density and amplitude of z direction velocity respectively the experimental measurements are carried out in the time domain so the vibration energy can be calculated by 19 e e p e k 1 2 ρ v a c 2 where ω is the angular frequency table 2 shows the results of vibration energy insulation by phononic crystal including numerical simulation and experiments e a e c and e b are the vibration energy that is calculated by eq 18 and eq 19 at the three points respectively the simulation and experimental results all indicate that the energy in the protected area is much smaller than that in the underneath plate so the phononic crystal has high efficiency of vibration isolation 4 conclusions in conclusion this work measures the velocity amplitude frequency spectrum in changjing 9 based on the vibration spectrum a single phase and spiral shaped phononic crystal is designed and its locally resonant mechanism is comprehensively studied next the phononic crystal plate and a vibration isolation platform made of the phononic crystals with different boundary conditions and loading forms are numerically simulated and tested by groups of experiments the results in the frequency domain and time domain both show that the spiral phononic crystal only manufactured by structural steel has good adaptability and flexibility for broadband frequency and various types of load the frequency band of vibration isolation can cover from 15 hz to 45 hz by using standardized cylinders and the loading forms can be distributed loads point loads and torsional moment particularly the frequency band of vibration isolation is not limited by the weights of the protected objects making full use of these advantages the phononic crystals can be used to protect precise instruments and electronic devices on ships that have many complex engineering boundaries and low frequency vibration sources despite the promising results some unsettled issues also existed for example the minimum size of the unit cell should be not small than 1 10 wavelength of the plate wave the vibration isolation effect will decrease when the loading frequency is the resonant frequency of the entire structure the spiral phononic crystal is easy to produce high order harmonics vibrations and it cannot be a supporting structure future work may focus on these issues more especially for the broadband low frequency phononic crystals with high bending strength which may be a challenge for a long time in short this work is an active exploration of a practical application in the field of ship vibration and noise reduction credit authorship contribution statement yongdu ruan conceived the

20939,the flow induced vibrations fiv in two degrees of freedom for two circular cylinders with three arrangements including parallel tandem and stagger were investigated numerically the rigid constraint is considered due to its widespread in industry fields the effects of arrangement and constraint on fiv characteristics including trajectory vibration response force response and near wake structure are analyzed results indicate that the existence of constraint can significantly suppress the vibration of the two cylinders when reduced velocity u 7 however when u 7 the oscillation of the parallel cylinders with constraint in cross flow direction is strengthened moreover the existence of constraint can reduce the vibration frequencies of cylinders with tandem arrangement significantly the trajectory in the shape of 8 can be captured in most cases of motion for the cylinders without constraint and the closed single loop 8 and i shape trajectories are obtained for the vibration of cylinders with constraint the two cylinders move synchronously when the constraint is applied and the near wake structures of the two cylinders are more stable than that without constraint keywords

engineering hong and shah 2018 li et al 2018 milne et al 2016 wang et al 2020b the force due to vortex shedding of cylinder can lead to vibration which can further result in instability and fatigue damage of the cylinder in general the fiv of cylinder is suppressed for its damage to engineering safety zhu et al 2019a kumar et al 2018 rashidi et al 2016 on the other hand the vibration of cylinder can be utilized to harvest clean energy from river and ocean currents ding et al 2015 2016 2019 wang et al 2019a zou et al 2019 the fiv of a single circular cylinder is a widespread flow structure interaction phenomenon and has been investigated numerically or experimentally by researchers by analyzing the simulated and experimental results ponta and aref 2006 classified the vortex patterns and illustrated the relationship between the classification and the reynolds number re in laminar flow the vortex patterns of two 2s four 2p and three p s vortices modes have been observed under different reynolds numbers in the simulations of singh et al 2013 hasan and ali 2013 investigated the vortex shedding of single cylinder when re 60 and re 100 they carried out the richardson number to describe the strength of vortex shedding the other literatures about the fiv of a single cylinder can be found in the reviews of williamson and govardhan 2004 bearman 2011 and the studies of wang et al 2019b 2020c 2020d ding et al 2021 yang et al 2019 and zhu et al 2019b 2019c 2020 in consideration of the technical requirement and economy the arrangement of two circular cylinders is common in the industry for the very reason the research on the flow induced vibration of two cylinders has remarkable significance in engineering applications there are many literatures on the fiv of two cylinders ding et al 2017 haider and sohn 2018 xu et al 2018 for example qin et al 2018 investigated the influence of the natural frequencies on the flow induced vibrations of two cylinders and elucidated the oscillatory characteristic and its relationship with the frequency ratio zhao and yan 2013 numerically studied the vortex induced vibration viv of two cylinders at a fixed diameter ratio of 0 2 they found a small distance between the two cylinders could suppress the vibration and lower the amplitude in addition griffith et al 2017 investigated the flow induced vibration of two cylinders arranged in tandem and stagger when re 200 it was concluded that two cylinders will vibrate unsynchronized when the vortex shedding frequency of one cylinder is around their inherent frequencies furthermore the fiv of multiple cylinders is more complex for their interaction between cylinders ding et al 2018 studied the fiv of three circular cylinders with tandem arrangement at high reynolds number they found that the downstream cylinder will affect the fiv of the upstream cylinder and observed 2p 2p 4s and 2p 2s vortex patterns for the three cylinders zhang et al 2018 studied the fiv of four stagger arranged cylinders and focused on the influence of gap between the cylinders on the viv responses and the energy harvesting they concluded that the interaction between cylinders can enhance the viv of the downstream cylinder moreover yu and lin 2005 numerically investigated the viv of two to seven identical cylinders it was shown that the cylinder becomes more fluid elastically unstable when there are more upstream cylinders although there are many applications of flow induced vibration and its control of multiple cylinders the flow characteristics and the underlying control mechanisms still need further investigation therefore a series of numerical simulations on the two degree of freedom flow induced vibration of two circular cylinders with different arrangements are performed in this paper moreover due to the widespread of rigid constraint between cylinders such as heat exchanger bundle marine riser and the support structures the effects of rigid connection between two cylinders are considered this paper is constituted as following the physical model of the oscillatory system and the numerical method are illustrated in section 2 and section 3 respectively the fiv responses of two cylinders including amplitude force coefficients frequencies xy trajectories and vortex patterns are presented and analyzed in section 4 the conclusions are summarized in the end 2 physical model the schematic of the investigated model is shown in fig 1 the oscillatory system consists of two circular cylinders which are immersed in uniform flow the diameter of the rigid cylinder is d the stiffness is denoted as k and the oscillatory system damping is c to compare the results of present work with that of literatures hover and triantafyllou 2001 assis et al 2006 a low mass ratio of each circular cylinder m m system m d where m system means the inertial mass of the oscillation system and m d indicates the displaced fluid mass is set as 2 0 in this work three types of arrangement for two cylinders were studied which are parallel side by side tandem and stagger arrangement for all the three arrangements the center to center distance between the cylinders is d 2d the schematic of constraint between the two cylinders is shown in fig 1 d and the connection is assumed to be rigid in the numerical simulation which means the two cylinders will vibrate together without relative displacement meanwhile the calculations of the two cylinders in fiv that each cylinder can vibrate separately were conducted for comparison and the simulations were conducted in the reduced velocity range of 2 u 14 in this work the definition of reduced velocity is u u f n water d in which u means the velocity of free stream f n water is the natural frequency of the oscillatory system in water 3 numerical approach 3 1 governing equations and integration scheme fiv of two rigid cylinders with three different arrangements is considered in this study as shown in fig 1 a cartesian coordinate system is applied and the x direction is the direction of u the two cylinders can be rigidly coupled or vibrate separately the reynolds number re of 100 is considered to avoid the effect of three dimensional turbulent characteristics and it is assumed that the flow is laminar incompressible and two dimensional the unsteady navier stokes n s equations can be described as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t x i u i u j 1 ρ p x i u i u i x i 1 r e 2 u i x i 2 where x i is the coordinate u i is the velocity and p is the pressure re is the reynolds number the mass spring damping simplification is applied to model the oscillation of the two cylinders the two cylinders can oscillate in both the x and y directions under the stream loading for each cylinder of the oscillating system the linear mass spring damping governing equations are 3 m s y s t e m x c 1 x k 1 x f f l u i d x 4 m s y s t e m y c 2 y k 2 y f f l u i d y where f fluid x and f fluid y are the drag and lift force on the cylinder x x and x y y and y are the displacement velocity and accelerated velocity of the cylinder in the flow direction cross flow direction c 1 and c 2 are the system damping of the cylinders k 1 and k 2 are the system stiffness of the cylinders as shown in fig 1 for the cylinder in fiv the velocity components in flow and cross flow directions are defined as 5 u t x t 6 v t y t to simulate the oscillation of the two cylinders the motion equations 3 and 4 are discretized by the method of fourth order runge kutta take eq 4 as an example it can be rewritten as 7 y t n 1 y t n υ y t n δ t δ t 2 6 k 1 2 k 2

which is y in eq 4 δt is time step 3 2 computational domain and boundary conditions a typical arrangement of two cylinders in parallel is depicted in fig 2 the distance between the boundary and the center of the closest cylinder is fixed at 20d which is large enough to obtain the wake flow zou et al 2019 therefore different computational domains are adopted to keep such constant distance for different arrangements the boundary conditions of inlet and outlet are set as uniform velocity and zero gradient velocity respectively in account of enough distance between cylinders and top or bottom slip boundaries are applied for top and bottom for all cylinders the no slip condition is also considered an internal boundary of overset exists for the utilization of the overset mesh the function of this boundary is for connecting the background mesh and the append mesh the internal boundary is not a physical boundary but a numerical boundary parts of the background mesh will be overlapped by the overset mesh as shown in fig 3 the overset mesh consists of the background mesh and the append mesh the size of background mesh is the same as that of the computational domain and is static and structured in addition the area nearby the two cylinders and their motion area are refined to capture the flow field variation and the oscillation of the cylinders the append mesh will move with the oscillation of the cylinders the obvious advantage for the combination of two grids is that it can adapt to the moving of complicated structures and allow strongly enforced boundary conditions koblitz et al 2017 tang et al 2003 in this work the two dimensional simulations were conducted by commercial cfd software fluent and the motion equations of cylinder are discreted by the method of fourth order runge kutta and then realized by in hose code thorough user defined function udf in addition according to the previous studies we conducted wang et al 2019a 2020a zou et al 2019 the overset mesh strategy can provide high accuracy which is acceptable in engineering applications the non dimensional time step is set as u δt d 0 001 to make sure that the courant friedrichs lewy cfl number is less than 1 lax and wendroff 2012 so that the calculation is converged within each time step hence the different time steps were applied for different reduced velocities in addition the mesh sensitivity study was conducted to ensure that the simulation results are independent of the mesh density the density of the background mesh and append mesh should be validated synchronously due to the density corresponding to these two sets of mesh the mesh sensitivity study was accomplished in following conditions the two cylinders are arranged in stagger and with rigid constraint the reduced velocity is u 8 the mesh density is represented by the minimal mesh size δh of background mesh it s worth noting that the force coefficients presented in table 1 are the mean value of two cylinders as shown in table 1 the optimal minimal background mesh size of 0 020d was selected under the comparison of a peaks x d a peaks y d the root mean square value of lift coefficient c l rms and the time averaged drag coefficient c d mean 3 3 validations to confirm the validity of the simulation approach the studies on flow pass the two circular cylinders in parallel arrangement were carried out the vibration responses such as drag coefficient c d mean time averaged lift and rms lift coefficients c l mean and c l rms are compared with that reported by bao et al 2013 lee et al 2009 and kang 2003 as shown in fig 4 for small values of d d the values of the drag coefficient obtained in the present work are closely agreed with that reported by bao et al 2013 lee et al 2009 and kang 2003 for relatively large value of d d c d mean is slightly larger but the variation trends are almost the same meanwhile since the lift coefficient is important for the description of cylinders in fiv both the time averaged lift coefficient c l mean and rms lift coefficient c l rms are analyzed and compared with the previous works bao et al 2013 kang 2003 lee et al 2009 for drag coefficients the maximum difference is only 3 4 which can be observed in the case of d d 4 compared with the results of lee et al 2009 moreover the average difference between the results of present work and others is 2 0 as depicted in fig 5 the time averaged lift coefficient decreases sharply in the range of 1 d d 3 and then keeps around 0 1 with the rise of d d while the value of c l rms rises with d d increasing from 1 to 3 and drops slowly when d d 3 the calculation of two cylinders in fiv has been carried out by the present method and the amplitude results have been presented and compared with that of griffith et al 2017 as shown in fig 6 the amplitude of upstream cylinder increases slowly in the range of 0 u 3 and then rises fast when 3 u 6 the decline can be observed when u 6 as for the downstream cylinder the tendency of amplitude almost keeps the same however the downstream cylinder experience significantly higher amplitude vibration when compared with that of upstream cylinder the reason is that the vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder can be captured by the downstream cylinder and then further leads to stronger dynamic lift force acting on the surface of downstream cylinder which also corresponds to the results of ding et al 2018 it is worth noting that more validations about the overset mesh strategy and fiv of a single cylinder can be found in the previous work of wang et al 2019a 2020a and zou et al 2019 as a result it can be concluded that the vibration responses obtained in this work match well with that reported in previous work which confirms the reliability of the numerical method used in this work 4 results discussion 4 1 amplitude response the non dimensional oscillation amplitude ratios of two cylinders in 2 dof a peaks x d and a peaks y d are used to describe the oscillate strength of cylinders the numerical results were compared with that of gao et al 2020 it should be noted that the mass ratio and reynolds number in the work of gao et al 2020 are 2 6 and 150 respectively as presented in fig 7 for x direction the amplitude ranges of two cylinders for all cases are 0 a peaks x d 0 6 when the two cylinders are arranged in parallel for x direction the initial branch of the top cylinder can be observed in the ranges of 2 u 3 and the amplitude experiences fast increasing when 3 u 4 and then drop in the range of 4 u 5 when 5 u 14 the amplitude for the top cylinder fluctuates with the increase of reduced velocity and significant local peaks exist when u 9 the maximum value of amplitude for top cylinder with parallel cylinder is 0 25d and it is obtained when u 4 the maximum amplitude of the top cylinder with parallel arrangement in x direction is 0 30d u 9 for the bottom cylinder of the separate vibration cases the amplitude in flow direction is almost the same as that of the top cylinder when u 7 and a maximum amplitude value of 0 27d can be captured when u 8 the amplitude of bottom cylinder drops slowly when u 9 as for the situation of oscillation together the vibration is suppressed in the range of u 7 the amplitudes of the two cylinders with constraint are even smaller than 0 05d when u 7 the vibration of the cylinders is enhanced and reaches a peak at u 8 but this peak value is still lower than that of two cylinders oscillate separately the amplitude of the two cylinders with constraint drops to a low value when u 13 the amplitudes of two cylinders with parallel arrangement were also carried out by gao et al 2020 the comparison shows that the amplitude in their results is lower than that of this work when 7 u 12 which can be caused by the difference of system parameters for the cases of tandem arrangement that the two cylinders can vibrate separately the cylinders almost do not oscillate when u 4 with the increase of u the amplitude of the downstream cylinder experiences a slight rising in the reduced velocity range of 4 u 6 a rapid increase and decrease of the amplitude have been observed when 6 u 8 the peak value of the amplitude for downstream cylinder is 0 31d when u 7 as for upstream cylinder the amplitude in flow direction rises slowly in the range of 4 u 8 and then reduces to a steady value around 0 015d the maximum value of amplitude for upstream cylinder can reach 0 052d u 8 for the cases of two cylinders fixed together the amplitudes are always less than 0 014d which is much lower than that of free vibration cylinders the amplitudes for this case in the work of gao et al 2020 also keep around zero the vibration can be effectively suppressed by constraint when the two cylinders are arranged in tandem different from the above two arrangements for the stagger cases the location of the upstream cylinder is 45 to bottom left of the downstream cylinders this relative location results in complicated gap flow and further influences the amplitude of the two cylinders when they oscillate separately for the upstream cylinder the amplitude in x direction rises and then drops with the increase of reduced velocity when 3 u 14 the maximum value of the amplitude ratio is a peaks x d 0 28 when u 7 and the same tendency can also be observed for the amplitude in x direction of the downstream cylinder and the maximum value is 0 59d u 8 when the cylinders are rigidly connected the vibration is suppressed in the range of 2 u 6 and then the amplitude increases monotonically with the reduced velocity in the range of 6 u 11 and drops fast when 11 u 13 it is obviously that the disparity of amplitudes in x direction between two cylinders for parallel is much small than that of tandem when the cylinders vibrate in 2dof the reason is that the wake of the upstream cylinder is captured by the downstream one when these two cylinders are arranged in tandem and this phenomenon rarely happens for the situation of parallel arrangement this can be observed and will be discussed in the section of near wake structures the amplitudes in cross flow direction for the three arrangements are presented in fig 8 it can be observed that the a peaks y is larger than a peaks x when 5 u 14 for the cases of parallel arrangement the vibration responses of the two free vibration cylinders are similar at different u a prominent increment of a peaks y is detected as 3 u 5 then it stabilizes around 0 6d in the range of 5 u 8 5 when u 9 the value of a peaks y decreases with the rise of reduced velocity on the other hand the fiv responses of the two parallel cylinders with constraint are different the amplitudes for constrain cases in y direction are small in the range of 2 u 4 the value of a peaks y increases slowly when 4 u 7 once u is higher than 7 a peaks y rises sharply and the maximum value reaches 1 20d when u 9 which is higher than that of separate vibration cylinders moreover the amplitude experiences a drop when 9 u 14 the amplitude of parallel arranged two cylinders with constraint in the work of gao et al 2020 also shown similar tendency when compared with that in the present work for the tandem cases the vibration in y direction for downstream cylinder is significantly influenced by the upstream one while two cylinders vibrate separately in the two ranges of 4 u 8 and 8 u 14 the amplitude in cross flow direction for the downstream cylinder increases first and then drops therefore two peaks exist in these two ranges a peaks y 0 78d when u 7 a peaks y 1 18d when u 9 for upstream cylinder the initial branch can be observed when 2 u 4 and the amplitude in cross flow direction increases in the reduced velocity range of 4 u 7 and decreases when 7 u 14 with the rise of reduced velocity the maximum amplitude of 0 82d can be obtained for upstream cylinder in cross flow direction when u 7 in addition the vibration of the two cylinders with constraint is suppressed in the tested reduced velocity range the amplitude of two cylinders with constraint keep around zero when 2 u 7 5 the amplitude increases with the rise of reduced velocity in the range of 7 5 u 10 and then decreases the maximum amplitude of cases with constraint in cross flow direction is 0 32d u 10 for the results of gao et al 2020 similar tendency can be observed but the peak can be captured when u 5 for the two cylinders in stagger arrangement the amplitude of upstream cylinder rises in the range of 3 u 8 and decreases when 8 u 9 with the increase of reduced velocity the maximum amplitude of 0 65d for upstream cylinder was observed when u 8 the maximum amplitude 0 96d of downstream cylinder also can be found when u 8 as for the cases with constraint the amplitude increases slowly in the range of 2 u 6 and rises fast when 6 u 11 with the increase of reduced velocity the maximum amplitude for the cases with constraint is 0 60d u 11 in addition the vibration of cylinders with constraint becomes stronger than that of upstream cylinder when u 8 5 but it still lower than that of downstream oscillator the above analysis shows that the constraint between two cylinders can significantly suppress the oscillation of cylinders in x direction for different arrangements however in cross flow direction the constraint does not always reduce the amplitudes the effect of constraint depends on the arrangements of two cylinders for brevity the influences of the constraint for different arrangements are summarized in table 2 for y direction the role of constraint in vibration amplitude turns from suppression to enhancement when the arrangement changes from flow direction tandem to cross flow direction parallel this transition is resulted from the variation of lift force for the changing of vortex shedding which will be discussed in section 4 5 1 4 2 frequency responses the oscillation frequencies of two cylinders can be obtained by fast fourier transform fft over the time history displacement of oscillators the reduced frequencies presented in this study are defined as f x f osc x f n water and f y f osc y f n water to be more detailed the f osc x and f osc y are the first order oscillation frequencies in x direction and y direction respectively the frequencies responses of two cylinders with parallel arrangement are released in fig 9 a the frequencies of top and bottom cylinders keep the same in the same direction for a given reduced velocity for separating vibration cases the value of f y is the four times of f x when u 2 and 3 and the frequency in flow direction keeps the same as that in cross flow direction when 4 u 9 moreover the value of f y increases first in the range of 2 u 4 and then decreases in the range of 4 u 14 with the rise of reduced velocity the maximum value of f y 1 44 can be obtained when u 4 for the cylinders with rigid constraint the frequencies in two directions are equal when 2 u 8 and f x 2f y can be observed when u 8 and the maximum value of f x and f y can be captured when u 8 as presented in fig 9 b the frequencies of upstream and downstream cylinders are equal in the same direction except for upstream cylinder when u 8 for the separating vibration cases meanwhile f x 2f y can be observed for the separating vibration cases except for f x f y when u 8 the exception for u 8 will lead to the difference of trajectory which can be found in the subsequence section of trajectory for two cylinders with rigid constraint the value of f x is double to that of f y when 5 u 14 and f x f y can be observed in the range of 2 u 4 for a given reduced velocity the vibration frequencies of two cylinders arranged in stagger totally keep the same in two directions for cases without rigid constraint fig 9 c the frequencies ratios of two separating vibrate cylinders increase in the range of 3 u 4 and decline slowly when u 4 with the increase of u the maximum reduced frequency of f x f y 1 34 can be obtained when u 4 for cases with rigid constraint between cylinders the frequencies in two directions keep the same for a given reduced velocity and the similar tendency can be observed with the rising of u when compared with the cases of separate vibration the maximum reduced frequency of f x f y 1 38 is captured when u 7 and it is worth noting that f x f y can result in the closed loop trajectory and f x 2f y leads to 8 shape trajectory which will be detailed discussed and analyzed in the sub section of trajectory to sum up the existence of rigid constraint for parallel arrangement leads to the frequencies of cylinders in two directions keeping steady with the rising of u when compared with that of separating vibration cases for tandem arrangement the frequency in x direction for rigid constraint cases is lower than that of separating vibration cases in the most reduced velocity range 2 u 9 for two cylinders with stagger arrangement the rigid constraint almost doesn t affect the tendency of frequency responses with the rise of u but leads to the drifting of peaks for frequency 4 3 forces responses the drag and lift forces responses are important parameters to analyze the vibration mechanism of cylinders in fiv the time averaged drag c d mean and root mean square value of lift force coefficients c l rms for two cylinders with different arrangements were carried out and discussed in this section as shown in fig 10 a the force responses of two cylinders with parallel arrangement are presented as expected the values of c d mean for top and bottom cylinders are the same because almost no interaction between two cylinders in flow direction due to the parallel arrangement the slight differences in high reduced velocity range are caused by the small instantaneous distance can be observed in the section of near wake structures between two cylinders due to the high amplitude the values of c d mean for top and bottom cylinders increase fast in the range of 2 u 4 and then drop slowly in the range of 4 u 14 with the rise of u the maximum values of time averaged drag coefficient for these two cylinders are all equal to 2 27 u 4 the values of c l rms for two cylinders almost keep the same for the above reason and the maximum value of c l rms 1 67 for the two cylinders can be obtained when u 4 for the cases with rigid constraint the value of c l rms for two cylinders is lower than that of the cases without rigid constraint in low reduced velocity range and inverse in high reduced velocity range which corresponds to the tendency of a peaks y and also explain the influence of constraint table 2 in addition the peaks of c l rms for two cylinders with constraint exist and can be captured under the different reduced velocities as for tandem arrangement fig 10 b the value of c d mean for upstream cylinder is significantly higher than that of downstream cylinder especially in low reduced velocity range the value of c l rms increases first in the range of 2 u 5 and then decreases to a steady range when 5 u 14 with the rise of reduced velocity moreover the tendencies of c l rms for the two cylinders almost keep the same and the value of c l rms for upstream cylinder is higher than that of downstream cylinder in the range of 4 u 8 and reverse in the range of 8 u 14 which corresponding to the comparison of a peaks y for the two cylinders fig 8 the maximum values of c l rms for upstream and downstream cylinder can be captured when u 5 c l rms max 1 24 and u 6 c l rms max 0 86 respectively for the cases with rigid constraint the drag coefficients of upstream cylinder are far higher than that of the downstream one due to that the downstream cylinder is exposed in the wake area of upstream cylinder and the lift coefficients of two cylinders with rigid constraint always keep in a low level never higher than 0 6 with the rise of reduced velocity which corresponds to the tendency of a peaks y in fig 8 the forces responses of two cylinders with stagger arrangement are presented in fig 10 c the results show that the drag coefficients of upstream cylinder are lower than that of downstream cylinder for a given reduced velocity when u 4 the value of c d mean for downstream cylinder increases first in the range of 4 u 6 and then drops in the range of 6 u 11 the maximum value of 2 16 can be obtained when u 6 for upstream cylinder the time averaged drag coefficients keep around 1 4 with the increase of u for a given reduced velocity c l rms upstream c l rms downstream can be observed which also supports the results of amplitude responses the tendencies of lift coefficients for these two cylinders are similar the maximum lift coefficients of 0 63 u 6 and 1 66 u 5 can be captured for upstream and downstream cylinders respectively for the cases with rigid constraint the drag coefficient of upstream cylinder is only slightly smaller than that of downstream cylinder which means that the influence of the wake of upstream cylinder on the drag force for downstream cylinder is weaker than that of tandem arrangement and for the cases with rigid constraint the value of c l rms for upstream cylinder is lower than that of downstream one in all selected reduced velocities moreover lift coefficients of the cylinders with rigid constraint exceed that of separated cylinders when u 9 the tendency of lift forces coefficients almost keeps the same as that of amplitudes for the separating vibration cases 4 4 xy trajectories the xy trajectories of two cylinders can reveal how the cylinders oscillate as shown in fig 11 the trajectories of two cylinders arranged in parallel are presented under different u the motions of the two cylinders with constraint are synchronized thus there is only one trajectory shown for the free vibration cases due to the low amplitudes of two cylinders the xy trajectory almost can be considered as one point for each cylinder when u 3 in the range of 4 u 7 closed single loop trajectories are observed for the two free vibrating cylinders another type of oscillation trajectory is 8 shape which can be captured when 8 u 14 the closed single loop trajectories indicate that the oscillation frequency in x direction f osc x is equal to that in y direction f osc y and the trajectories with the shape of 8 mean that f osc y is twice of f osc x zhao et al 2014 for a given reduced velocity when the two cylinders are rigidly connected the amplitude is lower than that of freely oscillation cylinders this results in the different shapes of the trajectories between the two situations as shown in the range of 3 u 7 the displacement of the cylinders with constraint is too small to be identified when u 8 the motion trail with the shape of d closed single loop is captured with the further increase of u the trajectories with the shape of 8 can be observed for the cases with constraint fig 12 shows the xy trajectories for the oscillators arranged in tandem the amplitudes for cylinders are very low and the xy trajectories are not easy to be identified when u 4 however when u 5 the classical trajectory with the shape of 8 appears for the freely oscillating cylinders an exception exists the trajectory of the downstream is a closed single loop when u 8 for the downstream cylinder under free oscillation the oscillation frequencies in two directions are the same when u 8 although the motion of the downstream cylinder is disturbed by the wake of the upstream one the trajectories in wide reduced velocity range 4 u 14 are similar to that of single cylinder which was observed by zhao et al 2014 the trajectories also clearly show that the amplitude in flow direction is much lower than a peaks y when u 5 for the tandem cylinders with constraint i shape trajectories can be observed only when u 9 the amplitude in flow direction is almost close to zero for these cases as shown in fig 13 the trajectories for the stagger cylinders are closed single loops in a wide range of 6 u 14 for the separate oscillate scheme the trails of the motions for the downstream cylinder are relatively complex at u 7 and u 8 compared with other reduced velocities this is caused by the instability of the oscillation for the downstream cylinder and the other trajectories are basically closed single loops but the shape is not quite the same as the rising of the reduced velocity the shape of the closed single loop varies from a slender loop to a drop shape the change suggests the value of the amplitudes in two directions are closing to each other with the increasing of u when 9 u 13 in addition the trajectories also indicate that the amplitude of upstream cylinder in the cross flow direction is lower than that of downstream cylinder for a given reduced velocity the trajectories for the oscillating cylinders with constraint also show the same tendency in the range of 7 u 11 but the size of the trajectories is relatively smaller due to the low amplitude then 12 u 14 the amplitude in flow direction reduces faster than the amplitude in cross flow direction which results in slender trajectories with the rise of u 4 5 near wake structures the near wake structures are useful to make the complex motions and the interaction between two cylinders clear in addition the amplitude response and the shape of trajectory can be partly illustrated by the near wake structures in consideration that the similarity of the near wake structure for different reduced velocities only the near wake structures of some highlighted cases are presented in this part 4 5 1 parallel arrangement the near wake structures of the two cylinders with parallel arrangement are similar thus a typical reduced velocity of u 9 is selected and the corresponding revolutions of near wake structures are presented in fig 14 for the oscillators with constraint the vortices formed in the gap of the two cylinders interact with each other and then fade away in the near wake as shown in fig 14 a the vortices shedding from the outside of the two parallel cylinders are less affected and then the independent vortices form the parallel vortex street in the wake of the two cylinders for the cylinders which can vibrate separately the wake structures are close to that of connected cylinders however the vortices shedding from one cylinder will interact with the vortices shedding from the other cylinder when the two cylinders moving close to each other and this results in complex wake structures behind the two cylinders as shown in fig 14 b it is noted that the most remarkable feature for the wake structures in the cases of separate oscillation is that the vortices shedding from the two cylinders are stretched due to the interaction between vortices moreover the vortex shedding from the two cylinders synchronous when the constraint exists which leads to high lift force and further results in high amplitude in y direction 4 5 2 tandem arrangement for the tandem arrangement of the two cylinders the near wake structures are different from the parallel case the vorticity contour of the two cylinders with tandem arrangement when u 9 is presented in fig 15 the downstream cylinder disrupts the vortices from the upstream cylinder due to the arrangement of tandem this leads to a different vortex shedding model when the two cylinders are rigidly connected and only allowed to move together fig 15 a a typical 2s pattern can be captured by the downstream cylinder for the separate vibration cases fig 15 b the downstream cylinder cut the wake of the upstream cylinder due to the out of step motion of the two cylinders as the position of the upstream cylinder overlaps the equilibrium position and is going to move downward t t n 0 the upstream vortices reattach on the surface of the downstream cylinder as the upstream cylinder vibrates from equilibrium position to maximum position when t t n 0 25 it can be clearly observed that the wake of the upstream cylinder is disturbed by the downstream one and then separating from the surface of the cylinder this phenomenon leads to the imbalance force acts on the downstream cylinder and further results in the higher amplitudes of downstream cylinder in two directions compared with that of the upstream cylinder see in figs 7 and 8 in general the constraints between the two tandem arranged cylinders can lead to parallel vortex street and a large amplitude for downstream cylinder can be observed when the two cylinders can motion separately 4 5 3 stagger arrangement fig 16 presents the near wake structures of two stagger arranged cylinders it can be seen that the vortices shedding from the two cylinders interact with each other especially the vortices generated in the gap will mix with each other for the cases with constraint the distance between the cylinders does not change when vibration occurs although the vortices shedding from the two cylinders interrelate with each other the wake structure is relatively stable the shear layers attached on the surface of upstream cylinder are stretched as elongated wake structures and a typical 2s structure of the vortices shedding model for the downstream cylinder is observed for the case of separate vibrating cylinders the distance between the cylinders varies with the occurrence of vibration different wake structures result from different cylinder distances when the distance is small t t n 0 0 25 the vortex can not be formed in the gap of the cylinders when the distance is large the 2s structure can be captured for the downstream cylinder 5 conclusions the two degree of freedom fiv of two cylinders which arranged in parallel tandem and stagger was numerically studied in this paper the initial center to center distance between two cylinders was fixed at 2d the two cylinders with and without rigid constraint were considered the amplitudes responses and xy trajectories of all the arrangements are presented and discussed moreover the near wake structures are also analyzed in this work the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 for the motion of the two cylinders in x direction the existence of constraint can obviously suppress the vibration of the two cylinders when u 9 when u 9 the amplitudes of the staggered cylinders with rigid constraint are higher than that of cylinders which are allowed to vibrate freely for the parallel and tandem arrangements constraint can effectively suppress the vibration over the entire reduced velocity range 2 for the motion of the two cylinders in transverse flow direction the vibration of cylinders is significantly suppressed when u 7 in the three different arrangements when u 7 the vibration of the parallel cylinders with constraint is strengthened and the amplitude is much higher than that without constraint 3 the existence of rigid constraint for parallel arrangement leads to the frequencies of cylinders in two directions keep steady with the rising of u for tandem arrangement the rigid constraint results in lower frequency in x direction in most reduced velocity range for two cylinders with stagger arrange the rigid constraint almost doesn t affect the tendency of frequency responses with the rising of u but leads to the drifting of peaks for frequency 4 the trajectory of the oscillatory system is affected by the reduced velocity and the arrangement of the two cylinders when the parallel cylinders vibrate with constraint the closed single loop and 8 shape trajectories can be observed for the staggered cylinders with constraints the amplitude in flow direction is much lower than the transverse amplitude the trajectory of i shape can be obtained for the stagger cylinders the trajectories are shown as closed single loop in a wide range of 6 u 14 5 the near wake structure of the two cylinders with constraint is more stable than that without constraint and 2s model can be observed this is due to the two cylinders move synchronously when the constraint is applied for the free oscillating cylinders the distance between the cylinders varies with the vibration which results in large force fluctuations acting on the cylinders and then causes more complex vibration responses credit authorship contribution statement qunfeng zou

20939,the flow induced vibrations fiv in two degrees of freedom for two circular cylinders with three arrangements including parallel tandem and stagger were investigated numerically the rigid constraint is considered due to its widespread in industry fields the effects of arrangement and constraint on fiv characteristics including trajectory vibration response force response and near wake structure are analyzed results indicate that the existence of constraint can significantly suppress the vibration of the two cylinders when reduced velocity u 7 however when u 7 the oscillation of the parallel cylinders with constraint in cross flow direction is strengthened moreover the existence of constraint can reduce the vibration frequencies of cylinders with tandem arrangement significantly the trajectory in the shape of 8 can be captured in most cases of motion for the cylinders without constraint and the closed single loop 8 and i shape trajectories are obtained for the vibration of cylinders with constraint the two cylinders move synchronously when the constraint is applied and the near wake structures of the two cylinders are more stable than that without constraint keywords

engineering hong and shah 2018 li et al 2018 milne et al 2016 wang et al 2020b the force due to vortex shedding of cylinder can lead to vibration which can further result in instability and fatigue damage of the cylinder in general the fiv of cylinder is suppressed for its damage to engineering safety zhu et al 2019a kumar et al 2018 rashidi et al 2016 on the other hand the vibration of cylinder can be utilized to harvest clean energy from river and ocean currents ding et al 2015 2016 2019 wang et al 2019a zou et al 2019 the fiv of a single circular cylinder is a widespread flow structure interaction phenomenon and has been investigated numerically or experimentally by researchers by analyzing the simulated and experimental results ponta and aref 2006 classified the vortex patterns and illustrated the relationship between the classification and the reynolds number re in laminar flow the vortex patterns of two 2s four 2p and three p s vortices modes have been observed under different reynolds numbers in the simulations of singh et al 2013 hasan and ali 2013 investigated the vortex shedding of single cylinder when re 60 and re 100 they carried out the richardson number to describe the strength of vortex shedding the other literatures about the fiv of a single cylinder can be found in the reviews of williamson and govardhan 2004 bearman 2011 and the studies of wang et al 2019b 2020c 2020d ding et al 2021 yang et al 2019 and zhu et al 2019b 2019c 2020 in consideration of the technical requirement and economy the arrangement of two circular cylinders is common in the industry for the very reason the research on the flow induced vibration of two cylinders has remarkable significance in engineering applications there are many literatures on the fiv of two cylinders ding et al 2017 haider and sohn 2018 xu et al 2018 for example qin et al 2018 investigated the influence of the natural frequencies on the flow induced vibrations of two cylinders and elucidated the oscillatory characteristic and its relationship with the frequency ratio zhao and yan 2013 numerically studied the vortex induced vibration viv of two cylinders at a fixed diameter ratio of 0 2 they found a small distance between the two cylinders could suppress the vibration and lower the amplitude in addition griffith et al 2017 investigated the flow induced vibration of two cylinders arranged in tandem and stagger when re 200 it was concluded that two cylinders will vibrate unsynchronized when the vortex shedding frequency of one cylinder is around their inherent frequencies furthermore the fiv of multiple cylinders is more complex for their interaction between cylinders ding et al 2018 studied the fiv of three circular cylinders with tandem arrangement at high reynolds number they found that the downstream cylinder will affect the fiv of the upstream cylinder and observed 2p 2p 4s and 2p 2s vortex patterns for the three cylinders zhang et al 2018 studied the fiv of four stagger arranged cylinders and focused on the influence of gap between the cylinders on the viv responses and the energy harvesting they concluded that the interaction between cylinders can enhance the viv of the downstream cylinder moreover yu and lin 2005 numerically investigated the viv of two to seven identical cylinders it was shown that the cylinder becomes more fluid elastically unstable when there are more upstream cylinders although there are many applications of flow induced vibration and its control of multiple cylinders the flow characteristics and the underlying control mechanisms still need further investigation therefore a series of numerical simulations on the two degree of freedom flow induced vibration of two circular cylinders with different arrangements are performed in this paper moreover due to the widespread of rigid constraint between cylinders such as heat exchanger bundle marine riser and the support structures the effects of rigid connection between two cylinders are considered this paper is constituted as following the physical model of the oscillatory system and the numerical method are illustrated in section 2 and section 3 respectively the fiv responses of two cylinders including amplitude force coefficients frequencies xy trajectories and vortex patterns are presented and analyzed in section 4 the conclusions are summarized in the end 2 physical model the schematic of the investigated model is shown in fig 1 the oscillatory system consists of two circular cylinders which are immersed in uniform flow the diameter of the rigid cylinder is d the stiffness is denoted as k and the oscillatory system damping is c to compare the results of present work with that of literatures hover and triantafyllou 2001 assis et al 2006 a low mass ratio of each circular cylinder m m system m d where m system means the inertial mass of the oscillation system and m d indicates the displaced fluid mass is set as 2 0 in this work three types of arrangement for two cylinders were studied which are parallel side by side tandem and stagger arrangement for all the three arrangements the center to center distance between the cylinders is d 2d the schematic of constraint between the two cylinders is shown in fig 1 d and the connection is assumed to be rigid in the numerical simulation which means the two cylinders will vibrate together without relative displacement meanwhile the calculations of the two cylinders in fiv that each cylinder can vibrate separately were conducted for comparison and the simulations were conducted in the reduced velocity range of 2 u 14 in this work the definition of reduced velocity is u u f n water d in which u means the velocity of free stream f n water is the natural frequency of the oscillatory system in water 3 numerical approach 3 1 governing equations and integration scheme fiv of two rigid cylinders with three different arrangements is considered in this study as shown in fig 1 a cartesian coordinate system is applied and the x direction is the direction of u the two cylinders can be rigidly coupled or vibrate separately the reynolds number re of 100 is considered to avoid the effect of three dimensional turbulent characteristics and it is assumed that the flow is laminar incompressible and two dimensional the unsteady navier stokes n s equations can be described as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t x i u i u j 1 ρ p x i u i u i x i 1 r e 2 u i x i 2 where x i is the coordinate u i is the velocity and p is the pressure re is the reynolds number the mass spring damping simplification is applied to model the oscillation of the two cylinders the two cylinders can oscillate in both the x and y directions under the stream loading for each cylinder of the oscillating system the linear mass spring damping governing equations are 3 m s y s t e m x c 1 x k 1 x f f l u i d x 4 m s y s t e m y c 2 y k 2 y f f l u i d y where f fluid x and f fluid y are the drag and lift force on the cylinder x x and x y y and y are the displacement velocity and accelerated velocity of the cylinder in the flow direction cross flow direction c 1 and c 2 are the system damping of the cylinders k 1 and k 2 are the system stiffness of the cylinders as shown in fig 1 for the cylinder in fiv the velocity components in flow and cross flow directions are defined as 5 u t x t 6 v t y t to simulate the oscillation of the two cylinders the motion equations 3 and 4 are discretized by the method of fourth order runge kutta take eq 4 as an example it can be rewritten as 7 y t n 1 y t n υ y t n δ t δ t 2 6 k 1 2 k 2

which is y in eq 4 δt is time step 3 2 computational domain and boundary conditions a typical arrangement of two cylinders in parallel is depicted in fig 2 the distance between the boundary and the center of the closest cylinder is fixed at 20d which is large enough to obtain the wake flow zou et al 2019 therefore different computational domains are adopted to keep such constant distance for different arrangements the boundary conditions of inlet and outlet are set as uniform velocity and zero gradient velocity respectively in account of enough distance between cylinders and top or bottom slip boundaries are applied for top and bottom for all cylinders the no slip condition is also considered an internal boundary of overset exists for the utilization of the overset mesh the function of this boundary is for connecting the background mesh and the append mesh the internal boundary is not a physical boundary but a numerical boundary parts of the background mesh will be overlapped by the overset mesh as shown in fig 3 the overset mesh consists of the background mesh and the append mesh the size of background mesh is the same as that of the computational domain and is static and structured in addition the area nearby the two cylinders and their motion area are refined to capture the flow field variation and the oscillation of the cylinders the append mesh will move with the oscillation of the cylinders the obvious advantage for the combination of two grids is that it can adapt to the moving of complicated structures and allow strongly enforced boundary conditions koblitz et al 2017 tang et al 2003 in this work the two dimensional simulations were conducted by commercial cfd software fluent and the motion equations of cylinder are discreted by the method of fourth order runge kutta and then realized by in hose code thorough user defined function udf in addition according to the previous studies we conducted wang et al 2019a 2020a zou et al 2019 the overset mesh strategy can provide high accuracy which is acceptable in engineering applications the non dimensional time step is set as u δt d 0 001 to make sure that the courant friedrichs lewy cfl number is less than 1 lax and wendroff 2012 so that the calculation is converged within each time step hence the different time steps were applied for different reduced velocities in addition the mesh sensitivity study was conducted to ensure that the simulation results are independent of the mesh density the density of the background mesh and append mesh should be validated synchronously due to the density corresponding to these two sets of mesh the mesh sensitivity study was accomplished in following conditions the two cylinders are arranged in stagger and with rigid constraint the reduced velocity is u 8 the mesh density is represented by the minimal mesh size δh of background mesh it s worth noting that the force coefficients presented in table 1 are the mean value of two cylinders as shown in table 1 the optimal minimal background mesh size of 0 020d was selected under the comparison of a peaks x d a peaks y d the root mean square value of lift coefficient c l rms and the time averaged drag coefficient c d mean 3 3 validations to confirm the validity of the simulation approach the studies on flow pass the two circular cylinders in parallel arrangement were carried out the vibration responses such as drag coefficient c d mean time averaged lift and rms lift coefficients c l mean and c l rms are compared with that reported by bao et al 2013 lee et al 2009 and kang 2003 as shown in fig 4 for small values of d d the values of the drag coefficient obtained in the present work are closely agreed with that reported by bao et al 2013 lee et al 2009 and kang 2003 for relatively large value of d d c d mean is slightly larger but the variation trends are almost the same meanwhile since the lift coefficient is important for the description of cylinders in fiv both the time averaged lift coefficient c l mean and rms lift coefficient c l rms are analyzed and compared with the previous works bao et al 2013 kang 2003 lee et al 2009 for drag coefficients the maximum difference is only 3 4 which can be observed in the case of d d 4 compared with the results of lee et al 2009 moreover the average difference between the results of present work and others is 2 0 as depicted in fig 5 the time averaged lift coefficient decreases sharply in the range of 1 d d 3 and then keeps around 0 1 with the rise of d d while the value of c l rms rises with d d increasing from 1 to 3 and drops slowly when d d 3 the calculation of two cylinders in fiv has been carried out by the present method and the amplitude results have been presented and compared with that of griffith et al 2017 as shown in fig 6 the amplitude of upstream cylinder increases slowly in the range of 0 u 3 and then rises fast when 3 u 6 the decline can be observed when u 6 as for the downstream cylinder the tendency of amplitude almost keeps the same however the downstream cylinder experience significantly higher amplitude vibration when compared with that of upstream cylinder the reason is that the vortices shedding from the upstream cylinder can be captured by the downstream cylinder and then further leads to stronger dynamic lift force acting on the surface of downstream cylinder which also corresponds to the results of ding et al 2018 it is worth noting that more validations about the overset mesh strategy and fiv of a single cylinder can be found in the previous work of wang et al 2019a 2020a and zou et al 2019 as a result it can be concluded that the vibration responses obtained in this work match well with that reported in previous work which confirms the reliability of the numerical method used in this work 4 results discussion 4 1 amplitude response the non dimensional oscillation amplitude ratios of two cylinders in 2 dof a peaks x d and a peaks y d are used to describe the oscillate strength of cylinders the numerical results were compared with that of gao et al 2020 it should be noted that the mass ratio and reynolds number in the work of gao et al 2020 are 2 6 and 150 respectively as presented in fig 7 for x direction the amplitude ranges of two cylinders for all cases are 0 a peaks x d 0 6 when the two cylinders are arranged in parallel for x direction the initial branch of the top cylinder can be observed in the ranges of 2 u 3 and the amplitude experiences fast increasing when 3 u 4 and then drop in the range of 4 u 5 when 5 u 14 the amplitude for the top cylinder fluctuates with the increase of reduced velocity and significant local peaks exist when u 9 the maximum value of amplitude for top cylinder with parallel cylinder is 0 25d and it is obtained when u 4 the maximum amplitude of the top cylinder with parallel arrangement in x direction is 0 30d u 9 for the bottom cylinder of the separate vibration cases the amplitude in flow direction is almost the same as that of the top cylinder when u 7 and a maximum amplitude value of 0 27d can be captured when u 8 the amplitude of bottom cylinder drops slowly when u 9 as for the situation of oscillation together the vibration is suppressed in the range of u 7 the amplitudes of the two cylinders with constraint are even smaller than 0 05d when u 7 the vibration of the cylinders is enhanced and reaches a peak at u 8 but this peak value is still lower than that of two cylinders oscillate separately the amplitude of the two cylinders with constraint drops to a low value when u 13 the amplitudes of two cylinders with parallel arrangement were also carried out by gao et al 2020 the comparison shows that the amplitude in their results is lower than that of this work when 7 u 12 which can be caused by the difference of system parameters for the cases of tandem arrangement that the two cylinders can vibrate separately the cylinders almost do not oscillate when u 4 with the increase of u the amplitude of the downstream cylinder experiences a slight rising in the reduced velocity range of 4 u 6 a rapid increase and decrease of the amplitude have been observed when 6 u 8 the peak value of the amplitude for downstream cylinder is 0 31d when u 7 as for upstream cylinder the amplitude in flow direction rises slowly in the range of 4 u 8 and then reduces to a steady value around 0 015d the maximum value of amplitude for upstream cylinder can reach 0 052d u 8 for the cases of two cylinders fixed together the amplitudes are always less than 0 014d which is much lower than that of free vibration cylinders the amplitudes for this case in the work of gao et al 2020 also keep around zero the vibration can be effectively suppressed by constraint when the two cylinders are arranged in tandem different from the above two arrangements for the stagger cases the location of the upstream cylinder is 45 to bottom left of the downstream cylinders this relative location results in complicated gap flow and further influences the amplitude of the two cylinders when they oscillate separately for the upstream cylinder the amplitude in x direction rises and then drops with the increase of reduced velocity when 3 u 14 the maximum value of the amplitude ratio is a peaks x d 0 28 when u 7 and the same tendency can also be observed for the amplitude in x direction of the downstream cylinder and the maximum value is 0 59d u 8 when the cylinders are rigidly connected the vibration is suppressed in the range of 2 u 6 and then the amplitude increases monotonically with the reduced velocity in the range of 6 u 11 and drops fast when 11 u 13 it is obviously that the disparity of amplitudes in x direction between two cylinders for parallel is much small than that of tandem when the cylinders vibrate in 2dof the reason is that the wake of the upstream cylinder is captured by the downstream one when these two cylinders are arranged in tandem and this phenomenon rarely happens for the situation of parallel arrangement this can be observed and will be discussed in the section of near wake structures the amplitudes in cross flow direction for the three arrangements are presented in fig 8 it can be observed that the a peaks y is larger than a peaks x when 5 u 14 for the cases of parallel arrangement the vibration responses of the two free vibration cylinders are similar at different u a prominent increment of a peaks y is detected as 3 u 5 then it stabilizes around 0 6d in the range of 5 u 8 5 when u 9 the value of a peaks y decreases with the rise of reduced velocity on the other hand the fiv responses of the two parallel cylinders with constraint are different the amplitudes for constrain cases in y direction are small in the range of 2 u 4 the value of a peaks y increases slowly when 4 u 7 once u is higher than 7 a peaks y rises sharply and the maximum value reaches 1 20d when u 9 which is higher than that of separate vibration cylinders moreover the amplitude experiences a drop when 9 u 14 the amplitude of parallel arranged two cylinders with constraint in the work of gao et al 2020 also shown similar tendency when compared with that in the present work for the tandem cases the vibration in y direction for downstream cylinder is significantly influenced by the upstream one while two cylinders vibrate separately in the two ranges of 4 u 8 and 8 u 14 the amplitude in cross flow direction for the downstream cylinder increases first and then drops therefore two peaks exist in these two ranges a peaks y 0 78d when u 7 a peaks y 1 18d when u 9 for upstream cylinder the initial branch can be observed when 2 u 4 and the amplitude in cross flow direction increases in the reduced velocity range of 4 u 7 and decreases when 7 u 14 with the rise of reduced velocity the maximum amplitude of 0 82d can be obtained for upstream cylinder in cross flow direction when u 7 in addition the vibration of the two cylinders with constraint is suppressed in the tested reduced velocity range the amplitude of two cylinders with constraint keep around zero when 2 u 7 5 the amplitude increases with the rise of reduced velocity in the range of 7 5 u 10 and then decreases the maximum amplitude of cases with constraint in cross flow direction is 0 32d u 10 for the results of gao et al 2020 similar tendency can be observed but the peak can be captured when u 5 for the two cylinders in stagger arrangement the amplitude of upstream cylinder rises in the range of 3 u 8 and decreases when 8 u 9 with the increase of reduced velocity the maximum amplitude of 0 65d for upstream cylinder was observed when u 8 the maximum amplitude 0 96d of downstream cylinder also can be found when u 8 as for the cases with constraint the amplitude increases slowly in the range of 2 u 6 and rises fast when 6 u 11 with the increase of reduced velocity the maximum amplitude for the cases with constraint is 0 60d u 11 in addition the vibration of cylinders with constraint becomes stronger than that of upstream cylinder when u 8 5 but it still lower than that of downstream oscillator the above analysis shows that the constraint between two cylinders can significantly suppress the oscillation of cylinders in x direction for different arrangements however in cross flow direction the constraint does not always reduce the amplitudes the effect of constraint depends on the arrangements of two cylinders for brevity the influences of the constraint for different arrangements are summarized in table 2 for y direction the role of constraint in vibration amplitude turns from suppression to enhancement when the arrangement changes from flow direction tandem to cross flow direction parallel this transition is resulted from the variation of lift force for the changing of vortex shedding which will be discussed in section 4 5 1 4 2 frequency responses the oscillation frequencies of two cylinders can be obtained by fast fourier transform fft over the time history displacement of oscillators the reduced frequencies presented in this study are defined as f x f osc x f n water and f y f osc y f n water to be more detailed the f osc x and f osc y are the first order oscillation frequencies in x direction and y direction respectively the frequencies responses of two cylinders with parallel arrangement are released in fig 9 a the frequencies of top and bottom cylinders keep the same in the same direction for a given reduced velocity for separating vibration cases the value of f y is the four times of f x when u 2 and 3 and the frequency in flow direction keeps the same as that in cross flow direction when 4 u 9 moreover the value of f y increases first in the range of 2 u 4 and then decreases in the range of 4 u 14 with the rise of reduced velocity the maximum value of f y 1 44 can be obtained when u 4 for the cylinders with rigid constraint the frequencies in two directions are equal when 2 u 8 and f x 2f y can be observed when u 8 and the maximum value of f x and f y can be captured when u 8 as presented in fig 9 b the frequencies of upstream and downstream cylinders are equal in the same direction except for upstream cylinder when u 8 for the separating vibration cases meanwhile f x 2f y can be observed for the separating vibration cases except for f x f y when u 8 the exception for u 8 will lead to the difference of trajectory which can be found in the subsequence section of trajectory for two cylinders with rigid constraint the value of f x is double to that of f y when 5 u 14 and f x f y can be observed in the range of 2 u 4 for a given reduced velocity the vibration frequencies of two cylinders arranged in stagger totally keep the same in two directions for cases without rigid constraint fig 9 c the frequencies ratios of two separating vibrate cylinders increase in the range of 3 u 4 and decline slowly when u 4 with the increase of u the maximum reduced frequency of f x f y 1 34 can be obtained when u 4 for cases with rigid constraint between cylinders the frequencies in two directions keep the same for a given reduced velocity and the similar tendency can be observed with the rising of u when compared with the cases of separate vibration the maximum reduced frequency of f x f y 1 38 is captured when u 7 and it is worth noting that f x f y can result in the closed loop trajectory and f x 2f y leads to 8 shape trajectory which will be detailed discussed and analyzed in the sub section of trajectory to sum up the existence of rigid constraint for parallel arrangement leads to the frequencies of cylinders in two directions keeping steady with the rising of u when compared with that of separating vibration cases for tandem arrangement the frequency in x direction for rigid constraint cases is lower than that of separating vibration cases in the most reduced velocity range 2 u 9 for two cylinders with stagger arrangement the rigid constraint almost doesn t affect the tendency of frequency responses with the rise of u but leads to the drifting of peaks for frequency 4 3 forces responses the drag and lift forces responses are important parameters to analyze the vibration mechanism of cylinders in fiv the time averaged drag c d mean and root mean square value of lift force coefficients c l rms for two cylinders with different arrangements were carried out and discussed in this section as shown in fig 10 a the force responses of two cylinders with parallel arrangement are presented as expected the values of c d mean for top and bottom cylinders are the same because almost no interaction between two cylinders in flow direction due to the parallel arrangement the slight differences in high reduced velocity range are caused by the small instantaneous distance can be observed in the section of near wake structures between two cylinders due to the high amplitude the values of c d mean for top and bottom cylinders increase fast in the range of 2 u 4 and then drop slowly in the range of 4 u 14 with the rise of u the maximum values of time averaged drag coefficient for these two cylinders are all equal to 2 27 u 4 the values of c l rms for two cylinders almost keep the same for the above reason and the maximum value of c l rms 1 67 for the two cylinders can be obtained when u 4 for the cases with rigid constraint the value of c l rms for two cylinders is lower than that of the cases without rigid constraint in low reduced velocity range and inverse in high reduced velocity range which corresponds to the tendency of a peaks y and also explain the influence of constraint table 2 in addition the peaks of c l rms for two cylinders with constraint exist and can be captured under the different reduced velocities as for tandem arrangement fig 10 b the value of c d mean for upstream cylinder is significantly higher than that of downstream cylinder especially in low reduced velocity range the value of c l rms increases first in the range of 2 u 5 and then decreases to a steady range when 5 u 14 with the rise of reduced velocity moreover the tendencies of c l rms for the two cylinders almost keep the same and the value of c l rms for upstream cylinder is higher than that of downstream cylinder in the range of 4 u 8 and reverse in the range of 8 u 14 which corresponding to the comparison of a peaks y for the two cylinders fig 8 the maximum values of c l rms for upstream and downstream cylinder can be captured when u 5 c l rms max 1 24 and u 6 c l rms max 0 86 respectively for the cases with rigid constraint the drag coefficients of upstream cylinder are far higher than that of the downstream one due to that the downstream cylinder is exposed in the wake area of upstream cylinder and the lift coefficients of two cylinders with rigid constraint always keep in a low level never higher than 0 6 with the rise of reduced velocity which corresponds to the tendency of a peaks y in fig 8 the forces responses of two cylinders with stagger arrangement are presented in fig 10 c the results show that the drag coefficients of upstream cylinder are lower than that of downstream cylinder for a given reduced velocity when u 4 the value of c d mean for downstream cylinder increases first in the range of 4 u 6 and then drops in the range of 6 u 11 the maximum value of 2 16 can be obtained when u 6 for upstream cylinder the time averaged drag coefficients keep around 1 4 with the increase of u for a given reduced velocity c l rms upstream c l rms downstream can be observed which also supports the results of amplitude responses the tendencies of lift coefficients for these two cylinders are similar the maximum lift coefficients of 0 63 u 6 and 1 66 u 5 can be captured for upstream and downstream cylinders respectively for the cases with rigid constraint the drag coefficient of upstream cylinder is only slightly smaller than that of downstream cylinder which means that the influence of the wake of upstream cylinder on the drag force for downstream cylinder is weaker than that of tandem arrangement and for the cases with rigid constraint the value of c l rms for upstream cylinder is lower than that of downstream one in all selected reduced velocities moreover lift coefficients of the cylinders with rigid constraint exceed that of separated cylinders when u 9 the tendency of lift forces coefficients almost keeps the same as that of amplitudes for the separating vibration cases 4 4 xy trajectories the xy trajectories of two cylinders can reveal how the cylinders oscillate as shown in fig 11 the trajectories of two cylinders arranged in parallel are presented under different u the motions of the two cylinders with constraint are synchronized thus there is only one trajectory shown for the free vibration cases due to the low amplitudes of two cylinders the xy trajectory almost can be considered as one point for each cylinder when u 3 in the range of 4 u 7 closed single loop trajectories are observed for the two free vibrating cylinders another type of oscillation trajectory is 8 shape which can be captured when 8 u 14 the closed single loop trajectories indicate that the oscillation frequency in x direction f osc x is equal to that in y direction f osc y and the trajectories with the shape of 8 mean that f osc y is twice of f osc x zhao et al 2014 for a given reduced velocity when the two cylinders are rigidly connected the amplitude is lower than that of freely oscillation cylinders this results in the different shapes of the trajectories between the two situations as shown in the range of 3 u 7 the displacement of the cylinders with constraint is too small to be identified when u 8 the motion trail with the shape of d closed single loop is captured with the further increase of u the trajectories with the shape of 8 can be observed for the cases with constraint fig 12 shows the xy trajectories for the oscillators arranged in tandem the amplitudes for cylinders are very low and the xy trajectories are not easy to be identified when u 4 however when u 5 the classical trajectory with the shape of 8 appears for the freely oscillating cylinders an exception exists the trajectory of the downstream is a closed single loop when u 8 for the downstream cylinder under free oscillation the oscillation frequencies in two directions are the same when u 8 although the motion of the downstream cylinder is disturbed by the wake of the upstream one the trajectories in wide reduced velocity range 4 u 14 are similar to that of single cylinder which was observed by zhao et al 2014 the trajectories also clearly show that the amplitude in flow direction is much lower than a peaks y when u 5 for the tandem cylinders with constraint i shape trajectories can be observed only when u 9 the amplitude in flow direction is almost close to zero for these cases as shown in fig 13 the trajectories for the stagger cylinders are closed single loops in a wide range of 6 u 14 for the separate oscillate scheme the trails of the motions for the downstream cylinder are relatively complex at u 7 and u 8 compared with other reduced velocities this is caused by the instability of the oscillation for the downstream cylinder and the other trajectories are basically closed single loops but the shape is not quite the same as the rising of the reduced velocity the shape of the closed single loop varies from a slender loop to a drop shape the change suggests the value of the amplitudes in two directions are closing to each other with the increasing of u when 9 u 13 in addition the trajectories also indicate that the amplitude of upstream cylinder in the cross flow direction is lower than that of downstream cylinder for a given reduced velocity the trajectories for the oscillating cylinders with constraint also show the same tendency in the range of 7 u 11 but the size of the trajectories is relatively smaller due to the low amplitude then 12 u 14 the amplitude in flow direction reduces faster than the amplitude in cross flow direction which results in slender trajectories with the rise of u 4 5 near wake structures the near wake structures are useful to make the complex motions and the interaction between two cylinders clear in addition the amplitude response and the shape of trajectory can be partly illustrated by the near wake structures in consideration that the similarity of the near wake structure for different reduced velocities only the near wake structures of some highlighted cases are presented in this part 4 5 1 parallel arrangement the near wake structures of the two cylinders with parallel arrangement are similar thus a typical reduced velocity of u 9 is selected and the corresponding revolutions of near wake structures are presented in fig 14 for the oscillators with constraint the vortices formed in the gap of the two cylinders interact with each other and then fade away in the near wake as shown in fig 14 a the vortices shedding from the outside of the two parallel cylinders are less affected and then the independent vortices form the parallel vortex street in the wake of the two cylinders for the cylinders which can vibrate separately the wake structures are close to that of connected cylinders however the vortices shedding from one cylinder will interact with the vortices shedding from the other cylinder when the two cylinders moving close to each other and this results in complex wake structures behind the two cylinders as shown in fig 14 b it is noted that the most remarkable feature for the wake structures in the cases of separate oscillation is that the vortices shedding from the two cylinders are stretched due to the interaction between vortices moreover the vortex shedding from the two cylinders synchronous when the constraint exists which leads to high lift force and further results in high amplitude in y direction 4 5 2 tandem arrangement for the tandem arrangement of the two cylinders the near wake structures are different from the parallel case the vorticity contour of the two cylinders with tandem arrangement when u 9 is presented in fig 15 the downstream cylinder disrupts the vortices from the upstream cylinder due to the arrangement of tandem this leads to a different vortex shedding model when the two cylinders are rigidly connected and only allowed to move together fig 15 a a typical 2s pattern can be captured by the downstream cylinder for the separate vibration cases fig 15 b the downstream cylinder cut the wake of the upstream cylinder due to the out of step motion of the two cylinders as the position of the upstream cylinder overlaps the equilibrium position and is going to move downward t t n 0 the upstream vortices reattach on the surface of the downstream cylinder as the upstream cylinder vibrates from equilibrium position to maximum position when t t n 0 25 it can be clearly observed that the wake of the upstream cylinder is disturbed by the downstream one and then separating from the surface of the cylinder this phenomenon leads to the imbalance force acts on the downstream cylinder and further results in the higher amplitudes of downstream cylinder in two directions compared with that of the upstream cylinder see in figs 7 and 8 in general the constraints between the two tandem arranged cylinders can lead to parallel vortex street and a large amplitude for downstream cylinder can be observed when the two cylinders can motion separately 4 5 3 stagger arrangement fig 16 presents the near wake structures of two stagger arranged cylinders it can be seen that the vortices shedding from the two cylinders interact with each other especially the vortices generated in the gap will mix with each other for the cases with constraint the distance between the cylinders does not change when vibration occurs although the vortices shedding from the two cylinders interrelate with each other the wake structure is relatively stable the shear layers attached on the surface of upstream cylinder are stretched as elongated wake structures and a typical 2s structure of the vortices shedding model for the downstream cylinder is observed for the case of separate vibrating cylinders the distance between the cylinders varies with the occurrence of vibration different wake structures result from different cylinder distances when the distance is small t t n 0 0 25 the vortex can not be formed in the gap of the cylinders when the distance is large the 2s structure can be captured for the downstream cylinder 5 conclusions the two degree of freedom fiv of two cylinders which arranged in parallel tandem and stagger was numerically studied in this paper the initial center to center distance between two cylinders was fixed at 2d the two cylinders with and without rigid constraint were considered the amplitudes responses and xy trajectories of all the arrangements are presented and discussed moreover the near wake structures are also analyzed in this work the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 for the motion of the two cylinders in x direction the existence of constraint can obviously suppress the vibration of the two cylinders when u 9 when u 9 the amplitudes of the staggered cylinders with rigid constraint are higher than that of cylinders which are allowed to vibrate freely for the parallel and tandem arrangements constraint can effectively suppress the vibration over the entire reduced velocity range 2 for the motion of the two cylinders in transverse flow direction the vibration of cylinders is significantly suppressed when u 7 in the three different arrangements when u 7 the vibration of the parallel cylinders with constraint is strengthened and the amplitude is much higher than that without constraint 3 the existence of rigid constraint for parallel arrangement leads to the frequencies of cylinders in two directions keep steady with the rising of u for tandem arrangement the rigid constraint results in lower frequency in x direction in most reduced velocity range for two cylinders with stagger arrange the rigid constraint almost doesn t affect the tendency of frequency responses with the rising of u but leads to the drifting of peaks for frequency 4 the trajectory of the oscillatory system is affected by the reduced velocity and the arrangement of the two cylinders when the parallel cylinders vibrate with constraint the closed single loop and 8 shape trajectories can be observed for the staggered cylinders with constraints the amplitude in flow direction is much lower than the transverse amplitude the trajectory of i shape can be obtained for the stagger cylinders the trajectories are shown as closed single loop in a wide range of 6 u 14 5 the near wake structure of the two cylinders with constraint is more stable than that without constraint and 2s model can be observed this is due to the two cylinders move synchronously when the constraint is applied for the free oscillating cylinders the distance between the cylinders varies with the vibration which results in large force fluctuations acting on the cylinders and then causes more complex vibration responses credit authorship contribution statement qunfeng zou
