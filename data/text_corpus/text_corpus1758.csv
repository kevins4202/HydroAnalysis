first stage of the sbr it degrades bio refractory compounds via advanced oxidation processes thereby resulting in the formation of simple biodegradable intermediates several factors including the hydraulic retention time hrt sludge volume index svi and sludge retention time srt of the efsbr were optimized the effectiveness was studied for 1 y laboratory scale experiments under stable conditions hrt of 10 h srt of 15 d mixed liquor suspended solids concentration of 3500 mg l and svi of 89 which revealed 99 chemical oxygen demand 97 total nitrogen and 95 total phosphorus removal thus the developed system is economically feasible and superior to other conventional biological treatment systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment advanced oxidation process fenton sequencing batch reactor biological treatment pollutants 1 introduction discharge of wastewater ww containing a high load of organic pollutants is an important environmental issue 45 46 it causes the growth of algae and aquatic plants in shallow rivers which affect the esthetic properties of water a high nutrient load nitrogen and phosphorus can cause adverse effects such as reduced concentrations of dissolved oxygen do among the various food industries the dairy industry is severely affected by the presence of high loads of organic matter in such effluents 3 24 36 50 biological processes that remove nutrients from industrial ww can be performed in several systems including conventional activated sludge as membrane bioreactors oxidation ditches upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors and sequencing batch reactors sbrs 7 23 sbrs use a modified as process and are operated using a sequence of five discrete phases filling reaction settling draw and idle these phases occur in a single reactor basin during the filling phase raw ww is mixed with biomass from the sbr and the reaction under aerobic conditions is aided by agitation and aeration 50 51 in the next phase stirring is discontinued to allow the sludge to settle settling phase during the draw phase the effluent is discharged this cycle is then repeated 35 this approach has many advantages such as low energy consumption small space requirement low construction and operational costs high flexibility and high effectiveness compared with other types of biological processes 22 40 advanced oxidation processes aops are chemical processes based on the application of radical species mainly hydroxyl radicals oh for the degradation of complex organic compounds the final treatment products are in the form of co2 h2o and inorganic salts 5 17 aops such as photocatalytic oxidation 16 ozonation fernandes et al 2019 fernandes et al 2018 cavitation based processes 14 15 17 and the fenton process have demonstrated reasonable performance in the treatment of industrial ww the fenton reaction fe2 h2o2 is widely used because of its advantages such as ease of operation at ambient temperature and pressure environmental friendliness higher efficiency in removing a wide range of organic compounds and low cost 26 27 30 32 the oh generated during the fenton reaction are highly reactive and thus can completely degrade organic compounds by hydrogen abstraction however this process requires a high consumption of chemicals owing to the acidification of the solution this causes the generation of high metal sludge 38 39 which is not economically feasible for high pollutant loads moreover the sole use of aops such as fenton or electrochemical oxidation does not provide satisfactory treatment effectiveness vahid and khataee 2013 asaithambi et al 2020 the electro fenton ef process 15 is one of the most popular modifications of the classic fenton process that enhances the oxidation of organic compounds in the ef process iron ions are introduced into the liquid phase via a controlled electrochemical reaction the presence of iron ions in the ef process is an important factor because iron ions are responsible for conducting the catalytic fenton cycle 11 42 whereas an excess amount of iron ions can cause additional sludge formation hybrid processes combining conventional ww treatment e g biological methods with aops are effective and economical methods that allow the degradation of persistent organic pollutants to biodegradable intermediates in the primary step biological processes provide the final treatment step resulting in 100 removal of pollutants 21 50 54 in this study a novel strategy using the ef process as one of the stages in an sbr efsbr was proposed the efsbr process was expected to reduce the treatment cost owing to the low energy consumption and to minimize the shock caused by the high load of pollutants at the inlet of the reactor it was also expected to ensure effective removal of ef by products improve the efficiency with the variety of operation conditions and reduce the treatment time however this approach requires further study and validation with respect to various types of real effluents the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate the efficiency of the combined efsbr process with the addition of an extra ef phase for the treatment of dairy ww to optimize the operation conditions of the efsbr the effects of various parameters i e ph h2o2 concentration current density hydraulic retention time hrt mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration sludge volume index svi sludge retention time srt and reaction time t r on the overall degradation performance were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of dairy industry ww the as used in this research was obtained from a municipal ww treatment plant treating dairy industry ww diw in kerman iran and stored at 4 c until use coarse particles were separated using a filter the system reached steady state after 15 d of operation the characteristics of the diw and seed sludge are shown in table 1 2 2 efsbr operation and setup the efsbr was made of plexiglas with a total volume of 10 l dimensions of 18 8 cm length 18 5 cm wide 30 0 cm height which was divided into two sections ef and biological basins and six phases filling aop aeration settling draw and idle fig 1 the filling phase occurred in the upper part of the ef basin with the filling of ww using a peristaltic pump dls ma etatron co italy the aop phase second phase was conducted in the ef basin which contained four iron plates as the cathode and anode dimensions of 5 0 cm 5 0 cm 0 5 cm the gap between the electrode plates was 5 cm and a power supply 0 30 v 0 10 a was used to adjust the current density h2o2 30 w w solution was added at the beginning of the ef process the effluent was then passed to the biological basin using a flow head pump as depicted in fig 1 the biological basin consisted of an sbr basin a feeding system peristaltic pump and an aeration system air pump and four air stones the aeration system was used to inject air in the form of fine bubbles and to obtain uniform mixing to maintain the do level at 2 mg l 18 and decant the system all phases in the system were controlled by programmable timers in the preliminary experimental period the efficiency of the ef process was evaluated by measuring process parameters such as the h2o2 concentration current density aop time t a and ph of the solution the aeration time in the sbr basin t r was optimized to achieve maximum cod tn and tp removal however in the efsbr experiments according to the results of the preliminary period some other parameters were kept constant a compilation of the efsbr parameters is provided in table 2 the operating parameters of t a hrt srt svi and mlss were optimized to maximize the performance of the efsbr system 2 3 experimental procedure the reactor was initially inoculated with as bacteria i e 2 0 cm3 of the diw as the aeration and reaction phases were then operated in circulation for 15 d until the efsbr reached steady state the average time to reach steady state was 3 d 7 d of operation without changes 6 as the criterion in the system operation conditions with respect to the effluent cod codeff 43 to control the srt and mlss in the efsbr reactor a specified mlss concentration was removed to maintain a stable srt at the end of every reaction phase of the sbr 2 4 analytical methods the studied parameters included cod mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids tn no3 n tp and po4 3 p using the 5220a 4500d 2710d 4500 n c 4500 no3 b 4500 pe and 4500 pe methods respectively these measurements were performed according to the standard methods 1 parameters such as the turbidity temperature do and ph of the solution were monitored online using instruments provided by hanna instruments italy prior to analysis the collected samples were filtered using a membrane filter 0 45 Î¼m whatman the dissolved iron ion content was measured using the 1 10 phenanthroline method 1 to maintain the ph in the range from 6 5 to 8 0 sodium bicarbonate was used as a buffer evaluation of each operating cycle was performed on the basis of the parameter removal efficiency of tn tp and cod the removal efficiency r was calculated according to eq 1 1 r i n p u t o u t p u t i n p u t 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 sbr performance to understand the importance of the combined efsbr process separate treatment processes were initially conducted for the sbr and ef the results revealed that the sbr process alone suffered from major limitations for the treatment of ww with a high load of pollutants because it requires high aeration and energy consumption the sbr process is composed of a series of phases including basin filling reaction settling and drawing with a defined time fig 2 shows a comparison of the cod removal efficiency from dairy ww for the different systems used in this study according to similar previous studies an hrt of 24 h with a filling time t f of 1 h and an anoxic phase of 1 h after the filling phase were reported to be sufficient for dairy ww treatment 19 24 31 35 40 50 the cod and tn removal efficiencies were 45 7 and 36 7 respectively under the optimum conditions 3 2 advanced oxidation process performance of the ef process the removal efficiency of the ef process depends on several important factors such as the ph h2o2 concentration iron concentration h2o2 fe ratio and initial pollutant concentration the ph value which affects the formation of oh is a key parameter in fenton based aops 4 fig 3 a shows that the removal rates of cod tn and tp at acidic and neutral ph values were much greater than those at alkaline ph values which is typical in fenton type processes a maximum removal rate of 78 was obtained at a ph of 5 5 in general the generation of oh in the fenton process mainly occurs in an acidic medium however the formation of fe ii h2o 2 occurs when the ph is less than 5 it slowly reacts with h2o2 thereby resulting in the formation of less reactive oxygen species 9 furthermore it causes a considerable decrease in the iron concentration in the system responsible for h2o2 activation thereby lowering the formation of oh moreover h2o2 can attach to the h ions to form h3o2 eq 2 which reduces the amount of oxidant available for reaction with ferrous ions 12 14 2 h2o2 h h3o2 the oxidative potential of oh decreases as the ph increases thus as the ph increases the removal efficiency decreases the ef process mainly follows first order kinetics thus it increases the effectiveness of the process by increasing the amount of oxidants added to the system fig 3a reveals that the best cod removal efficiency of the ef process was obtained at a ph of 4 however only a minor decrease in the effectiveness was reported in the ph range from 4 5 to 7 0 for ph values above 7 a significant decrease in removal effectiveness was reported as the ph increased from 4 5 to 7 0 the cod removal efficiency decreased by only 5 thus a ph of 7 was selected for further experiments additional costs and operations are needed to neutralize the effluent prior to its discharge into the environment at an alkaline ph fe2 forms fe oh 3 precipitates in the system which affect the catalytic cycle thus a sufficient amount of catalyst will not remain in the reaction 20 because iron ions tend to form unreactive hydroxoferric complexes at a ph of greater than 7 a neutral ph is considered optimal for the treatment process the dose of h2o2 plays a vital role in the oxidation process as a source of oh eq 3 44 the oxidation rate strongly depends on the amount of consumed h2o2 9 to examine the effect of the h2o2 concentration on the efficiency of the ef process an h2o2 concentration of 0 2 mm 2 0 mm was considered for the experiments as shown in fig 3b by increasing the concentration of h2o2 from 0 2 mm to 1 0 mm under optimal conditions ph of 7 current density of 2 ma cm2 and time of 45 min the cod removal efficiency was increased to 78 further enhancement of the oxidant concentration is not effective at obtaining higher degradation whereas higher concentrations of h2o2 can have a scavenging effect with respect to oh 48 h2o2 can react with oh thereby causing the formation of less reactive radical species eq 4 4 9 finally residual h2o2 increases the cod concentration and is harmful to microorganisms that are responsible for degradation in biological processes 10 3 h2o2 oh oh 4 h2o2 oh h2o ho2 another important parameter in ef is the current density 29 in this study the current density was optimized in the range of 0 5 5 0 ma cm2 with respect to the removal rate of cod as presented in fig 3c these experiments revealed that with an increase in current density to 2 ma cm2 the cod removal efficiency increased whereas further increasing the current density had an insignificant effect on the removal efficiency because the highest removal rate was obtained at a current density of 2 ma cm2 this value was used for further experiments the mass of the sacrificed electrode in the ef reaction was 0 25 mg m3 which can be calculated from faraday s electrolysis equation related to the volume of the effluent in m3 as follows eq 5 5 w i t m w z f where w is the mass of dissolved iron g i is the current intensity a t is the reaction time s m w is the molecular weight of iron m 55 85 g mol z is the number of electrons involved in the redox reactions z 2 and f is faraday s constant 96 500 c mol the sludge formation under optimal conditions was approximately 2 g m3 of ww thus the ef process is a technology that minimizes the addition of chemicals and sludge formation the formed ferrous iron cation 2 reacted with h2o2 to form oh eq 6 to exclusively cause the activation of h2o2 to form oh the amount of fe2 should be catalytic an increase in the ferrous ion concentration above the optimal concentration is associated with reduced cod removal 49 moreover excess iron can cause a secondary reaction of the formed fe3 with h2o2 eqs 6 and 7 thus non optimal iron doses lead to high treatment costs and high sludge production mahvi et al 2011 6 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho oh 7 fe3 h2o2 fe ooh 2 h the release of iron ions from the electrode into the ww requires a specific voltage eq 8 murillo sierra et al 2018 8 e i v t Î´ c o d v where e is the energy consumption kwh kg cod i is the operating current intensity kw v is the voltage v v is the volume of the solution in the efsbr l t is the reaction time h and Î´cod is the cod removal kg l under optimum conditions the energy consumption increased from 0 0647 kwh kg cod to 1 6720 kwh kg cod and the current density increased from 0 5 ma cm2 to 5 0 ma cm2 thus increasing the current density resulted in an increase in the amount of oxidized iron and enhanced energy consumption an increase in the current density from 2 ma cm2 to 3 ma cm2 improved the degradation effectiveness by only 3 for cod whereas the energy consumption was increased by 20 thus a current density of 2 ma cm2 was selected as the optimum value to determine the best tn and tp removal efficiencies via the ef process under optimum conditions experiments were conducted for 5 120 min fig 3d fig 3d indicates that the highest tn and tp removal rates were 46 and 37 respectively after 45 min of treatment in the ef process the removal efficiencies of tn and tp were lower than the environmental protection agency epa standard for effluent discharge into the environment 49 53 54 these results can be attributed to acidic conditions lack of chemical precipitation and the inability to decompose nitrogen and phosphate compounds into simpler compounds 55 3 3 optimization of the efsbr system 3 3 1 effect of hydraulic parameters the abovementioned results clearly indicate that the application of the combined ef and sbr process is favorable in terms of effectiveness to evaluate t r the simultaneous removal of cod tn and tp was performed for 2 18 h according to the operating conditions listed in table 2 the simultaneous removal rates of cod tn and tp in the efsbr system during 6 h of treatment exceeded 95 fig 4 a the removal efficiency for t r of 6 h and 8 h did not significantly affect the treatment effectiveness when t r was greater than 8 h the changes in the effluent quality and removal efficiency were not significant therefore t r of 6 h is optimal in terms of cod tn and tp removal with respect to the treatment cost a comparison of the obtained results with those of a conventional sbr system 24 confirmed the significant improvement of the developed process the efsbr system can reduce the costs via reduced t r and provide a higher treatment efficiency to investigate the effect of the hrt on the cod tn and tp removal efficiencies water samples at the end of each cycle of 9 25 h 26 75 h were analyzed the data compared in fig 4b are presented as the cod removal efficiency as a function of hrt during the experiment the cod removal efficiency increased from 91 to 98 when the hrt was prolonged from 9 25 h to 10 00 h no significant increase in cod removal efficiency was observed after 10 h of hrt the ability of the system to provide greater removal with an increased hrt ensures the flexibility of the treatment system moreover it is an effective method for nitrification control owing to the limited doubling time of ammonium oxidizing bacteria in comparison with that of nitrite oxidizing bacteria this phenomenon enhances the capability of the bioreactor to receive ww with higher ammonium concentrations 2 7 3 3 2 effects of microbiological parameters analysis of the svi is the best known approach for quantifying and qualifying microalgal biomass and sludge bulk settling properties this parameter was used to describe the sludge properties in the efsbr system eq 9 v in eq 9 represents the settled sludge volume ml l obtained in 30 min svi values in the range of 100 200 ml g indicate good settling ability that leads to microalgal aggregates and increased bioflocs determination of the optimum mlss concentration is required to maintain a favorable food microorganism f m ratio 18 9 s v i 1000 v m l s s fig 5 a presents the effects of the initial cod and mlss concentrations on the svi under the optimum treatment conditions during the first 15 d performance fluctuations related to microbial acclimation under the applied experimental conditions were observed the svi gradually decreased with the generation of granules and reached 89 ml g at the end of the cycle in the efsbr system the matured granules were completely settled in 90 min settling time t s 90 min thus the supernatant was discharged from the reactor because the effluent was clear during the initial operation phase in the efsbr system the mlss concentration was less than 1850 mg l after the formation of granular sludge the mlss concentration increased from 1850 mg l to 6300 mg l during the experiments as the amount of sludge granules increased the mlss concentration decreased 25 the outgrowth of floc forming bacteria on the granule sludge caused appropriate settleability and subsequently provided biomass maintenance as indicated by the increase in the mlss concentration 19 the system with a constant mlss concentration 3500 mg l srt of 15 d and hrt of 10 h exhibited stable performance as the cod concentration of the influent increased thereby confirming its applicability in routine operations in which fluctuations in the ww parameters at the inlet of the treatment plant are observed furthermore an increase in the mlss concentration decreased the svi when the mlss concentration increased from 1800 mg l to 3500 mg l the svi increased from 46 to 89 respectively in the efsbr system the svi values were in the range of 80 100 mg l thereby indicating that the granular sludge had great settling ability fig 5a indicates that an increase in the initial cod concentration did not significantly affect the svi hrt is an efficient operating parameter in biological treatment processes it can regulate the physiological and microbial acclimation of the bacterial culture such as the growth phase f m ratio thereby resulting in the stabilization of the system performance the decrease in the hrt at a constant initial cod concentration 3225 mg l led to a decrease in the svi as shown in fig 5b the change in the srt had a significant effect on the cod removal efficiency under the operating conditions the cod removal efficiency at an srt of 7 d increased from 75 to 90 and that at an srt of 10 d and 15 d was 93 and 98 respectively the highest cod removal efficiency was achieved at an srt of 15 d fig 5b shows that the efficiency of the efsbr system decreased at an srt of greater than 20 d owing to the growth of filamentous microorganisms and sludge bulking and at an srt of less than 15 d owing to the growth of pinpoint flocs at a lower srt floc forming bacteria showed better growth than filamentous bacteria the cod removal efficiencies for srts of 15 d and 20 d were almost the same because it is easier to operate the system at a low srt an srt of 15 d was chosen as the optimum value under these conditions srt of 15 d the codeff decreased from 3225 mg l to 45 mg l after selecting the optimum conditions of the efsbr system its performance was evaluated from a longer time perspective the nutrient removal mechanism during a 1 y 365 d study under stable operation conditions was monitored the average cod tn and tp removal efficiencies were 98 4 95 2 and 93 3 respectively in this study the organic loading rate olr was constant 0 245 kg cod l d in addition the lowest number of adapted bacteria 4 92 102 mpn 100 ml was observed at 0 15 d and the highest number of adapted bacteria 3 10 107 mpn 100 ml was reported on the 95th day 3 3 3 tn removal mechanism by the efsbr process the biological nitrogen removal process involves nitrification processes i e conversion of ammonia into nitrites and nitrates nh4 to no2 and no2 to no3 and denitrification processes that transform no3 into n2 8 21 in this study the cod removal efficiency increased in the first 95 d period to 98 45 which followed the acclimatization of the bacteria to the operation conditions after 165 d owing to the increased olr and the assimilation of nitrogen which inhibited the bacterial activity although the bacteria were acclimated to the operating conditions the change in the removal efficiency was insignificant because nitrification was conducted completely and quickly without accumulation or inhibition during this period thus the population of nitrifying bacteria grew well in the presence of organic matter cod 20 22 25 because the density of bacteria depends on the srt of the efsbr system 31 this parameter was also monitored as shown in fig 5b the highest density of nitrifying bacteria was observed at an srt of 15 d thus as the srt decreased the nitrifying bacteria population decreased in this study the removal efficiency of t r increased because of the extra phase t a before t r thereby resulting in decreased competition for organic matter uptake between microorganisms heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria this helped to increase the number of nitrifying bacteria and the removal of ammonia nitrogen 35 fig 5b shows that after the 95th cycle when the population of denitrifying bacteria was the highest the no3 concentration in the effluent decreased in the t s stage owing to the presence of residual no3 n in the previous stage t r and the rapid growth of denitrification bacteria in this stage no3 was transformed into n2 therefore t s ensured complete nitrogen removal from the effluent the residual tn concentration in the effluent of the efsbr was lower than the epa standard 3 mg l 41 43 according to eq 10 the presence of oh in the biological process increased the do concentration the do concentration in ww increased rapidly and was mainly available for the external respiration of bacteria the do concentration is a crucial factor for the efficiency of aerobic ww treatment processes in addition the addition of h2o2 to the biological reactor can be effective for the generation of peroxidase enzymes by bacteria which allows the decomposition of organic compounds 10 hoo oh h2o o2 3 3 4 tp removal mechanism by the efsbr process this study indicates that the efsbr is a promising approach for tp reduction 93 fig 4b the phosphorus removal performance was less than 50 in the initial 15 d but the tp removal efficiency increased to more than 80 on the 50th day the tp removal efficiency is affected by the competition between phosphorous accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos because a high c p ratio favors the growth of paos over gaos and can lead to endogenous denitrification 35 43 fig 4d confirms the presence of denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dpaos in the efsbr system conventionally dpaos are responsible for the removal of phosphorus in biological processes which are capable of nitrogen and phosphorus uptake via no2 n and no3 n as electron acceptors dpaos can reduce carbon sources 50 poly hydroxyl alkanets glycogen and energy 30 43 50 throughout the experiments the ph was maintained at less than 7 to achieve good microorganism growth in the reactor and optimum operating conditions therefore phosphorus removal was only slightly attributed to chemical precipitation comparison of the sbr and efsbr systems indicated that the removal efficiency of the sbr system was lower than the standard at a high olr without pre treatment and it could not fulfill the expectations of treatment effectiveness however the tn tp and cod removal efficiencies in the efsbr system at lower hrt srt and energy consumption owing to lower t r were 99 97 and 95 respectively and it was found that the use of t a as one of the phases of efsbr promoted the conversion of complex compounds present in the ww with a high olr to simple biodegradable organic compounds in addition the t a phase caused nh4 n to be oxidized to no3 n and organic phosphorus to be oxidized orthophosphate thereby providing the conditions for the simultaneous growth of nitrogen phosphorus removing bacteria 53 the performance comparison of the ef as a pre treatment unit and sbr processes alone to the efsbr process clearly indicated the advantages of the combined approach in terms of most of the studied parameters the system based on separate processes had higher operating and construction costs e g blower pump and land and a higher srt hrt and t r therefore in the combined system the cod tn ratio was maintained at above 10 1 and enhanced the simultaneous removal of tn and tp 35 in addition the efsbr system operated in fully continuous mode owing to the existence of two separate basins the first basin included the filling and aop phases and the biological basin included the settling and draw phases 52 3 4 kinetics of the efsbr a kinetic model was developed for cod removal at different initial cod concentrations with an olr of 0 245 kg cod m3 d with the operating conditions of the efsbr system for steady state 51 which is expressed as follows 11 x t s 0 s k s k s 1 k the model equation eq 11 was used in the kinetic study where x t is the mlss mg l concentration at t r h s 0 is the initial cod concentration mg l s is the final cod concentration mg l k is the rate constant of substrate degradation per unit mass of microorganisms h 1 and k s is a half rate constant mg l the k values of the sbr ef and efsbr processes were 1 20 3 50 and 4 94 h 1 respectively and the k s values for the sbr ef and efsbr processes were 1217 44 5825 50 and 5984 90 mg l respectively the results were in good agreement with the model for data obtained under the efsbr process in addition the rate constant value calculated from the model indicated that an efsbr system with a small volume can achieve the desired removal efficiency for dairy ww treatment to reach the discharge standards besides the listed advantages of the efsbr system on the basis of the rate constant a synergism sk of 1 05 for the combined process was calculated eq 12 12 sk k efsbr k ef k sbr the comparison of similar studies for dairy ww treatment showed that the efsbr system has a higher efficiency lower treatment cost and lower chemical consumption compared with other hetero ef processes table 3 the combined fenton sbr process when compared with biological treatment alone and aop alone had a synergistic effect it followed the generation of more biodegradable by products during fenton pretreatment which were further effectively degraded by microorganisms overall this combined approach exhibited synergism thereby providing enhanced tn and tp removal the results confirmed that the combined efsbr process used for industrial ww treatment reduces the pollution load to an acceptable level thereby allowing the discharge of effluent into the environment 4 conclusion in this study the treatment of diw was performed by an efsbr which involved the simultaneous reaction of chemical treatment via aops ef and biodegradation sbr this study reveals that the efsbr system can achieve higher effectiveness in the mineralization of biologically persistent compounds compared with other available technologies in addition this hybrid process eliminates the weakness of aerobic biological systems such as the inability to treat industrial ww with a high organic load and reduces the operational costs this aspect makes the development of a hybrid process advantageous to benchmark technologies based on physiochemical processes combined with the biological treatment stage it provides operational flexibility based on the ability to effectively degrade all types of impurities present in dairy effluent an hrt of 10 h srt of 15 d mlss concentration of 3500 mg l and svi of 89 were found to be suitable for the treatment of diw in the efsbr system under the optimum conditions of the efsbr the simultaneous cod tn and tp removal efficiencies were greater than 95 therefore the efsbr not only allows the reduction of the hrt srt and t r but also increases the treatment efficiency compared with the sole use of biological or ef treatment therefore the efsbr is a promising treatment system for the removal of organics nitrogen and phosphate compounds present in food industry ww the experimental period used in this study ensures the ability of implementing the

fenton sequencing batch reactor biological treatment pollutants 1 introduction discharge of wastewater ww containing a high load of organic pollutants is an important environmental issue 45 46 it causes the growth of algae and aquatic plants in shallow rivers which affect the esthetic properties of water a high nutrient load nitrogen and phosphorus can cause adverse effects such as reduced concentrations of dissolved oxygen do among the various food industries the dairy industry is severely affected by the presence of high loads of organic matter in such effluents 3 24 36 50 biological processes that remove nutrients from industrial ww can be performed in several systems including conventional activated sludge as membrane bioreactors oxidation ditches upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors and sequencing batch reactors sbrs 7 23 sbrs use a modified as process and are operated using a sequence of five discrete phases filling reaction settling draw and idle these phases occur in a single reactor basin during the filling phase raw ww is mixed with biomass from the sbr and the reaction under aerobic conditions is aided by agitation and aeration 50 51 in the next phase stirring is discontinued to allow the sludge to settle settling phase during the draw phase the effluent is discharged this cycle is then repeated 35 this approach has many advantages such as low energy consumption small space requirement low construction and operational costs high flexibility and high effectiveness compared with other types of biological processes 22 40 advanced oxidation processes

environmental friendliness higher efficiency in removing a wide range of organic compounds and low cost 26 27 30 32 the oh generated during the fenton reaction are highly reactive and thus can completely degrade organic compounds by hydrogen abstraction however this process requires a high consumption of chemicals owing to the acidification of the solution this causes the generation of high metal sludge 38 39 which is not economically feasible for high pollutant loads moreover the sole use of aops such as fenton or electrochemical oxidation does not provide satisfactory treatment effectiveness vahid and khataee 2013 asaithambi et al 2020 the electro fenton ef process 15 is one of the most popular modifications of the classic fenton process that enhances the oxidation of organic compounds in the ef process iron ions are introduced into the liquid phase via a controlled electrochemical reaction the presence of iron ions in the ef process is an important factor because iron ions are responsible for conducting the catalytic fenton cycle 11 42 whereas an excess amount of iron ions can cause additional sludge formation hybrid processes combining conventional ww treatment e g biological methods with aops are effective and economical methods that allow the degradation of persistent organic pollutants to biodegradable intermediates in the primary step biological processes provide the final treatment step resulting in 100 removal of pollutants 21 50 54 in this study a novel strategy using the ef process as one of the stages in an sbr efsbr was proposed the efsbr process was expected to reduce the treatment cost owing to the low energy consumption and to minimize the shock caused by the high load of pollutants at the inlet of the reactor it was also expected to ensure effective removal of ef by products improve the efficiency with the variety of operation conditions and reduce the treatment time however this approach requires further study and validation with respect to various types of real effluents the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate the efficiency of the combined efsbr process with the addition of an extra ef phase for the treatment of dairy ww to optimize the operation conditions of the efsbr the effects of various parameters i e ph h2o2 concentration current density hydraulic retention time hrt mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration sludge volume index svi sludge retention time srt and reaction time t r on the overall degradation performance were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of dairy industry ww the as used in this research was obtained from a municipal ww treatment plant treating dairy industry ww diw in kerman iran and stored at 4 c until use coarse particles were separated using a filter the system reached steady state after 15 d of operation the characteristics of the diw and seed sludge are shown in table 1 2 2 efsbr operation and setup the efsbr was made of plexiglas with a total volume of 10 l dimensions of 18 8 cm length 18 5 cm wide 30 0 cm height which was divided into two sections ef and biological basins and six phases filling aop aeration settling draw and idle fig 1 the filling phase occurred in the upper part of the ef basin with the filling of ww using a peristaltic pump dls ma etatron co italy the aop phase second phase was conducted in the ef basin which contained four iron plates as the cathode and anode dimensions of 5 0 cm 5 0 cm 0 5 cm the gap between the electrode plates was 5 cm and a power supply 0 30 v 0 10 a was used to adjust the current density h2o2 30 w w solution was added at the beginning of the ef process the effluent was then passed to the biological basin using a flow head pump as depicted in fig 1 the biological basin consisted of an sbr basin a feeding system peristaltic pump and an aeration system air pump and four air stones the aeration system was used to inject air in the form of fine bubbles and to obtain uniform mixing to maintain the do level at 2 mg l 18 and decant the system all phases in the system were controlled by programmable timers in the preliminary experimental period the efficiency of the ef process was evaluated by measuring process parameters such as the h2o2 concentration current density aop time t a and ph of the solution the aeration time in the sbr basin t r was optimized to achieve maximum cod tn and tp removal however in the efsbr experiments according to the results of the preliminary period some other parameters were kept constant a compilation of the efsbr parameters is provided in table 2 the operating parameters of t a hrt srt svi and mlss were optimized to maximize the performance of the efsbr system 2 3 experimental procedure the reactor was initially inoculated with as bacteria i e 2 0 cm3 of the diw as the aeration and reaction phases were then operated in circulation for 15 d until the efsbr reached steady state the average time to reach steady state was 3 d 7 d of operation without changes 6 as the criterion in the system operation conditions with respect to the effluent cod codeff 43 to control the srt and mlss in the efsbr reactor a specified mlss concentration was removed to maintain a stable srt at the end of every reaction phase of the sbr 2 4 analytical methods the studied parameters included cod mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids tn no3 n tp and po4 3 p using the 5220a 4500d 2710d 4500 n c 4500 no3 b 4500 pe and 4500 pe methods respectively these measurements were performed according to the standard methods 1 parameters such as the turbidity temperature do and ph of the solution were monitored online using instruments provided by hanna instruments italy prior to analysis the collected samples were filtered using a membrane filter 0 45 Î¼m whatman the dissolved iron ion content was measured using the 1 10 phenanthroline method 1 to maintain the ph in the range from 6 5 to 8 0 sodium bicarbonate was used as a buffer evaluation of each operating cycle was performed on the basis of the parameter removal efficiency of tn tp and cod the removal efficiency r was calculated according to eq 1 1 r i n p u t o u t p u t i n p u t 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 sbr performance to understand the importance of the combined efsbr process separate treatment processes were initially conducted for the sbr and ef the results revealed that the sbr process alone suffered from major limitations for the treatment of ww with a high load of pollutants because it requires high aeration and energy consumption the sbr process is composed of a series of phases including basin filling reaction settling and drawing with a defined time fig 2 shows a comparison of the cod removal efficiency from dairy ww for the different systems used in this study according to similar previous studies an hrt of 24 h with a filling time t f of 1 h and an anoxic phase of 1 h after the filling phase were reported to be sufficient for dairy ww treatment 19 24 31 35 40 50 the cod and tn removal efficiencies were 45 7 and 36 7 respectively under the optimum conditions 3 2 advanced oxidation process performance of the ef process the removal efficiency of the ef process depends on several important factors such as the ph h2o2 concentration iron concentration h2o2 fe ratio and initial pollutant concentration the ph value which affects the formation of oh is a key parameter in fenton based aops 4 fig 3 a shows that the removal rates of cod tn and tp at acidic and neutral ph values were much greater than those at alkaline ph values which is typical in fenton type processes a maximum removal rate of 78 was obtained at a ph of 5 5 in general the generation of oh in the fenton process mainly occurs in an acidic medium however the formation of fe ii h2o 2 occurs when the ph is less than 5 it slowly reacts with h2o2 thereby resulting in the formation of less reactive oxygen species 9 furthermore it causes a considerable decrease in the iron concentration in the system responsible for h2o2 activation thereby lowering the formation of oh moreover h2o2 can attach to the h ions to form h3o2 eq 2 which reduces the amount of oxidant available for reaction with ferrous ions 12 14 2 h2o2 h h3o2 the oxidative potential of oh decreases as the ph increases thus as the ph increases the removal efficiency decreases the ef process mainly follows first order kinetics thus it increases the effectiveness of the process by increasing the amount of oxidants added to the system fig 3a reveals that the best cod removal efficiency of the ef process was obtained at a ph of 4 however only a minor decrease in the effectiveness was reported in the ph range from 4 5 to 7 0 for ph values above 7 a significant decrease in removal effectiveness was reported as the ph increased from 4 5 to 7 0 the cod removal efficiency decreased by only 5 thus a ph of 7 was selected for further experiments additional costs and operations are needed to neutralize the effluent prior to its discharge into the environment at an alkaline ph fe2 forms fe oh 3 precipitates in the system which affect the catalytic cycle thus a sufficient amount of catalyst will not remain in the reaction 20 because iron ions tend to form unreactive hydroxoferric complexes at a ph of greater than 7 a neutral ph is considered optimal for the treatment process the dose of h2o2 plays a vital role in the oxidation process as a source of oh eq 3 44 the oxidation rate strongly depends on the amount of consumed h2o2 9 to examine the effect of the h2o2 concentration on the efficiency of the ef process an h2o2 concentration of 0 2 mm 2 0 mm was considered for the experiments as shown in fig 3b by increasing the concentration of h2o2 from 0 2 mm to 1 0 mm under optimal conditions ph of 7 current density of 2 ma cm2 and time of 45 min the cod removal efficiency was increased to 78 further enhancement of the oxidant concentration is not effective at obtaining higher degradation whereas higher concentrations of h2o2 can have a scavenging effect with respect to oh 48 h2o2 can react with oh thereby causing the formation of less reactive radical species eq 4 4 9 finally residual h2o2 increases the cod concentration and is harmful to microorganisms that are responsible for degradation in biological processes 10 3 h2o2 oh oh 4 h2o2 oh h2o ho2 another important parameter in ef is the current density 29 in this study the current density was optimized in the range of 0 5 5 0 ma cm2 with respect to the removal rate of cod as presented in fig 3c these experiments revealed that with an increase in current density to 2 ma cm2 the cod removal efficiency increased whereas further increasing the current density had an insignificant effect on the removal efficiency because the highest removal rate was obtained at a current density of 2 ma cm2 this value was used for further experiments the mass of the sacrificed electrode in the ef reaction was 0 25 mg m3 which can be calculated from faraday s electrolysis equation related to the volume of the effluent in m3 as follows eq 5 5 w i t m w z f where w is the mass of dissolved iron g i is the current intensity a t is the reaction time s m w is the molecular weight of iron m 55 85 g mol z is the number of electrons involved in the redox reactions z 2 and f is faraday s constant 96 500 c mol the sludge formation under optimal conditions was approximately 2 g m3 of ww thus the ef process is a technology that minimizes the addition of chemicals and sludge formation the formed ferrous iron cation 2 reacted with h2o2 to form oh eq 6 to exclusively cause the activation of h2o2 to form oh the amount of fe2 should be catalytic an increase in the ferrous ion concentration above the optimal concentration is associated with reduced cod removal 49 moreover excess iron can cause a secondary reaction of the formed fe3 with h2o2 eqs 6 and 7 thus non optimal iron doses lead to high treatment costs and high sludge production mahvi et al 2011 6 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho oh 7 fe3 h2o2 fe ooh 2 h the release of iron ions from the electrode into the ww requires a specific voltage eq 8 murillo sierra et al 2018 8 e i v t Î´ c o d v where e is the energy consumption kwh kg cod i is the operating current intensity kw v is the voltage v v is the volume of the solution in the efsbr l t is the reaction time h and Î´cod is the cod removal kg l under optimum conditions the energy consumption increased from 0 0647 kwh kg cod to 1 6720 kwh kg cod and the current density increased from 0 5 ma cm2 to 5 0 ma cm2 thus increasing the current density resulted in an increase in the amount of oxidized iron and enhanced energy consumption an increase in the current density from 2 ma cm2 to 3 ma cm2 improved the degradation effectiveness by only 3 for cod whereas the energy consumption was increased by 20 thus a current density of 2 ma cm2 was selected as the optimum value to determine the best tn and tp removal efficiencies via the ef process under optimum conditions experiments were conducted for 5 120 min fig 3d fig 3d indicates that the highest tn and tp removal rates were 46 and 37 respectively after 45 min of treatment in the ef process the removal efficiencies of tn and tp were lower than the environmental protection agency epa standard for effluent discharge into the environment 49 53 54 these results can be attributed to acidic conditions lack of chemical precipitation and the inability to decompose nitrogen and phosphate compounds into simpler compounds 55 3 3 optimization of the efsbr system 3 3 1 effect of hydraulic parameters the abovementioned results clearly indicate that the application of the combined ef and sbr process is favorable in terms of effectiveness to evaluate t r the simultaneous removal of cod tn and tp was performed for 2 18 h according to the operating conditions listed in table 2 the simultaneous removal rates of cod tn and tp in the efsbr system during 6 h of treatment exceeded 95 fig 4 a the removal efficiency for t r of 6 h and 8 h did not significantly affect the treatment effectiveness when t r was greater than 8 h the changes in the effluent quality and removal efficiency were not significant therefore t r of 6 h is optimal in terms of cod tn and tp removal with respect to the treatment cost a comparison of the obtained results with those of a conventional sbr system 24 confirmed the significant improvement of the developed process the efsbr system can reduce the costs via reduced t r and provide a higher treatment efficiency to investigate the effect of the hrt on the cod tn and tp removal efficiencies water samples at the end of each cycle of 9 25 h 26 75 h were analyzed the data compared in fig 4b are presented as the cod removal efficiency as a function of hrt during the experiment the cod removal efficiency increased from 91 to 98 when the hrt was prolonged from 9 25 h to 10 00 h no significant increase in cod removal efficiency was observed after 10 h of hrt the ability of the system to provide greater removal with an increased hrt ensures the flexibility of the treatment system moreover it is an effective method for nitrification control owing to the limited doubling time of ammonium oxidizing bacteria in comparison with that of nitrite oxidizing bacteria this phenomenon enhances the capability of the bioreactor to receive ww with higher ammonium concentrations 2 7 3 3 2 effects of microbiological parameters analysis of the svi is the best known approach for quantifying and qualifying microalgal biomass and sludge bulk settling properties this parameter was used to describe the sludge properties in the efsbr system eq 9 v in eq 9 represents the settled sludge volume ml l obtained in 30 min svi values in the range of 100 200 ml g indicate good settling ability that leads to microalgal aggregates and increased bioflocs determination of the optimum mlss concentration is required to maintain a favorable food microorganism f m ratio 18 9 s v i 1000 v m l s s fig 5 a presents the effects of the initial cod and mlss concentrations on the svi under the optimum treatment conditions during the first 15 d performance fluctuations related to microbial acclimation under the applied experimental conditions were observed the svi gradually decreased with the generation of granules and reached 89 ml g at the end of the cycle in the efsbr system the matured granules were completely settled in 90 min settling time t s 90 min thus the supernatant was discharged from the reactor because the effluent was clear during the initial operation phase in the efsbr system the mlss concentration was less than 1850 mg l after the formation of granular sludge the mlss concentration increased from 1850 mg l to 6300 mg l during the experiments as the amount of sludge granules increased the mlss concentration decreased 25 the outgrowth of floc forming bacteria on the granule sludge caused appropriate settleability and subsequently provided biomass maintenance as indicated by the increase in the mlss concentration 19 the system with a constant mlss concentration 3500 mg l srt of 15 d and hrt of 10 h exhibited stable performance as the cod concentration of the influent increased thereby confirming its applicability in routine operations in which fluctuations in the ww parameters at the inlet of the treatment plant are observed furthermore an increase in the mlss concentration decreased the svi when the mlss concentration increased from 1800 mg l to 3500 mg l the svi increased from 46 to 89 respectively in the efsbr system the svi values were in the range of 80 100 mg l thereby indicating that the granular sludge had great settling ability fig 5a indicates that an increase in the initial cod concentration did not significantly affect the svi hrt is an efficient operating parameter in biological treatment processes it can regulate the physiological and microbial acclimation of the bacterial culture such as the growth phase f m ratio thereby resulting in the stabilization of the system performance the decrease in the hrt at a constant initial cod concentration 3225 mg l led to a decrease in the svi as shown in fig 5b the change in the srt had a significant effect on the cod removal efficiency under the operating conditions the cod removal efficiency at an srt of 7 d increased from 75 to 90 and that at an srt of 10 d and 15 d was 93 and 98 respectively the highest cod removal efficiency was achieved at an srt of 15 d fig 5b shows that the efficiency of the efsbr system decreased at an srt of greater than 20 d owing to the growth of filamentous microorganisms and sludge bulking and at an srt of less than 15 d owing to the growth of pinpoint flocs at a lower srt floc forming bacteria showed better growth than filamentous bacteria the cod removal efficiencies for srts of 15 d and 20 d were almost the same because it is easier to operate the system at a low srt an srt of 15 d was chosen as the optimum value under these conditions srt of 15 d the codeff decreased from 3225 mg l to 45 mg l after selecting the optimum conditions of the efsbr system its performance was evaluated from a longer time perspective the nutrient removal mechanism during a 1 y 365 d study under stable operation conditions was monitored the average cod tn and tp removal efficiencies were 98 4 95 2 and 93 3 respectively in this study the organic loading rate olr was constant 0 245 kg cod l d in addition the lowest number of adapted bacteria 4 92 102 mpn 100 ml was observed at 0 15 d and the highest number of adapted bacteria 3 10 107 mpn 100 ml was reported on the 95th day 3 3 3 tn removal mechanism by the efsbr process the biological nitrogen removal process involves nitrification processes i e conversion of ammonia into nitrites and nitrates nh4 to no2 and no2 to no3 and denitrification processes that transform no3 into n2 8 21 in this study the cod removal efficiency increased in the first 95 d period to 98 45 which followed the acclimatization of the bacteria to the operation conditions after 165 d owing to the increased olr and the assimilation of nitrogen which inhibited the bacterial activity although the bacteria were acclimated to the operating conditions the change in the removal efficiency was insignificant because nitrification was conducted completely and quickly without accumulation or inhibition during this period thus the population of nitrifying bacteria grew well in the presence of organic matter cod 20 22 25 because the density of bacteria depends on the srt of the efsbr system 31 this parameter was also monitored as shown in fig 5b the highest density of nitrifying bacteria was observed at an srt of 15 d thus as the srt decreased the nitrifying bacteria population decreased in this study the removal efficiency of t r increased because of the extra phase t a before t r thereby resulting in decreased competition for organic matter uptake between microorganisms heterotrophic and nitrifying bacteria this helped to increase the number of nitrifying bacteria and the removal of ammonia nitrogen 35 fig 5b shows that after the 95th cycle when the population of denitrifying bacteria was the highest the no3 concentration in the effluent decreased in the t s stage owing to the presence of residual no3 n in the previous stage t r and the rapid growth of denitrification bacteria in this stage no3 was transformed into n2 therefore t s ensured complete nitrogen removal from the effluent the residual tn concentration in the effluent of the efsbr was lower than the epa standard 3 mg l 41 43 according to eq 10 the presence of oh in the biological process increased the do concentration the do concentration in ww increased rapidly and was mainly available for the external respiration of bacteria the do concentration is a crucial factor for the efficiency of aerobic ww treatment processes in addition the addition of h2o2 to the biological reactor can be effective for the generation of peroxidase enzymes by bacteria which allows the decomposition of organic compounds 10 hoo oh h2o o2 3 3 4 tp removal mechanism by the efsbr process this study indicates that the efsbr is a promising approach for tp reduction 93 fig 4b the phosphorus removal performance was less than 50 in the initial 15 d but the tp removal efficiency increased to more than 80 on the 50th day the tp removal efficiency is affected by the competition between phosphorous accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos because a high c p ratio favors the growth of paos over gaos and can lead to endogenous denitrification 35 43 fig 4d confirms the presence of denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dpaos in the efsbr system conventionally dpaos are responsible for the removal of phosphorus in biological processes which are capable of nitrogen and phosphorus uptake via no2 n and no3 n as electron acceptors dpaos can reduce carbon sources 50 poly hydroxyl alkanets glycogen and energy 30 43 50 throughout the experiments the ph was maintained at less than 7 to achieve good microorganism growth in the reactor and optimum operating conditions therefore phosphorus removal was only slightly attributed to chemical precipitation comparison of the sbr and efsbr systems indicated that the removal efficiency of the sbr system was lower than the standard at a high olr without pre treatment and it could not fulfill the expectations of treatment effectiveness however the tn tp and cod removal efficiencies in the efsbr system at lower hrt srt and energy consumption owing to lower t r were 99 97 and 95 respectively and it was found that the use of t a as one of the phases of efsbr promoted the conversion of complex compounds present in the ww with a high olr to simple biodegradable organic compounds in addition the t a phase caused nh4 n to be oxidized to no3 n and organic phosphorus to be oxidized orthophosphate thereby providing the conditions for the simultaneous growth of nitrogen phosphorus removing bacteria 53 the performance comparison of the ef as a pre treatment unit and sbr processes alone to the efsbr process clearly indicated the advantages of the combined approach in terms of most of the studied parameters the system based on separate processes had higher operating and construction costs e g blower pump and land and a higher srt hrt and t r therefore in the combined system the cod tn ratio was maintained at above 10 1 and enhanced the simultaneous removal of tn and tp 35 in addition the efsbr system operated in fully continuous mode owing to the existence of two separate basins the first basin included the filling and aop phases and the biological basin included the settling and draw phases 52 3 4 kinetics of the efsbr a kinetic model was developed for cod removal at different initial cod concentrations with an olr of 0 245 kg cod m3 d with the operating conditions of the efsbr system for steady state 51 which is expressed as follows 11 x t s 0 s k s k s 1 k the model equation eq 11 was used in the kinetic study where x t is the mlss mg l concentration at t r h s 0 is the initial cod concentration mg l s is the final cod concentration mg l k is the rate constant of substrate degradation per unit mass of microorganisms h 1 and k s is a half rate constant mg l the k values of the sbr ef and efsbr processes were 1 20 3 50 and 4 94 h 1 respectively and the k s values for the sbr ef and efsbr processes were 1217 44 5825 50 and 5984 90 mg l respectively the results were in good agreement with the model for data obtained under the efsbr process in addition the rate constant value calculated from the model indicated that an efsbr system with a small volume can achieve the desired removal efficiency for dairy ww treatment to reach the discharge standards besides the listed advantages of the efsbr system on the basis of the rate constant a synergism sk of 1 05 for the combined process was calculated eq 12 12 sk k efsbr k ef k sbr the comparison of similar studies for dairy ww treatment showed that the efsbr system has a higher efficiency lower treatment cost and lower chemical consumption compared with other hetero ef processes table 3 the combined fenton sbr process when compared with biological treatment alone and aop alone had a synergistic effect it followed the generation of more biodegradable by products during fenton pretreatment which were further effectively degraded by microorganisms overall this combined approach exhibited synergism thereby providing enhanced tn and tp removal the results confirmed that the combined efsbr process used for industrial ww treatment reduces the pollution load to an acceptable level thereby allowing the discharge of effluent into the environment 4 conclusion in this study the treatment of diw was performed by an efsbr which involved the simultaneous reaction of chemical treatment via aops ef and biodegradation sbr this study reveals that the efsbr system can achieve higher effectiveness in the mineralization of biologically persistent compounds compared with other available technologies in addition this hybrid process eliminates the weakness of aerobic biological systems such as the inability to treat industrial ww with a high organic load and reduces the operational costs this aspect makes the development of a hybrid process advantageous to benchmark technologies based on physiochemical processes combined with the biological treatment stage it provides operational flexibility based on the ability to effectively degrade all types of impurities present in dairy effluent an hrt of 10 h srt of 15 d mlss concentration of 3500 mg l and svi of 89 were found to be suitable for the treatment of diw in the efsbr system under the optimum conditions of the efsbr the simultaneous cod tn and tp removal efficiencies were greater than 95 therefore the efsbr not only allows the reduction of the hrt srt and t r but also increases the treatment efficiency compared with the sole use of biological or ef treatment therefore the efsbr is a promising treatment system for the removal of organics nitrogen and phosphate compounds present in food industry ww the experimental period used in this study ensures the ability of implementing the developed process in industrial practices credit authorship contribution statement evaluation and start up of an extra stage sequential batch reactor with electro fenton efsbr for dairy wastewater

8791,hbpp uses hot dense bubbles as heat and mass carriers to evaporate the solution with improved evaporation efficiency compared with the traditional thermal method to develop an energy efficient water treatment process we applied combustion gas as inlet gas within hbpp for the first time to evaporate synthetic seawater the advantage of using combustion gas is that the hot waste combustion gas from factories can be used at almost no energy cost thereby reducing energy consumption in this paper the evaporation efficiency was determined by measuring the weight loss of column solution of hbpp in a 60 min run firstly the ability of the hbpp to treat different types of wastewater including 0 5 m nacl solution or synthetic sewage was tested by pumping air at the temperature of 80 120 and 160 c respectively the observed amount of evaporated water vapour was higher for the 0 5 m nacl solution than for the synthetic sewage at inlet air temperatures of 80 c and 120 c but the same at a temperature of 160 c the hbpp shows the potential for water treatment regardless of wastewater type then the evaporation efficiency was calculated for both combustion gas and air at the inlet temperature of 120 c to evaporate 0 5 m nacl solution the result showed an increment of 37 of evaporation efficiency achieved by sparging combustion gas that is because the contained water vapour has a high capacity for efficient heat transfer to evaporate the solution as a result applying combustion gas within hbpp can provide an energy conservative method with improved evaporation efficiency for water treatment keywords hbpp desalination combustion gas evaporation efficiency energy balance 1 introduction the shortage of freshwater worldwide has triggered a crisis for the wellbeing of humanity 1 2 to help solve the shortage locally the peak body of the australian pork industry australian pork limited has invested in novel water treatment technologies one of which is to use the bubble column evaporator bce developed in the laboratory as a large scale hbpp the purpose of building up hbpp is to develop a long term energy conservative water treatment technology with improved evaporation efficiency and reduced energy consumption the process has been patented by the university of new south wales as australian patent number wo2020124161a1 this paper is a continuation work of our earlier published paper 3 which evaluates the efficiency of water sterilization effect of hbpp in this paper we focused on the evaporation efficiency achieved by hbpp and used the combustion gas as inlet for the first time regarding the working mechanism the bce is a new thermal desalination technology that uses pumped hot gas through a porous sinter underneath a column of solution to produce a continuous stream of hot fine bubbles these hot bubbles can exchange heat to evaporate water from the surrounding solution via the bubble interface 4 the bce can be applied in many areas based on the increased surface area for efficient heat and mass transfer the applications include water treatment 4 5 virus inactivation 6 7 evaporative cooling 8 and for the thermolysis of solutes at low temperatures 9 the main advantage of using the bce to desalinate seawater is that the salt contained in seawater inhibits bubble coalescence thus producing finer bubbles in the column the consequent increase in surface area means a higher rate of mass and heat transfer at the bubble surface 10 11 the heat transfer between liquid and gas is 100 times more efficient in a gas liquid bubble column than in a single phase flow 12 13 as a result bce can reach a higher evaporation efficiency at temperatures well below the boiling point the bce reaches a dynamic equilibrium when the heat supplied to the column by those continuously ascending hot gas bubbles is balanced by the heat required to vaporize solution to saturate the bubbles at the equilibrium vapour pressure 14 a clear indication of reaching equilibrium is that the column solution reaches a constant temperature at which the cooling effect of the bubbles is equal to the heating effect of the column solution the study of this energy dynamic equilibrium condition is important because it indicates the heat exchange between heated gas bubbles and surrounding solution 15 in early bce experiments researchers studied the effect of different inlet gases on the evaporation efficiency of a laboratory scale bce 16 helium produced a higher efficiency than other gases a low value for the enthalpy of evaporation was achieved calculated from the above mentioned energy equilibrium 5 although the earlier research results indicated the improved evaporation efficiency of bce compared with the traditional thermal method the flow rate and inlet gas temperature should be carefully monitored because of the excessive foam produced by the helium 17 thus it is important to develop a foam controllable bce process with improved evaporation efficiency to enable the application of bce in an industrial scale in this paper for the first time we used the combustion gas the gas remaining after combustion as the inlet gas and determined the corresponding evaporation efficiency the reasons for using a combustion gas are first there is no need to pump the gas into the hbpp column as the gas is already under pressure after combustion and second the heat generated by the combustion process can be used as the heat source to improve the performance of the hbpp desalination treatment as a result the energy efficiency can be greatly improved by reducing the consumption of fuels to heat up the inlet gas thirdly the combustion gases typically also contain heated water vapour which has higher heat capacity compared with heated gas 18 thus the heat transfer efficiency between heated combustion gas bubbles and solution can be greatly improved to increase the evaporation efficiency it should be noted that the composition of the combustion gas can also be controlled by adjusting the combustion parameters including air percentage and temperature 19 this property makes the hbpp process more controllable compared with other inlet gases such as helium 5 16 17 here we used liquefied petroleum gas lpg as the combustible source and carefully controlled the amount of air during combustion to ensure that the lpg was fully combusted 2 materials and methods the hbpp experimental setup was designed in two different configurations fig 1 for experiment 1 air was pumped through an aeroflow pump which provided an airflow of 120 140 l min the air was heated by an lhs15 leister electric air heater to maintain the target temperature of the inlet airflow the evaporation efficiency for two experimental solutions a 0 5 m nacl solution to simulate seawater and synthetic sewage was determined to assess the ability of the hbpp to treat seawater and wastewater the secondary treated synthetic sewage was prepared based on iso 11733 water quality guidelines and the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd standards 20 21 to meet the standards it consisted of 120 mg of peptone 90 mg of meat extract replaced here by bovril 22 30 mg of urea 13 mg of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 7 mg of sodium chloride 2 mg of calcium chloride dehydrate and 2 mg of magnesium sulphate heptahydrate in 1l of tap water the evaporation efficiency of the hbpp with the different solutions nacl solution or synthetic sewage was determined with the inlet air at temperatures of 80 c 120 c and 180 c the efficiency with the different inlet gases air or combustion gas was determined at 80 c and 120 c with the nacl solution in experiment 2 lpg was put through a greenpower gas generator to produce the inlet combustion gas the combustion exhaust of the gas generator was connected to the column gas inlet by an insulated metal pipe during operation of the hbpp the lpg gas cylinder was weighed to calculate the combustion gas flow rate based on the combustion equation the flowrate was about 130 l min similar to that of the air in experiment 1 the combustion heat from the gas generator heated the combustion gas no extra gas heating was required the heated combustion gas and air was pumped into the column through the ceramic sinter to produce bubbles in the column solution the column was insulated with rock wool to reduce heat loss fig 2 the base of the rectangular stainless steel pilot plant was fitted with a half cylinder length 500 mm and an external ceramic sinter diameter 150 mm pore size 40 100 Î¼m porosity 30 43 a thermometer tenmars tm 82 n digital thermometer resolution 0 1 c was inserted just above the sinter to measure the inlet gas temperature on the sinter surface once the inlet gas reached the target temperature 3 5 l of experimental solution were poured into the pilot plant column this was the starting point 0 min of the experiment the digital balance excel fbtw series which measured the weight of the hbpp column monitored the weight loss of the solution throughout the experiement the weight loss of the column solution was recorded every 5 min during the 60 min run this indicated the amount of water vapour evaporated the temperature of the solution in the column was also recorded every 5 min at the same position the center of the column 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of solution type on hbpp evaporation efficiency the hbpp setup was designed to produce pure water via vapour transfer from multiple types of effluent such as sewage and piggery effluent the reason for this universality is that the bubble surfaces act as a natural semi permeable membrane which only allows the passage of water molecules while obstructing pollutant ions and molecules this property allows long term running of the hbpp without the loss of evaporation efficiency caused by pollutant blockage or equipment maintenance in contrast to synthetic polymer membranes here we first determined the evaporation efficiency of the hbpp with the two different column solutions with identical air inlet flows fig 3 shows a boxplot of the evaporation efficiency for the nacl solution and the synthetic sewage with the inlet air heated to 80 c 120 c and 160 c the evaporation efficiency increased when the inlet air temperature was increased from 80 c to 160 c for both column solutions this can be explained by the rapid heat and mass transfer between the hotter bubbles and solution at the bubble solution air liquid interface this temperature effect enhances the generation of water vapour increasing the evaporation efficiency of the hbpp the solution type does influence the evaporation efficiency we conducted statistical tests using ibm spss statistics 24 to analyze the evaporation efficiency reached by two solutions when pumped air at the same temerpature first the normality of the data was analysed with spss the evaporation efficiency for both experimental solutions was normally distributed at inlet gas temperatures of 80 c and 120 c but not at 160 c therefore the independent t test was chosen for the data at 80 c and 120 c and the mann whitney test for the data at 160 c the null hypothesis h 0 for the tests was that the evaporation efficiency of the nacl solution Î¼ 1 is less than or equal to the evaporation efficiency of the synthetic sewage Î¼ 2 fig 3 and the spss analysis suggest that there is enough evidence 95 cl to indicate that the evaporation efficiency for the nacl solution was higher than that for the synthetic sewage for inlet air temperatures t in the range 80 120 c t 80 c t 4 97 df 16 17 p 0 00 t 120 c t 2 11 df 17 97 p 0 03 however when the inlet air temperature reached 160 c the evaporation efficiency with the nacl solution was the same as with the synthetic sewage t 1 49 df 12 52 p 0 92 the reason for the increased evaporation efficiency of nacl solution might be that finer and denser bubbles were produced because of the bubble coalescence inhibition by the salt 10 11 this shows the potential of the hbpp to desalinate seawater and saline water with a low energy consumption 23 the observed column solution temperatures of these two experimental solutions are shown in fig 4 the higher solution temperature can be reached when higher temperature of inlet gas was pumped into the column despite of the inlet gas type that is because more heat can be transferred by the heated gas thus facilitating the evaporation process both solution temperatures increased dramatically in the first 10 min because of the flash heat exchange between the hot air flow and the column solution after 10 min the column solution temperature increased more slowly and eventually remained constant because the dynamic heat exchange between hot gas bubbles and the surrounding solution reached equilibrium the evaporation efficiency was a linear function of the column solution temperature in the hbpp figs 3 and 5 this correlation is due to the high saturated vapour pressures at high solution temperatures more water vapour was collected by the air bubbles when the solution temperature increased these more saturated bubbles continuously collapse and release water vapour to the condenser producing more condensed water 3 2 influence of the inlet gas on evaporation efficiency here we compare the evaporation efficiency of the hbpp for two types of inlet gas air and a combustion gas using the 0 5 m nacl solution in the column combustion gas was pumped into the column from lpg burned in the gas generator in specifying the composition of the combustion gas the lpg was considered to be fully combusted the chemical formula of lpg c3 5h9 was determined by assuming that the lpg was a mixture of 50 by mass of butane c4h10 and 50 propane c3h8 the combustion gas is the combustion product of the lpg 24 25 1 c3 5h9 5 75o2 22n2 3 5co2 4 5h2o 22n2 the inlet combustion gas temperature was monitored by placing the thermocouple on the surface of the porous sinter in the column the nacl column solution was poured into the column when the gas temperature reached 120 c 3 2 1 mass transfer between the combustion gas and the nacl column solution the evaporation efficiency of the hbpp can be determined by measuring the amount of water vapour evaporated over time when air was used as the inlet gas the amount of water vapour evaporated was measured as the weight loss in the column solution however when the combustion gas was used as the inlet gas condensation of hot water vapour in the combustion gas eq 1 introduced an error calculation of the net amount of water vapour evaporated must take into account this condensation the mass transfer process in the hbpp is shown in fig 6 for both air and combustion gas with air as the inlet gas the weight of water vapour evaporated is equal to the weight loss of the column solution 2 w net evaporation w solution weight loss w balance weight variation to determine the net evaporation caused by the combustion gas the inlet water vapour produced by combusting the lpg was calculated by comparing the weight variation in the column solution throughout the evaporation process the net amount of water vapour evaporated was calculated as follows 1 before the combustion gas was pumped into the column solution the weight w of the solution was measured 3 w before evaporation w column solution 2 after the combustion gas is pumped into the column the weight balance can be written 4 w after evaporation w column solution w inlet water vapour w net evaporation 3 the weight variation is the difference between the weight after and the weight before bubbling the combustion gas into the hbpp column 5 w weight variation w after evaporation w before evaporation therefore the net amount of evaporated water vapour is 6 w net evaporation w inlet water vapour w weight variation fig 7 shows boxplots of the amount of water vapour evaporated every 5 min with the inlet air and combustion gas at 120 c there is no overlap between the boxplots thus showing a significant difference between the evaporation efficiencies with these two inlet gases the combustion gas had on average a 37 higher evaporation efficiency than the air during the 60 min run of the hbpp this substantial increase is probably due to the hot water vapour contained in the combustion gas condensation of the hot water vapour in the column solution brings in more heat to evaporate the solution thus increasing the evaporation efficiency with the combustion gas 3 2 2 heat transfer between the combustion gas and the nacl column solution the excellent evaporation efficiency achieved by the combustion gas was attributed to the additional heat caused by the condensation of the hot water vapour in the combustion gas the amount of inlet water vapour was calculated from the consumption of lpg using eq 1 the total exothermic heat in the inlet water vapour was calculated using the scheme in fig 8 we assumed that the inlet water vapour at 120 c was fully converted to liquid water because of the large temperature difference between the hot water vapour and the nacl solution in calculating the total exothermic heat q transferred from the hot inlet water vapour in the combustion gas three types of energy were considered fig 8 q 1 is the heat released from the 120 c water vapour to the 100 c water vapour q 2 is the condensation heat released by turning the 100 c water from vapour to liquid and q 3 is the heat released from the 100 c liquid water to the 48 5 c liquid water in the column solution fig 9 shows the temperature of the nacl solution when sparging 120 c combustion gas or air into the hbpp the combustion gas resulted in both a higher column solution temperature and a better evaporation efficiency compared with air at the same inlet temperature this is because more heat was transferred from the combustion gas in evaporating the column solution with air as the inlet gas the energy balance between the air and column solution can be expressed as 26 27 7 Î´t c p t e Î´p Ï v t e Î´h vap t e on the left hand side of the energy balance equation c p t e is the specific heat capacity of the inlet gas at the equilibrium temperature j m 3 k 1 Î´t the temperature difference between the gas entering and the gas leaving the column k and Î´p the hydrostatic pressure difference between the inlet gas flow and the atmosphere j m 3 on the right hand side of the equation Ï v t e is the vapour density at the equilibrium solution temperature mol m 3 andÎ´h vap t e the enthalpy of vaporization for the column solution j mol 1 this energy balance equation shows the dynamic heat exchange process when the heat transferred from the hot inlet gas bubbles is equal to the heat required to evaporate the column solution however with combustion gas as the inlet gas the heat transferred by the gas bubbles includes the exothermic heat of the water vapour in the combustion gas 8 q w Î´t c p t e Î´p Ï v t e Î´h vap t e in this equation the extra term q w is the liquefaction heat of the inlet water vapour j m 3 comparison of eqs 7 and 8 shows that the heat supplied by the combustion gas is higher than the heat supplied by the air due to the addition of the exothermic liquefaction reaction of the water vapour in the combustion gas therefore the vapour density on the right hand side of eq 7 for the combustion gas is higher than for the air if Î´h vap t e is constant this is the reason why a higher evaporation efficiency in the hbpp process is observed when using combustion gas as the inlet gas 4 conclusions hbpp has been designed as a small scale industrial application of the bce heated gas is pumped through a porous sinter to produce dense fine bubbles in the column solution which transfer heat and mass to from the solution a 0 5 m nacl solution and synthetic sewage were chosen as experimental column solutions to study the ability of the hbpp to produce pure condensed water from seawater and sewage it was found that a higher inlet gas temperature achieved better evaporation efficiency because more heat was transferred from the hot gas bubbles to evaporate the column solution a statistical analysis using spss showed that the hbpp performed better in treating the nacl solution than the sewage at inlet temperatures of 80 c and 120 c but performed equally well in treating the nacl solution and the sewage at 160 c this demonstrated the best temperature range for the hbpp to treat different types of wastewater using the combustion gas from lpg as the inlet gas in the hbpp increased the evaporation efficiency compared with air at the same inlet temperature with the nacl solution as the column solution this hot combustion gas is the normal exhaust from biogas engines and the byproduct of many factories and so could be used as the inlet gas without additional heating the hbpp provides a new energy efficient

8791,hbpp uses hot dense bubbles as heat and mass carriers to evaporate the solution with improved evaporation efficiency compared with the traditional thermal method to develop an energy efficient water treatment process we applied combustion gas as inlet gas within hbpp for the first time to evaporate synthetic seawater the advantage of using combustion gas is that the hot waste combustion gas from factories can be used at almost no energy cost thereby reducing energy consumption in this paper the evaporation efficiency was determined by measuring the weight loss of column solution of hbpp in a 60 min run firstly the ability of the hbpp to treat different types of wastewater including 0 5 m nacl solution or synthetic sewage was tested by pumping air at the temperature of 80 120 and 160 c respectively the observed amount of evaporated water vapour was higher for the 0 5 m nacl solution than for the synthetic sewage at inlet air temperatures of 80 c and 120 c but the same at a temperature of 160 c the hbpp shows the potential for water treatment regardless of wastewater type then the evaporation efficiency was calculated for both combustion gas and air at the inlet temperature of 120 c to evaporate 0 5 m nacl solution the result showed an increment of 37 of evaporation efficiency achieved by sparging combustion gas that is because the contained water vapour has a high capacity for efficient heat transfer to evaporate the solution as a result applying combustion gas within hbpp can provide an energy conservative method with improved evaporation efficiency for water treatment keywords hbpp desalination combustion gas evaporation efficiency energy balance 1 introduction the shortage of freshwater worldwide has triggered a crisis for the wellbeing of humanity 1 2 to help solve the shortage locally the peak body of the australian pork industry australian pork limited has invested in novel water treatment technologies one of which is to use the bubble column evaporator bce developed in the laboratory as a large scale hbpp the purpose of building up hbpp is to develop a long term energy conservative water treatment technology with improved evaporation efficiency and reduced energy consumption the process has been patented by the university of new south wales as australian patent number wo2020124161a1 this paper is a continuation work of our earlier published paper 3 which evaluates the efficiency of water sterilization effect of hbpp in this paper we focused on the evaporation efficiency achieved by hbpp and used the combustion gas as inlet for the first time regarding the working mechanism the bce is a new thermal desalination technology that uses pumped hot gas through a porous sinter underneath a column of solution to produce a continuous stream of hot fine bubbles these hot bubbles can exchange heat to evaporate water from the surrounding solution via the bubble interface 4 the bce can be applied in many areas based on the increased surface area for efficient heat and mass transfer the applications include water treatment 4 5 virus inactivation 6 7 evaporative cooling 8 and for the thermolysis of solutes at low temperatures 9 the main advantage of using the bce to desalinate seawater is that the salt contained in seawater inhibits bubble coalescence thus producing finer bubbles in the column the consequent increase in surface area means a higher rate of mass and heat transfer at the bubble surface 10 11 the heat transfer between liquid and gas is 100 times more efficient in a gas liquid bubble column than in a single phase flow 12 13 as a result bce can reach a higher evaporation efficiency at temperatures well below the boiling point the bce reaches a dynamic equilibrium when the heat supplied to the column by those continuously ascending hot gas bubbles is balanced by the heat required to vaporize solution to saturate the bubbles at the equilibrium vapour pressure 14 a clear indication of reaching equilibrium is that the column solution reaches a constant temperature at which the cooling effect of the bubbles is equal to the heating effect of the column solution the study of this energy dynamic equilibrium condition is important because it indicates the heat exchange between heated gas bubbles and surrounding solution 15 in early bce experiments researchers studied the effect of different inlet gases on the evaporation efficiency of a laboratory scale bce 16 helium produced a higher efficiency than other gases a low value for the enthalpy of evaporation was achieved calculated from the above mentioned energy equilibrium 5 although the earlier research results indicated the improved evaporation efficiency of bce compared with the traditional thermal method the flow rate and inlet gas temperature should be carefully monitored because of the excessive foam produced by the helium 17 thus it is important to develop a foam controllable bce process with improved evaporation efficiency to enable the application of bce in an industrial scale in this paper for the first time we used the combustion gas the gas remaining after combustion as the inlet gas and determined the corresponding evaporation efficiency the reasons for using a combustion gas are first there is no need to pump the gas into the hbpp column as the gas is already under pressure after combustion and second the heat generated by the combustion process can be used as the heat source to improve the performance of the hbpp desalination treatment as a result the energy efficiency can be greatly improved by reducing the consumption of fuels to heat up the inlet gas thirdly the combustion gases typically also contain heated water vapour which has higher heat capacity compared with heated gas 18 thus the heat transfer efficiency between heated combustion gas bubbles and solution can be greatly improved to increase the evaporation efficiency it should be noted that the composition of the combustion gas can also be controlled by adjusting the combustion parameters including air percentage and temperature 19 this property makes the hbpp process more controllable compared with other inlet gases such as helium 5 16 17 here we used liquefied petroleum gas lpg as the combustible source and carefully controlled the amount of air during combustion to ensure that the lpg was fully combusted 2 materials and methods the hbpp experimental setup was designed in two different configurations fig 1 for experiment 1 air was pumped through an aeroflow pump which provided an airflow of 120 140 l min the air was heated by an lhs15 leister electric air heater to maintain the target temperature of the inlet airflow the evaporation efficiency for two experimental solutions a 0 5 m nacl solution to simulate seawater and synthetic sewage was determined to assess the ability of the hbpp to treat seawater and wastewater the secondary treated synthetic sewage was prepared based on iso 11733 water quality guidelines and the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd standards 20 21 to meet the standards it consisted of 120 mg of peptone 90 mg of meat extract replaced here by bovril 22 30 mg of urea 13 mg of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 7 mg of sodium chloride 2 mg of calcium chloride dehydrate and 2 mg of magnesium sulphate heptahydrate in 1l of tap water the evaporation efficiency of the hbpp with the different solutions nacl solution or synthetic sewage was determined with the inlet air at temperatures of 80 c 120 c and 180 c the efficiency with the different inlet gases air or combustion gas was determined at 80 c and 120 c with the nacl solution in experiment 2 lpg was put through a greenpower gas generator to produce the inlet combustion gas the combustion exhaust of the gas generator was connected to the column gas inlet by an insulated metal pipe during operation of the hbpp the lpg gas cylinder was weighed to calculate the combustion gas flow rate based on the combustion equation the flowrate was about 130 l min similar to that of the air in experiment 1 the combustion heat from the gas generator heated the combustion gas no extra gas heating was required the heated combustion gas and air was pumped into the column through the ceramic sinter to produce bubbles in the column solution the column was insulated with rock wool to reduce heat

ethanol is an important chemical and used in several application such as preparation of important chemical reagents as a solvent and preparation of gasohol mixture of gasoline and alcohol additionally for the production of many alcoholic beverages i e beer wine and distilled spirits ethanol is an important ingredient most of the ethanol is produced by using sugarcane molasses as a raw material however recently rice wheat and corn are also being used for the ethanol production owing to its high demand since availability of rice is throughout the year therefore it is well accepted by the several industries as a raw material for ethanol production furthermore looking to economic point of view even poor grade rice can also be used for ethanol 1 fermentation broth media is prepared by fermentation of raw material which contains 7 11 vol ethanol this ethanol is main product of distillation column and collected from the rectifying section reaming material liquor received from the stripping section is commonly known as spent wash sw sw is characterize by high organic loads in term of chemical oxygen demand cod 11 125 kg m3 and biochemical oxygen demand bod 3 40 kg m3 as rice is used as raw material 2 therefore sw is first treated in aerobic biodigester which reduces 40 60 cod and 50 70 bod the biodigester treated effluent is called biodigester effluent bde bde still contains a high cod and bod 2 30 and 0 5 8 kg m3 respectively 3 if it is directly discharge in any water receiving body then it is not safe for the aquatic system furthermore the cpcb central pollution control board had fixed standard for treated effluent to be discharged into surface cod 0 1 kg m3 bod 0 03 kg m3 and in sewers cod 0 3 kg m3 bod 0 1 kg m3 4 therefore treatment of bde is essentially for the

filtration 8 and anaerobic digestion 9 but these of these techniques have their own limitation addition of chemicals and large amount of sludge generation are major drawback of coagulation process while in the case of air stripping only volatile components are removed effectively and other pollutants are still remain in water 5 7 preparation and regeneration of adsorbent i e activated carbon increases cost of granular activated carbon filtration process 8 large retention time and high installation cost are limitation associated with anaerobic digestion process 9 therefore researchers have shifted to other advance techniques in the recent past advance oxidation processes aops are well accepted by the several industries due to its promising efficiency of waste water treatment recently ozone is used with several advanced oxidation processes aops such as electrocoagulation 10 ultrasound 11 uv h2o2 and tio2 12 14 to further improve the performance of process towards removal of reluctant pollutants in these sequence electro peroxone process are found more suitable to treat bde this process is a combination of three techniques namely electrocoagulation ozonation and peroxone process to understand the concept of electro peroxone process understanding of the basic principles of these three techniques are very important electrocoagulation is based on supply of direct current in water wastewater submerged metal plate generally iron or aluminium and this plate is well known as electrode waste water contains colloidal particles that possess negative charges 1 3 during the process metallic ions releases from the anode that combine with the negative ions consequently small colloids convert into the heavy flocks in form of metal hydroxide and settle down by virtue of gravity 5 equation 1 1 x m 3 y h 2 o m x o h y 3 x y y h ozonation process is effective pretreatment method for the remediation of the bio recalcitrant based waste water during the process bio refractory organics successfully converts into more readily biodegradable intermediates followed by biological degradation of these intermediates because ozone is very powerful oxidizing agent i e oxidation potential of ozone is 2 07 v hence it successfully reacts with the different organic compounds either directly as molecular ozone or indirectly through hydroxyl free radical generation 8 15 furthermore organics are present in the form of macromolecules which avoid effective biological oxidation when ozone is applied in this type of waste water macromolecules easily breakdown as a short chain intermediate products that can enter into cells and becomes easily biodegradable because biological oxidation rate increases with decrease in molecular size 15 moreover peroxone process is a type of aop for water wastewater treatment that is based on the combination of ozone and hydrogen peroxide during peroxone treatment highly persistent particles are formed which is known as hydroxyradicals oh these radicals react with or oxidize most organic pollutants present in a solution 16 apart from this the electro peroxone is a type of electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop which is based on the supply of o3 in electrocoagulation reactor which causes in situ hydrogen peroxide h2o2 production at the cathode to promote peroxone reaction and it offers successful treatment of water and wastewater in other words electro peroxone process is based on the supply of o3 into traditional electrocoagulation reactor where reactor is equipped with carbon based cathode 17 it is well known that ozone generators are unable to convert 100 oxygen in the form of ozone during the process the gas mixture o3 and o2 is sparged in the reactor hence h2o2 is produced electrochemically at the cathode by utilizing o2 which is the main product of the process 18 in other words this allows in situ generation of h2o2 at controlled rates with proper use of o2 in the presence of o3 and h2o2 following reaction occurs 19 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 o h o 2 o 2 3 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 4 h 2 o 2 h h o 2 5 h o 2 o 3 h o 2 o 3 as formed hydroxyl radicals are very powerful oxidants consequently most of the reluctant pollutants are easily oxidized at very high reaction rates hence high pollutants reduction efficiency can be achieved by the electro peroxone process in electro peroxone process ph plays important role for the overall reductions of pollutants the pollutants reduction varies with variation in ph because in the presence of hydroxide ions o3 decay occurs through following reactions 20 6 o 3 o h h o 2 o 2 7 o 3 h o 2 o h o 2 o 2 8 h o 2 o h o 2 h o h oxidative treatments are more effective in current water wastewater treatment technologies but it has several drawbacks for example during peroxone treatment addition of h2o2 enhances operating cost of the process and generation of large amount of sludge and its disposal etc 18 19 furthermore in the ozonation process bromate is formed when ozone reacts with naturally occurring bromide found in source water is major disadvantage of this process 16 electro peroxone process overcomes these problems in several ways in term of low sludge generation considerable reduction in operating cost by effectively avoiding bromate formation during the treatment of bromide containing water 19 almost no literatures has been reported for the treatment of distillery waste water using electro peroxone process however asaithambi et al 21 investigated the effect of ozone assisted electrocoagulation for the removal of cod and color from the distillery waste water using different combination of iron and aluminium electrode this work is based on the effect of several operating parameters such as initial ph initial cod concentration current density electrode gap and electrode combination towards organics removal it was reported that the maximum cod reduction of 83 and color reduction of 100 respectively was achieved at current density of 3 a dm2 initial cod concentration of 2500 mg dm3 initial ph 6 and at ozone gas mixture flow rate 15 dm3 min aziz et al 22 have treated distillery industrial effluent to reduce organic load in terms of the color and cod reduction by hybrid electrocoagulation process such as peroxi electrocoagulation photoelectrocoagulation ozone electrocoagulation and peroxi photo electrocoagulation process and by using electrocoagulation and ozonation process alone it was observed that hybrid electrocoagulation process had provided better cod reduction as compared to electrocoagulation and ozonation process alone the maximum removal efficiency achieved were 95 85 88 36 100 and 90 45 by using peroxi electrocoagulation process photo electrocoagulation process ozone electrocoagulation process and peroxi photo electrocoagulation process respectively after 240 min of reaction moreover ozonation process and electrocoagulation process had provided maximum cod reduction 18 75 and 81 30 respectively after 240 min of reaction therefore it is clearly evident that addition of other process is more effective than individual process alone orescanin et al 23 have proposed a two step treatment technique for the treatment of winery wastewater this technique is based on either using electrochemical followed by advanced oxidation process or sonication followed by advanced oxidation process maximum removal efficiencies of 99 were achieved for different parameter such the color turbidity suspended solids and phosphates the novelties of the present work includes the detailed literature review on treatment of bde using electro peroxone process and similar techniques the mechanism of electro peroxone is given in detail with updated information also the paper presents a detailed discussion about advantages disadvantages and limitations of electro peroxone process additionally the detailed study of operating parameters of the electro peroxone technique such as current density ozone concentration cathode material electrolyte and solution ph are also incorporated moreover this work reports application of novel electroperoxone process technique for the treatment of rice grain based distillery biodigester effluent bde for the very first time therefore in the present investigation this technique electro peroxone was chosen to treat the bde further the oh production during electro peroxone process was calculated by a terephthalic acid ta trapping technique 24 25 influence of operating parameters such as current density ozone concentration cathode material electrolyte and solution ph was studied on color and cod removal and on the basis of experimental results all operating parameter were optimized a comparative study on the removal of cod and color from the bde by electro peroxone and electrocoagulation was also presented 2 material and methods 2 1 materials the rice grain based distillery bde was obtained from chhattisgarh distillery pvt ltd kumhari chhattisgarh india the sample was collected once for whole experiments in the help two plastic containers 50 l each from biodigester unit biodigester is a waste water treatment unit where spent wash is treated already for this grab sampling was used collected sample was transported through institute vehicle the distance between institute and industry is around 10 km to maintain constant characteristics of bde the sample was stored at 4 c in a deep freezer the main characteristics of the original effluent are summarized in table 1 chemicals i e h2o2 h2so4 naoh and anhydrous alcohol and purity of these chemicals are 99 used are of analytical grade ar and purchased from the merck company mumbai india isaf n220 carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe were also supplied by merck company mumbai india aluminium and titanium is purchased from the local market double distilled water was used in all the experiments made in laboratory 2 2 preparation of carbon ptfe cathode a mixture of polytetrafluoroethylene isaf n 220 carbon black and water in a volume ratio of 55 45 and anhydrous alcohol were used to prepare the carbon ptfe cathode 26 the removal of impurities from carbon black was done in three steps including boiling of carbon black in deionized water for 2 h then washing for few times and finely dried at 110 c with the help of an oven further 100 g of dried carbon black and 120 ml of ptfe water dispersion were mixed with calculated quantity of anhydrous alcohol with the help of an ultrasonic bath for 20 min after this whole mixture was mixed continuously with the help of water bath 80 c and at the same time alcohol was also evaporated now a cake of carbon ptfe was obtained and that was compressed to form a defined size of plate with the dimensions of 80 20 2 mm when two carbon ptfe plates were prepared it was compressed by nickel mesh with the same dimensions at a pressure of 20 mpa for 5 min to form a cathode finally this compressed cathode was treated in a muffle furnace at high temperature 350 c for 1 h and left to cool in the furnace 2 3 experimental setup the experimental setup consisted an electrocoagulation reactor perspex glass assisted with ozone generator for the present investigation is schematically shown in fig 1 i e effluent has been already biologically treated therefore sample can be directivity treated by electro peroxone method with the help of bubble diffuser the ozone was spread at the bottom of the reactor at a fixed flow rate of 70 dm3 h ozone was supplied by using an ozone generator ozonetek limited chennai the capacity of ozone generator was around 3 g h however during the electrocoagulation ozone was not spread in the reactor a pair of electrodes i e aluminum as an anode and carbon ptfe as a cathode were placed in a perspex glass reactor because the best treatment possibility is based on the balance between the hydroxyl radical generation and rate of organics degradation the detailed configuration of electrode and reactor is presented in table 2 the 1 dm3 bde is placed in the 1 2 dm3 perspex glass reactor for all the experiments the ph of the bde was adjusted by using h2so4 and naoh solutions the inter electrode gap was kept at 2 cm a gap of 3 cm was preserved between the bottom of the electrodes and the perspex glass to avail easy stirring to maintain the uniform concentration of perspex glass reactor magnetic stirrer was used after each experimental run the electrodes were reused for further experiment by cleaning with 12 hcl followed by distilled water to supply dc current electrodes were connected to a digital dc current range 0 5a voltage range 0 30 v power supply current density was adjusted by regulator the treated samples were collected at regular time intervals from perspex glass reactor during the experiments and subsequently filtered by whatman filter paper 42 for the measurement of cod and color reduction all the measurements were repeated three times to avoid any manual or instrumental error residue obtain after the electro peroxone treatment was dried and its calorific value was measured 2 4 analytical methods transferred ozone was determinate by iodometric method 27 in this method buffered iodine solution was added into the ozone contained sample consequently the amount of ozone present in the sample oxidizes and hence triiodide ions are liberating further reading shown in spectrophotometer is noted absorbance was measured at 352 nm after 30 min and compared to a calibration graph made with a stable iodine solution and the transferred ozone concentration was determined the strength of h2o2 in the effluent was analyzed by potassium titanium iv oxalate method in this method a 0 025 dm3 calibrated flask is used to

following equation 28 29 h 2 o 2 absorbances of the sample absorbances of the blank solution volume sample path length of the spectrophotometer cell in centimetres 37 4 terephthalic acid ta trapping was used to determine oh concentration 24 25 in this method the hydroxyl radical was trapped by the direct addition reaction with terephthalic acid when ph of solution reaches 6 to 6 9 and this condition is achieved after 5 min of experimental run this terephthalic acid solution 1 5 mm was prepared in a phosphate buffer 6 8 10 4 m sodium hydroxide and 4 1 10 3 m sodium phosphate dibasic at a ph of 10 9 0 1 samples were collected at defined time interval during electro peroxone and put to a quartz fluorescence cell in the fluorimeter shimadzu spectrofluorophotometer rf 540 was used to measure the fluorescence electro peroxone treated solutions in the existence of terephthalate were examine fluorometrically by excitation at 310 nm with emission measured at 425 nm it should be noted that overdosing of terephthalic acid can influences the production of hydroxyl radicals oh in term of oh scavenges the proteins present in the solution were evaluated by the bradford method 30 the reduced carbohydrates were determined by the fehling method 31 the amount of lignin in samples was analyzed by the klason method 32 total carbon analyser shimadzu model toc vcsn was used to determine inorganic carbon organic carbon total carbon and dissolve carbon of the samples digital ph meter ei made india was used to measure the ph of the solutions the concentration of the metal ions in the filtrate is determined by using an atomic absorption spectrometer gbc model awanta australia 33 the chloride concentration was determined by the standard titrimetric volhard method 34 po4 3 was

phenolphthalein and 1 n sodium hydroxide solution then sample was nutrilized by 4 0 ml molybedate reagent and 0 5 ml stannous chloride reagent and then its absorbance at 690 nm was noted using spectrophotometer and compared with standard calibration curve 33 total hardness of the solution is determinate by titrimetric analysis where known amount of sample is processed with buffer solution and titrated by edta solution 33 sulfate was determinate by gravimetric method where hydrochloric acid and 5 barium chloride were used as reagent 33 nitrate concentrations in the influent and effluent

dad detector equipped with the agilent zorbax eclipse pah separation column at 220 nm wavelengths the movable phase was filled with acetonitrile with 0 1 formic acid and water 30 70 v v during the measurement the flow rate was maintained by 1 ml min and 1 Î¼l of the solution sample was inserted through auto sampler agilent 1100 it is noted that all samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 10 000 g before analysis 35 the bod 5 day of given sample was evaluated at 20 c by technique of standard dilution 33 in this technique airtight bod bottle was used to adopt 300 ml of sample and positioned it

the value of bod total suspended solid was determinate by gravimetric test in this method a water sample is filtered residue was dried to a constant weight at 105 c 1 and weighed for determining the mass of the residue retained on the filter 33 the amount of total dissolve solid tds is the difference between the total solids i e this parameter is measured by evaporating a sample to dryness and weighing the sample and suspended solids content in the water sample 33 the cod were measured by a dichromatic closed reflux method with solution a contains mercury ii sulfate and solution b contains sulphuric acid potassium dichromate as per standard method 33 the color of the solution was evaluated by absorbance capacity at the wavelength Î»max 475 nm of the solution with the help of uv spectrophotometer 36 the cod reduction is evaluated by following equation 9 cod reduction cod 0 cod t cod 0 where cod0 is the initial cod value mg dm3 and codt is the cod value at any time t mg dm3 the percentage color reduction is evaluated by following equation 10 color reduction abe 0 abe t abe 0 where abe0 and abet are absorbance of effluent at initial and any reaction time t for

experiments were conducted for electrocoagulation and electro peroxone process electrocoagulation was operated at cd of 16 a m2 cod concentration of 6000 mg dm3 electrode gap of 2 cm with initial ph of 6 during electro peroxone o3 was sparged into the electrocoagulation reactor with the rate of 70 dm3 h at the same operating conditions as used in electrocoagulation the o3 concentration in bde was taken as 135 mg dm3 the percentage cod and color reduction during electrocoagulation and electro peroxone process are shown in fig 2 a and b the percentage of cod reduction by electrocoagulation and electro peroxone processes was found to be 52 1 and 84 3 respectively after 70 min of reaction additionally color reduction was observed as 35 8 and 65 3 respectively by electrocoagulation and electro peroxone process results indicate that electro peroxone process is much better than electrocoagulation in term of pollutants removal in the electrocoagulation process metallic ions are only driving force which adds with negative ions of different functional group present in organics 37 38 on the other hand during electro peroxone process h2o2 generates at cathode while o3 sparged through ozone generator thus in the presence of both reaction 3 4 and 5 occurs 19 38 39 above equation shows that very powerful oxidizing agents are generated during the reaction and hence pollutants gets easily oxidized 3 2 h2o2 and oh production in electro peroxone process as discussed earlier that h2o2 generates at the cathode which play important role to reduce reluctant pollutants therefore the production of h2o2 during electro peroxone process has been analyzed and presented in fig 3 a the investigation is performed at cd of 16 a m2 cod concentration of 6000 mg dm3 electrode gap of 2 cm ph of 6 o3 sparged rate of 70 dm3 h and o3 concentration of 135 mg dm3 it can be seen from fig 3 a that h2o2 production increased from 1 9 mg dm3 to 10 2 mg dm3 with increasing process time from 10 min to 50 min however with further increase in process time production rate of h2o2 is almost constant this may be due to cathode material carbon ptfe which supports oxygen towards h2o2 production up to a certain limit however excessive presence of oxygen does not get any proper platform for the production of h2o2 fig 3 b shows that oh production increases from 2 2 Î¼m to 11 9 Î¼m at 10 and 50 min of reaction time respectively this may be due to production of oh by the reaction between electro generated h2o2 and sparged o3 the oh concentration attained equilibrium after 50 min of reaction time however reaction between o3 and h2o2 is slow k 0 01 m1 s 1 but it involves fast conjugated base k 5 5 106 m1 s 1 39 hence large difference occurs in rate constants possibly o3 reacts with only ho2 form of h2o2 39 40 3 3 effect of different cathode selection of cathode is the key operational parameter for the electro peroxone process therefore the experiment was performed with different cathode material such as carbon ptfe and titanium it can be seen from fig 4 a and b that maximum cod and color reduction of 84 1 and 65 3 respectively was achieved using carbon ptfe as a cathode material at cd of 16 a m2 cod concentration of 6000 mg dm3 electrode gap of 2 cm ph of 6 o3 sparged rate of 70 dm3 h and o3 concentration of 135 mg dm3 whereas when titanium was used as cathode the maximum cod and color reduction observed were 67 8 and 51 8 respectively at the same operating condition as used for carbon ptfe cathode actually effective degradation of pollutants during electro peroxone process is based on the in situ production of h2o2 selection of more efficient cathode can easily generate h2o2 from oxygen as carbon based cathodes like carbon ptfe produce a significant quantity of h2o2 consequently substantial amount of oh but metal cathodes like titanium produce a lower amount of h2o2 because decay of h2o2 41 additionally carbon based cathodes have their excessive potential for h2 evolution and poor activity for h2o2 decay therefore it easily convert o2 to h2o2 42 3 4 effects of current density cd is yet another important parameter for electo peroxone process hence the effect of cd during the electro peroxane process was performed and presented in fig 5 a and b the cod reductions of 72 3 84 1 92 1 and 98 9 and color reduction of 53 6 65 3 71 3 and 80 1 respectively were achieved at cd of 8 a m2 16 a m2 24 a m2 and 32 a m2 during the experiments the operating condition maintained were cod concentration of 6000 mg dm3 electrode gap of 2 cm ph of 6 o3 sparged rate of 70 dm3 h and o3 concentration of 135 mg dm3 it is clear that cod and color reduction increases with increase in current density this may be due to the fact that current density can generates more aqueous oh while sufficient aqueous o3 is present in the media consequently oh actively participate in reaction with in situ generated h2o2 hence pollutants efficiently degrades through the electro peroxone process further experiments with higher cd were not performed due to the economic constraints however the pollutants reduction rate increases up to a certain limit of cd after that it decreases as also reported by several authors 43 44 this may be attributed to controlled oh production rate by the o3 transfer rate from gas phase to liquid phase as current density increases beyond a certain limit moreover it is well known fact that when cd increases hydrogen gas formation on the cathode also increases consequently hydrogen bubbles adhere on the surface of electrode causing lower transfer area and therefore less production of h2o2 and oh 44 3 5 effect of o3 doses the o3 dose is also a critical parameter during electro peroxone process therefore effect of inlet o3 concentration on the bde was investigated by o3 dose at varying concentrations of 45 100 and 135 mg dm3 other operating parameters like ph cd stirrer speed and cod concentration were kept constant the experimental results see fig 6 a and b shows that cod and color removal efficiency has increased with increasing inlet o3 concentration the cod reductions were found 72 8 92 3 and 98 9 respectively with 45 100 and 135 mg dm3 of inlet ozone concentration fig 6 a similarly color reductions were 56 1 70 2 and 80 1 respectively with 45 100 and 135 mg dm3 of inlet ozone concentration fig 6 b usually o3 concentration increases in gas phase are responsible to promotes the mass transfer of o3 to liquid phase from gas phase consequently higher oh productions rate occurs due to the reaction between aqueous o3 and in situ h2o2 produced by the cathode additionally when pure oxygen is sparged in the electrocoagulation reactor no significance cod and color reduction was observed as compared to electro peroxone process this may be due to the fact that pure oxygen only increases the availability of h2o2 to cathode side but for the production of oh both o3 and h2o2 are required 45 3 6 effect of ph initial ph of the solution is considered as a crucial parameter for electro peroxone process therefore to investigate the effect of ph on cod and color removal from the bde the ph of the solution was adjusted to various initial values ph 2 10 with the help of diluted h2so4 or naoh before applying electro peroxone process the experiment were performed with initial cod concentration of 6000 mg dm3 cd of 32 a m2 electrode gap of 2 cm stirrer speed of 100 rpm and ozone concentration 135 mg dm3 of h2o2 fig 7 a and b maximum cod and color reduction of 98 9 and 80 1 respectively was achieved at ph 6 even significant reduction in cod was also obtained up to 91 3 and 93 8 at ph 4 and ph 8 respectively however poor cod and color reduction was observed at ph 2 and ph 10 overall the reductions of pollutants are different at different ph because initiation of o3 decay occurs due to the presence of hydroxide ions as per reaction equation 6 7 and 8 20 additionally the pollutants removal efficiency depends on organic s structures and types of electrode materials and hence the role of ph for degradation of organics is very important for the electro peroxone processes 3 7 effect of electrolytes the above experiments were conducted without addition of any electrolytes it is reported that electrolytes significantly influences the electrochemical production of h2o2 46 therefore to investigate the effects of electrolytes during electro peroxone treatment of bde was performed in electrolyte solutions of nacl and na2so4 with different concentrations the result reflects that complete cod reduction 99 9 in 50 min and satisfactory color reduction 91 3 in 50 min were achieved with electrolyte of na2so4 concentration na2so4 0 15 m fig 8 a and b it is remarkable that additions of electrolytes significantly reduce the process time for the cod and color reduction additionally organic pollutants were removed more rapidly in na2so4 solutions as compared to the nacl this may be accounted to the generation of more h2o2 from sparged o2 by na2so4 electrolyte as compared to nacl thus use of na2so4 can generates more oh by the peroxone reaction due to reaction between h2o2 and sparged o3 as compared to nacl which leads higher organics reduction with na2so4 electrolyte 47 furthermore change in electrolyte concentrations 0 15 0 1 m for na2so4 and 0 3 0 15 m for nacl did not influence significantly the organic reduction because of no marginal change in h2o2 production fig 8 a and b as demonstrated by several researcher 46 48 the organic reduction rate slightly increases with increase in nacl concentration the reason for this may be that more concentrated nacl causes more cl that may be oxidized at the anode to form cl2 and hclo and hence more pollutants are oxidized 49 50 3 8 potential of electro peroxone process in organics removal this work elucidate that electro peroxone process is a more effective method to treat bde however most of the work reported is for treatment of synthetic waste water electro peroxone process has several advantages compared to conventional aops its ability to remove reluctant pollutants with the mechanism of adequate production of radical species and in situ generation of h2o2 without any chemical addition are main advantages of electro peroxone process recent studies 51 52 showed that this method is being employed to remove non biodegradable chemicals from the waste water additionally for the treatment of drinking water electro peroxone process can be safely used to avoid bromate formation that can t be done in ozonation process alone the comparison of electrocoagulation process with electro peroxone process has demonstrated that degradation efficiency of electro peroxone process is much better than traditional electrocoagulation process in tem of cod and color removal this process generates less sludge as compared to other aops that minimizes further treatment or disposal cost which is an additional advantage of electro peroxone process 3 9 cost analysis the cost estimation for plant capacity of 100 m3 bde day is done and presented in table 3 for the proper operation of treatment plant 10 m 10 m area is sufficient the cost estimation involves several factors like equipment installation electricity electrolytes sludge disposal labor and plant maintenance however the operating cost of electro peroxone process was estimated using three main parameters namely electrode consumption electrical energy consumption and chemical electrolyte consumption using following equation 21 53 55 13 operating cost a e t b e c c c c where et total electrical consumption in kwh m3 ec electrode consumption in kg m3 and cc chemical electrolyte consumption in kg m3 et can be calculated by equations 3 and 4 additionally a b and c are the unit price of electricity consumption 0 17 us kwh electrode material al 2 35 us kg and electrolyte na2so4 0 18 us kg respectively as per indian market at the optimum operating condition for electro peroxone process the current density 32 a m2 initial ph 6 0 inter electrode gap 2 cm anode cathode combination al carbon ptfe na2so4 concentration 0 15 m o3 flow rate 70 mg dm3 the energy electrode and chemical consumptions were found to be 3 8 kwh m3 0 48 kg m3 and 0 5 kg m3 respectively additionally maintenance labor and sludge transportation and disposal cost were also added from table 3 thus the estimated operating cost was found to be 2 0 us m3 cost analysis can also be done as per unit cod at the optimum condition cod reduced from 6 0 to 0 085 kg m3 i e the total cod reduction is 5 915 kg m3 therefore cost per unit cod reduction is 0 338 cod reduction where cod is in kg m3 it is well known that cost of effluent treatment depends on the type of pollutants and their concentration if the effluent contain high organic load then it should be treated in two or three stages which aggravate the treatment cost electro peroxone treatment method can be fully competitive with other technologies like coagulation electrocoagulation and other aops however the cost of the system depends on the organic load of the bde electro peroxone treatment need more cost as compared to coagulation electrocoagulation and other aops in term of fixed capital cost but it s pollutant removal efficiency is much higher while maintenance labor and sludge transportation and disposal cost is low electro peroxone treatment cost is limited to 1 1 2 9 m3 while coagulation electrocoagulation and other aops is limited to 1 3 4 6 m3 38 in general the price may increase by approximately 7 if bod removal increases from 40 to 50 38 3 10 sludge analysis though electro peroxone process generates less amount of sludge as compared to other aops yet its disposal and management is a great problem because it contains harmful organics and metals that can influences an aquatic system anode material is main source of metal content in sludge that can be extracted by several ways such as by acidic and alkaline extractions liquid ion exchange etc 56 57 the sludge can be consumed as a fuel if its calorific value is good hence the heating value of generated sludge was determined by bomb calorimeter and it was found to be 5 8 mj kg dry basis therefore it can be used as a fuel in the furnaces or incinerator in addition sludge can be also be used for manufacturing of bricks cementious mixtures fertilizer etc additionally sludge is basically a metal hydroxide therefore metal separation from the sludge could be a good economic choice 58 4 conclusions the results of this study demonstrated that electro peroxone process effectively removed pollutants from the bde evaluated in terms of cod and color removal electro peroxone works more effectively as compared to traditional electrocoagulation process electro peroxone process is based on a novel approach of in situ production of h2o2 using carbon ptfe as a cathode material it is also found that sludge production in electro peroxone process is lesser than other aops the h2o2 and oh concentration was observed to be 11 g dm3 and 12 5 Î¼m respectively during electro peroxone process results indicate that electro peroxone process is much better than electrocoagulation process which can remove 100 cod and 92 color from the bde it is recommended that the electro peroxone process can be used to treat different type of waste water to treat 1 m3 bde the estimated operating cost is 2 0 us thus it is more acceptable to treat bde in view of cost effectiveness author statement savita

concentration of 135 mg dm3 na2so4 concentration of 0 15 m stirring speed of 100 rpm and electrolysis time of 50 min in the electro peroxone process finally potential of electro peroxone process sludge analysis and cost optimization are also described in the present article graphical abstract image 1 keywords biodigester effluent electroperoxone carbon ptfe power consumption 1 introduction ethanol is an important chemical and used in several application such as preparation of important chemical reagents as a solvent and preparation of gasohol mixture of gasoline and alcohol additionally for the production of many alcoholic beverages i e beer wine and distilled spirits ethanol is an important ingredient most of the ethanol is produced by using sugarcane molasses as a raw material however recently rice wheat and corn are also being used for the ethanol production owing to its high demand since availability of rice is throughout the year therefore it is well accepted by the several industries as a raw material for ethanol production furthermore looking to economic point of view even poor grade rice can also be used for ethanol 1 fermentation broth media is prepared by fermentation of raw material which contains 7 11 vol ethanol this ethanol is main product of distillation column and collected from the rectifying section reaming material liquor received from the stripping section is commonly known as spent wash sw sw is characterize by high organic loads in term of chemical oxygen demand cod 11 125 kg m3 and biochemical oxygen demand bod 3 40 kg m3 as rice is used as raw material 2 therefore sw is first treated in aerobic biodigester which reduces 40 60 cod and 50 70 bod the biodigester treated effluent is called biodigester effluent bde bde still contains a high cod and bod 2 30 and 0 5 8 kg m3 respectively 3 if it is directly discharge in any water receiving body then it is not safe for the aquatic system furthermore the cpcb central pollution control board had fixed standard for treated effluent to be discharged into surface cod 0 1 kg m3 bod 0 03 kg m3 and in sewers cod 0 3 kg m3 bod 0 1 kg m3 4 therefore treatment of bde is essentially for the safe discharge as well as survival of aquatic system several techniques are available to treat distillery waste water such as coagulation flocculation 5 6 air stripping 7 granular activated carbon filtration 8 and anaerobic digestion 9 but these of these techniques have their own limitation addition of chemicals and large amount of sludge generation are major drawback of coagulation process while in the case of air stripping only volatile components are removed effectively and other pollutants are still remain in water 5 7 preparation and regeneration of adsorbent i e activated carbon increases cost of granular activated carbon filtration process 8 large retention time and high installation cost are limitation associated with anaerobic digestion process 9 therefore researchers have shifted to other advance techniques in the recent past advance oxidation processes aops are well accepted by the several industries due to its promising efficiency of waste water treatment recently ozone is used with several advanced oxidation processes aops such as electrocoagulation 10 ultrasound 11 uv h2o2 and tio2 12 14 to further improve the performance of process towards removal of reluctant pollutants in these sequence electro peroxone process are found more suitable to treat bde this process is a combination of three techniques namely electrocoagulation ozonation and peroxone process to understand the concept of electro peroxone process understanding of the basic principles of these three techniques are very important electrocoagulation is based on supply of direct current in water wastewater submerged metal plate generally iron or aluminium and this plate is well known as electrode waste water contains colloidal particles that possess negative charges 1 3 during the process metallic ions releases from the anode that combine with the negative ions consequently small colloids convert into the heavy flocks in form of metal hydroxide and settle down by virtue of gravity 5 equation 1 1 x m 3 y h 2 o m x o h y 3 x y y h ozonation process is effective pretreatment method for the remediation of the bio recalcitrant based waste water during the process bio refractory organics successfully converts into more readily biodegradable intermediates followed by biological degradation of these intermediates because ozone is very powerful oxidizing agent i e oxidation potential of ozone is 2 07 v hence it successfully reacts with the different organic compounds either directly as molecular ozone or indirectly through hydroxyl free radical generation 8 15 furthermore organics are present in the form of macromolecules which avoid effective biological oxidation when ozone is applied in this type of waste water macromolecules easily breakdown as a short chain intermediate products that can enter into cells and becomes easily biodegradable because biological oxidation rate increases with decrease in molecular size 15 moreover peroxone process is a type of aop for water wastewater treatment that is based on the combination of ozone and hydrogen peroxide during peroxone treatment highly persistent particles are formed which is known as hydroxyradicals oh these radicals react with or oxidize most organic pollutants present in a solution 16 apart from this the electro peroxone is a type of electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop which is based on the supply of o3 in electrocoagulation reactor which causes in situ hydrogen peroxide h2o2 production at the cathode to promote peroxone reaction and it offers successful treatment of water and wastewater in other words electro peroxone process is based on the supply of o3 into traditional electrocoagulation reactor where reactor is equipped with carbon based cathode 17 it is well known that ozone generators are unable to convert 100 oxygen in the form of ozone during the process the gas mixture o3 and o2 is sparged in the reactor hence h2o2 is produced electrochemically at the cathode by utilizing o2 which is the main product of the process 18 in other words this allows in situ generation of h2o2 at controlled rates with proper use of o2 in the presence of o3 and h2o2 following reaction occurs 19 2 o 3 h 2 o 2 o h o 2 o 2 3 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 4 h 2 o 2 h h o 2 5 h o 2 o 3 h o 2 o 3 as formed hydroxyl radicals are very powerful oxidants consequently most of the reluctant pollutants are easily oxidized at very high reaction rates hence high pollutants reduction efficiency can be achieved by the electro peroxone process in electro peroxone process ph plays important role for the overall reductions of pollutants the pollutants reduction varies with variation in ph because in the presence of hydroxide ions o3 decay occurs through following reactions 20 6 o 3 o h h o 2 o 2 7 o 3 h o 2 o h o 2 o 2 8 h o 2 o h o 2 h o h oxidative treatments are more effective in current water wastewater treatment technologies but it has several drawbacks for example during peroxone treatment addition of h2o2 enhances operating cost of the process and generation of large amount of sludge and its disposal etc 18 19 furthermore in the ozonation process bromate is formed when ozone reacts with naturally occurring bromide found in source water is major disadvantage of this process 16 electro peroxone process overcomes these problems in several ways in term of low sludge generation considerable reduction in operating cost by effectively avoiding bromate formation during the treatment of bromide containing water 19 almost no literatures has been reported for the treatment of distillery waste water using electro peroxone process however asaithambi et al 21 investigated the effect of ozone assisted electrocoagulation for the removal of cod and color from the distillery waste water using different combination of iron and aluminium electrode this work is based on the effect of several operating parameters such as initial ph initial cod concentration current density electrode gap and electrode combination towards organics removal it was reported that the maximum cod reduction of 83 and color reduction of 100 respectively was achieved at current density of 3 a dm2 initial cod concentration of 2500 mg dm3 initial ph 6 and at ozone gas mixture flow rate 15 dm3 min aziz et al 22 have treated distillery industrial effluent to reduce organic load in terms of the color and cod reduction by hybrid electrocoagulation process such as peroxi electrocoagulation photoelectrocoagulation ozone electrocoagulation and peroxi photo electrocoagulation process and by using electrocoagulation and ozonation process alone it was observed that hybrid electrocoagulation process had provided better cod reduction as compared to electrocoagulation and ozonation process alone the maximum removal efficiency achieved were 95 85 88 36 100 and 90 45 by using peroxi electrocoagulation process photo electrocoagulation process ozone electrocoagulation process and peroxi photo electrocoagulation process respectively after 240 min of reaction moreover ozonation process and electrocoagulation process had provided maximum cod reduction 18 75 and 81 30 respectively after 240 min of reaction therefore it is clearly evident that addition of other process is more effective than individual process alone orescanin et al 23 have proposed a two step treatment technique for the treatment of winery wastewater this technique is based on either using electrochemical followed by advanced oxidation process or sonication followed by advanced oxidation process maximum removal efficiencies of 99 were achieved for different parameter such the color turbidity suspended solids and phosphates the novelties of the present work includes the detailed literature review on treatment of bde using electro peroxone process and similar techniques the mechanism of electro peroxone is given in detail with updated information also the paper presents a detailed discussion about advantages disadvantages and limitations of electro peroxone process additionally the detailed study of operating parameters of the electro peroxone technique such as current density ozone concentration cathode material electrolyte and solution ph are also incorporated moreover this work reports application of novel electroperoxone process technique for the treatment of rice grain based distillery biodigester effluent bde for the very first time therefore in the present investigation this technique electro peroxone was chosen to treat the bde further the oh production during electro peroxone process was calculated by a terephthalic acid ta trapping technique 24 25 influence of operating parameters such as current density ozone concentration cathode material electrolyte and solution ph was studied on color and cod removal and on the basis of experimental results all operating parameter were optimized a comparative study on the removal of cod and color from the bde by electro peroxone and electrocoagulation was also presented 2 material and methods 2 1 materials the rice grain based distillery bde was obtained from chhattisgarh distillery pvt ltd kumhari chhattisgarh india the sample was collected once for whole experiments in the help two plastic containers 50 l each from biodigester unit biodigester is a waste water treatment unit where spent wash is treated already for this grab sampling was used collected sample was transported through institute vehicle the distance between institute and industry is around 10 km to maintain constant characteristics of bde the sample was stored at 4 c in a deep freezer the main characteristics of the original effluent are summarized in table 1 chemicals i e h2o2 h2so4 naoh and anhydrous alcohol and purity of these chemicals are 99 used are of analytical grade ar and purchased from the merck company mumbai india isaf n220 carbon black and polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe were also supplied by merck company mumbai india aluminium and titanium is purchased from the local market double distilled water was used in all the experiments made in laboratory 2 2 preparation of carbon ptfe cathode a mixture of polytetrafluoroethylene isaf n 220 carbon black and water in a volume ratio of 55 45 and anhydrous alcohol were used to prepare the carbon ptfe cathode 26 the removal of impurities from carbon black was done in three steps including boiling of carbon black in deionized water for 2 h then washing for few times and finely dried at 110 c with the help of an oven further 100 g of dried carbon black and 120 ml of ptfe water dispersion were mixed with calculated quantity of anhydrous alcohol with the help of an ultrasonic bath for 20 min after this whole mixture was mixed continuously with the help of water bath 80 c and at the same time alcohol was also evaporated now a cake of carbon ptfe was obtained and that was compressed to form a defined size of plate with the dimensions of 80 20 2 mm when two carbon ptfe plates were prepared it was compressed by nickel mesh with the same dimensions at a pressure of 20 mpa for 5 min to form a cathode finally this compressed cathode was treated in a muffle furnace at high temperature 350 c for 1 h and left to cool in the furnace 2 3 experimental setup the experimental setup consisted an electrocoagulation reactor perspex glass assisted with ozone generator for the present investigation is schematically shown in fig 1 i e effluent has been already biologically treated therefore sample can be directivity treated by electro peroxone method with the help of bubble diffuser the ozone was spread at the bottom of the reactor at a fixed flow rate of 70 dm3 h ozone was supplied by using an ozone generator ozonetek limited chennai the capacity of ozone generator was around 3 g h however during the electrocoagulation ozone was not spread in the reactor a pair of electrodes i e aluminum as an anode and carbon ptfe as a cathode were placed in a perspex glass reactor because the best treatment possibility is based on the balance between the hydroxyl radical generation and rate of organics degradation the detailed configuration of electrode and reactor is presented in table 2 the 1 dm3 bde is placed in the 1 2 dm3 perspex glass reactor for all the experiments the ph of the bde was adjusted by using h2so4 and naoh solutions the inter electrode gap was kept at 2 cm a gap of 3 cm was preserved between the bottom of the electrodes and the perspex glass to avail easy stirring to maintain the uniform concentration of perspex glass reactor magnetic stirrer was used after each experimental run the electrodes were reused for further experiment by cleaning with 12 hcl followed by distilled water to supply dc current electrodes were connected to a digital dc current range 0 5a voltage range 0 30 v power supply current density was adjusted by regulator the treated samples were collected at regular time intervals from perspex glass reactor during the experiments and subsequently filtered by whatman filter paper 42 for the measurement of cod and color reduction all the measurements were repeated three times to avoid any manual or instrumental error residue obtain after the electro peroxone treatment was dried and its calorific value was measured 2 4 analytical methods transferred ozone was determinate by iodometric method 27 in this method buffered iodine solution was added into the ozone contained sample consequently the amount of ozone present in the sample oxidizes and hence triiodide ions are liberating further reading shown in spectrophotometer is noted absorbance was measured at 352 nm after 30 min and compared to a calibration graph made with a stable iodine solution and the transferred ozone concentration was determined the strength of h2o2 in the effluent was analyzed by potassium titanium iv oxalate method in this method a 0 025 dm3 calibrated flask is used to take 5 ml of titanium reagent 28 and 5 ml of the sample and make up to the mark and then absorbance of the solution is measured at 400 nm for the blank measurement again a 0 025 dm3 calibrated flask is used to take 5 ml of titanium reagent 28 and 5 ml or as appropriate of the sample without the hydrogen peroxide make up to 25 ml is also measured at same wavelength then the h2o2 was calculated by following equation 28 29 h 2 o 2 absorbances of the sample absorbances of the blank solution volume sample path length of the spectrophotometer cell in centimetres 37 4 terephthalic acid ta trapping was used to determine oh concentration 24 25 in this method the hydroxyl radical was trapped by the direct addition reaction with terephthalic acid when ph of solution reaches 6 to 6 9 and this condition is achieved after 5 min of experimental run this terephthalic acid solution 1 5 mm was prepared in a phosphate buffer 6 8 10 4 m sodium hydroxide and 4 1 10 3 m sodium phosphate dibasic at a ph of 10 9 0 1 samples were collected at defined time interval during electro peroxone and put to a quartz fluorescence cell in the fluorimeter shimadzu spectrofluorophotometer rf 540 was used to measure the fluorescence electro peroxone treated solutions in the existence of terephthalate were examine fluorometrically by excitation at 310 nm with emission measured at 425 nm it should be noted that overdosing of terephthalic acid can influences the production of hydroxyl radicals oh in term of oh scavenges the proteins present in the solution were evaluated by the bradford method 30 the reduced carbohydrates were determined by the fehling method 31 the amount of lignin in samples was analyzed by the klason method 32 total carbon analyser shimadzu model toc vcsn was used to determine inorganic carbon organic carbon total carbon and dissolve carbon of the samples digital ph meter ei made india was used to measure the ph of the solutions the concentration of the metal ions in the filtrate is determined by using an atomic absorption spectrometer gbc model awanta australia 33 the chloride concentration was determined by the standard titrimetric volhard method 34 po4 3 was determinate by spectrophotometric absorbance where measured quantity of sample 1 0 ml conc h2so4 and 5 ml hno3 solution was digested by using a small kjeldahl flask further it was analyzed by 1 ml phenolphthalein and 1 n sodium hydroxide solution then sample was nutrilized by 4 0 ml molybedate reagent and 0 5 ml stannous chloride reagent and then its absorbance at 690 nm was noted using spectrophotometer and compared with standard calibration curve 33 total hardness of the solution is determinate by titrimetric analysis where known amount of sample is processed with buffer solution and titrated by edta solution 33 sulfate was determinate by gravimetric method where hydrochloric acid and 5 barium chloride were used as reagent 33 nitrate concentrations in the influent and effluent were measured using test merck spectroquant kit 14773 ammonium was determined by standard method as described in apha 33 terephthalic acid ta was detected by using hplc agilent 1100 with a diode array dad detector equipped with the agilent zorbax eclipse pah separation column at 220 nm wavelengths the movable phase was filled with acetonitrile with 0 1 formic acid and water 30 70 v v during the measurement the flow rate was maintained by 1 ml min and 1 Î¼l of the solution sample was inserted through auto sampler agilent 1100 it is noted that all samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 10 000 g before analysis 35 the bod 5 day of given sample was evaluated at 20 c by technique of standard dilution 33 in this technique airtight bod bottle was used to adopt 300 ml of sample and positioned it in incubator for 5 days at 20 c further amount of dissolved oxygen was measured initially and after 5 days of incubation the difference between the initial and final value of dissolved oxygen provided the value of bod total suspended solid was determinate by gravimetric test in this method a water sample is filtered residue was dried to a constant weight at 105 c 1 and weighed for determining the mass of the residue retained on the filter 33 the amount of total dissolve solid tds is the difference between the total solids i e this parameter is measured by evaporating a sample to dryness and weighing the sample and suspended solids content in the water sample 33 the cod were measured by a dichromatic closed reflux method with solution a contains mercury ii sulfate and solution b contains sulphuric acid potassium dichromate as per standard method 33 the color of the solution was evaluated by absorbance capacity at the wavelength Î»max 475 nm of the solution with the help of uv spectrophotometer 36 the cod reduction is evaluated by following equation 9 cod reduction cod 0 cod t cod 0 where cod0 is the initial cod value mg dm3 and codt is the cod value at any time t mg dm3 the percentage color reduction is evaluated by following equation 10 color reduction abe 0 abe t abe 0 where abe0 and abet are absorbance of effluent at initial and any reaction time t for

experiments were conducted for electrocoagulation and electro peroxone process electrocoagulation was operated at cd of 16 a m2 cod concentration of 6000 mg dm3 electrode gap of 2 cm with initial ph of 6 during electro peroxone o3 was sparged into the electrocoagulation reactor with the rate of 70 dm3 h at the same operating conditions as used in electrocoagulation the o3 concentration in bde was taken as 135 mg dm3 the percentage cod and color reduction during electrocoagulation and electro peroxone process are shown in fig 2 a and b the percentage of cod reduction by electrocoagulation and electro peroxone processes was found to be 52 1 and 84 3 respectively after 70 min of reaction additionally color reduction was observed as 35 8 and 65 3 respectively by electrocoagulation and electro peroxone process results indicate that electro peroxone process is much better than electrocoagulation in term of pollutants removal in the electrocoagulation process metallic ions are only driving force which adds with negative ions of different functional group present in organics 37 38 on the other hand during electro peroxone process h2o2 generates at cathode while o3 sparged through ozone generator thus in the presence of both reaction 3 4 and 5 occurs 19 38 39 above equation shows that very powerful oxidizing agents are generated during the reaction and hence pollutants gets easily oxidized 3 2 h2o2 and oh production in electro peroxone process as discussed earlier that h2o2 generates at the cathode which play important role to reduce reluctant pollutants therefore the production of h2o2 during electro peroxone process has been analyzed and presented in fig 3 a the investigation is performed at cd of 16 a m2 cod concentration of 6000 mg dm3 electrode gap of 2 cm ph of 6 o3 sparged rate of 70 dm3 h and o3 concentration of 135 mg dm3 it can be seen from fig 3 a that h2o2 production increased from 1 9 mg dm3 to 10 2 mg dm3 with increasing process time from 10 min to 50 min however with further increase in process time production rate of h2o2 is almost constant this may be due to cathode material carbon ptfe which supports oxygen towards h2o2 production up to a certain limit however excessive presence of oxygen does not get any proper platform for the production of h2o2 fig 3 b shows that oh production increases from 2 2 Î¼m to 11 9 Î¼m at 10 and 50 min of reaction time respectively this may be due to production of oh by the reaction between electro generated h2o2 and sparged o3 the oh concentration attained equilibrium after 50 min of reaction time however reaction between o3 and h2o2 is slow k 0 01 m1 s 1 but it involves fast conjugated base k 5 5 106 m1 s 1 39 hence large difference occurs in rate constants possibly o3 reacts with only ho2 form of h2o2 39 40 3 3 effect of different cathode selection of cathode is the key operational parameter for the electro peroxone process therefore the experiment was performed with different cathode material such as carbon ptfe and titanium it can be seen from fig 4 a and b that maximum cod and color reduction of 84 1 and 65 3 respectively was achieved using carbon ptfe as a cathode material at cd of 16 a m2 cod concentration of 6000 mg dm3 electrode gap of 2 cm ph of 6 o3 sparged rate of 70 dm3 h and o3 concentration of 135 mg dm3 whereas when titanium was used as cathode the maximum cod and color reduction observed were 67 8 and 51 8 respectively at the same operating condition as used for carbon ptfe cathode actually effective degradation of pollutants during electro peroxone process is based on the in situ production of h2o2 selection of more efficient cathode can easily generate h2o2 from oxygen as carbon based cathodes like carbon ptfe produce a significant quantity of h2o2 consequently substantial amount of oh but metal cathodes like titanium produce a lower amount of h2o2 because decay of h2o2 41 additionally carbon based cathodes have their excessive potential for h2 evolution and poor activity for h2o2 decay therefore it easily convert o2 to h2o2 42 3 4 effects of current density cd is yet another important parameter for electo peroxone process hence the effect of cd during the electro peroxane process was performed and presented in fig 5 a and b the cod reductions of 72 3 84 1 92 1 and 98 9 and color reduction of 53 6 65 3 71 3 and 80 1 respectively were achieved at cd of 8 a m2 16 a m2 24 a m2 and 32 a m2 during the experiments the operating condition maintained were cod concentration of 6000 mg dm3 electrode gap of 2 cm ph of 6 o3 sparged rate of 70 dm3 h and o3 concentration of 135 mg dm3 it is clear that cod and color reduction increases with increase in current density this may be due to the fact that current density can generates more aqueous oh while sufficient aqueous o3 is present in the media consequently oh actively participate in reaction with in situ generated h2o2 hence pollutants efficiently degrades through the electro peroxone process further experiments with higher cd were not performed due to the economic constraints however the pollutants reduction rate increases up to a certain limit of cd after that it decreases as also reported by several authors 43 44 this may be attributed to controlled oh production rate by the o3 transfer rate from gas phase to liquid phase as current density increases beyond a certain limit moreover it is well known fact that when cd increases hydrogen gas formation on the cathode also increases consequently hydrogen bubbles adhere on the surface of electrode causing lower transfer area and therefore less production of h2o2 and oh 44 3 5 effect of o3 doses the o3 dose is also a critical parameter during electro peroxone process therefore effect of inlet o3 concentration on the bde was investigated by o3 dose at varying concentrations of 45 100 and 135 mg dm3 other operating parameters like ph cd stirrer speed and cod concentration were kept constant the experimental results see fig 6 a and b shows that cod and color removal efficiency has increased with increasing inlet o3 concentration the cod reductions were found 72 8 92 3 and 98 9 respectively with 45 100 and 135 mg dm3 of inlet ozone concentration fig 6 a similarly color reductions were 56 1 70 2 and 80 1 respectively with 45 100 and 135 mg dm3 of inlet ozone concentration fig 6 b usually o3 concentration increases in gas phase are responsible to promotes the mass transfer of o3 to liquid phase from gas phase consequently higher oh productions rate occurs due to the reaction between aqueous o3 and in situ h2o2 produced by the cathode additionally when pure oxygen is sparged in the electrocoagulation reactor no significance cod and color reduction was observed as compared to electro peroxone process this may be due to the fact that pure oxygen only increases the availability of h2o2 to cathode side but for the production of oh both o3 and h2o2 are required 45 3 6 effect of ph initial ph of the solution is considered as a crucial parameter for electro peroxone process therefore to investigate the effect of ph on cod and color removal from the bde the ph of the solution was adjusted to various initial values ph 2 10 with the help of diluted h2so4 or naoh before applying electro peroxone process the experiment were performed with initial cod concentration of 6000 mg dm3 cd of 32 a m2 electrode gap of 2 cm stirrer speed of 100 rpm and ozone concentration 135 mg dm3 of h2o2 fig 7 a and b maximum cod and color reduction of 98 9 and 80 1 respectively was achieved at ph 6 even significant reduction in cod was also obtained up to 91 3 and 93 8 at ph 4 and ph 8 respectively however poor cod and color reduction was observed at ph 2 and ph 10 overall the reductions of pollutants are different at different ph because initiation of o3 decay occurs due to the presence of hydroxide ions as per reaction equation 6 7 and 8 20 additionally the pollutants removal efficiency depends on organic s structures and types of electrode materials and hence the role of ph for degradation of organics is very important for the electro peroxone processes 3 7 effect of electrolytes the above experiments were conducted without addition of any electrolytes it is reported that electrolytes significantly influences the electrochemical production of h2o2 46 therefore to investigate the effects of electrolytes during electro peroxone treatment of bde was performed in electrolyte solutions of nacl and na2so4 with different concentrations the result reflects that complete cod reduction 99 9 in 50 min and satisfactory color reduction 91 3 in 50 min were achieved with electrolyte of na2so4 concentration na2so4 0 15 m fig 8 a and b it is remarkable that additions of electrolytes significantly reduce the process time for the cod and color reduction additionally organic pollutants were removed more rapidly in na2so4 solutions as compared to the nacl this may be accounted to the generation of more h2o2 from sparged o2 by na2so4 electrolyte as compared to nacl thus use of na2so4 can generates more oh by the peroxone reaction due to reaction between h2o2 and sparged o3 as compared to nacl which leads higher organics reduction with na2so4 electrolyte 47 furthermore change in electrolyte concentrations 0 15 0 1 m for na2so4 and 0 3 0 15 m for nacl did not influence significantly the organic reduction because of no marginal change in h2o2 production fig 8 a and b as demonstrated by several researcher 46 48 the organic reduction rate slightly increases with increase in nacl concentration the reason for this may be that more concentrated nacl causes more cl that may be oxidized at the anode to form cl2 and hclo and hence more pollutants are oxidized 49 50 3 8 potential of electro peroxone process in organics removal this work elucidate that electro peroxone process is a more effective method to treat bde however most of the work reported is for treatment of synthetic waste water electro peroxone process has several advantages compared to conventional aops its ability to remove reluctant pollutants with the mechanism of adequate production of radical species and in situ generation of h2o2 without any chemical addition are main advantages of electro peroxone process recent studies 51 52 showed that this method is being employed to remove non biodegradable chemicals from the waste water additionally for the treatment of drinking water electro peroxone process can be safely used to avoid bromate formation that can t be done in ozonation process alone the comparison of electrocoagulation process with electro peroxone process has demonstrated that degradation efficiency of electro peroxone process is much better than traditional electrocoagulation process in tem of cod and color removal this process generates less sludge as compared to other aops that minimizes further treatment or disposal cost which is an additional advantage of electro peroxone process 3 9 cost analysis the cost estimation for plant capacity of 100 m3 bde day is done and presented in table 3 for the proper operation of treatment plant 10 m 10 m area is sufficient the cost estimation involves several factors like equipment installation electricity electrolytes sludge disposal labor and plant maintenance however the operating cost of electro peroxone process was estimated using three main parameters namely electrode consumption electrical energy consumption and chemical electrolyte consumption using following equation 21 53 55 13 operating cost a e t b e c c c c where et total electrical consumption in kwh m3 ec electrode consumption in kg m3 and cc chemical electrolyte consumption in kg m3 et can be calculated by equations 3 and 4 additionally a b and c are the unit price of electricity consumption 0 17 us kwh electrode material al 2 35 us kg and electrolyte na2so4 0 18 us kg respectively as per indian market at the optimum operating condition for electro peroxone process the current density 32 a m2 initial ph 6 0 inter electrode gap 2 cm anode cathode combination al carbon ptfe na2so4 concentration 0 15 m o3 flow rate 70 mg dm3 the energy electrode and chemical consumptions were found to be 3 8 kwh m3 0 48 kg m3 and 0 5 kg m3 respectively additionally maintenance labor and sludge transportation and disposal cost were also added from table 3 thus the estimated operating cost was found to be 2 0 us m3 cost analysis can also be done as per unit cod at the optimum condition cod reduced from 6 0 to 0 085 kg m3 i e the total cod reduction is 5 915 kg m3 therefore cost per unit cod reduction is 0 338 cod reduction where cod is in kg m3 it is well known that cost of effluent treatment depends on the type of pollutants and their concentration if the effluent contain high organic load then it should be treated in two or three stages which aggravate the treatment cost electro peroxone treatment method can be fully competitive with other technologies like coagulation electrocoagulation and other aops however the cost of the system depends on the organic load of the bde electro peroxone treatment need more cost as compared to coagulation electrocoagulation and other aops in term of fixed capital cost but it s pollutant removal efficiency is much higher while maintenance labor and sludge transportation and disposal cost is low electro peroxone treatment cost is limited to 1 1 2 9 m3 while coagulation electrocoagulation and other aops is limited to 1 3 4 6 m3 38 in general the price may increase by approximately 7 if bod removal increases from 40 to 50 38 3 10 sludge analysis though electro peroxone process generates less amount of sludge as compared to other aops yet its disposal and management is a great problem because it contains harmful organics and metals that can influences an aquatic system anode material is main source of metal content in sludge that can be extracted by several ways such as by acidic and alkaline extractions liquid ion exchange etc 56 57 the sludge can be consumed as a fuel if its calorific value is good hence the heating value of generated sludge was determined by bomb calorimeter and it was found to be 5 8 mj kg dry basis therefore it can be used as a fuel in the furnaces or incinerator in addition sludge can be also be used for manufacturing of bricks cementious mixtures fertilizer etc additionally sludge is basically a metal hydroxide therefore metal separation from the sludge could be a good economic choice 58 4 conclusions the results of this study demonstrated that electro peroxone process effectively removed pollutants from the bde evaluated in terms of cod and color removal electro peroxone works more effectively as compared to traditional electrocoagulation process electro peroxone process is based on a novel approach of in situ production of h2o2 using carbon ptfe as a cathode material it is also found that sludge production in electro peroxone process is lesser than other aops the h2o2 and oh concentration was observed to be 11 g dm3 and 12 5 Î¼m respectively during electro peroxone process results indicate that electro peroxone process is much better than electrocoagulation process which can remove 100 cod and 92 color from the bde it is recommended that the electro peroxone process can be used to treat different type of waste water to treat 1 m3 bde the estimated operating cost is 2 0 us thus it is more acceptable to treat bde in view of cost effectiveness author statement savita

8793,this study estimates the blue green and grey water footprints of dry onion production from the nigerian perspective the national average water footprint of dry onion production was 2475 7 cubic metres per tonne m3 t out of which 0 77 was green 97 16 blue and 2 07 grey dry onion production in katsina state used the lowest amount of water 1807 3 m3 t compared with kano state that used the highest 2800 6 m3 t annually dry onion production in nigeria consumes 3 36 109 and pollutes 0 07 109 m3 of freshwater the average annual water footprint including the pollution component related to dry onion export to other countries is 0 22 million m3 year this study provides important information for policy makers and planners farmers water managers food industries stakeholders in the onion markets and researchers keywords dry onion production blue water green water grey water water footprint nigeria 1 introduction onion allium cepa linn belonging to the amaryllidaceae family 1 is an important vegetable crop and one of the most widely used ingredients for condiments in sauces stews and soups between 2010 and 2018 the average annual global production of dry onion was 89 18 million tonnes t with an average annual yield of 18 74 t ha ha 2 table 1 illustrates the list of top 20 largest producers together accounting for about 80 6 of the global dry onion production in 2018 2 roughly 8 9 of the world s dry onion production were traded on the international markets between 2010 and 2018 3 representing the 16th largest producer after uzbekistan dry onion production in nigeria accounted for roughly 1 43 of the world production in 2018 table 1 the water used in the production of a crop and or crop products can significantly contribute to changes in the freshwater systems of the producing area being a less investigated crop from the water perspective this study quantifies the amount of freshwater used to cultivate dry onion in nigeria this includes the volume of dilution water associated with the use of nitrogen fertilizers in dry onion production crop production and or consumption often exert pressures on the freshwater resource of the production area in the case of dry onion its cultivation in nigeria is dependent on two major water sources rainwater green water and irrigation water drawn from surface and or subsurface water sources blue water besides being a limited resource this study argues that a failure to manage nigeria s freshwater may push the resource beyond its sustainable limits and possibly hinder the ability of the freshwater systems to perform their ecological functions already there are numerous cultural socio economic and environmental pressures affecting freshwater availability and supply in nigeria for example the internal renewable freshwater availability in nigeria is expected to decrease from 1800 in 2010 to 1100 cubic metres per capita m3 capita in 2030 4 with internal renewable freshwater availability below 1700 m3 capita 5 nigeria may be regarded as a freshwater scarce country by 2030 exacerbating these challenges which further justifies the motivation for this study issues such as climate change and climate variability freshwater pollution and demographic changes will continue to impact the sustainable management of water resources in nigeria it is expected that increased economic development and population growth as well as dietary changes and biofuel production from agricultural crops will further increase the demand for freshwater in nigeria estimates suggest that nigeria s annual mean precipitation is decreasing at a rate of 1 7 in 50 years while the annual mean air temperature is increasing at a rate of 3 0 in 50 years 4 this has implications for crop production and water resources management in nigeria however amidst all this the country s ability to sustainably meet present and future water needs will among others depend on a sound understanding of the impacts of crop production and or consumption on freshwater resources since agriculture is still the largest water user between 1987 and 2010 water for agriculture accounted for roughly 54 of the total freshwater withdrawal 6 with its resultant pressure on nigeria s surface and subsurface water sources this study therefore draws on the water footprint assessment to quantify how much pressure dry onion production and consumption exerts on nigeria s freshwater the water footprint a measure of water use 7 8 quantifies the total amount of freshwater used over the various production and or consumption steps of a good or service 9 10 this use can be broadly classified as consumptive and non consumptive or degradative freshwater use 11 many investigations have applied the water footprint assessment to quantify the amount of freshwater consumed by different crops and crop products during their production these include rice 12 tomato 13 14 tea and coffee 15 gari 16 pasta and pizza margherita 7 and cotton 17 the finding of this study will help key stakeholders for example farmers direct onion consumers indirect onion consumers such as food processors industries onion traders supermarkets water managers etc understand the impacts of dry onion production and or consumption on nigeria s freshwater resource it will also enable policymakers and planners be better informed on water issues associated with dry onion production in nigeria carry out water related risk assessments and to effectively manage vulnerable water resources in nigeria besides this the study also makes a secondary contribution to the body of research on pressures exerted by crops and crop products on freshwater resource to which the water footprint assessment has been applied thereby advancing the increasing body of knowledge needed to inform sustainable water management and realise greater water use efficiency as one of the value criteria or policy options to improve natural resource management a sound understanding of the impacts of crop production and or consumption is vital when making decisions on water governance in the face of increasing demand and dwindling freshwater resource already there is a growing understanding that one of the important drivers of global water shortage is not the physical scarcity of the resource but rather governance 18 21 as illustrated in table 2 dry onion is one of the high value vegetable crops in terms of domestic production area hervested and price in nigeria after tomato 1 1 data and method table 3 presents the dry onion producing areas in nigeria these areas accounting for nearly 100 99 97 of the total production were kaduna kano bauchi katsina sokoto borno nasarawa and gombe states the bulk of the dry onion producing areas originates from the northern part 1 1 other dry onion producing areas include jigawa kebbi plateau and adamawa but their production figures were not known and therefore excluded of nigeria table 3 and they fall within the sudan savanna and the northern guinea savanna agro ecological zones of nigeria in the major producing areas dry onion is mostly cultivated during the dry season this study considered the dry season farming being the main production period with higher yields and area under cultivation the calculation scheme used to quantify the water footprint of dry onion production in nigeria was based on the water footprint network wfn approach among others evangelou et al 13 sarma et al 23 and jordaan et al 24 are examples of studies that have employed the wfn methodology however as suggested by kim and kim 25 it is more appropriate to apply the wfn approach to agricultural related studies the dry season onion cultivation usually starts from october to december while harvesting commences from january the annual cycle of the dry period in the major production areas is between november and april because of a dearth of field level data the cropwat model cropwat 8 0 for windows developed by fao water was used to quantify the dry onion crop water requirement in the cropwat model to estimate the reference crop evapotranspiration eto the climate parameters of each of the major dry onion producing areas table 3 were taken from the climwat 2 0 database for cropwat the model estimated the eto data based on the penman monteith equation described in allen et al 27 monthly average eto data were distributed within the month in the model to obtain data per 10 days for a single cropped field per ha the cropwat model quantified the crop water requirement etc by multiplying the eto with the crop coefficient kc crop growth stage climate and crop variety are the major factors determining kc and responsible for why it varies over the crop s growing period 14 dry onion s kc values 0 7 initial 1 05 mid season 0 75 late and 0 4 m maximum crop height were obtained from allen et al 27 also from allen et al 27 and adjusted for the case of nigeria dry onion s length of development stages were taken as 15 days initial 25 days development and 50 days mid stage and 30 days late from sowing to harvest dry onion takes between 3 and 4 months the red type is the most popular variety grown in nigeria data on other important crop characteristics depletion coefficient rooting depth and yield response factor were obtained from fao 28 a mature dry onion bulb contains approximately 86 6 water 0 1 fat 1 2 protein 0 6 fibre 11 1 carbohydrate and 0 4 minerals it also contains phosphorus iron carotene thiamine and niacin in small quantities 29 in the cropping areas the soil moisture was met either by irrigation water supply or by effective rain defined as the part of rainwater stored in the soil as moisture and available for crop growth the monthly average rain data per cropping area were also obtained from the climwat database in the model the monthly average data on rain were distributed within the month to obtain data per 10 days while the united states department of agriculture soil conservation usda s c method was used to calculate the effective rain in cropwat model being dry season farming the contribution of capillary rise in the onion fields was assumed to be negligible although the root zone was taken as the unit of analysis the case of percolation water and seepage in the cropping areas was not considered in the model being losses to the plant but not a loss to the drainage basin to obtain the effective irrigation water supply defined as the part of irrigation water stored in the soil as moisture and available for crop growth the actual irrigation water to be supplied would be higher influenced by irrigation efficiency type of irrigation technology used and conveyance losses the cropwat model has some inbuilt options on soil parameters because the soil situations in the dry onion growing areas in nigeria were mixed the medium soil option in the fao database in cropwat was selected onion requires well drained medium textured soils with optimum ph of 6 7 and an optimum mean daily temperature ranging between 15 and 20 c 28 this study took a 10 day interval to compute effective rain and irrigation water requirements for all the 8 major growing areas the planting date in the cropwat model was set at end of november at any time step if crop water requirement exceeded green water availability it was assumed that the deficit was completely met by irrigation water supply otherwise the irrigation water supply became zero if the crop water requirement was met by the effective rain the cropwat model estimated the effective rain and the irrigation water requirement in terms of depth of water mm ha both were converted to volume per ha m3 ha by multiplying each with a factor of 10 because of the availability of irrigation water supply it was assumed that there was no deficit crop water requirement therefore crop water use was taken as equal to crop water requirement the overall green water use was determined by adding all the green water use per time step over the crop growing period in the case of blue water use it was assumed that the onion fields were 100 irrigated therefore the overall blue water use was calculated by adding all the blue water use per time step over the crop growing period the green water footprint of dry onion was estimated as the ratio of the overall green water use to the crop yield while the blue water footprint was estimated as the ratio of the overall blue water use to the crop yield these were calculated per major dry onion producing area data on dry onion annual production per unit land area or crop yield t ha were obtained from the faostat database averaged for the period 2010 to 2018 the value obtained was 3 3 t ha and assumed as representative of the major growing areas the application of nitrogen fertilizers and other agrochemicals for example insecticides pesticides etc is common in dry onion cultivation in nigeria the dilution or grey water footprint represents the quantity of freshwater required to dilute pollutants released during dry onion cultivation to the extent that the quality of the receiving water bodies agrees with the extant freshwater quality standards in this study the quantity of polluted water was calculated using nitrogen n as the representative indicator in general onions require a high source of n following chapagain and hoekstra 12 nitrate no3 loss was assumed to be 20 of the total n application while the n leached to freshwater bodies was taken as 10 of the n application rate this is a moderate approach 2 2 although the use of a fixed fraction that is 10 of the n application rates may give a satisfactory estimate of grey water footprint per tonne of dry onion in nigeria evangelou et al 13 chapagain et al 17 and mekonnen and hoekstra 49 are examples of studies that have applied the 10 n application rate to estimating the grey water footprint the assumed 10 n application rate offers a first rough estimate of the n loads in nigeria s freshwater bodies more so that agricultural practices at the smallholder farmers level are still inefficient in nigeria notwithstanding this for n application rates below 150 kg n ha the assumed 10 n loss to freshwater bodies could serve as a good proxy for estimating the grey water footprint 30 besides this where local or actual data are lacking scholars for example franke et al 31 and hedjuk and hedjuk 32 have suggested the use of 10 for n losses to freshwater bodies the maximum permissible limit of no3 in drinking water according to the nigerian standard for drinking water quality nis 554 2015 is 50 mg no3 per litre equivalent to 11 3 mg n per litre 32 33 however the united states environmental protection agency us epa 34 recommended limit of no3 in freshwater bodies is 10 mg l measured as n equivalent to 45 mg no3 per litre 13 14 since the two limits are close and being stricter considering the issue of eutrophication this study has used the us epa recommended limit in the case of nigeria there was a dearth of data on fertilizer consumption by crop data on actual application rate by farmers were also missing however drawing on the report of indorama fertilizer 35 and others fertilizer consumption covering nitrogenous phosphate and potash for dry onion production in nigeria was roughly estimated at 85 kg ha this value was roughly adopted for the case of dry onion farming in the major growing areas in nigeria it was roughly assumed that the onion crop and the cropping areas received the same amount of n fertilizer per ha 16 88 kg n ha therefore the grey water footprint per tonne of dry onion was determined by dividing the dilution water m3 ha with the crop yield t ha on a hectare basis the dilution water m3 ha was obtained from chapagain et al 17 as follows dilution water m 3 ha quantity of n leached to freshwater bodies t ha nitrate permissible limit in freshwater bodies t m 3 the dilution water volume m3 per major growing area was evaluated by multiplying the dilution water m3 ha with the cropping area ha the water pollution level wpl which measures the degree of pollution within a drainage basin was estimated as the ratio of the grey water footprint to the drainage basin runoff 11 36 37 the wpl illustrates the fraction of runoff required to dilute pollutants in order to meet extant water quality standards if wpl 1 the runoff s waste assimilation capacity has been fully consumed a wpl 1 indicates that the runoff is insufficient to assimilate the pollutants generated therefore the water quality standards have been violated 10 36 the water scarcity or the blue water scarcity value per drainage basin a measure of the sustainable blue water limits was obtained from hoekstra et al 38 as follows water scarcity value Î· Îµ Î¼ 100 where Î· is the blue water footprint m3 year Îµ is the drainage basin average total annual internally generated renewable surface water flow m3 year and Î¼ is the minimum annual environmental flow requirement m3 year the available blue water resource Îµ Î¼ is therefore the volume of runoff in a drainage basin that can be consumed without adverse ecological impacts since there was no data on the percentage or amount of internally generated renewable surface water flow allocated to the environment in nigeria this study adopted 60 of the average total annual internally generated renewable surface flow per drainage basin as the minimum environmental flow requirements as suggested by the organisation for economic co operation and development 39 the environment is totally stressed if the water scarcity value 100 available runoff fully consumed otherwise not if the water scarcity value 0 no consumption with blue water scarcity value 100 this suggests that the blue water footprint is lower than 40 of the drainage basin runoff and the reserved minimum environmental flow not violated the national average water footprint of dry onion production was computed by multiplying the average quantity of dry onion produced in nigeria between 2010 and 2018 t year with the average field level water footprint of dry onion production m3 t obtained in this study also the water footprint flows between nigeria and importing countries related to trade in dry onion were calculated by multiplying the average dry onion trade flows t year with the associated field level dry onion water footprint m3 t in nigeria data on international trade in dry onion were obtained from fao 3 averaged for the period 2010 2018 this study did not consider multiple cropping practices that might possibly exist in the growing areas also the initial or natural no3 concentrations in the dilution water were assumed negligible the total water footprint 30 32 of dry onion production m3 t was obtained by summing together the green the blue and the grey water footprints the blue and the green water footprints are referred to as the consumptive water footprint while the grey water footprint is referred to as the non consumptive or degradative water footprint the water footprint assessment holds that an impact on freshwater resource is established when the water consumed in the production and or consumption process of a particular crop product or service is not available for use elsewhere this therefore establishes a link between water use and the resultant subtractive impact on the freshwater bodies any unused soil moisture after cropping was excluded in the water footprint calculation however since the water footprint assessment method is sensititive to the input data used and assumptions made following the studies of schyns and hoekstra 40 mekonnen and hoekstra 41 hoff et al 42 and hoekstra et al 43 this study assumed uncertainty ranges of 20 for a n leaching fraction to freshwater bodies b crop yield and c possible changes in international trade it is assumed that changes in crop yield will affect domestic production volumes and export 2 results water footprint of dry onion production in nigeria from the cropwat model the calculated depth of water used in dry onion production in each of the 8 major growing areas in nigeria is illustrated in table 4 as shown in table 4 the field level consumptive green water use was lowest in katsina while the consumptive blue water use was highest in kano eto was highest in kano 6 58 mm day slightly higher than that of borno 6 50 mm day and lowest in kaduna 4 85 mm day the obtained eto values for the 8 major growing areas were mixed and did not correlate with any increase or decrease in latitude fertilizer use per ha in nigeria was among the lowest in the world in the analysis the study assumed a uniform fertilizer application rate and no3 loss to freshwater bodies for all the 8 major growing areas in nigeria therefore the calculated grey water footprint per cropping area was 51 2 m3 t however in terms of dilution water volume this varied from 2 79 lowest nasarawa to 19 50 million m3 highest kaduna per drainage basin that of lower niger ln drainage basin 47 5 was higher than that of lake chad lc drainage basin 23 4 million m3 the water footprint of dry onion production per growing area is presented in table 5 the calculated national average was 2475 7 m3 t table 5 as illustrated in table 5 the major impact of dry onion production in nigeria was mainly on the blue water resources at the national level the average blue water footprint represented about 97 2 of the total the green water footprint of onion production had little negative economic and environmental impacts in the major growing areas compared with the blue water footprint which had alternative uses therefore increasing the use of rainwater where possible will cause a decrease to blue water use and its associated economic and environmental impacts from an economic viewpoint this will among others reduce the cost of blue water abstraction and supply the environmental benefits are also high the unused blue water volume will remain within the drainage basin to sustain in stream river water use and other ecological functions this is more important in the lc drainage basin accounting for 33 of the dry onion growing areas where runoffs surface and subsurface have been diminishing and its likely contributory effect on the shrinking lake chad out of the four natural drainage basins in nigeria the lc drainage basin see fig 1 draining about 20 of nigeria s total land area has the lowest mean annual rainfall of 0 61 m year as well as internally generated renewable surface water flow of 7 2 109 m3 year with the average weight of one dry onion bulb equals to 101 38 27 4 g per bulb about 1 93 10 3 m3 of green water 0 24 m3 of blue water and 5 19 10 3 m3 of grey water or 0 25 m3 in total are responsible for its production in nigeria between 2011 and 2015 dry onion consumption in nigeria averaged 6 6 kg capita year 46 although not limited to nigeria onions can be consumed raw cooked eaten with food or used as an important seasoning in foods the per capita water footprint of dry onion consumption therefore translates to 16 3 m3 of water capita year the bulk of dry onion produced in nigeria is consumed internally from a sustainable production point of view dry onion production in the major growing areas in the ln drainage basin averaged 2429 2 m3 t exerted lesser pressure on freshwater resource compared with production in the lc drainage basin averaged 2671 5 m3 t the studies of ibÃ¡Ã±ez et al 47 and sarma et al 23 reported the water footprints of dry onion to be 260 m3 t in murcia spain and 230 21 m3 t in india respectively pÃ³sleman and garcÃ­a 48 estimated the water footprint of onion in the san juan province argentina to be 236 7 m3 t from a water perspective this suggests that onion is better produced in these countries than in nigeria compared with the global average value of 345 m3 t reported in mekonnen and hoekstra 41 the average dry onion water footprint value obtained in this study per tonne was 7 times larger although chapagain and orr 14 have criticised the use of national average climatic data for calculating water footprint climate soil cultivar and pollutant parameters as well as embedded assumptions directly affect water footprint calculations and may be responsible for the difference apart from this the relatively low dry onion yield period 2010 2018 in nigeria 3 3 t ha compared with for example india 16 2 argentina 26 5 or spain 52 8 t ha 2 was also an important contributory factor to the high dry onion water footprint value obtained in this study for the case of nigeria however as illustrated in table 5 the water footprint of dry onion production in katsina state 1807 3 m3 t was the lowest compared with kano state that had the highest 2800 6 m3 t this has important implications for policy and practice in relation to where dry onion could be better produced in nigeria from a water point of view the average total annual internally generated renewable surface runoff see fig 1 the wpl and the blue water scarcity value varied across the two drainage basins with the assumed n leaching fraction the total n loads to freshwater bodies in the lc and in the ln drainage basins were 233 7 t year and 474 5 t year respectively the grey water footprints within the lc and the ln drainage basins related to n were 23 4 and 47 5 million m3 year resulting in wpl values of 3 25 10 3 and 3 27 10 4 respectively table 6 although the wpl within the lc drainage basin was higher than that of the ln drainage basin table 6 runoffs pollutant assimilation capacities for n in the two drainage basins were not overused for the two drainage basins with wpl values 1 this indicates that there is enough runoff water to dilute the n pollutant to below the maximum limits despite being higher see table 6 the annual average blue water scarcity value of dry onion production in the lc drainage basin was also less than 100 however roughly 42 of the available 40 blue water resource were consumed in dry onion production in the lc drainage basin table 6 for the two drainage basins the blue water use in dry onion production has not exceeded the sustainable limits of the drainage basins freshwater systems drawing on data from the major growing areas table 5 on average per annum dry onion production consumes about 3 36 109 m3 of nigeria s freshwater and uses an additional 0 07 109 m3 of freshwater to dilute the emitted n to permissible limits in the case of exports nigeria is not a major dry onion exporting country however between 2010 and 2018 an average of 88 6 t year accounting for 7 64 10 3 per cent of the dry onion produced in nigeria were consumed in other countries 3 these countries 3 3 the share of the external water footprint per importing country could not be calculated due to a dearth of data on the quantity of dry onion imported or exported from nigeria include ghana togo benin and congo exporting dry onion from nigeria to other countries resulted in freshwater transfer of 0 22 million m3 per year the calculation indicates that international trade in dry onion evaporates 0 215 million m3 of freshwater each year with an additional 0 005 million m3 of freshwater being polluted per year in nigeria as illustrated in table 7 the input data used were sensitive to the assumptions made for example the national average water footprint of dry onion production in nigeria decreased by 0 35 with 20 increase in n leaching fraction to freshwater bodies while it increased by 0 51 when the n leaching fraction to freshwater bodies decreased by 20 changes in national average crop yield by 20 led to various changes in the values of grey water footprint wpl and water scarcity however should international trade be affected by changes in demand or domestic production volumes international freshwater transfer due to dry onion export is expected to increase by 19 6 with 20 increase in export volume table 7 as revealed in table 7 these results indicate that the measured parameters are sensitive to the assumptions made on n leaching fraction to freshwater bodies average crop yield and export volume 2 1 implications for policy and practice as highlighted earlier this study has important implications for developing relevant policy measures related to dry onion production and water resources management in nigeria as noted there was no specific policy on dry onion production in nigeria unlike the tomato policy published in 2017 both the agricultural policy for nigeria formulated in 2001 and the national policy on food and nutrition in nigeria produced in 2016 made no specific reference to dry onion production in addition to this the two policy documents had no information with respect on the need to minimise the production impacts of crops and crop products on freshwater resource however an outcome of this study has shown that the average water footprint of dry onion production is relatively higher in the lc drainage basin than in the ln drainage basin this knowledge apart from the need to inform policy development should also inform the development of agricultural cropping zones in nigeria with a view to promoting water use efficiency and minimising the contributions of crops and crop products to water scarcity and ecological stress both irrigation water and rain water are necessary for dry onion cultivation in nigeria however since onion production in the major growing areas depends more on blue water resource this offers the possibility of encouraging the cultivation of dry onion in the ln drainage basin in nigeria dry onion cultivation is mostly carried out in the sudan savanna and the northern guinea savanna where freshwater is rather scarce the lc drainage basin is the most freshwater deficient in nigeria compared with the ln drainage basin average annual precipitation 0 61 m year is relatively lower while average annual potential evapotranspiration 1 347 m year is relatively higher in the lc drainage basin fig 1 dry onion production national average water footprint can be reduced by shifting production from the lc drainage basin to the ln drainage basin both rain water and evapotranspiration are part of the soil water balance because of the uneven distribution of freshwater and climatic parameters the impacts of dry onion production on freshwater resource are not the same in the ln and in the lc drainage basins shifting about 50 of dry onion production from the lc to the ln drainage basin will lead to about 0 6 109 m3 of freshwater saved reducing the blue water scarcity value to 20 73 in addition commencing cultivation as from september or cessation of the raining season in the ln drainage basin could make dry onion production benefit more from green water use thereby reducing the need to abstract freshwater from surface and or subsurface water sources this is crucial because the opportunity costs of blue water resources are generally higher since dry onion production is mostly carried out during the dry season in nigeria its contribution to freshwater scarcity is also relatively high therefore the practice aspect should a encourage the production of dry onion in the ln drainage basin particularly in kaduna and katsina states and b inform how to minimise blue water consumption per unit of crop produced given the same management practices should there be a need to cover the costs of water pollution and water scarcity in dry onion production the unit cost of dry onion production in the lc drainage basin may be higher 2 2 study limitation all studies suffer from some sorts of weaknesses in terms of actual data availability 49 the paucity of actual data can bias research results and increase uncertainties in this study a number of assumptions were made due to a lack of field data these assumptions are likely to affect the estimation of the green blue and grey water footprints and other calculated parameters for example a fixed planting date was assumed for all the dry onion growing areas in the model leaving out local variations in planting and harvesting dates as well as yield this assumption may lead to an underestimation of dry onion production water footprint in some cropping areas and an overestimation in some others the grey water footprint assessment evaluates pollution from an ecosystem perspective and facilitates a better understanding of the relationship between water quantity and water quality data on n application rates were not available for the cropping areas it was assumed that the dry onion growing areas received the same n application rate therefore this study has used a simple model with a fixed n leaching fraction leaving out the effects of local factors such as soil conditions methods of fertilization application application rates and crop management including irrigation practices on the quantity of n leached into the freshwater bodies there is also a possibility that many of the smallholder farmers may likely use less or no fertilizer this therefore suggests that the actual n leached value which is cropping area specific needs to be evaluated more importantly the results of sensitivity analysis table 7 have shown that the national average water footprint the wpl and the blue water scarcity values were sensitive to n leaching fraction it is important to highlight that this study has used n as the representative indicator to evaluate the grey water footprint per tonne of dry onion however the effects of water pollution through phosphorous and other chemicals are also very important the results of the n grey water footprint estimation cannot be transferred to the phosphorus grey water footprint which requires further study since all the leachable chemicals to freshwater bodies were not accounted for in this study the results of the grey water footprint should be seen as underestimated therefore the grey water footprint value per tonne of dry onion presented in this study should be taken with caution since actual data are not easily obtainable the information presented in this study does not speak about the sustainable water limits of each of the major dry onion growing areas the opportunity costs of water use or the livelihood implications of freshwater use on the dry onion farmers in nigeria a further analysis is required to expose whether water use in dry onion production in each of the growing areas has exceeded the sustainable limits of their freshwater systems notwithstanding the stated assumptions which may limit the accuracy of the results this study establishes a first estimate of the national water footprint of dry onion production and consumption in nigeria readers should be aware of this and interpret the findings of this study within the context of this limitation however when applied with caution the results of this study can be useful for policy development integrated water resources development and management and awareness generation it can also help policy makers farmers and water managers to address water scarcity issues sustainable water use and river basin water resources development and management plans 3 conclusions this study has shown how much freshwater is abstracted locally in the production of dry onion and how much freshwater is required to dilute polluted flows on an annual basis a crucial information from water footprint is to illustrate to policy makers water managers key stakeholders in the dry onion markets the quantity of freshwater resource on which dry onion production and or consumption as well as trade depends an awareness of the impacts of crop production and or consumption on freshwater resources will enable policy makers and planners initiate the necessary changes and policy measures to mitigate stress and freshwater scarcity and serve as a vital tool to improving freshwater governance in the major growing areas dry onion is mostly cultivated during the dry season therefore its contribution to freshwater scarcity is relatively high since growers depend more on blue water resources as noted the impacts of dry onion cultivation on blue water resource are relatively higher in the lc drainage basin than in the ln drainage basin the grey water footprint values the wpl and the blue water scarcity values varied between the two drainage basins although for both drainage basins that the wpl values were 1 does not guarantee the absence of eutrophication this is because this study did not account for the initial no3 concentration in the receiving water bodies it should be noted that the pollutant assimilation capacity of freshwater sysstems is limited this calls for appropriate fertilizer and crop management practices that limit the grey water footprint per tonne of crop production although the annual average blue water scarcity values for the two drainage basins were less than 100 about 42 of the available 40 blue water resources were consumed in dry onion production in the lc drainage basin increasing crop production in the lc drainage basin may lead to blue water use exceeding the sustainable limits of the drainage basin freshwater systems notwithstanding the assumptions made the results of this study hold an important message for policy makers farmers and water

8793,this study estimates the blue green and grey water footprints of dry onion production from the nigerian perspective the national average water footprint of dry onion production was 2475 7 cubic metres per tonne m3 t out of which 0 77 was green 97 16 blue and 2 07 grey dry onion production in katsina state used the lowest amount of water 1807 3 m3 t compared with kano state that used the highest 2800 6 m3 t annually dry onion production in nigeria consumes 3 36 109 and pollutes 0 07 109 m3 of freshwater the average annual water footprint including the pollution component related to dry onion export to other countries is 0 22 million m3 year this study provides important information for policy makers and planners farmers water managers food industries stakeholders in the onion markets and researchers keywords dry onion production blue water green water grey water water footprint nigeria 1 introduction onion allium cepa linn belonging to the amaryllidaceae family 1 is an important vegetable crop and one of the most widely used ingredients for condiments in sauces stews and soups between 2010 and 2018 the average annual global production of dry onion was 89 18 million tonnes t with an average annual yield of 18 74 t ha ha 2 table 1 illustrates the list of top 20 largest producers together accounting for about 80 6 of the global dry onion production in 2018 2 roughly 8 9 of the world s dry onion production were traded on the international markets between 2010 and 2018 3 representing the 16th largest producer after uzbekistan dry onion production in nigeria accounted for roughly 1 43 of the world production in 2018 table 1 the water used in the production of a crop and or crop products can significantly contribute to changes in the freshwater systems of the producing area being a less investigated crop from the water perspective this study quantifies the amount of freshwater used to cultivate dry onion in nigeria this includes the volume of dilution water associated with the use of nitrogen fertilizers in dry onion production crop production and or consumption often exert pressures on the freshwater resource of the production area in the case of dry onion its cultivation in nigeria is dependent on two major water sources rainwater green water and irrigation water drawn from surface and or subsurface water sources blue water besides being a limited resource this study argues that a failure to manage nigeria s freshwater may push the resource beyond its sustainable limits and possibly hinder the ability of the freshwater systems to perform their ecological functions already there are numerous cultural socio economic and environmental pressures affecting freshwater availability and supply in nigeria for example the internal renewable freshwater availability in nigeria is expected to decrease from 1800 in 2010 to 1100 cubic metres per capita m3 capita in 2030 4 with internal renewable freshwater availability below 1700 m3 capita 5 nigeria may be regarded as a freshwater scarce country by 2030 exacerbating these challenges which further justifies the motivation for this study issues such as climate change and climate variability freshwater pollution and demographic changes will continue to impact the sustainable management of water resources in nigeria it is expected that increased economic development and population growth as well as dietary changes and biofuel production from agricultural crops will further increase the demand for freshwater in nigeria estimates suggest that nigeria s annual mean precipitation is decreasing at a rate of 1 7 in 50 years while the annual mean air temperature is increasing at a rate of 3 0 in 50 years 4 this has implications for crop production and water resources management in nigeria however amidst all this the country s ability to sustainably meet present and future water needs will among others depend on a sound understanding of the impacts of crop production and or consumption on freshwater resources since agriculture is still the largest water user between 1987 and 2010 water for agriculture accounted for roughly 54 of the total freshwater withdrawal 6 with its resultant pressure on nigeria s surface and subsurface water sources this study therefore draws on the water footprint assessment to quantify how much pressure dry onion production and consumption exerts on nigeria s freshwater the water footprint a measure of water use 7 8 quantifies the total amount of freshwater used over the various production and or consumption steps of a good or service 9 10 this use can be broadly classified as consumptive and non consumptive or degradative freshwater use 11 many investigations have applied the water footprint assessment to quantify the amount of freshwater consumed by different crops and crop products during their production these include rice 12 tomato 13 14 tea and coffee 15 gari 16 pasta and pizza margherita 7 and cotton 17 the finding of this study will help key stakeholders for example farmers direct onion consumers indirect onion consumers such as food processors industries onion traders supermarkets water managers etc understand the impacts of dry onion production and or consumption on nigeria s freshwater resource it will also enable policymakers and planners be better informed on water issues associated with dry onion production in nigeria carry out water related risk assessments and to effectively manage vulnerable water resources in nigeria besides this the study also makes a secondary contribution to the body of research on pressures exerted by crops and crop products on freshwater resource to which the water footprint assessment has been applied thereby advancing the increasing body of knowledge needed to inform sustainable water management and realise greater water use efficiency as one of the value criteria or policy options to improve natural resource management a sound understanding of the impacts of crop production and or consumption is vital when making decisions on water governance in the face of increasing demand and dwindling freshwater resource already there is a growing understanding that one of the important drivers of global water shortage is not the physical scarcity of the resource but rather governance 18 21 as illustrated in table 2 dry onion is one of the high value vegetable crops in terms of domestic production area hervested and price in nigeria after tomato 1 1 data and method table 3 presents the dry onion producing areas in nigeria these areas accounting for nearly 100 99 97 of the total production were kaduna kano bauchi katsina sokoto borno nasarawa and gombe states the bulk of the dry onion producing areas originates from the northern part 1 1 other dry onion producing areas include jigawa kebbi plateau and adamawa but their production figures were not known and therefore excluded of nigeria table 3 and they fall within the sudan savanna and the northern guinea savanna agro ecological zones of nigeria in the major producing areas dry onion is mostly cultivated during the dry season this study considered the dry season farming being the main production period with higher yields and area under cultivation the calculation scheme used to quantify the water footprint of dry onion production in nigeria was based on the water footprint network wfn approach among others evangelou et al 13 sarma et al 23 and jordaan et al 24 are examples of studies that have employed the wfn methodology however as suggested by kim and kim 25 it is more appropriate to apply the wfn approach to agricultural related studies the dry season onion cultivation usually starts from october to december while harvesting commences from january the annual cycle of the dry period in the major production areas is between november and april because of a dearth of field level data the cropwat model cropwat 8 0 for windows developed by fao water was used to quantify the dry onion crop water requirement in the cropwat model to estimate the reference crop evapotranspiration eto the climate parameters of each of the major dry onion producing areas table 3 were taken from the climwat 2 0 database for cropwat the model estimated the eto data based on the penman monteith equation described in allen et al 27 monthly average eto data were distributed within the month in the model to obtain data per 10 days for a single cropped field per ha the cropwat model quantified the crop water requirement etc by multiplying the eto with the crop coefficient kc crop growth stage climate and crop variety are the major factors determining kc and responsible for why it varies over the crop s growing period 14 dry onion s kc values 0 7 initial 1 05 mid season 0 75 late and 0 4 m maximum crop height were obtained from allen et al 27 also from allen et al 27 and adjusted for the case of nigeria dry onion s length of development stages were taken as 15 days initial 25 days development and 50 days mid stage and 30 days late from sowing to harvest dry onion takes between 3 and 4 months the red type is the most popular variety grown in nigeria data on other important crop characteristics depletion coefficient rooting depth and yield response factor were obtained from fao 28 a mature dry onion bulb contains approximately 86 6 water 0 1 fat 1 2 protein 0 6 fibre 11 1 carbohydrate and 0 4 minerals it also contains phosphorus iron carotene thiamine and niacin in small quantities 29 in the cropping areas the soil moisture was met either by irrigation water supply or by effective rain defined as the part of rainwater stored in the soil as moisture and available for crop growth the monthly average rain data per cropping area were also obtained from the climwat database in the model the monthly average data on rain were distributed within the month to obtain data per 10 days while the united states department of agriculture soil conservation usda s c method was used to calculate the effective rain in cropwat model being dry season farming the contribution of capillary rise in the onion fields was assumed to be negligible although the root zone was taken as the unit of analysis the case of percolation water and seepage in the cropping areas was not considered in the model being losses to the plant but not a loss to the drainage basin to obtain the effective irrigation water supply defined as the part of irrigation water stored in the soil as moisture and available for crop growth the actual irrigation water to be supplied would be higher influenced by irrigation efficiency type of irrigation technology used and conveyance losses the cropwat model has some inbuilt options on soil parameters because the soil situations in the dry onion growing areas in nigeria were mixed the medium soil option in the fao database in cropwat was selected onion requires well drained medium textured soils with optimum ph of 6 7 and an optimum mean daily temperature ranging between 15 and 20 c 28 this study took a 10 day interval to compute effective rain and irrigation water requirements for all the 8 major growing areas the planting date in the cropwat model was set at end of november at any time step if crop water requirement exceeded green water availability it was assumed that the deficit was completely met by irrigation water supply otherwise the irrigation water supply became zero if the crop water requirement was met by the effective rain the cropwat model estimated the effective rain and the irrigation water requirement in terms of depth of water mm ha both were converted to volume per ha m3 ha by multiplying each with a factor of 10 because of the availability of irrigation water supply it was assumed that there was no deficit crop water requirement therefore crop water use was taken as equal to crop water requirement the overall green water use was determined by adding all the green water use per time step over the crop growing period in the case of blue water use it was assumed that the onion fields were 100 irrigated therefore the overall blue water use was calculated by adding all the blue water use per time step over the crop growing period the green water footprint of dry onion was estimated as the ratio of the overall green water use to the crop yield while the blue water footprint was estimated as the ratio of the overall blue water use to the crop yield these were calculated per major dry onion producing area data on dry onion annual production per unit land area or crop yield t ha were obtained from the faostat database averaged for the period 2010 to 2018 the value obtained was 3 3 t ha and assumed as representative of the major growing areas the application of nitrogen fertilizers and other agrochemicals for example insecticides pesticides etc is common in dry onion cultivation in nigeria the dilution or grey water footprint represents the quantity of freshwater required to dilute pollutants released during dry onion cultivation to the extent that the quality of the receiving water bodies agrees with the extant freshwater quality standards in this study the quantity of polluted water was calculated using nitrogen n as the representative indicator in general onions require a high source of n following chapagain and hoekstra 12 nitrate no3 loss was assumed to be 20 of the total n application while the n leached to freshwater bodies was taken as 10 of the n application rate this is a moderate approach 2 2 although the use of a fixed fraction that is 10 of the n application rates may give a satisfactory estimate of grey water footprint per tonne of dry onion in nigeria evangelou et al 13 chapagain et al 17 and mekonnen and hoekstra 49 are examples of studies that have applied the 10 n application rate to estimating the grey water footprint the assumed 10 n application rate offers a first rough estimate of the n loads in nigeria s freshwater bodies more so that agricultural practices at the smallholder farmers level are still inefficient in nigeria notwithstanding this for n application rates below 150 kg n ha the assumed 10 n loss to freshwater bodies could serve as a good proxy for estimating the grey water footprint 30 besides this where local or actual data are lacking scholars for example franke et al 31 and hedjuk and hedjuk 32 have suggested the use of 10 for n losses to freshwater bodies the maximum permissible limit of no3 in drinking water according to the nigerian standard for drinking water quality nis 554 2015 is 50 mg no3 per litre equivalent to 11 3 mg n per litre 32 33 however the united states environmental protection agency us epa 34 recommended limit of no3 in freshwater bodies is 10 mg l measured as n equivalent to 45 mg no3 per litre 13 14 since the two limits are close and being stricter considering the issue of eutrophication this study has used the us epa recommended limit in the case of nigeria there was a dearth of data on fertilizer consumption by crop data on actual application rate by farmers were also missing however drawing on the report of indorama fertilizer 35 and others fertilizer consumption covering nitrogenous phosphate and potash for dry onion production in nigeria was roughly estimated at 85 kg ha this value was roughly adopted for the case of dry onion farming in the major growing areas in nigeria it was roughly assumed that the onion crop and the cropping areas received the same amount of n fertilizer per ha 16 88 kg n ha therefore the grey water footprint per tonne of dry onion was determined by dividing the dilution water m3 ha with the crop yield t ha on a hectare basis the dilution water m3 ha was obtained from chapagain et al 17 as follows dilution water m 3 ha quantity of n leached to freshwater bodies t ha nitrate permissible limit in freshwater bodies t m 3 the dilution water volume m3 per major growing area was evaluated by multiplying the dilution water m3 ha with the cropping area ha the water pollution level wpl which measures the degree of pollution within a drainage basin was estimated as the ratio of the grey water footprint to the drainage basin runoff 11 36 37 the wpl illustrates the fraction of runoff required to dilute pollutants in order to meet extant water quality standards if wpl 1 the runoff s waste assimilation capacity has been fully consumed a wpl 1 indicates that the runoff is insufficient to assimilate the pollutants generated therefore the water quality standards have been violated 10 36 the water scarcity or the blue water scarcity value per drainage basin a measure of the sustainable blue water limits was obtained from hoekstra et al 38 as follows water scarcity value Î· Îµ Î¼ 100 where Î· is the blue water footprint m3 year Îµ is the drainage basin average total annual internally generated renewable surface water flow m3 year and Î¼ is the minimum annual environmental flow requirement m3 year the available blue water resource Îµ Î¼ is therefore the volume of runoff in a drainage basin that can be consumed without adverse ecological impacts since there was no data on the percentage or amount of internally generated renewable surface water flow allocated to the environment in nigeria this study adopted 60 of the average total annual internally generated renewable surface flow per drainage basin as the minimum environmental flow requirements as suggested by the organisation for economic co operation and development 39 the environment is totally stressed if the water scarcity value 100 available runoff fully consumed otherwise not if the water scarcity value 0 no consumption with blue water scarcity value 100 this suggests that the blue water footprint is lower than 40 of the drainage basin runoff and the reserved minimum environmental flow not violated the national average water footprint of dry onion production was computed by multiplying the average quantity of dry onion produced in nigeria between 2010 and 2018 t year with the average field level water footprint of dry onion production m3 t obtained in this study also the water footprint flows between nigeria and importing countries related to trade in dry onion were calculated by multiplying the average dry onion trade flows t year with the associated field level dry onion water footprint m3 t in nigeria data on international trade in dry onion were obtained from fao 3 averaged for the period 2010 2018 this study did not consider multiple cropping practices that might possibly exist in the growing areas also the initial or natural no3 concentrations in the dilution water were assumed negligible the total water footprint 30 32 of dry onion production m3 t was obtained by summing together the green the blue and the grey water footprints the blue and the green water footprints are referred to as the consumptive water footprint while the grey water footprint is referred to as the non consumptive or degradative water footprint the water footprint assessment holds that an impact on freshwater resource is established when the water consumed in the production and or consumption process of a particular crop product or service is not available for use elsewhere this therefore establishes a link between water use and the resultant subtractive impact on the freshwater bodies any unused soil moisture after cropping was excluded in the water footprint calculation however since the water footprint assessment method is sensititive to the input data used and assumptions made following the studies of schyns and hoekstra 40 mekonnen and hoekstra 41 hoff et al 42 and hoekstra et al 43 this study assumed uncertainty ranges of 20 for a n leaching fraction to freshwater bodies b crop yield and c possible changes in international trade it is assumed that changes in crop yield will affect domestic production volumes and export 2 results water footprint of dry onion production in nigeria from the cropwat model the calculated depth of water used in dry onion production in each of the 8 major growing areas in nigeria is illustrated in table 4 as shown in table 4 the field level consumptive green water use was lowest in katsina while the consumptive blue water use was highest in kano eto was highest in kano 6 58 mm day slightly higher than that of borno 6 50 mm day and lowest in kaduna 4 85 mm day the obtained eto values for the 8 major growing areas were mixed and did not correlate with any increase or decrease in latitude fertilizer use per ha in nigeria was among the lowest in the world in the analysis the study assumed a uniform fertilizer application rate and no3 loss to freshwater bodies for all the 8 major growing areas in nigeria therefore the calculated grey water footprint per cropping area was 51 2 m3 t however in terms of dilution water volume this varied from 2 79 lowest nasarawa to 19 50 million m3 highest kaduna per drainage basin that of lower niger ln drainage basin 47 5 was higher than that of lake chad lc drainage basin 23 4 million m3 the water footprint of dry onion production per growing area is presented in table 5 the calculated national average was 2475 7 m3 t table 5 as illustrated in table 5 the major impact of dry onion production in nigeria was mainly on the blue water resources at the national level the average blue water footprint represented about 97 2 of the total the green water footprint of onion production had little negative economic and environmental impacts in the major growing areas compared with the blue water footprint which had alternative uses therefore increasing the use of rainwater where possible will cause a decrease to blue water use and its associated economic and environmental impacts from an economic viewpoint this will among others reduce the cost of blue water abstraction and supply the environmental benefits are also high the unused blue water volume will remain within the drainage basin to sustain in stream river water use and other ecological functions this is more important in the lc drainage basin accounting for 33 of the dry onion growing areas where runoffs surface and subsurface have been diminishing and its likely contributory effect on the shrinking lake chad out of the four natural drainage basins in nigeria the lc drainage basin see fig 1 draining about 20 of nigeria s total land area has the lowest mean annual rainfall of 0 61 m year as well as internally generated renewable surface water flow of 7 2 109 m3 year with the average weight of one dry onion bulb equals to 101 38 27 4 g per bulb about 1 93 10 3 m3 of green water 0 24 m3 of blue water and 5 19 10 3 m3 of grey water or 0 25 m3 in total are responsible for its production in nigeria between 2011 and 2015 dry onion consumption in nigeria averaged 6 6 kg capita year 46 although not limited to nigeria onions can be consumed raw cooked eaten with food or used as an important seasoning in foods the per capita water footprint of dry onion consumption therefore translates to 16 3 m3 of water capita year the bulk of dry onion produced in nigeria is consumed internally from a sustainable production point of view dry onion production in the major growing areas in the ln drainage basin averaged 2429 2 m3 t exerted lesser pressure on freshwater resource compared with production in the lc drainage basin averaged 2671 5 m3 t the studies of ibÃ¡Ã±ez et al 47 and sarma et al 23 reported the water footprints of dry onion to be 260 m3 t in murcia spain and 230 21 m3 t in india respectively pÃ³sleman and garcÃ­a 48 estimated the water footprint of onion in the san juan province argentina to be 236 7 m3 t from a water perspective this suggests that onion is better produced in these countries than in nigeria compared with the global average value of 345 m3 t reported in mekonnen and hoekstra 41 the average dry onion water footprint value obtained in this study per tonne was 7 times larger although chapagain and orr 14 have criticised the use of national average climatic data for calculating water footprint climate soil cultivar and pollutant parameters as well as embedded assumptions directly affect water footprint calculations and may be responsible for the difference apart from this the relatively low dry onion yield period 2010 2018 in nigeria 3 3 t ha compared with for example india 16 2 argentina 26 5 or spain 52 8 t ha 2 was also an important contributory factor to the high dry onion water footprint value obtained in this study for the case of nigeria however as illustrated in table 5 the water footprint of dry onion production in katsina state 1807 3 m3 t was the lowest compared with kano state that had the highest 2800 6 m3 t this has important implications for policy and practice in relation to where dry onion could be better produced in nigeria from a water point of view the average total annual internally generated renewable surface runoff see fig 1 the wpl and the blue water scarcity value varied across the two drainage basins with the assumed n leaching fraction the total n loads to freshwater bodies in the lc and in the ln drainage basins were 233 7 t year and 474 5 t year respectively the grey water footprints within the lc and the ln drainage basins related to n were 23 4 and 47 5 million m3 year resulting in wpl values of 3 25 10 3 and 3 27 10 4 respectively table 6 although the wpl within the lc drainage basin was higher than that of the ln drainage basin table 6 runoffs pollutant assimilation capacities for n in the two drainage basins were not overused for the two drainage basins with wpl values 1 this indicates that there is enough runoff water to dilute the n pollutant to below the maximum limits despite being higher see table 6 the annual average blue water scarcity value of dry onion production in the lc drainage basin was also less than 100 however roughly 42 of the available 40 blue water resource were consumed in dry onion production in the lc drainage basin table 6 for the two drainage basins the blue water use in dry onion production has not exceeded the sustainable limits of the drainage basins freshwater systems drawing on data from the major growing areas table 5 on average per annum dry onion production consumes about 3 36 109 m3 of nigeria s freshwater and uses an additional 0 07 109 m3 of freshwater to dilute the emitted n to permissible limits in the case of exports nigeria is not a major dry onion exporting country however between 2010 and 2018 an average of 88 6 t year accounting for 7 64 10 3 per cent of the dry onion produced in nigeria were consumed in other countries 3 these countries 3 3 the share of the external water footprint per importing country could not be calculated due to a dearth of data on the quantity of dry onion imported or exported from nigeria include ghana togo benin and congo exporting dry onion from nigeria to other countries resulted in freshwater transfer of 0 22 million m3 per year the calculation indicates that international trade in dry onion evaporates 0 215 million m3 of freshwater each year with an additional 0 005 million m3 of freshwater being polluted per year in nigeria as illustrated in table 7 the input data used were sensitive to the assumptions made for example the national average water footprint of dry onion production in nigeria decreased by 0 35 with 20 increase in n leaching fraction to freshwater bodies while it increased by 0 51 when the n leaching fraction to freshwater bodies decreased by 20 changes in national average crop yield by 20 led to various changes in the values of grey water footprint wpl and water scarcity however should international trade be affected by changes in demand or domestic production volumes international freshwater transfer due to dry onion export is expected to increase by 19 6 with 20 increase in export volume table 7 as revealed in table 7 these results indicate that the measured parameters are sensitive to the assumptions made on n leaching fraction to freshwater bodies average crop yield and export volume 2 1 implications for policy and practice as highlighted earlier this study has important implications for developing relevant policy measures related to dry onion production and water resources management in nigeria as noted there was no specific policy on dry onion production in nigeria unlike the tomato policy published in 2017 both the agricultural policy for nigeria formulated in 2001 and the national policy on food and nutrition in nigeria produced in 2016 made no specific reference to dry onion production in addition to this the two policy documents had no information with respect on the need to minimise the production impacts of crops and crop products on freshwater resource however an outcome of this study has shown that the average water footprint of dry onion production is relatively higher in the lc drainage basin than in the ln drainage basin this knowledge apart from the need to inform policy development should also inform the development of agricultural cropping zones in nigeria with a view to promoting water use efficiency and minimising the contributions of crops and crop products to water scarcity and ecological stress both irrigation water and rain water are necessary for dry onion cultivation in nigeria however since onion production in the major growing areas depends more on blue water resource this offers the possibility of encouraging the cultivation of dry onion in the ln drainage basin in nigeria dry onion cultivation is mostly carried out in the sudan savanna and the northern guinea savanna where freshwater is rather scarce the lc drainage basin is the most freshwater deficient in nigeria compared with the ln drainage basin average annual precipitation 0 61 m year is relatively lower while average annual potential evapotranspiration 1 347 m year is relatively higher in the lc drainage basin fig 1 dry onion production national average water footprint can be reduced by shifting production from the lc drainage basin to the ln drainage basin both rain water and evapotranspiration are part of the soil water balance because of the uneven distribution of freshwater and climatic parameters the impacts of dry onion production on freshwater resource are not the same in the ln and in the lc drainage basins shifting about 50 of dry onion production from the lc to the ln drainage basin will lead to about 0 6 109 m3 of freshwater saved reducing the blue water scarcity value to 20 73 in addition commencing cultivation as from september or cessation of the raining season in the ln drainage basin could make dry onion production benefit more from green water use thereby reducing the need to abstract freshwater from surface and or subsurface water sources this is crucial because the opportunity costs of blue water resources are generally higher since dry onion production is mostly carried out during the dry season in nigeria its contribution to freshwater scarcity is also relatively high therefore the practice aspect should a encourage the production of dry onion in the ln drainage basin particularly in kaduna and katsina states and b inform how to minimise blue water consumption per unit of crop produced given the same management practices should there be a need to cover the costs of water pollution and water scarcity in dry onion production the unit cost of dry onion production in the lc drainage basin may be higher 2 2 study limitation all studies suffer from some sorts of weaknesses in terms of actual data availability 49 the paucity of actual data can bias research results and increase uncertainties in this study a number of assumptions were made due to a lack of field data these assumptions are likely to affect the estimation of the green blue and grey water footprints and other calculated parameters for example a fixed planting date was assumed for all the dry onion growing areas in the model leaving out local variations in planting and harvesting dates as well as yield this assumption may lead to an underestimation of dry onion production water footprint in some cropping areas and an overestimation in some others the grey water footprint assessment evaluates pollution from an ecosystem perspective and facilitates a better understanding of the relationship between water quantity and water quality data on n application rates were not available for the cropping areas it was assumed that the dry onion growing areas received the same n application rate therefore this study has used a simple model with a fixed n leaching fraction leaving out the effects of local factors such as soil conditions methods of fertilization application application rates and crop management including irrigation practices on the quantity of n leached into the freshwater bodies there is also a possibility that many of the smallholder farmers may likely use less or no fertilizer this therefore suggests that the actual n leached value which is cropping area specific needs to be evaluated more importantly the results of sensitivity analysis table 7 have shown that the national average water footprint the wpl and the blue water scarcity values were sensitive to n leaching fraction it is important to highlight that this study has used n as the representative indicator to evaluate the grey water footprint per tonne of dry onion however the effects of water pollution through phosphorous and other chemicals are also very important the results of the n grey water footprint estimation cannot be transferred to the phosphorus grey water footprint which requires further study since all the leachable chemicals to freshwater bodies were not accounted for in this study the results of the grey water footprint should be seen as underestimated therefore the grey water footprint value per tonne of dry onion presented in this study should be taken with caution since actual data are not easily obtainable the information presented in this study does not speak about the sustainable water limits of each of the major dry onion growing areas the opportunity costs of water use or the livelihood implications of freshwater use on the dry onion farmers in nigeria a further analysis is required to expose whether water use in dry onion production in each of the growing areas has exceeded the sustainable limits of their freshwater systems notwithstanding the stated assumptions which may limit the accuracy of the results this study establishes a first estimate of the national water footprint of dry onion production and consumption in nigeria readers should be aware of this and interpret the findings of this study within the context of this limitation however when applied with caution the results of this study can be useful for policy development integrated water resources development and management and awareness generation it can also help policy makers farmers and water managers to address water scarcity issues sustainable water use and river basin water resources development and management plans 3 conclusions this study has shown how much freshwater is abstracted locally in the production of dry onion and how much freshwater is required to dilute polluted flows on an annual basis a crucial information from water footprint is to illustrate to policy makers water managers key stakeholders in the dry onion markets the quantity of freshwater resource on which dry onion production and or consumption as well as trade depends an awareness of the impacts of crop production and or consumption on freshwater resources will enable policy makers and planners initiate the necessary changes and policy measures to mitigate stress and freshwater scarcity and serve as a vital tool to improving freshwater governance in the major growing areas dry onion is mostly cultivated during the dry season therefore its contribution to freshwater scarcity is relatively high since growers depend more on blue water resources as noted the impacts of dry onion cultivation on blue water resource are relatively higher in the lc drainage basin than in the ln drainage basin the grey water footprint values the wpl and the blue water scarcity values varied between the two drainage basins although for both drainage basins that the wpl values were 1 does not guarantee the absence of eutrophication this is because this study did not account for the initial no3 concentration in the receiving water bodies it should be noted that the pollutant assimilation capacity of freshwater sysstems is limited this calls for appropriate fertilizer and crop management practices that limit the grey water footprint per tonne of crop production although the annual average blue water scarcity values for the two drainage basins were less than 100 about 42 of the available 40 blue water resources were consumed in dry onion production in the lc drainage basin increasing crop production in the lc drainage basin may lead to blue water use exceeding the sustainable limits of the drainage basin freshwater systems notwithstanding the assumptions made the results of this study hold an important message for policy makers farmers and water managers in nigeria to ensure that freshwater is used efficiently author statement o adeoti conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing

livestock farming and the overall agricultural industry which leads to an elevated level of impacts to the surrounding environment 1 2 such impacts call for a greater degree of coordinated efforts from the food industry to consider how livestock farming can viably generate food products while minimizing its environmental influences 3 4 to meet the requirements of a sustainable future the australian pork industry represented by its peak body the australian pork limited apl has invested over the last decade towards innovative technologies and processes in conserving resources and reducing carbon footprint in australia s pork production process with the aim that the success of these explorations will positively impact the global understanding in sustainable livestock farming which contributes to the overall resource management in the primary industry two key areas of focus are effluent and water management and the corresponding utilization of the byproduct biogas 5 6 as needed by the specific geographical and climate nature of australia that has challenging issues with access to quality water resources including pathogen contamination 7 and its national drought that can potentially be the most severe drying for the last 400 years 8 plus the manure treatment generated biogas that has been proven to be an effective method to conserve energy usage and cost on farms and possible corresponding manure bourne pathogens that may possess risks to public health 9 in particular if the re using the effluent water is part of the sustainability plan 10 these issues are not standalone in australia but rather global challenges in many other countries primary industries 11 this work will discuss a specific technological solution for water treatment and biogas integration in livestock effluent management in the context of australia however the information provided shall be widely applicable to other parts of the world that share similar concerns to address the issues mentioned above apl has funded several theoretical and practical studies to examine potential water reuse technologies that can be applied in the current situations to solve problems faced by the country such as water sterilization and purification biogas integration etc especially for contaminated water to become reusable on pig farms as water prices in australia have been rising steadily over the past years and farmers pay very uneven amounts across the country 12 according to a non public study commissioned by apl 13 which examined the possible applications of currently available water technologies both thermal and membrane based technologies have been demonstrated to not fit the purposes of the pig farmers in summary 64 of australia s pig farms own less than 100 pigs and such number is even higher 81 in the united states as shown by the usda 14 which calls for water management and recycling systems to be scalable that suit the smaller farms thermal processes such as multi stage flash and multi effect distillation typically require treatments of several thousand to half a million cubic meters per day to be economical and often with the addition of excess industry heat wastes to reduce the energy costs 15 on the other hand popular membrane based technologies such as reverse osmosis and electrodialysis which can be scaled down to suit the needs of small farms but often possess strong technical challenges to farmers for maintenance of membranes 16 and can be expensive to operate 17 with these considerations in mind an innovative and emerging technology the hot bubble column evaporator hbce 18 was identified to be fit for purpose for both of its scalability and simple engineering that are required by the pork industry the hbce utilizes its heat transfer efficiency to inactivate waterborne pathogens for water reuse without the need for boiling 19 it does so by transferring heat from the hot bubbles of 1 3 mm of diameter to the pathogen surfaces through collisions while keeping the water at low temperature 18 20 the heat transfer rate between liquid and gas is 100 times more efficient in a gas liquid bubble column than in a single phase flow according to decker 21 however though promising hbce that successfully inactivated viruses and bacteria using different hot gases 18 to date has not been industrially applied in livestock farming and effluent management whether for manure water treatment sterilization of contaminated water 22 or integration of biogas as a potential energy source the research team here aims to design and implement an industry applicable system hbpp hot bubble pilot plant utilizing the principles of hbce lab scale hot bubble column evaporator from our previous work to address sustainability issues faced by the australian pork industry and with the hope that the application can widely benefit and provide insights for the primary industry resource management globally this offers a new attractive energy efficient alternative to disinfect the wastewater produced by the industry on top of that the technology can be applied to other industries and sites with abundant waste heat from combustion gases such as landfills and power plants as the hot exhaust combustion gases can be used as the main input of the hbpp sterilization treatment what plays a role in establishing a circular economy 2 materials and methods 2 1 e coli c 3000 atcc15597 for stage 1 laboratory experiments escherichia coli is a gram negative bacterium found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals with a straight cylindrical rod shape 0 5 1 0 Î¼m diameter and 1 0 2 0 Î¼m in length 23 most e coli strains are harmless but some like the ones that produce shiga toxin can be pathogenic causing severe foodborne disease 24 e coli presence in water is used to monitor fecal contamination 25 one such harmful strain is e coli c 3000 atcc15597 which is a biosafety level 1 organism 26 it was selected as a representative model for bacterial contamination in water during the stage 1 of this project laboratory experiments 27 28 the plate count method see section 2 3 was employed to measure the e coli c 3000 atcc15597 inactivation during this stage spinks at al 29 proved that pathogenic bacteria are inactivated in a temperature range of 55 c 65 c e coli presents the first signs of thermal inactivation at temperatures over 55 c achieving high inactivation rates at 60 c 30 2 2 experimental solutions in stage 1 two different solutions were prepared and both were sterilized by autoclaving in an aesculap 420 at 15 psi and 121 124 c for 15 min 31 the first solution was secondary treated synthetic sewage synthetic s prepared according to iso 11733 water quality guidelines the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd standards 32 33 and the official journal of the european community for secondary treated water quality which recommends the following values for discharges from urban wastewater treatment plants 125 mg l of cod 15 mg l of total nitrogen and 2 mg l of total phosphorus 34 our synthetic s was designed to meet european standards by using the following compounds 120 mg of peptone 90 mg of meat extract replaced here by bovril according to recommendations in biology of wastewater treatment 35 30 mg of urea 13 mg of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 7 mg of sodium chloride 2 mg of calcium chloride dehydrate and 2 mg of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in a liter of boiled tap water the second solution a synthetic piggery water synthetic p was prepared following the oecd medium procedure with a composition based on the analytical results of piggery effluent see supplementary data i 628 mg l of bod 52 5 mg l of total phosphorus 2 100 mg l of total nitrogen 1 520 mg l of sodium 156 mg l of calcium and 59 9 mg l of magnesium the synthetic p solution was made with the following ingredients in a liter of boiled tap water 836 mg of peptone 557 3 mg of meat extract again replaced by bovril 4 506 mg of urea 300 mg of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 3 863 mg of sodium chloride 572 mg of calcium chloride dehydrate and 607 mg of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in a liter of boiled tap water for both solutions the tap water was previously boiled for 30 min to ensure that all chlorine was removed from the water therefore e coli c 3000 was not affected by the disinfecting action of chlorine in stage 2 the pilot plant was installed at the piggery farm using real piggery effluent for the sterilization experiments 2 3 excherichia medium for experiments in stage 1 the plate count method is commonly used for the detection of e coli in treated drinking water wastewater and marine water the water quality is assessed based on the ability of bacteria colonies to grow on a layer of agar producing colony forming units cfu 36 for each laboratory experiment two solutions were prepared a and b solution a was prepared with 13 g of tryptone 1 g of yeast extract 6 g of nacl and 1 000 ml of milli q water this solution was aseptically dispensed into two vessels with agar 1 41 and without agar the agar used in the experiments was molecular biology grade from sigma aldrich the solid media solution a with agar was heated to boiling to dissolve the agar and sterilized by autoclaving for 15 min in an aesculap 420 at 15 psi and 121 124 c solution b improved the viability of the bacteria it was prepared by adding 0 010 g of thiamine and 1 g of glucose to 50 ml of milli q water and filter sterilized by passing through a 0 22Î¼m filter once solution a cooled to 50 c solution b was added aseptically in a proportion of 1 19 the resulting 1 34 agar solid media after mixing solutions a and b was poured into 100 mm 15 mm petri dishes which were placed within the sterile field area around the bunsen burner created by the updraft of the flame 37 2 4 the hot bubble pilot plant hbpp the hbpp can treat 3 5 l of influent per minute and the design see fig 1 contemplates a modular layout that offers the possibility of connecting two pilot plants in series or parallel which can potentially be extended to an increased number of plant units for downstream commercial applications the experiment used an a 120lm aeroflow air pump that constantly supplied 130 l of air minute this air was heated with an electrical heater lhs 15 leister the heater maintained the air temperature just above the ceramic sinter surface at 130 c 185 c and 215 c for different experiments respectively the base of the rectangular stainless steel pilot plant was fitted with a half cylinder shaped ceramic sinter the ceramic sinter had a length of 500 mm and a diameter of 150 mm the pore size was 40 100 Î¼m with 30 43 porosity see fig 1 once contaminated solutions e g synthetic s and p or real piggery effluent were poured into the pilot plant their temperature was measured with a thermocouple in the center of the ceramic sinter hot gases either air or combustion gases were introduced into the hot gas chamber at a flow rate of 130 l min these hot gases formed bubbles that when ascending in the contaminated liquid inactivated different types of pathogens the top of the pilot plant was fitted with a settlement condenser tank that kept the lower surface of the condenser at 12 16 c this facilitated the recovery of high quality water through the condensation of the water vapor in the saturated gas onto the internal surface 2 5 disinfection experiments the disinfection experiments were conducted in two different stages stage 1 applied hbpp in a university s laboratory environment and stage 2 installed the hbpp at a real piggery to test the results in practical situations during stage 1 the hbpp treated synthetic s and synthetic p containing escherichia coli c 3000 atcc15597 with inlet air at three different temperatures 130 c 185 c and 215 c plus inlet combustion exhaust gas from an greenpower gp2200 lpg generator at 47 c for additional study and test the plate count method 37 39 was used to assess the viability of e coli samples of 1 3 ml were collected from 10 to 15 mm above the central area of the plant during stage 2 at the piggery the plant sterilized real piggery effluent in two experiments with different hot inlet gases the first one using 130 l min of combustion gas at 115 c from the greenpower gas generator the exhaust pipe of the gas generator was attached to an insulated metal pipe on the hbpp the second one using air at 175 c from an hiblow hp 120 air blower that supplied 130 l min of air which was heated with lesier lhs 15 air heater piggery effluent contains different types of naturally occurring bacteria and protozoa to assess the hbpp performance piggery effluent was sampled before and after the treatments and analyzed in an accredited laboratory see supplementary data i 2 6 data analysis the decay linear model was used to study the inactivation of e coli overtime during stage 1 laboratory experiments plate counts were performed for all 19 21 plates from each of the experiments the mean and standard deviation of each triplicated sample were obtained using bacteria survival factor log10 cfut cfu0 where cfu0 is the initial number of colony forming units cfu per sample and cfut is the cfu per sample after a set exposure time in minutes 40 the decimal reduction time d value was used to measure the temperature impact on escherichia coli c 3000 atcc15597 this can also be defined as the time needed to inactivate 90 i e 1 log of e coli or heat resistance z value measures the temperature change required to increase or reduce the d value by a factor of 10 d values and z values were calculated using a linear exponential decay model or thermal death model 41 1 log c f u t l o g c f u 0 t d 2 log c f u t c f u 0 t d where c f u t is the number of colonies at time t c f u 0 the initial number of colonies 1 d the slope of the curve d the decimal reduction time the z value represents the increase in temperature needed to reduce the d value by 1 log it measures the impact of a change in temperature on e coli inactivation thus 3 z t 1 t 2 l o g d 1 l o g d 2 where t1 first temperature of the interval t2 second temperature of the interval and d1 and d2 are the d values at t1 and t2 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli inactivation efficiency hbpp vs hbce the hbce process inactivates waterborne pathogens with less thermal energy than traditional methods such as boiling 19 this is because hbce uses hot gas bubbles in which the specific heat capacity per unit of weight cp of air is four times lower than that of water temperatures of the hot gas and the contaminated solution within the hbce will equilibrate during the process to produce a steady state temperature however the practical application of such a process requires additional industry design to make it fit for purpose to be used in a real environment e g a piggery findings from our previous work 18 22 42 established the data needed to design the new hbpp and proved that it is technically feasible to extend this process from bench scale to a pilot plant the new hbpp has been designed as a scaled down version of a possible final commercial plant table 1 shows cfu counts and inactivation values from e coli c 3000 for both experimental setups hbpp and hbce after an exposure time at different inlet air temperatures thermal inactivation of e coli is dependent both on the duration of the treatment and temperature of exposure thermal calculations consequently require the need for knowledge of the thermal resistance and concentration of e coli c 3000 and the time temperature relationship required for their inactivation thermal death curve plots show the correlation between the log of the d values and the corresponding temperatures fig 2 decimal reduction times d values table 2 calculated from inactivation values have been used to compare the e coli inactivation performance of the hbce with that of the hbpp d values measure the time in minutes at a given temperature required to inactivate 90 of e coli z values table 2 are calculated from d values as equation 3 they reflect the heat resistance of a microorganism the smaller the z value the greater its sensitivity to heat fig 2 compares the impact of inlet gas temperature on e coli inactivation between hbpp and hbce d values from both hbce and hbpp at different temperature points were used to calculate z values for hbpp z 48 3 and for hbce z 81 3 which show that the inactivation in the pilot plant was less temperature dependent than in the glass bubble column fig 2 for inlet air temperatures in the range 100 170 c the hbce presented higher e coli inactivation rates than the hbpp with d values of 65 3 min at 100 c for the hbce and 55 min at 130 c for the hbpp at higher inlet gas temperatures 170 215 c the hbpp presented better inactivation with only 1 09 min at 215 c whereas hbce needed 3 89 min to achieve 1 log e coli inactivation at 200 c fig 2 and table 2 for both hbce and hbpp e coli inactivations can be increased by raising the air inlet temperature 3 2 stage 1 hbpp laboratory experiments e coli c 3000 inactivation in two different types of synthetic effluent during stage 1 the hbpp was operated at the university laboratories under a controlled environment the fundamental mechanism of inactivation is the collision between dispersed pathogens and hot air bubbles 43 when hot air bubbles at 130 c 185 c or 215 c form on the surface of the ceramic sinter see fig 1 a thin layer of heated water is transiently formed around the surface of the bubbles while the solution temperature is kept at 40 c 49 c or 52 c respectively e coli is rapidly inactivated at temperatures above 60 c 29 so the hot air bubbles will effectively thermally inactivate the bacteria if the temperature of the bubbles and the transient water film is greater than 60 c the hbpp experiments were conducted at the university laboratories under a controlled environment using 3 5 l of either synthetic s or synthetic p which were treated with hot air at different temperature points when the hot air bubbles at 130 c rose through the synthetic s only a 0 44 log reduction of e coli was achieved after 20 min of treatment for an inlet air temperature of 185 c the inactivation increased to 3 log after 6 min of treatment at 215 c air inlet temperature e coli from the synthetic piggery effluent reached 2 5 log inactivation after 2 2 min when the inlet air temperature increases so does the temperature of the hot water layer around the bubbles consequently the inactivation rate becomes more effective as observed in fig 3 and table 1 combustion gas from a generator was used to inactivate e coli in 3 5 l of synthetic p after 20 min only a 0 01 log reduction was achieved fig 3 the combustion gas on the surface of the sinter only reached 47 c which is not a high enough temperature to thermally inactivate the e coli in the hbpp 3 3 stage 2 field test hbpp farm deployment treating real piggery effluent 3 3 1 piggery effluent chemical and physical parameters piggery effluent is usually biologically stabilized by storing it in one or more anaerobic ponds before its disposal onto agricultural land 44 different water samples from the piggery pond at the farm were analyzed in an accredited laboratory to establish the nutrient content for the synthetic p used in stage 1 the piggery effluent is used to clean the facilities then digested for 7 days in a bioreactor anaerobic reactor to generate methane and later settled in a pond for 5 days before it is reused again in the facilities the water analytics showed high electrical conductivity 25 600 Î¼s cm and a ph of 8 17 high values of turbidity 1 160 ntu total solids 13 200 mg l and suspended solids 2 300 mg l were also obtained a very high organic load total organic carbon 3 380 mg l biochemical oxygen demand bod 628 mg l total nitrogen as n 2 100 mg l and high salinity chloride 1 270 mg l sodium 1 520 mg l were observed due to the continuous reuse of the water for cleaning the piggeries see supplementary data i for more detail 3 3 2 piggery effluent biological parameters it has been a known issue that intensive livestock farming such as dairy piggery and poultry can sometimes give rise to pathogen issues this could have implications for food safety and health conditions if not managed appropriately piggery effluents of 13 farms in queensland australia have been used to identify the most common bacterial e coli salmonella campylobacter thermotolerant coliforms arcobacter spp and protozoan giardia and cryptosporidium indicator organisms and establish their levels 45 als laboratories analyzed the effluent samples from the piggery obtaining the following results thermo tolerant fecal coliforms 1 100 cfu 100ml e coli 660 cfu 100ml salmonella detected adenovirus 440 l protozoan giardia cysts 200 l cryptosporidium oocysts 1800 l and very high numbers of cyanophyta 25 930 cells ml see supplementary data i for more details these results show that if these gastrointestinal pathogens are inhaled or swallowed at the infective dose they could initiate an infection on humans 46 or animals with the consequent reduction in production efficiency 3 3 3 hbpp operation with piggery effluent at the farm the livestock industry often integrates biogas as part of its effluent management scheme 47 which provides large amounts of hot combustion gases that can be reused to produce hot bubbles in the hbpp for water sterilization pig farms in australia treat effluent minimally before its reuse in agriculture or production such as splashing and cleaning piggeries that can potentially cause harm by spreading pathogens 48 to test the new process two pilot plants were installed at the farm to sterilize 3 5 l of piggery effluent each during 20 min one using combustion gas at 115 c as inlet gas and another one with hot air at 175 c see fig 4 three samples of real piggery effluent were analyzed in an accredited laboratory als see results in supplementary data ii one sample before the pilot plant treatments the raw piggery water and the other two after 20 min of treatment with two different inlet gases hot air and hot combustion gases based on the preliminary piggery effluent characterization the following waterborne pathogens were selected for this study salmonella e coli thermotolerant coliforms cyanophyta giardia and cryptosporidium when hot air at 175 c was used as inlet gas in the pilot plant a 3 26 log reduction for thermotolerant fecal coliforms and e coli was achieved and salmonella was not detected other species like cyanophyta were also inactivated reaching 0 66 log reduction hot combustion gas at 115 c presented lower inactivation rates with 0 06 log reduction for cyanophyta and 0 05 log for thermotolerant fecal coliforms and e coli salmonella was still detected table 3 different studies 49 50 have identified cyanophyta as a significant threat to the health of humans and other animal species the toxins produced by cyanophyta can affect all vertebrates during summer months the numbers of cyanophyta in water can increase rapidly this impacts many activities such as increasing the risk of reactional use of water and reducing the efficiency in wastewater treatment plants the hbpp achieved 0 66 log reduction of cyanophyta with hot air at 175 c and 0 06 log with hot combustion gases at 115 c giardia and cryptosporidium can cause infections that range from simple gastroenteritis to a life threatening outcome in immunocompromised individuals 51 protozoa spores oocysts and cysts from giardia and cryptosporidium were successfully inactivated in the pilot plant achieving 0 22 log and 0 67 log reduction respectively when the inlet air temperature reached 175 c but not inactivation was observed for combustion gases at 115 c table 3 chlorine is the most frequently used disinfectant in drinking water but has very little effect on cryptosporidium and giardia sterilization 52 thermal treatments can successfully inactivate giardia achieving more than 2 logs reduction after 10 min of treatment in a solution at 64 c 53 and cryptosporidium with more than 3 4 log after 5 min of treatment in a solution at 60 c 54 therefore the hbpp poses a viable alternative to chlorine for protozoa inactivation when the inlet gas temperature is at least 175 c these results prove that the new hbpp offers a viable water sterilization technology that can sterilize different types of bacteria 50 and protozoa spores in the most heavily infected waters inlet gas temperature is the key variable needed to improve the performance of the plant combustion gas can be successfully used in the plant if its temperature is increased by for example improving the insulation or the design 3 4 the economic viability of the hbpp compared with other sterilization technologies given normal variations in factors such as climate population water use type of water and location the energy requirement to treat water to the necessary level is in the range of 0 05 5 kwh m3 55 for example the energy requirements for pumping equipment in rainwater harvesting technologies will be around 0 3 1 3 kwh m3 and for water reuse around 0 2 2 5 kwh m3 depending on the capacity pumping and needs on water quality 55 among all the different water disinfection technologies chlorination is used most extensively because it is cheap 0 05 kwh m3 56 and easy to operate however it does present several limitations for example it typically requires at least 30 min of contact time and is not able to inactivate protozoa like giardia and cryptosporidium 57 also chlorine can react with organic matter and often forms disinfection by products dbps that are hazardous to humans if the water is reused in agriculture more than 5 ppm of chlorine can cause plant injury such as foliar burning in some species 58 consequently many countries are moving to non chlorine based treatment methods such as uv irradiation and ozone 59 despite other limitations that these methods have ozone systems need a moderate contact time and are complex to operate and maintain rotaviruses can be resistant to uv irradiation treatment and its efficiency can be affected by dissolved inorganics and organics in the wastewater as well as its color and turbidity 57 in stage 1 the hbpp treated 3 5 l of synthetic piggery water in 1 09 min table 2 therefore the theoretical limit of the plant is around 4 600 l day with an energy requirement of 0 89 kw h 0 12 kw for the air pump and 0 77 kw for the air heater which gives an energy use of about 4 6 kwh m3 when the inlet air is heated with better insulation and bigger plant capacity the energy cost is projected to reduce to 1 2 kwh m3 this value is still far from the 0 05 kwh m3 for uv irradiation and the 0 3 kwh m3 for ozonation but on par with the value of reverse osmosis 1 5 kwh m3 56 60 during stage 2 when the hbpp was operated at the farm with exhaust gases as inlet gas it was able to inactivate e coli thermotolerant fecal coliforms cyanophyta see table 3 from a heavily contaminated piggery effluent the use of the hot combustion gases as the main input to sterilize water is what makes the new process highly energy efficient with potentially no energy requirements 0 kwh m3 this new disinfection technology will be able to provide to the livestock farming industry a new source of disinfected water for irrigation or for cleaning facilities at virtually no cost when operated with combustion gases from biogas power plant processes therefore it will be able to compete with other water disinfection technologies such as uv irradiation ozonation and even chlorination due to its low operating costs and its energy efficiency 4 conclusions the hbpp was practically tested at a pig farm in a real operational environment which successfully inactivated naturally occurring bacteria such as salmonella e coli thermotolerant coliforms cyanophyta and protozoa spores oocysts and cysts from giardia and cryptosporidium from heavily infected piggery effluent the results demonstrated the technical feasibility to scale up the technology from a laboratory experiment hbce to a pilot plant hbpp which has a strong commercial value for both the manufacturing and agricultural industries it can potentially become a strong contender with other water disinfection technologies such as uv irradiation ozonation and chlorination especially when considering hbpp s scalability low operating cost and high energy efficiency as the first investor and potential customer the australian pork industry will benefit from the hbpp as a tailored and fit for purpose solution to battle their challenges of drought increased water prices and effluent management issues while economically utilizing their by products such as biogas this study offers a novel technology that plays a role in establishing a circular economy by creating an onsite closed loop for piggeries and other farms which utilizes heating energy that may otherwise be disposed of e g reuse the exhaust gases from biogas fired power plants to generate reusable water from animal effluent and other contaminated water sources it delivers a low cost and scalable effluent management method that may financially benefit livestock farmers across many parts of the world contributions adrian garrido sanchis principal

8794,effluent and water management in particular inactivating pathogens have become more critical for the livestock farming industry from both public health and business efficiency perspectives the new hot bubble pilot plant hbpp uses hot air and hot combustion gases to produce hot bubbles that successfully inactivated escherichia coli c 3000 atcc15597 in the lab in different synthetic effluents and later at the farm using naturally occurring bacteria such as salmonella e coli thermotolerant coliforms and cyanophyta and protozoa spores oocysts and cysts from giardia and cryptosporidium from piggery effluent many industries such as pig farms landfills biogas power plants and coal power plants emit large amounts of hot combustion gases the potential use of these hot combustion gases waste to produce hot bubbles in a bubble column reactor offers a new energy efficient water sterilization process that fits within the circular economy principals by using waste gases as an input for the system this new technology would then be able to compete with other water disinfection technologies such as uv irradiation ozonation and even chlorination due to its low operating costs and high

in livestock effluent management in the context of australia however the information provided shall be widely applicable to other parts of the world that share similar concerns to address the issues mentioned above apl has funded several theoretical and practical studies to examine potential water reuse technologies that can be applied in the current situations to solve problems faced by the country such as water sterilization and purification biogas integration etc especially for contaminated water to become reusable on pig farms as water prices in australia have been rising steadily over the past years and farmers pay very uneven amounts across the country 12 according to a non public study commissioned by apl 13 which examined the possible applications of currently available water technologies both thermal and membrane based technologies have been demonstrated to not fit the purposes of the pig farmers in summary 64 of australia s pig farms own less than 100 pigs and such number is even higher 81 in the united states as shown by the usda 14 which calls for water management and recycling systems to be scalable that suit the smaller farms thermal processes such as multi stage flash and multi effect distillation typically require treatments of several thousand to half a million cubic meters per day to be economical and often with the addition of excess industry heat wastes to reduce the energy costs 15 on the other hand popular membrane based technologies such as reverse osmosis and electrodialysis which can be scaled down to suit the needs of small farms but often possess strong technical challenges to farmers for maintenance of membranes 16 and can be expensive to operate 17 with these considerations in mind an innovative and emerging technology the hot bubble column evaporator hbce 18 was identified to be fit for purpose for both of its scalability and simple engineering that are required by the pork industry the hbce utilizes its heat transfer efficiency to inactivate waterborne pathogens for water reuse without the need for boiling 19 it does so by transferring heat from the hot bubbles of 1 3 mm of diameter to the pathogen surfaces through collisions while keeping the water at low temperature 18 20 the heat transfer rate between liquid and gas is 100 times more efficient in a gas liquid bubble column than in a single phase flow according to decker 21 however though promising hbce that successfully inactivated viruses and bacteria using different hot gases 18 to date has not been industrially applied in livestock farming and effluent management whether for manure water treatment sterilization of contaminated water 22 or integration of biogas as a potential energy source the research team here aims to design and implement an industry applicable system hbpp hot bubble pilot plant utilizing the principles of hbce lab scale hot bubble column evaporator from our previous work to address sustainability issues faced by the australian pork industry and with the hope that the application can widely benefit and provide insights for the primary industry resource management globally this offers a new attractive energy efficient alternative to disinfect the wastewater produced by the industry on top of that the technology can be applied to other industries and sites with abundant waste heat from combustion gases such as landfills and power plants as the hot exhaust combustion gases can be used as the main input of the hbpp sterilization treatment what plays a role in establishing a circular economy 2

foodborne disease 24 e coli presence in water is used to monitor fecal contamination 25 one such harmful strain is e coli c 3000 atcc15597 which is a biosafety level 1 organism 26 it was selected as a representative model for bacterial contamination in water during the stage 1 of this project laboratory experiments 27 28 the plate count method see section 2 3 was employed to measure the e coli c 3000 atcc15597 inactivation during this stage spinks at al 29 proved that pathogenic bacteria are inactivated in a temperature range of 55 c 65 c e coli presents the first signs of thermal inactivation at temperatures over 55 c achieving high inactivation rates at 60 c 30 2 2 experimental solutions in stage 1 two different solutions were prepared and both were sterilized by autoclaving in an aesculap 420 at 15 psi and 121 124 c for 15 min 31 the first solution was secondary treated synthetic sewage synthetic s prepared according to iso 11733 water quality guidelines the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd standards 32 33 and the official journal of the european community for secondary treated water quality which recommends the following values for discharges from urban wastewater treatment plants 125 mg l of cod 15 mg l of total nitrogen and 2 mg l of total phosphorus 34 our synthetic s was designed to meet european standards by using the following compounds 120 mg of peptone 90 mg of meat extract replaced here by bovril according to recommendations in biology of wastewater treatment 35 30 mg of urea 13 mg of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 7 mg of sodium chloride 2 mg of calcium chloride dehydrate and 2 mg of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in a liter of boiled tap water the second solution a synthetic piggery water synthetic p was prepared following the oecd medium procedure with a composition based on the analytical results of piggery effluent see supplementary data i 628 mg l of bod 52 5 mg l of total phosphorus 2 100 mg l of total nitrogen 1 520 mg l of sodium 156 mg l of calcium and 59 9 mg l of magnesium the synthetic p solution was made with the following ingredients in a liter of boiled tap water 836 mg of peptone 557 3 mg of meat extract again replaced by bovril 4 506 mg of urea 300 mg of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate 3 863 mg of sodium chloride 572 mg of calcium chloride dehydrate and 607 mg of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in a liter of boiled tap water for both solutions the tap water was previously boiled for 30 min to ensure that all chlorine was removed from the water therefore e coli c 3000 was not affected by the disinfecting action of chlorine in stage 2 the pilot plant was installed at the piggery farm using real piggery effluent for the sterilization experiments 2 3 excherichia medium for experiments in stage 1 the plate count method is commonly used for the detection of e coli in treated drinking water wastewater and marine water the water quality is assessed based on the ability of bacteria colonies to grow on a layer of agar producing colony forming units cfu 36 for each laboratory experiment two solutions were prepared a and b solution a was prepared with 13 g of tryptone 1 g of yeast extract 6 g of nacl and 1 000 ml of milli q water this solution was aseptically dispensed into two vessels with agar 1 41 and without agar the agar used in the experiments was molecular biology grade from sigma aldrich the solid media solution a with agar was heated to boiling to dissolve the agar and sterilized by autoclaving for 15 min in an aesculap 420 at 15 psi and 121 124 c solution b improved the viability of the bacteria it was prepared by adding 0 010 g of thiamine and 1 g of glucose to 50 ml of milli q water and filter sterilized by passing through a 0 22Î¼m filter once solution a cooled to 50 c solution b was added aseptically in a proportion of 1 19 the resulting 1 34 agar solid media after mixing solutions a and b was poured into 100 mm 15 mm petri dishes which were placed within the sterile field area around the bunsen burner created by the updraft of the flame 37 2 4 the hot bubble pilot plant hbpp the hbpp can treat 3 5 l of influent per minute and the design see fig 1 contemplates a modular layout that offers the possibility of connecting two pilot plants in series or parallel which can potentially be extended to an increased number of plant units for downstream commercial applications the experiment used an a 120lm aeroflow air pump that constantly supplied 130 l of air minute this air was heated with an electrical heater lhs 15 leister the heater maintained the air temperature just above the ceramic sinter surface at 130 c 185 c and 215 c for different experiments respectively the base of the rectangular stainless steel pilot plant was fitted with a half cylinder shaped ceramic sinter the ceramic sinter had a length of 500 mm and a diameter of 150 mm the pore size was 40 100 Î¼m with 30 43 porosity see fig 1 once contaminated solutions e g synthetic s and p or real piggery effluent were poured into the pilot plant their temperature was measured with a thermocouple in the center of the ceramic sinter hot gases either air or combustion gases were introduced into the hot gas chamber at a flow rate of 130 l min these hot gases formed bubbles that when ascending in the contaminated liquid inactivated different types of pathogens the top of the pilot plant was fitted with a settlement condenser tank that kept the lower surface of the condenser at 12 16 c this facilitated the recovery of high quality water through the condensation of the water vapor in the saturated gas onto the internal surface 2 5 disinfection experiments the disinfection experiments were conducted in two different stages stage 1 applied hbpp in a university s laboratory environment and stage 2 installed the hbpp at a real piggery to test the results in practical situations during stage 1 the hbpp treated synthetic s and synthetic p containing escherichia coli c 3000 atcc15597 with inlet air at three different temperatures 130 c 185 c and 215 c plus inlet combustion exhaust gas from an greenpower gp2200 lpg generator at 47 c for additional study and test the plate count method 37 39 was used to assess the viability of e coli samples of 1 3 ml were collected from 10 to 15 mm above the central area of the plant during stage 2 at the piggery the plant sterilized real piggery effluent in two experiments with different hot inlet gases the first one using 130 l min of combustion gas at 115 c from the greenpower gas generator the exhaust pipe of the gas generator was attached to an insulated metal pipe on the hbpp the second one using air at 175 c from an hiblow hp 120 air blower that supplied 130 l min of air which was heated with lesier lhs 15 air heater piggery effluent contains different types of naturally occurring bacteria and protozoa to assess the hbpp performance piggery effluent was sampled before and after the treatments and analyzed in an accredited laboratory see supplementary data i 2 6 data analysis the decay linear model was used to study the inactivation of e coli overtime during stage 1 laboratory experiments plate counts were performed for all 19 21 plates from each of the experiments the mean and standard deviation of each triplicated sample were obtained using bacteria survival factor log10 cfut cfu0 where cfu0 is the initial number of colony forming units cfu per sample and cfut is the cfu per sample after a set exposure time in minutes 40 the decimal reduction time d value was used to measure the temperature impact on escherichia coli c 3000 atcc15597 this can also be defined as the time needed to inactivate 90 i e 1 log of e coli or heat resistance z value measures the temperature change required to increase or reduce the d value by a factor of 10 d values and z values were calculated using a linear exponential decay model or thermal death model 41 1 log c f u t l o g c f u 0 t d 2 log c f u t c f u 0 t d where c f u t is the number of colonies at time t c f u 0 the initial number of colonies 1 d the slope of the curve d the decimal reduction time the z value represents the increase in temperature needed to reduce the d value by 1 log it measures the impact of a change in temperature on e coli inactivation thus 3 z t 1 t 2 l o g d 1 l o g d 2 where t1 first temperature of the interval t2 second temperature of the interval and d1 and d2 are the d values at t1 and t2 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli inactivation efficiency hbpp vs hbce the hbce process inactivates waterborne pathogens with less thermal energy than traditional methods such as boiling 19 this is because hbce uses hot gas bubbles in which the specific heat capacity per unit of weight cp of air is four times lower than that of water temperatures of the hot gas and the contaminated solution within the hbce will equilibrate during the process to produce a steady state temperature however the practical application of such a process requires additional industry design to make it fit for purpose to be used in a real environment e g a piggery findings from our previous work 18 22 42 established the data needed to design the new hbpp and proved that it is technically feasible to extend this process from bench scale to a pilot plant the new hbpp has been designed as a scaled down version of a possible final commercial plant table 1 shows cfu counts and inactivation values from e coli c 3000 for both experimental setups hbpp and hbce after an exposure time at different inlet air temperatures thermal inactivation of e coli is dependent both on the duration of the treatment and temperature of exposure thermal calculations consequently require the need for knowledge of the thermal resistance and concentration of e coli c 3000 and the time temperature relationship required for their inactivation thermal death curve plots show the correlation between the log of the d values and the corresponding temperatures fig 2 decimal reduction times d values table 2 calculated from inactivation values have been used to compare the e coli inactivation performance of the hbce with that of the hbpp d values measure the time in minutes at a given temperature required to inactivate 90 of e coli z values table 2 are calculated from d values as equation 3 they reflect the heat resistance of a microorganism the smaller the z value the greater its sensitivity to heat fig 2 compares the impact of inlet gas temperature on e coli inactivation between hbpp and hbce d values from both hbce and hbpp at different temperature points were used to calculate z values for hbpp z 48 3 and for hbce z 81 3 which show that the inactivation in the pilot plant was less temperature dependent than in the glass bubble column fig 2 for inlet air temperatures in the range 100 170 c the hbce presented higher e coli inactivation rates than the hbpp with d values of 65 3 min at 100 c for the hbce and 55 min at 130 c for the hbpp at higher inlet gas temperatures 170 215 c the hbpp presented better inactivation with only 1 09 min at 215 c whereas hbce needed 3 89 min to achieve 1 log e coli inactivation at 200 c fig 2 and table 2 for both hbce and hbpp e coli inactivations can be increased by raising the air inlet temperature 3 2 stage 1 hbpp laboratory experiments e coli c 3000 inactivation in two different types of synthetic effluent during stage 1 the hbpp was operated at the university laboratories under a controlled environment the fundamental mechanism of inactivation is the collision between dispersed pathogens and hot air bubbles 43 when hot air bubbles at 130 c 185 c or 215 c form on the surface of the ceramic sinter see fig 1 a thin layer of heated water is transiently formed around the surface of the bubbles while the solution temperature is kept at 40 c 49 c or 52 c respectively e coli is rapidly inactivated at temperatures above 60 c 29 so the hot air bubbles will effectively thermally inactivate the bacteria if the temperature of the bubbles and the transient water film is greater than 60 c the hbpp experiments were conducted at the university laboratories under a controlled environment using 3 5 l of either synthetic s or synthetic p which were treated with hot air at different temperature points when the hot air bubbles at 130 c rose through the synthetic s only a 0 44 log reduction of e coli was achieved after 20 min of treatment for an inlet air temperature of 185 c the inactivation increased to 3 log after 6 min of treatment at 215 c air inlet temperature e coli from the synthetic piggery effluent reached 2 5 log inactivation after 2 2 min when the inlet air temperature increases so does the temperature of the hot water layer around the bubbles consequently the inactivation rate becomes more effective as observed in fig 3 and table 1 combustion gas from a generator was used to inactivate e coli in 3 5 l of synthetic p after 20 min only a 0 01 log reduction was achieved fig 3 the combustion gas on the surface of the sinter only reached 47 c which is not a high enough temperature to thermally inactivate the e coli in the hbpp 3 3 stage 2 field test hbpp farm deployment treating real piggery effluent 3 3 1 piggery effluent chemical and physical parameters piggery effluent is usually biologically stabilized by storing it in one or more anaerobic ponds before its disposal onto agricultural land 44 different water samples from the piggery pond at the farm were analyzed in an accredited laboratory to establish the nutrient content for the synthetic p used in stage 1 the piggery effluent is used to clean the facilities then digested for 7 days in a bioreactor anaerobic reactor to generate methane and later settled in a pond for 5 days before it is reused again in the facilities the water analytics showed high electrical conductivity 25 600 Î¼s cm and a ph of 8 17 high values of turbidity 1 160 ntu total solids 13 200 mg l and suspended solids 2 300 mg l were also obtained a very high organic load total organic carbon 3 380 mg l biochemical oxygen demand bod 628 mg l total nitrogen as n 2 100 mg l and high salinity chloride 1 270 mg l sodium 1 520 mg l were observed due to the continuous reuse of the water for cleaning the piggeries see supplementary data i for more detail 3 3 2 piggery effluent biological parameters it has been a known issue that intensive livestock farming such as dairy piggery and poultry can sometimes give rise to pathogen issues this could have implications for food safety and health conditions if not managed appropriately piggery effluents of 13 farms in queensland australia have been used to identify the most common bacterial e coli salmonella campylobacter thermotolerant coliforms arcobacter spp and protozoan giardia and cryptosporidium indicator organisms and establish their levels 45 als laboratories analyzed the effluent samples from the piggery obtaining the following results thermo tolerant fecal coliforms 1 100 cfu 100ml e coli 660 cfu 100ml salmonella detected adenovirus 440 l protozoan giardia cysts 200 l cryptosporidium oocysts 1800 l and very high numbers of cyanophyta 25 930 cells ml see supplementary data i for more details these results show that if these gastrointestinal pathogens are inhaled or swallowed at the infective dose they could initiate an infection on humans 46 or animals with the consequent reduction in production efficiency 3 3 3 hbpp operation with piggery effluent at the farm the livestock industry often integrates biogas as part of its effluent management scheme 47 which provides large amounts of hot combustion gases that can be reused to produce hot bubbles in the hbpp for water sterilization pig farms in australia treat effluent minimally before its reuse in agriculture or production such as splashing and cleaning piggeries that can potentially cause harm by spreading pathogens 48 to test the new process two pilot plants were installed at the farm to sterilize 3 5 l of piggery effluent each during 20 min one using combustion gas at 115 c as inlet gas and another one with hot air at 175 c see fig 4 three samples of real piggery effluent were analyzed in an accredited laboratory als see results in supplementary data ii one sample before the pilot plant treatments the raw piggery water and the other two after 20 min of treatment with two different inlet gases hot air and hot combustion gases based on the preliminary piggery effluent characterization the following waterborne pathogens were selected for this study salmonella e coli thermotolerant coliforms cyanophyta giardia and cryptosporidium when hot air at 175 c was used as inlet gas in the pilot plant a 3 26 log reduction for thermotolerant fecal coliforms and e coli was achieved and salmonella was not detected other species like cyanophyta were also inactivated reaching 0 66 log reduction hot combustion gas at 115 c presented lower inactivation rates with 0 06 log reduction for cyanophyta and 0 05 log for thermotolerant fecal coliforms and e coli salmonella was still detected table 3 different studies 49 50 have identified cyanophyta as a significant threat to the health of humans and other animal species the toxins produced by cyanophyta can affect all vertebrates during summer months the numbers of cyanophyta in water can increase rapidly this impacts many activities such as increasing the risk of reactional use of water and reducing the efficiency in wastewater treatment plants the hbpp achieved 0 66 log reduction of cyanophyta with hot air at 175 c and 0 06 log with hot combustion gases at 115 c giardia and cryptosporidium can cause infections that range from simple gastroenteritis to a life threatening outcome in immunocompromised individuals 51 protozoa spores oocysts and cysts from giardia and cryptosporidium were successfully inactivated in the pilot plant achieving 0 22 log and 0 67 log reduction respectively when the inlet air temperature reached 175 c but not inactivation was observed for combustion gases at 115 c table 3 chlorine is the most frequently used disinfectant in drinking water but has very little effect on cryptosporidium and giardia sterilization 52 thermal treatments can successfully inactivate giardia achieving more than 2 logs reduction after 10 min of treatment in a solution at 64 c 53 and cryptosporidium with more than 3 4 log after 5 min of treatment in a solution at 60 c 54 therefore the hbpp poses a viable alternative to chlorine for protozoa inactivation when the inlet gas temperature is at least 175 c these results prove that the new hbpp offers a viable water sterilization technology that can sterilize different types of bacteria 50 and protozoa spores in the most heavily infected waters inlet gas temperature is the key variable needed to improve the performance of the plant combustion gas can be successfully used in the plant if its temperature is increased by for example improving the insulation or the design 3 4 the economic viability of the hbpp compared with other sterilization technologies given normal variations in factors such as climate population water use type of water and location the energy requirement to treat water to the necessary level is in the range of 0 05 5 kwh m3 55 for example the energy requirements for pumping equipment in rainwater harvesting technologies will be around 0 3 1 3 kwh m3 and for water reuse around 0 2 2 5 kwh m3 depending on the capacity pumping and needs on water quality 55 among all the different water disinfection technologies chlorination is used most extensively because it is cheap 0 05 kwh m3 56 and easy to operate however it does present several limitations for example it typically requires at least 30 min of contact time and is not able to inactivate protozoa like giardia and cryptosporidium 57 also chlorine can react with organic matter and often forms disinfection by products dbps that are hazardous to humans if the water is reused in agriculture more than 5 ppm of chlorine can cause plant injury such as foliar burning in some species 58 consequently many countries are moving to non chlorine based treatment methods such as uv irradiation and ozone 59 despite other limitations that these methods have ozone systems need a moderate contact time and are complex to operate and maintain rotaviruses can be resistant to uv irradiation treatment and its efficiency can be affected by dissolved inorganics and organics in the wastewater as well as its color and turbidity 57 in stage 1 the hbpp treated 3 5 l of synthetic piggery water in 1 09 min table 2 therefore the theoretical limit of the plant is around 4 600 l day with an energy requirement of 0 89 kw h 0 12 kw for the air pump and 0 77 kw for the air heater which gives an energy use of about 4 6 kwh m3 when the inlet air is heated with better insulation and bigger plant capacity the energy cost is projected to reduce to 1 2 kwh m3 this value is still far from the 0 05 kwh m3 for uv irradiation and the 0 3 kwh m3 for ozonation but on par with the value of reverse osmosis 1 5 kwh m3 56 60 during stage 2 when the hbpp was operated at the farm with exhaust gases as inlet gas it was able to inactivate e coli thermotolerant fecal coliforms cyanophyta see table 3 from a heavily contaminated piggery effluent the use of the hot combustion gases as the main input to sterilize water is what makes the new process highly energy efficient with potentially no energy requirements 0 kwh m3 this new disinfection technology will be able to provide to the livestock farming industry a new source of disinfected water for irrigation or for cleaning facilities at virtually no cost when operated with combustion gases from biogas power plant processes therefore it will be able to compete with other water disinfection technologies such as uv irradiation ozonation and even chlorination due to its low operating costs and its energy efficiency 4 conclusions the hbpp was practically tested at a pig farm in a real operational environment which successfully inactivated naturally occurring bacteria such as salmonella e coli thermotolerant coliforms cyanophyta and protozoa spores oocysts and cysts from giardia and cryptosporidium from heavily infected piggery effluent the results demonstrated the technical feasibility to scale up the technology from a laboratory experiment hbce to a pilot plant hbpp which has a strong commercial value for both the manufacturing and agricultural industries it can potentially become a strong contender with other water disinfection technologies such as uv irradiation ozonation and chlorination especially when considering hbpp s scalability low operating cost and high energy efficiency as the first investor and potential customer the australian pork industry will benefit from the hbpp as a tailored and fit for purpose solution to battle their challenges of drought increased water prices and effluent management issues while economically utilizing their by products such as biogas this study offers a novel technology that plays a role in establishing a circular economy by creating an onsite closed loop for piggeries and other farms which utilizes heating energy that may otherwise be disposed of e g reuse the exhaust gases from biogas fired power plants to generate reusable water from animal effluent and other contaminated water sources it delivers a low cost and scalable effluent management method that may financially benefit livestock farmers across many parts of the world contributions adrian garrido sanchis principal
