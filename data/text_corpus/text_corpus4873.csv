24365,managers of insect pollinated orchards face many decisions that can significantly influence crop yields including managing pollination through use of beehives or the layout of cultivars in the orchard understanding the relative importance and interactions between these multiple decisions through empirical field trials is rarely possible so modeling approaches can provide valuable insights and generate new hypotheses based on kiwifruit actinidia chinensis var deliciosa a chev a chev hayward a dioecious fruiting vine as an exemplar we used a spatially explicit system of differential equations on a lattice to explore the effects of overlap of male and female flowers hive placements within the orchard and orchard layout on the predicted pollination success in our model hive placement and orchard layout influenced the proportion of fruit set in an orchard more strongly than male and female flowering synchrony simulations with hives distributed evenly around the orchard had the most fruit set while hives located at a single point resulted in relatively low fruit set our model showed that the effect of hive distribution was more important for fruit production than planting regime we have demonstrated how such a model can be used to provide key information for orchardists to optimize their yields our model predicts that while orchard planting decisions are important the consideration of hive placement during flowering is likely to have greater influence on final orchard productivity in functionally dioecious crops 2020 msc 92 10 92b05 keywords pollination mathematical modeling delay differential equation honey bee dioecious crop data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction insect mediated pollination primarily by managed western honey bee apis mellifera l colonies is critical for fruit set in many cropping systems globally but is particularly vital for functionally dioecious systems where pollen must cross from the pollen donor to the pollen recipient for a successful crop klein et al 2007 rader et al 2020 this type of dependence is common in horticultural crops with partial or complete self incompatibility hybrid seed production as well as in systems where male and female flowers are borne on separate plants kiwifruit actinidia chinensis is a dioecious subtropical liana and a valuable fruit crop and growers have to make decisions about the number and distribution of male and female vines to be planted for pollination honey bees colonies are typically deployed at a stocking rate of eight hives per hectare a service orchardists often pay significant amounts for goodwin 2012 yet placement of hives in an orchard is largely based on logistical constraints for the beekeeper and orchardist rather than what is optimal for pollination in systems such as kiwifruit pollination by managed honey bees is seen as crucial owing to the relative scarcity of wild pollinating species garibaldi et al 2013 howlett et al 2017 potential pollination deficits are mitigated by paying for the pollination service from honey bees it is therefore important for growers to be able to make informed decisions about how best to use these managed pollinators and how that interacts with other relevant decisions they make in in their orchards models can be used to help understand pollination systems and support decision making ramos jiliberto et al 2018 especially for multiple interacting factors where empirical field trials at orchard scales would be required and almost impossible to fully replicate well studied systems such as kiwifruit offer an opportunity to develop models which can be parameterized from the literature and then subsequently used to inform models in other systems different model approaches to pollination have been taken over time including models where pollinators are not specifically taken into account lescourret et al 1998a b agent based models abm broussard et al 2022 and spatially homogeneous pollinator dynamical system approaches peace et al 2020 a number of models addressing internal dynamics of a mellifera populations and their interactions with heterogeneous landscapes also have been developed cf table 1 in joseph et al 2020 but they do not specifically address the relationship between pollination management hive placement sex ratios in dioecious crops orchard layout and pollination efficiency spatial heterogeneity affects pollinator performance with studies reporting edge effects pisanty and mandelik 2015 and that planting regimes influence both insect behavior jay and jay 1984 and pollination success testolin 1991 additionally honey bee hive placement in an orchard can affect pollination success hives that are positioned in a single corner perform less well than when distributed evenly throughout the orchard goodwin 2012 given the profound effects that landscape configuration can have on pollinator performance and crop production it is important to consider how to develop spatially explicit mathematical models of pollination broussard et al 2022 used an abm framework incorporating spatially explicit flowering and pollinator dynamics to predict fruitset and total yield in kiwifruit abm approaches are simulation models that track individual agents and explore system level emergent behaviors broussard and colleagues tracked individual pollinators as they moved across a dynamic orchard collecting and depositing pollen broussard et al 2022 while abms like this are able to incorporate complex individual level details they become computationally expensive and their results can be hard to interpret dynamical systems offer an alternative modeling approach by using aggregate level perspectives and by defining system level dynamics into differential equations such as ordinary differential equations odes while these two modeling approaches can yield different predictions the results when considered can lead to unique insights for example it has been shown that analogous models using odes and abm approaches run in parallel can yield valuable complementary insights into understanding cancer growth scholl 2001 and vector borne pathogens shaw et al 2019 2017 here we use a dynamical systems approach odes to develop a spatially explicit model with dynamic flowering and pollinator behaviors in simulated orchards of realistic size and varying orchard layouts we expand the spatially homogeneous model developed by peace et al 2020 to a spatially explicit system of differential equations arranged on a lattice moving the previous system of equations to a lattice structure allows us to better model the heterogeneity inherent in field conditions movements of bee foragers in the field have been successfully modeled using brownian or lévy movement vallaeys et al 2017 which produce symmetrical predictions for bee movement about the origin but these models do not take into account density dependence there is good evidence that bees change their foraging behavior at high insect densities through a number of mechanisms including rejection of recently visited flowers giurfa and núñez 1992 and decreasing visit duration to flowers with low resource availability keasar et al 1996 as well as increased traveling distance after visiting several unrewarding flowers harder 1990 keasar et al 1996 which would result in density dependent dynamics the real world results of these dynamics have been recorded in kiwifruit with fruit set declining as distance from male vines is increased testolin 1991 to simulate the movement of bees in accordance to observations in the literature we used density dependent stochastic movement between neighboring cells parameterized by holling type ii functions holling 1965 1966 using this ode lattice model we explored the relative effects of different orchard layouts placement of functionally male and female plants a decision made when the orchard is established and can only be changed by regrafting and honey bee hive placement configurations a decision made annually by growers and beekeepers on predicted pollination success 2 material and methods using kiwifruit as a model for functionally dioecious crops we developed and analyzed a mathematical model of pollination dynamics that incorporates key features of plant biology and insect behavior on a 1 hectare orchard in our previous work peace et al 2020 we built a spatially homogeneous model where bees could visit either floral sex with different classes of pollinator corresponding to different loading of viable pollen on the insect body to build on this model and take into account the spatial heterogeneity of the orchard layout and location of beehives we first divided the orchard into a lattice of 100 by 100 cells each cell is one meter by one meter in each cell we assume all conditions for both flower and pollinator are homogeneous however conditions across different cells may vary we first present the model that we used to model the pollination dynamics in one cell without considering the insect movements then we extend it to include insect movements among cells to present the full model over the lattice table 1 describes the model state variables and parameters 2 1 pollination dynamics in one cell of the lattice similarly to the model of peace et al 2020 at any given cell without considering any insect movement across cells yet the pollination dynamics can be described with a combination of flowering dynamics and pollinator dynamics 2 1 1 flowering dynamics we track the number of male and female flowers that have opened using the following differential equations 1a d m d t b m 2 π σ m 2 e t t m 2 2 σ m 2 1b d f d t b f 2 π σ f 2 e t t f 2 2 σ f 2 where t m and t f are the times when the opening rates are highest and σ m and σ f are the variations in these rates of opening with the assumption that each flower is open only for a fixed amount of time we can determine the number of currently open male flowers m t and female flowers f t using the following expressions 2a m t m t m t τ m if t τ m m t elsewhere 2b f t f t f t τ f if t τ f f t elsewhere where τ m and τ f are the numbers of days that male flowers and female flowers remain open 2 1 2 pollinator dynamics pollinator dynamics are modeled with differential equations that divide the pollinator population into sub compartments based on their pollen load pollinators can have a high medium or low pollen load denoted as p m 1 p m 2 and p m 3 respectively or be carrying no pollen denoted as p f these four states were chosen to represent zero and three points along an exponential decay curve seen in the literature broussard et al 2021 in accordance with the base model peace et al 2020 we assume that pollinators completely load up on pollen with a visit to a male flower and deposit some pollen with a visit to a female flower empirical data show that pollen dehisces throughout the morning in kiwifruit becoming limited in the afternoon goodwin 1987 hopping 1990 oh et al 2020 chen et al 1996 this results in pollen availability being highest between 900 and 1300 broadly overlapping with the period of highest insect activity malaboeuf et al 1995 mckay 1978 goodwin 1987 macfarlane and ferguson 1983 within this 4 hour window pollen does not appear to be limiting but is limiting thereafter goodwin 1987 to account for the biological reality that male pollen availability is abundant but limited which cannot be captured accurately in the dynamic model we limit the period of active foraging per day to four hours approximating the window of abundant pollen availability and bee activity goodwin 1987 fig 1 depicts the movement of pollinators between the compartments pollinators that have just visited a male flower have a high pollen load p m 1 these pollinators can either visit another male flower and remain in compartment p m 1 or visit a female flower deposit some pollen and thus be transferred into compartment p m 2 pollinators in compartment p m 2 with a medium pollen load can either visit a male flower acquire more pollen and be transferred into compartment p m 1 or visit a female flower deposit some pollen and be transferred into compartment p m 3 similarly pollinators in compartment p m 3 with a low pollen load can either visit a male flower acquire more pollen and be transferred into compartment p m 1 or visit a female flower deposit all their pollen and be transferred into compartment p f pollinators in compartment p f without any pollen can either visit a female flower and remain in compartment p f or visit a male flower acquire a full load of pollen and be transferred into compartment p m 1 we used the same definitions introduced in our previous work peace et al 2020 of the total rate at which the pollinators visit male and female flowers and floral constancy honey bees have a preference to visit flowers of the same sex as the one they previously visited mckay 1978 howpage 1999 jay and jay 1984 goodwin and steven 1993 peace et al 2020 the number of pollinators in each compartment can be tracked using the following system of differential equations 3a d p m 1 d t α f m 1 α β f m total visitation rate 1 f f m ɛ p m 2 p m 3 p f moves from female to male 1 m f m δ p m 1 moves from male to female 3b d p

f f m ɛ p m 3 moves from female to female 1 f f m ɛ p f moves from female to male where α is the search rate β is the handling time δ and ϵ are the pollinator s preference to remain on male and female flowers respectively the incorporation of eqs 2 into the system of differential equations for the pollinator model 3 results in a system of ordinary differential equations when t min τ m τ f before any open flowers begin to close followed by a system of delayed differential equations with a single delay τ min τ m τ f when min τ m τ f t max τ m τ f and then by a system of delayed differential equations with two fixed delays τ m and τ f this model tracks the number of open male and female flowers m f and the number of pollinators of each type p m 1 p m 2 p m 3 p f as they visit male and female flowers in one cell when the pollinators movements between cells are not yet considered 2 2 the full model extension to the lattice to fully capture the pollination dynamics within the entire orchard we then extended the flower and pollinator dynamics from one cell to the lattice that models the entire orchard first we denote each cell with i j which is located at the i th row and j th column of the lattice in our study we compared four different orchard layouts point male row uniform and one in eight see fig 2 we also studied eight possible bee hive arrangements around the orchard see fig 3 to model the movements of the pollinators from cell to cell in the lattice we assume that 1 the probability of a pollinator moving out of a cell is density dependent which is modeled by a hill function 2 after leaving the previously occupied cell the pollinator will randomly land in one of the 8 neighboring cells or 5 or 3 if an edge or a corner respectively 3 after landing inside a new cell the pollinator will then visit flowers based on their preference for male flowers m or female flowers f 4 all bees will return to their hives at the end of each day and there is no carry over of pollen from day to day let t i j denote the total number flower at cell i j at a given time t 4 t i j f i j m i j and denote p i j the total number pollinator at cell i j at a given time t 5 p i j p m 1 i j p m 2 i j p m 3 i j p f i j for an interior cell i j the population dynamics of the pollinators are governed by the following system of impulsive differential equations during each day for t

j 1 8 for an interior cell i j which has 8 neighboring cells 1 5 for a boundary not a corner cell i j which has 5 neighboring cells 1 3 for a corner cell i j which has 3 neighboring cells under our fourth assumption when a new day starts all pollinators will return to the orchard without carrying any pollen therefore at the beginning of each active period of any given day we assume all pollinators start with p f thus we have when t n t 7 p m 1 i j t 0 p m 2 i j t 0 p m 3 i j t 0 p f i j t p f 0 where p f 0 is the total number of pollinators with initial start status at p f at each cell the flower dynamics is still governed by the following delayed differential equation system f i j t f i j t f i j t τ f if t τ f f i j t elsewhere m i j t m i j t m i j t τ m if t τ m m i j t elsewhere 8 d f i j d t o f e t t f 2 2 σ f 2 o f θ f b f i j 9 d m i j d t o m e t t m 2 2 σ m 2 o m θ m b m i j where f i j t and m i j t are the numbers of flowers that have opened up to time t at cell i j whereas f i j t and m i j t are the total number of opened flowers at a given time t at cell i j b m i j b m i j and b f i j b f i j are the total number of male and female buds flowers in a given season 2 3 measuring pollination at each cell we define the visit that results in transitioning a pollinator from group p m 1 to p m 2 as a type one visit the visit that results in transitioning a pollinator from group p m 2 to p m 3 as a type two visit and the visit that results in transitioning a pollinator from group p m 3 to p f as a type three visit see fig 1 we then define fruit set at cell i j for a day t denoted by y i j t as 10 y i j t 1 1 p 1 v 1 i j t 1 p 2 v 2 i j t 1 p 3 v 3 i j t where v n i j t for n 1 2 3 represents the total number of type n visits that each flower has received at the time of closing day t and p n represents the percentage chance that a single visit will fully pollinate a flower to set fruit for each visit type n the total predicted yield at cell i j denoted y t i j is the fruit set for each day multiplied by the number of female flowers closing on that day summed over all the days 11 y t i j t d f c i j t y i j t where d f c i j t denotes the daily number of female flowers closing at day t in cell i j the total predicted yield proportion over all days at cell i j denoted y p i j is the number of flowers closing on each day multiplied by the fruit set for that day divided by the total number of female flowers in our calculation we use the number of total female flower buds 12 y p i j t d f c i j t y i j t b f i j thus the overall total predicted yield in the orchard denoted y t is 13 y t i j t d f c i j t y i j t and the overall total predicted yield proportion in the orchard denoted y p is 14 y p i j t d f c i j t y i j t i j b f i j 2 4 parameterization all model parameters are listed in table 2 most parameters were already parameterized in our previous model with a sensitivity analysis conducted for them peace et al 2020 we have three new parameters in the extended model d h n whose values are assumed as there was insufficient empirical data to estimate them the range of dispersal values d were parameterized by using the maximum flight speed of honey bees 30 km h wenner 1963 to inform the upper bounds and the value which would result in bees reaching the edge of the 1 ha orchard within the 4 hour foraging period to inform the lower bound the default value was chosen as the value that resulted in which bees reached the edge of the 1 ha orchard within a 30 minute foraging bout the range of the half dispersal rate pollinator s density which is defined as the pollinator per thousand flowers density at which the pollinator reaches its half of the maximal dispersal rate is assumed to be one bee per 1000 flowers to 1000 bees per 1000 flowers encompassing the range of pollinator densities observed in the field plus one order of magnitude goodwin 1987 the baseline value is 10 bees per 1000 flowers a density commonly encountered and above the value required for adequate pollination meaning there is likely to be resource competition the hill coefficient which indicates the steepness of density dependence dispersal rate is included for generality and we choose n 1 for simplicity owing to lack of sufficient data to support an alternative in our previous work peace et al 2020 on the spatially homogeneous base model we conducted a global parameter sensitivity analysis using latin hypercube sampling with the statistical partial rank correlation coefficient technique to investigate parameter uncertainty while this parameter sensitivity analysis did not include the three new parameters d h and n it provides insight for all other parameters in particular it showed that the percentage of female flowers b f b m b f the total number of buds b m b f and the bee density ρ have the most significant positive effect on the total predicted yield the pollinators preference to remain on female flowers ϵ the male flowering period σ m and the pollinator s preference to remain on male flowers δ are the next most important parameters increasing the predicted yield furthermore pollinator handling time β is the only parameter with a strongly negative effect on the total predicted yield for this extended model we explore various ranges of d and h in appendix 2 5 model simulations we programmed the simulations in matlab matlab using differential equation solvers ode45 with initial conditions such that 0 of pollinators were p m 1 p m 2 and p m 3 and 100 of pollinators were p f at time t 0 for an orchard of sample of one ha in size parameter values for the total number of flower buds b m male and b f female along with the number of pollinators per 1000 female flowers ρ were used to determine the total number of pollinators for each simulation the simulations were performed in a high performance computing cluster based on centos linux 7 with openlava 3 2 0 load scheduling facility simulation runs were parallelized with a custom script written in r r core team 2020 using the foreach package microsoft and weston 2020 3 results like peace et al 2020 our model predicted that fruit set decreased with decreasing overlap of male and female kiwifruit cultivars in addition we found that different orchard layouts affected fruit set alongside synchrony with the commonly used male row layout outperforming all other layouts fig 4 for the three layouts that would potentially be used by orchardists excluding the extreme layout point the variation in fruit set between layouts was smaller than the variation in fruit set between different hive placement regimes overall the effect of synchrony was less than the effects of both hive setup and orchard layout fig 5 although our values were constrained to a possible mismatch of only three days with less synchrony the potential for fruit set decreases further but in these extreme scenarios better pollination is unlikely to make up for the lack of synchrony placing all hives in a single location resulted in the lowest fruit set across all three field realistic orchards while distributing hives evenly around the orchard resulted in the highest fruit set of the intermediary designs breaking hives into four clusters performed nearly as well as eight and placing two groups of hives one on either side of the orchard performed nearly as well the combination of pulsing and diffusion resulted in each hive effectively pollinating a limited radius from its placement location the extend of white shown in the figures displaying the spatial pattern of fruit set indicates areas with very low fruit set fig 6 the 4 in 2 opp and 8 in 1 and layouts resulted in negligible fruit set across approximately 1 6 and 1 3 and of the orchards respectively roughly equivalent to a 15 30 decline in yield 4 discussion we found that there were effects of both orchard type and hive placement on predicted pollination success for the unrealistic point layout where all male flowers occur in a small corner of the simulated 1 ha orchard changing the location of hives was unable to bring yield up to economical levels for the typical orchard configurations encountered in kiwifruit i e excluding point hive placement had a larger effect than planting regime this finding is potentially good news for orchardists as it is much more straightforward to change where hives are placed in an orchard than to change the existing planting arrangement the latter requires a considerable investment of both time and money both direct expense and loss of income while plants are grafted and growing the hive placements we examined were focused on delivering hives to the perimeter of the orchard as while it may be recommended to distribute hives throughout the orchard for best results goodwin 2012 growers and beekeepers are often constrained by logistics and capacity to this time consuming task at a critically busy time of year we examined the effects of deploying the recommended eight hives ha in eight different of placements at either one two four or eight sites surrounding the orchard of note is that several placements produced very similar results to the theoretical best placement 1 in 8 equal hives at 8 locations around the orchard all the options for four hive drop sites 2 in 4 corner 2 in 4 side 2 in 4 oppsides performed similarly to 1 in 8 equal yielding economical returns as did 4 in 2 side where two groups of four hives were dropped on opposite sides of the orchard this result is of particular importance as it would yield the most pollination success for the least beekeeper effort our model has shown significantly utility in being able to predict optimum and near optimum scenarios that could make a substantial economic benefit for growers a possible shortcoming of our approach is that our model results in circular spheres of influence for each hive or hive group in reality this pattern is likely to be somewhat elliptical probably because of the preference for bees to work down rows rather than across them free 1966 boerma and moradshahi 1975 jay and jay 1984 evans et al 2011 however in an experiment where male flowers were removed from all but one vine a setup similar to our point orchard fruit set was arranged approximately circularly around the male vine testolin 1991 indicating that bees are foraging equally in all directions this being the case our model suggests that there is a benefit to having hives distributed around the perimeter of the orchard and that more locations is generally better but they do not need necessarily to be deployed as single hives to achieve the majority of the benefit the similar performance of several of the orchard layouts may be partly due to our model incorporating a rate of diffusion which led to full coverage of the orchard by bees under most scenarios see also the discussion in the appendix if there are real world factors that decrease this movement of bees through a 1 ha block more divergence in fruit set between layouts might be experienced for example in crops prone to wind damage individual blocks can be smaller than 1 ha and separated by large wind breaks other orchards utilize netting between rows which might modify pollinator movement or have orchards planted in irregular sized blocks that alter the distance pollinators need to travel to reach the entire block our model did not account for varying pollinator numbers due to competing bloom outside the orchard or in fact any wider context for the 1 ha block the power of this model lies in its ability to generate new hypotheses about optimal pollination scenarios and to consider the relative importance of multiple different factors at once additionally we found that optimal hive placement can partially compensate for poor bloom synchrony a key concern not only for kiwifruit growers but also for producers of functionally dioecious crops more generally bloom synchrony in any given season is a combination of the characteristics of the cultivars and their response to the environmental conditions they have experienced factors which are beyond the control of the orchardist during flowering in contrast hive placement and density peace et al 2020 can be rapidly altered in response to observations of conditions and thus limit losses both abm and ode models have provided useful insights into key decisions made by orchardists that potentially have a large economic effect incorporating spatial positioning information is particularly valuable because of the importance of space and time in pollination intuitively we found that hive placement in the orchard has a very large influence on fruit production which is fortunate as it is an easily managed variable compared with plantings of long lived perennial plants it is likely that future models will be able to incorporate more realistic foraging by pollinators using this template and will be able to reveal further insights into methods to optimize pollination credit authorship contribution statement jing li conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing oringal draft

shaw for stimulating discussion that contributed to model development appendix to better support our parameterization on d and h we also simulated the model system with varying values for d and h respectively the results of varying d values ranging from 500 to 3000 are presented in fig 7 the average proportion of fruit set across eight hives placements increases with the maximal pollinator s dispersal rate when d 1500 the predicted range for fruit set is above 80 for both male row and uniform such prediction confirms our selection of the d value in the model simulation fig 8 presents the results of proportion of fruit set in simulated orchards with differing planting regime male row and uniform eight hive replacements and half dispersal rate pollinator s density ranging from 0 001 to 1 the average proportion of fruit set across eight hives placements decreases with increasing half dispersal rate pollinator s density when h 0 01 the predicted range for fruit set is above 80 for both male row and uniform this prediction supports the choice of the h value in our model simulation in section 3 
24365,managers of insect pollinated orchards face many decisions that can significantly influence crop yields including managing pollination through use of beehives or the layout of cultivars in the orchard understanding the relative importance and interactions between these multiple decisions through empirical field trials is rarely possible so modeling approaches can provide valuable insights

equations on a lattice to explore the effects of overlap of male and female flowers hive placements within the orchard and orchard layout on the predicted pollination success in our model hive placement and orchard layout influenced the proportion of fruit set in an orchard more strongly than male and female flowering synchrony simulations with hives distributed evenly around the orchard had the most fruit set while hives located at a single point resulted in relatively low fruit set our model showed that the effect of hive distribution was more important for fruit production than planting regime we have demonstrated how such a model can be used to provide key information for orchardists to optimize their yields our model predicts that while orchard planting decisions are important the consideration of hive placement during flowering is likely to have greater influence on final orchard productivity in functionally dioecious crops 2020 msc 92 10 92b05 keywords

fruit crop and growers have to make decisions about the number and distribution of male and female vines to be planted for pollination honey bees colonies are typically deployed at a stocking rate of eight hives per hectare a service orchardists often pay significant amounts for goodwin 2012 yet placement of hives in an orchard is largely based on logistical constraints for the beekeeper and orchardist rather than what is optimal for pollination in systems such as kiwifruit pollination by managed honey bees is seen as crucial owing to the relative scarcity of wild pollinating species garibaldi et al 2013 howlett et al 2017 potential pollination deficits are mitigated by paying for the pollination service from honey bees it is therefore important for growers to be able to make informed decisions about how best to use these managed pollinators and how that interacts with other relevant decisions they make in in their orchards models can be used to help understand pollination systems and support decision making ramos jiliberto et al 2018 especially for multiple interacting factors where empirical field trials at orchard scales would be required and almost impossible to fully replicate well studied systems such as kiwifruit offer an opportunity to develop models which can be parameterized from the literature and then subsequently used to inform models in other systems different model approaches to pollination have been taken over time including models where pollinators are not specifically taken into account lescourret et al 1998a b agent based models abm broussard et al 2022 and spatially homogeneous pollinator dynamical system approaches peace et al 2020 a number of models addressing internal dynamics of a mellifera populations and their interactions with heterogeneous landscapes also have been developed cf table 1 in joseph et al 2020 but they do not specifically address the relationship between pollination management hive placement sex ratios in dioecious crops orchard layout and pollination efficiency spatial heterogeneity affects pollinator performance with studies reporting edge effects pisanty and mandelik 2015 and that planting regimes influence both insect behavior jay and jay 1984 and pollination success testolin 1991 additionally honey bee hive placement in an orchard can affect pollination success hives that are positioned in a single corner perform less well than when distributed evenly throughout the orchard goodwin 2012 given the profound effects that landscape configuration can have on pollinator performance and crop production it is important to consider how to develop spatially explicit mathematical models of pollination broussard et al 2022 used an abm framework incorporating spatially explicit flowering and pollinator dynamics to predict fruitset and total yield in kiwifruit abm approaches are simulation models that track individual agents and explore system level emergent behaviors broussard and colleagues tracked individual pollinators as they moved across a dynamic orchard collecting and depositing pollen broussard et al 2022 while abms like this are able to incorporate complex individual level details they become computationally expensive and their results can be hard to interpret dynamical systems offer an alternative modeling approach by using aggregate level perspectives and by defining system level dynamics into differential equations such as ordinary differential equations odes while these two modeling approaches can yield different predictions the results when considered can lead to unique insights for example it has been shown that analogous models using odes and abm approaches run in parallel can yield valuable complementary insights into understanding cancer growth scholl 2001 and vector borne pathogens shaw et al 2019 2017 here we use a dynamical systems approach odes to develop a spatially explicit model with dynamic flowering and pollinator behaviors in simulated orchards of realistic size and varying orchard layouts we expand the spatially homogeneous model developed by peace et al 2020 to a spatially explicit system of differential equations arranged on a lattice moving the previous system of equations to a lattice structure allows us to better model the heterogeneity inherent in field conditions movements of bee foragers in the field have been successfully modeled using brownian or lévy movement vallaeys et al 2017 which produce symmetrical predictions for bee movement about the origin but these models do not take into account density dependence there is good evidence that bees change their foraging behavior at high insect densities through a number of mechanisms including rejection of recently visited flowers giurfa and núñez 1992 and decreasing visit duration to flowers with low resource availability keasar et al 1996 as well as increased traveling distance after visiting several unrewarding flowers harder 1990 keasar et al 1996 which would result in density dependent dynamics the real world results of these dynamics have been recorded in kiwifruit with fruit set declining as distance from male vines is increased testolin 1991 to simulate the movement of bees in accordance to observations in the literature we used density dependent stochastic movement between neighboring cells parameterized by holling type ii functions holling 1965 1966 using this ode lattice model we explored the relative effects of different orchard layouts placement of functionally male and female plants a decision made when the orchard is established and can only be changed by regrafting and honey bee hive placement configurations a decision made annually by growers and beekeepers on predicted pollination success 2 material and methods using kiwifruit as a model for functionally dioecious crops we developed and analyzed a mathematical model of pollination dynamics that incorporates key features of plant biology and insect behavior on a 1 hectare orchard in our previous work peace et al 2020 we built a spatially homogeneous model where bees could visit either floral sex with different classes of pollinator corresponding to different loading of viable pollen on the insect body to build on this model and take into account the spatial heterogeneity of the orchard layout and location of beehives we first divided the orchard into a lattice of 100 by 100 cells each cell is one meter by one meter in each cell we assume all conditions for both flower and pollinator are homogeneous however conditions across different cells may vary we first present the model that we used to model the pollination dynamics in one cell without considering the insect movements then we extend it to include insect movements among cells to present the full model over the lattice table 1 describes the model state variables and parameters 2 1 pollination dynamics in one cell of the lattice similarly to the model of peace et al 2020 at any given cell without considering any insect movement across cells yet the pollination dynamics can be described with a combination of flowering dynamics and pollinator dynamics 2 1 1 flowering dynamics we track the number of male and female flowers that have opened using the following differential equations 1a d m d t b m 2 π σ m 2 e t t m 2 2 σ m 2 1b d f d t b f 2 π σ f 2 e t t f 2 2 σ f 2 where t m and t f are the times when the opening rates are highest and σ m and σ f are the variations in these rates of opening with the assumption that each flower is open only for a fixed amount of time we can determine the number of currently open male flowers m t and female flowers f t using the following expressions 2a m t m t m t τ m if t τ m m t elsewhere 2b f t f t f t τ f if t τ f f t elsewhere where τ m and τ f are the numbers of days that male flowers and female flowers remain open 2 1 2 pollinator dynamics pollinator dynamics are modeled with differential equations that divide the pollinator population into sub compartments based on their pollen load pollinators can have a high medium or low pollen load denoted as p m 1 p m 2 and p m 3 respectively or be carrying no pollen denoted as p f these four states were chosen to represent zero and three points along an exponential decay curve seen in the literature broussard et al 2021 in accordance with the base model peace et al 2020 we assume that pollinators completely load up on pollen with a visit to a male flower and deposit some pollen with a visit to a female flower empirical data show that pollen dehisces throughout the morning in kiwifruit becoming limited in the afternoon goodwin 1987 hopping 1990 oh et al 2020 chen et al 1996 this results in pollen availability being highest between 900 and 1300 broadly overlapping with the period of highest insect activity malaboeuf et al 1995 mckay 1978 goodwin 1987 macfarlane and ferguson 1983 within this 4 hour window pollen does not appear to be limiting but is limiting thereafter goodwin 1987 to account for the biological reality that male pollen availability is abundant but limited which cannot be captured accurately in the dynamic model we limit the period of active foraging per day to four hours approximating the window of abundant pollen availability and bee activity goodwin 1987 fig 1 depicts the movement of pollinators between the compartments pollinators that have just visited a male flower have a high pollen load p m 1 these pollinators can either visit another male flower and remain in compartment p m 1 or visit a female flower deposit some pollen and thus be transferred into compartment p m 2 pollinators in compartment p m 2 with a medium pollen load can either visit a male flower acquire more pollen and be transferred into compartment p m 1 or visit a female flower deposit some pollen and be transferred into compartment p m 3 similarly pollinators in compartment p m 3 with a low pollen load can either visit a male flower acquire more pollen and be transferred into compartment p m 1 or visit a female flower deposit all their pollen and be transferred into compartment p f pollinators in compartment p f without any pollen can either visit a female flower and remain in compartment p f or visit a male flower acquire a full load of pollen and be transferred into compartment p m 1 we used the same definitions introduced in our previous work peace et al 2020 of the total rate at which the pollinators visit male and female flowers and floral constancy honey bees have a preference to visit flowers of the same sex as the one they previously visited mckay 1978 howpage 1999 jay and jay 1984 goodwin and steven 1993 peace et al 2020 the number of pollinators in each compartment can be tracked using the following system of differential equations 3a d p m 1 d t α f m 1 α β f m total visitation rate 1 f f m ɛ p m 2 p m 3 p f moves from female to male 1 m f m δ p m 1 moves from male to female 3b d p

f f m ɛ p m 3 moves from female to female 1 f f m ɛ p f moves from female to male where α is the search rate β is the handling time δ and ϵ are the pollinator s preference to remain on male and female flowers respectively the incorporation of eqs 2 into the system of differential equations for the pollinator model 3 results in a system of ordinary differential equations when t min τ m τ f before any open flowers begin to close followed by a system of delayed differential equations with a single delay τ min τ m τ f when min τ m τ f t max τ m τ f and then by a system of delayed differential equations with two fixed delays τ m and τ f this model tracks the number of open male and female flowers m f and the number of pollinators of each type p m 1 p m 2 p m 3 p f as they visit male and female flowers in one cell when the pollinators movements between cells are not yet considered 2 2 the full model extension to the lattice to fully capture the pollination dynamics within the entire orchard we then extended the flower and pollinator dynamics from one cell to the lattice that models the entire orchard first we denote each cell with i j which is located at the i th row and j th column of the lattice in our study we compared four different orchard layouts point male row uniform and one in eight see fig 2 we also studied eight possible bee hive arrangements around the orchard see fig 3 to model the movements of the pollinators from cell to cell in the lattice we assume that 1 the probability of a pollinator moving out of a cell is density dependent which is modeled by a hill function 2 after leaving the previously occupied cell the pollinator will randomly land in one of the 8 neighboring cells or 5 or 3 if an edge or a corner respectively 3 after landing inside a new cell the pollinator will then visit flowers based on their preference for male flowers m or female flowers f 4 all bees will return to their hives at the end of each day and there is no carry over of pollen from day to day let t i j denote the total number flower at cell i j at a given time t 4 t i j f i j m i j and denote p i j the total number pollinator at cell i j at a given time t 5 p i j p m 1 i j p m 2 i j p m 3 i j p f i j for an interior cell i j the population dynamics of the pollinators are governed by the following system of impulsive differential equations during each day for t

j 1 8 for an interior cell i j which has 8 neighboring cells 1 5 for a boundary not a corner cell i j which has 5 neighboring cells 1 3 for a corner cell i j which has 3 neighboring cells under our fourth assumption when a new day starts all pollinators will return to the orchard without carrying any pollen therefore at the beginning of each active period of any given day we assume all pollinators start with p f thus we have when t n t 7 p m 1 i j t 0 p m 2 i j t 0 p m 3 i j t 0 p f i j t p f 0 where p f 0 is the total number of pollinators with initial start status at p f at each cell the flower dynamics is still governed by the following delayed differential equation system f i j t f i j t f i j t τ f if t τ f f i j t elsewhere m i j t m i j t m i j t τ m if t τ m m i j t elsewhere 8 d f i j d t o f e t t f 2 2 σ f 2 o f θ f b f i j 9 d m i j d t o m e t t m 2 2 σ m 2 o m θ m b m i j where f i j t and m i j t are the numbers of flowers that have opened up to time t at cell i j whereas f i j t and m i j t are the total number of opened flowers at a given time t at cell i j b m i j b m i j and b f i j b f i j are the total number of male and female buds flowers in a given season 2 3 measuring pollination at each cell we define the visit that results in transitioning a pollinator from group p m 1 to p m 2 as a type one visit the visit that results in transitioning a pollinator from group p m 2 to p m 3 as a type two visit and the visit that results in transitioning a pollinator from group p m 3 to p f as a type three visit see fig 1 we then define fruit set at cell i j for a day t denoted by y i j t as 10 y i j t 1 1 p 1 v 1 i j t 1 p 2 v 2 i j t 1 p 3 v 3 i j t where v n i j t for n 1 2 3 represents the total number of type n visits that each flower has received at the time of closing day t and p n represents the percentage chance that a single visit will fully pollinate a flower to set fruit for each visit type n the total predicted yield at cell i j denoted y t i j is the fruit set for each day multiplied by the number of female flowers closing on that day summed over all the days 11 y t i j t d f c i j t y i j t where d f c i j t denotes the daily number of female flowers closing at day t in cell i j the total predicted yield proportion over all days at cell i j denoted y p i j is the number of flowers closing on each day multiplied by the fruit set for that day divided by the total number of female flowers in our calculation we use the number of total female flower buds 12 y p i j t d f c i j t y i j t b f i j thus the overall total predicted yield in the orchard denoted y t is 13 y t i j t d f c i j t y i j t and the overall total predicted yield proportion in the orchard denoted y p is 14 y p i j t d f c i j t y i j t i j b f i j 2 4 parameterization all model parameters are listed in table 2 most parameters were already parameterized in our previous model with a sensitivity analysis conducted for them peace et al 2020 we have three new parameters in the extended model d h n whose values are assumed as there was insufficient empirical data to estimate them the range of dispersal values d were parameterized by using the maximum flight speed of honey bees 30 km h wenner 1963 to inform the upper bounds and the value which would result in bees reaching the edge of the 1 ha orchard within the 4 hour foraging period to inform the lower bound the default value was chosen as the value that resulted in which bees reached the edge of the 1 ha orchard within a 30 minute foraging bout the range of the half dispersal rate pollinator s density which is defined as the pollinator per thousand flowers density at which the pollinator reaches its half of the maximal dispersal rate is assumed to be one bee per 1000 flowers to 1000 bees per 1000 flowers encompassing the range of pollinator densities observed in the field plus one order of magnitude goodwin 1987 the baseline value is 10 bees per 1000 flowers a density commonly encountered and above the value required for adequate pollination meaning there is likely to be resource competition the hill coefficient which indicates the steepness of density dependence dispersal rate is included for generality and we choose n 1 for simplicity owing to lack of sufficient data to support an alternative in our previous work peace et al 2020 on the spatially homogeneous base model we conducted a global parameter sensitivity analysis using latin hypercube sampling with the statistical partial rank correlation coefficient technique to investigate parameter uncertainty while this parameter sensitivity analysis did not include the three new parameters d h and n it provides insight for all other parameters in particular it showed that the percentage of female flowers b f b m b f the total number of buds b m b f and the bee density ρ have the most significant positive effect on the total predicted yield the pollinators preference to remain on female flowers ϵ the male flowering period σ m and the pollinator s preference to remain on male flowers δ are the next most important parameters increasing the predicted yield furthermore pollinator handling time β is the only parameter with a strongly negative effect on the total predicted yield for this extended model we explore various ranges of d and h in appendix 2 5 model simulations we programmed the simulations in matlab matlab using differential equation solvers ode45 with initial conditions such that 0 of pollinators were p m 1 p m 2 and p m 3 and 100 of pollinators were p f at time t 0 for an orchard of sample of one ha in size parameter values for the total number of flower buds b m male and b f female along with the number of pollinators per 1000 female flowers ρ were used to determine the total number of pollinators for each simulation the simulations were performed in a high performance computing cluster based on centos linux 7 with openlava 3 2 0 load scheduling facility simulation runs were parallelized with a custom script written in r r core team 2020 using the foreach package microsoft and weston 2020 3 results like peace et al 2020 our model predicted that fruit set decreased with decreasing overlap of male and female kiwifruit cultivars in addition we found that different orchard layouts affected fruit set alongside synchrony with the commonly used male row layout outperforming all other layouts fig 4 for the three layouts that would potentially be used by orchardists excluding the extreme layout point the variation in fruit set between layouts was smaller than the variation in fruit set between different hive placement regimes overall the effect of synchrony was less than the effects of both hive setup and orchard layout fig 5 although our values were constrained to a possible mismatch of only three days with less synchrony the potential for fruit set decreases further but in these extreme scenarios better pollination is unlikely to make up for the lack of synchrony placing all hives in a single location resulted in the lowest fruit set across all three field realistic orchards while distributing hives evenly around the orchard resulted in the highest fruit set of the intermediary designs breaking hives into four clusters performed nearly as well as eight and placing two groups of hives one on either side of the orchard performed nearly as well the combination of pulsing and diffusion resulted in each hive effectively pollinating a limited radius from its placement location the extend of white shown in the figures displaying the spatial pattern of fruit set indicates areas with very low fruit set fig 6 the 4 in 2 opp and 8 in 1 and layouts resulted in negligible fruit set across approximately 1 6 and 1 3 and of the orchards respectively roughly equivalent to a 15 30 decline in yield 4 discussion we found that there were effects of both orchard type and hive placement on predicted pollination success for the unrealistic point layout where all male flowers occur in a small corner of the simulated 1 ha orchard changing the location of hives was unable to bring yield up to economical levels for the typical orchard configurations encountered in kiwifruit i e excluding point hive placement had a larger effect than planting regime this finding is potentially good news for orchardists as it is much more straightforward to change where hives are placed in an orchard than to change the existing planting arrangement the latter requires a considerable investment of both time and money both direct expense and loss of income while plants are grafted and growing the hive placements we examined were focused on delivering hives to the perimeter of the orchard as while it may be recommended to distribute hives throughout the orchard for best results goodwin 2012 growers and beekeepers are often constrained by logistics and capacity to this time consuming task at a critically busy time of year we examined the effects of deploying the recommended eight hives ha in eight different of placements at either one two four or eight sites surrounding the orchard of note is that several placements produced very similar results to the theoretical best placement 1 in 8 equal hives at 8 locations around the orchard all the options for four hive drop sites 2 in 4 corner 2 in 4 side 2 in 4 oppsides performed similarly to 1 in 8 equal yielding economical returns as did 4 in 2 side where two groups of four hives were dropped on opposite sides of the orchard this result is of particular importance as it would yield the most pollination success for the least beekeeper effort our model has shown significantly utility in being able to predict optimum and near optimum scenarios that could make a substantial economic benefit for growers a possible shortcoming of our approach is that our model results in circular spheres of influence for each hive or hive group in reality this pattern is likely to be somewhat elliptical probably because of the preference for bees to work down rows rather than across them free 1966 boerma and moradshahi 1975 jay and jay 1984 evans et al 2011 however in an experiment where male flowers were removed from all but one vine a setup similar to our point orchard fruit set was arranged approximately circularly around the male vine testolin 1991 indicating that bees are foraging equally in all directions this being the case our model suggests that there is a benefit to having hives distributed around the perimeter of the orchard and that more locations is generally better but they do not need necessarily to be deployed as single hives to achieve the majority of the benefit the similar performance of several of the orchard layouts may be partly due to our model incorporating a rate of diffusion which led to full coverage of the orchard by bees under most scenarios see also the discussion in the appendix if there are real world factors that decrease this movement of bees through a 1 ha block more divergence in fruit set between layouts might be experienced for example in crops prone to wind damage individual blocks can be smaller than 1 ha and separated by large wind breaks other orchards utilize netting between rows which might modify pollinator movement or have orchards planted in irregular sized blocks that alter the distance pollinators need to travel to reach the entire block our model did not account for varying pollinator numbers due to competing bloom outside the orchard or in fact any wider context for the 1 ha block the power of this model lies in its ability to generate new hypotheses about optimal pollination scenarios and to consider the relative importance of multiple different factors at once additionally we found that optimal hive placement can partially compensate for poor bloom synchrony a key concern not only for kiwifruit growers but also for producers of functionally dioecious crops more generally bloom synchrony in any given season is a combination of the characteristics of the cultivars and their response to the environmental conditions they have experienced factors which are beyond the control of the orchardist during flowering in contrast hive placement and density peace et al 2020 can be rapidly altered in response to observations of conditions and thus limit losses both abm and ode models have provided useful insights into key decisions made by orchardists that potentially have a large economic effect incorporating spatial positioning information is particularly valuable because of the importance of space and time in pollination intuitively we found that hive placement in the orchard has a very large influence on fruit production which is fortunate as it is an easily managed variable compared with plantings of long lived perennial plants it is likely that future models will be able to incorporate more realistic foraging by pollinators using this template and will be able to reveal further insights into methods to optimize pollination credit authorship contribution statement jing li conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing oringal draft

shaw for stimulating discussion that contributed to model development appendix to better support our parameterization on d and h we also simulated the model system with varying values for d and h respectively the results of varying d values ranging from 500 to 3000 are presented in fig 7 the average proportion of fruit set across eight hives placements increases with the maximal pollinator s dispersal rate when d 1500 the predicted range for fruit set is above 80 for both male row and uniform such prediction confirms our selection of the d value in the model simulation fig 8 presents the results of proportion of fruit set in simulated orchards with differing planting regime male row and uniform eight hive replacements and half dispersal rate pollinator s density ranging from 0 001 to 1 the average proportion of fruit set across eight hives placements decreases with increasing half dispersal rate pollinator s density when h 0 01 the predicted range for fruit set is above 80 for both male row and uniform this prediction supports the choice of the h value in our model simulation in section 3 
24366,identifying sublethal pesticide effects on aquatic organisms is a challenge for environmental risk assessment long term population experiments can help assessing chronic toxicity however population experiments are subject to stochasticity demographic environmental and genetic therefore identifying sublethal chronic effects from noisy data can be difficult model based analysis can support this process we use stochastic age structured population models applied to data from long term population experiments with daphnia galeata in 1l aquaria with and without chronic pesticide treatments diazinon and diuron at sublethal concentrations posterior analysis following bayesian inference of model parameters and states helped choosing an adequate description of life history

introduction the environmental concentrations of pesticides from agricultural and urban sources raise concerns about their effects on aquatic ecosystems liess et al 2021 environmental risk assessment for pesticides is challenging topping et al 2020 due to the following reasons the intermittent nature of many pollution sources e g increased transport during storm events the large number of compounds and their transformation products mixture toxicity effects the large number of potentially affected species and their poorly known biotic interactions partial knowledge about interacting environmental influence factors and intrinsic stochasticity of ecosystem dynamics therefore the effects of these pollutants in aquatic ecosystems can primarily be assessed indirectly by statistical analyses beketov et al 2013 münze et al 2017 duong et al 2021 belaid and sbartai 2021 silva et al 2021 such integrative studies are of high importance as only investigations of the real systems reflect the full complexity of the environment and the biological communities taub 1997a b nevertheless laboratory experiments are important for environmental risk assessment taub 1997a b they are essential for prospective hazard assessment and complementary tools to explore the effects of specific pesticides on population or community dynamics of selected organisms advantages are the better control of pollutants and environmental conditions the limited community complexity and the opportunity of replicating experiments taub 1997b while short term bioassays for the assessment of acute lethal effects based on single species are routinely used for pesticide registration experiments with higher ecological realism did not make it into the registration procedures due to the challenges of standardization and reproducibility taub 1997a riedl et al 2019 however it is also of particular importance to investigate chronic effects of sublethal concentrations as pesticide concentrations in the environment are usually well below acute lethal concentrations and may prevail for longer time periods moschet et al 2014 de souza et al 2020 despite the advantages of laboratory experiments taub 1997a b there remain significant challenges especially for chronic effect studies erickson et al 2014 maintaining stable communities over a longer time span e g several weeks can be difficult already in the absence of pesticides the effect of sublethal concentrations may be small de souza et al 2020 perfect replication of experiments is difficult regarding the reproduction of the initial state as well as environmental conditions during the course of the experiment and demographic stochasticity may be significant for small populations shoemaker et al 2020 these challenges can make the interpretation of the results difficult integrating population modeling into environmental risk assessment can help to address some of the challenges mentioned above forbes et al 2010 raimondo et al 2021 a population or community model that makes it possible to consider many of these complicating factors can be a tool to support the interpretation of experimental results this usually requires a careful model selection process by fitting multiple model versions to the experimental data and the analysis of inferred posterior distributions of model parameters and states to select the most appropriate model and to learn from the corresponding posterior distribution process based models that can be used for this purpose include a deterministic models at the population level e g integral projection models ellner et al 2016 or models that follow the dynamic energy budget approach kooijman 2010 jager 2020 that are straightforward to use for model based inference but do not account for demographic stochasticity b individual based models ibms that describe life history processes at the individual level and can naturally describe demographic stochasticity grimm et al 2005 but are challenging to use for model based inference kattwinkel and reichert 2017 c age or stage structured stochastic population models nisbet and gurney 2004 lande et al 2003 chou and greenman 2016 that can describe demographic stochasticity while introducing less model complexity than individual based models daphnia is a widely used model organism and many models have been developed to describe its population dynamics classical stage structured population models de roos et al 1992 mccauley et al 2008 lamonica et al 2016 have been extended to include different forms of stochasticity preuss et al 2009 ananthasubramaniam et al 2011 metz and diekmann 2014 erickson et al 2014 stochastic population models are particularly relevant when the number of individuals is low and thus demographic stochasticity becomes important nisbet and gurney 2004 in this study we evaluate the chronic effect of sublethal concentrations of the insecticide diazinon and the herbicide diuron on daphnia galeata feeding on algae acutodesmus obliquus this is a well known model system for toxicological studies brede et al 2009 we then apply a careful model selection process and calibrate the resulting daphnia population model to multiple replications of experiments with and without the application of the pesticides the experimental data includes five replicates of up to 100 day long time series of three different life stages of daphnia of a control a treatment with diazinon a treatment with diuron and a combined treatment with diazinon and diuron we used a stochastic age structured discrete individuals population model to account for demographic stochasticity that was large due to the very small initial population size our model is similar to the stage structured model by erickson et al 2014 but uses age classes to more easily account for the delays between the transitions to the next life stages moreover we used a different parameterization for potential time and density dependence of survival in the absence of empirical data at different pesticide concentrations we do not describe the toxic effect explicitly in the model instead we calibrate the model to the control and the pesticide treatments separately and infer the toxic effect from a comparison of the posterior parameter distributions this helps us to identify empirically the mechanism that best describes the observed toxic effect with the model without the need to decide beforehand which model parameters may be affected by the pesticides the goals of the study are to learn if we can infer chronic effects of diazinon and diuron on the crustacean daphnia galeata from long term population data with a stochastic model and to gain experience with the model selection and calibration process that could be useful for future studies 2 material and methods a model design and selection process consists of an a priori phase in which reasonable model structures are suggested based on ecological knowledge the modeling objective the available data and on considerations regarding the description of the most important mechanisms in the system schuwirth et al 2019 and an a posteriori phase in which the final model structure is selected by the predictive performance of the model roberts et al 2017 houlahan et al 2017 a trade off between the quality of fit to the data and model complexity spiegelhalter et al 2002 plummer 2008 spiegelhalter et al 2014 hooten and hobbs 2015 or inference of parameters that characterize potentially relevant processes or that mix different model structures robert 2016 kamary et al 2018 in the following subsections we therefore first discuss the objectives of the experiment and of the accompanying modeling study we describe the experimental setup and the resulting data then we discuss the a priori model design process for this case study and finally the techniques chosen for a posteriori model structure selection 2 1 objectives the objective of the experiments was to investigate chronic effects of sublethal concentrations of a herbicide and an insecticide on a model community of algae and daphnia the model based analysis should support the identification and quantification of effects on fertility and mortality of daphnia in the presence of high stochasticity that limits the reproducibility of the experiments note that we do not model explicitly the effects of pesticides as only one concentration per treatment was tested instead we calibrate the model separately for each treatment and detect the effects of pesticides by observing the differences in the posterior parameter distributions between the four treatments our approach therefore does not require to impose any toxic effect relationship for selected model parameters but it allows us to identify a posteriori which parameters may be affected by the pesticides experiments at different pesticide concentrations would be needed to infer the response as a function of pesticide concentration 2 2 microcosm experiments we established laboratory communities of the crustacean daphnia galeata and the green alga acutodesmus obliquus in 1 liter microcosms daphnia genotypes were selected from a living library of daphnia galeata genotypes previously collected from lakes throughout europe and maintained in animal care facilities at eawag switzerland for the experiment presented here microcosms were innoculated with three daphnia neonates of a single clone from lake garlata it 45 4 9 0 3 n 9 2 4 3 0 e and with green algae acutodesmus obliquus 3 193mg carbon measured by spectrophotometry 800 nm we exposed five microcosms to each of four different treatments control sublethal concentration of an insecticide diazinon nominal concentration of 0 6 nm 186 ng l sublethal concentration of a herbicide diuron nominal concentration of 3 05 nm 711 ng l and the combination of the two pesticides the microcosms were maintained at 21 with a 16 8 light cycle each microcosm was filled with 1 liter of surface water collected from lake greifensee ch 47 2 1 1 6 n 8 4 0 3 0 e prior to use media were filtered pore size 0 45 μ m then autoclaved after autoclaving media were re gassed overnight using sterile filtered compressed air where appropriate diazinon and or diuron was introduced in ethanol final concentration 0 0004 4 μ l ethanol per l water was aged prior to use to limit effect of volatile organics e g kairomones and laboratory conditions maintained at steady state the microcosms were sampled weekly between june and august or until the daphnia population declined to extinction if extinction occurred in the first 2 weeks of the experiment we established new microcosms to replace them we followed a protocol from similar population experiments beckerman et al 2010 dennis et al 2011 because the goal was to assess long term population effects we chose a natural medium lake water from a lake close to the lab and a daphnia species that naturally occurs in this lake keller et al 2008 the specific clone was originally from another lake but acclimated to the same medium and did well in pre experiments under similar conditions the pesticides were chosen based on the following selection criteria they should be stable under experimental conditions to maintain constant concentrations during the experiments some knowledge about their effects on daphnia and algae was already available and they show measurable sub lethal effects at environmentally relevant concentrations the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor diazinon kretschmann et al 2011a b 2012 and the photosystem ii inhibitor diuron nestler et al 2012a b were identified as the most promising candidates wittmer et al 2014 the test concentrations were chosen based on pre experiments aiming at a roughly 20 reduction of the reproduction rate at each sampling event we filtered 30 μ m populations to census the entire population daphnia were classified by size 0 7 mm neonate juvenile 1 2 mm adult and adult reproductive output was assessed by counting the number of eggs in the brood pouch during each population census a subsample of algae 500 μ l was preserved for algal density assessment next 500 ml of media was transferred to a centrifuge bottle and centrifuged at 5000 rpm and 18 for 5 min the supernatant was discarded a subset retained for nutrient analysis and the algal pellet was resuspended in fresh media before being returned to the microcosm fig 1 provides an overview of the time series of adult and juvenile daphnia of eggs and of the fraction of adults without eggs for all microcosms note the high level of demographic noise shown in the time series in figure s 9 in the supplementary material we show qualitative time series of relative fluorescence measurements related to algal densities 2 3 a priori model structure selection 2 3 1 selection of model class with model class we denote the concept underlying the description of the population or the community how to deal with stochasticity and the temporal and spatial resolution of the model the model class does not describe the detailed equations of the model structure we select the model class for our specific problem according to the following considerations community populations as we only have qualitative data from the algae population see figure s 9 in the supplementary material and do not have indications for food limitation we focus on the description of the daphnia population individuals the small number of individuals three juveniles at the beginning of the experiment and the lack of information to distinguish the individuals during the time course of the experiment suggest using a discrete individuals model that accounts for the discrete nature of the population but does not distinguish the individuals traits the resolution of life stages by the model makes it possible to profit from the full information content of the data increasing the resolution of the model to age classes allows us to better describe the different residence times in different life stages without additional effort life stages are then associated with sets of age classes as the data does not distinguish other traits neither does the model stochasticity due to the small number of individuals demographic stochasticity has a large effect on the population environmental stochasticity was minimized in the experimental setup genetic stochasticity is not relevant because the populations consist of asexually reproducing clones we thus consider demographic stochasticity by going for probabilistic descriptions of birth and death processes space the experiments were carried out in homogeneous microcosms without spatial resolution in observations we thus choose not to resolve the spatial dimension by the model time a discrete time model with the same daily resolution for both time and age simplifies the model description as proceeding one time step increases age by one age class the choice of a stochastic age structured discrete population model in discrete time allows us to formulate a mechanistically correct model structure with the processes of reproduction aging and mortality that naturally contains demographic stochasticity using an age rather than a stage structured model allows us to consider different retention times in different life stages avoids numerical diffusion in the aging process and provides a more detailed description of the population at minor additional costs on the other hand this model uses empirical parameterizations of growth reproduction and mortality processes going beyond such an empirical description could not extract more information from the data nevertheless this model allows us to formulate ecological hypotheses by different parameterizations of these processes and to test these with the data 2 3 2 formulation of model structure model structure formulation within the model class selected in the previous section requires the specification of the number of age classes and how the numbers of individuals in these classes are related through mathematical relations for reproduction here egg production aging and mortality survival in addition to relate model output to observations a description of the observation process is needed individuals are distributed into n e n j n a age classes of length δ t 1 day each where n e 3 n j 5 and n a 45 are the numbers of egg juvenile and adult age classes respectively leading to an instar time of n e δ t 3 days a maturation age of n j δ t 5 days and a maximum age of n j n a δ t 50 days see fig 2 note that δ t defines both the time step for the temporal evolution of the model and age class length we assume every adult produces eggs according to a general fertility distribution f as each adult only gives birth every n e days the distribution of eggs in their different age classes and at time t 1 d are given by 1 e 1 t 1 d i 1 n a j 1 a i t n e f θ f i 2 e i t 1 d e i 1 t i 2 n e here e i t is the number of eggs in egg age class i at time t a i t is the number of adults in adult age class i at time t and θ f i are the parameters of the fertility distribution for adults in age class i the square brackets a i t n e at the top of the sum represent the number of adults that give birth at this time step if necessary rounded down to an integer note that we ignore mortality of eggs in eq 2 aging and mortality of individuals across age classes is defined by 3 j i t 1 d b j i 1 t s i j t j 1 j n j a 1 a n a i 1 n j 4 a i t 1 d b a i 1 t s i a t j 1 j n j a 1 a n a i 1 n a where j i is the number of juvenile individuals in juvenile age class i a i is the number of adult individuals in adult age class i and b is a binomial distribution whose second argument s i j or s i a define the average surviving fractions of adults a or juveniles j of age class i within one day respectively note that the number of juveniles in age class 0 is the number of eggs in age class n e j 0 e n e and that the number of adults in age class 0 is the number of juveniles in age class n j a 0 j n j the observation process is then defined using the sum of individuals among age classes within stages given by 5 e obs t n i 1 n e e i t σ obs 6 j obs t n i 1 n j j i t σ obs 7 a obs t n i 1 n a a i t σ obs where n is a normal distribution with standard deviation σ obs 1 describing complete counting of all individuals in the three developmental stages fig 2 although this distribution does not represent the results of a count process it will only be evaluated at non negative integer values that represent the observations this observation model serves primarily the purpose of supporting convergence of the inference algorithm allowing only for small deviations from actual counts that can be assumed to have only minor errors if the populations would become large in the course of the experiment we would have to replace this observation model with a model that accounts for larger errors for larger populations introducing such an observation process we make our model hierarchical in the context of what are typically described as a state space models in the ecological literature auger méthé et al 2021 newman et al 2022 2 3 3 formulation of hypotheses and associated model versions we can now formulate different ecological hypotheses to be tested against data leading to different model versions within the overarching model structure note that this has been an iterative process where identified deficits of models from earlier iterations provided inspiration regarding hypotheses to be tested during this iterative process we tested hypotheses regarding the fertility distribution as well as density and time dependence of mortality assuming fertility is independent of age in eq 1 leads to an egg distribution given by 8 e 1 t j 1 1 n e i 1 n a a i t f θ f where the square brackets 1 n e i 1 n a a i t at the top of the sum represent the total number of adults that give birth at this time step if necessary rounded down to an integer different assumptions can be made for the choice of the distribution f leading to different model versions we used four hypotheses for fertility the labels p n pz and nz are used to label the model versions p poisson distribution f θ f p f to describe the number of new eggs as a single distribution with the mean equal to the fecundity f mean number of eggs per individual n negative binomial distribution f θ f nb f r often used as an empirical distribution of overdispersed discrete observations lindén and mäntyniemi 2011 here parameterized with the mean equal to the fecundity f and the individual dispersion parameter r pz zero inflated poisson distribution f θ f pz c π where we assume that there is an excess fraction of adults π that does not produce eggs and the other fraction 1 π produces eggs according to a poisson distribution with a mean clutch size of c f 1 π where f c 1 π remains the effective fecundity as above note that π is the excess fraction of adults without eggs in addition to the probability for zero eggs described by the poisson distribution nz zero inflated negative binomial distribution f θ f nbz c r π where we combine the negative binomial distribution nb with zero inflation as for the poisson distribution π characterizes the excess fraction of adults without eggs in addition to the probability of zero eggs of the negative binomial distribution a large value of the dispersion parameter r reduces the fertility distribution of model version n to that of model version p and analogously for model version nz to pz setting π 0 leading to c f reduces model version pz to p and version nz to n respectively the more complex models thus reduce to the simpler models in a nested design fig 3 see supplementary section s 1 for a detailed description of fertility distributions and their numerical implementation note that despite not being mechanistic these distributional assumptions are typically used for describing count data e g egg distributions lindén and mäntyniemi 2011 brooks et al 2019 we then select hypotheses for mortality by parameterizing the mean survival fractions s j a in eqs 3 and 4 assuming mean survival fractions to be equal among age classes and stages and described by a general time and density dependent expression given by 9 s t j 1 j n j a 1 a n a exp k 0 k 1 t δ t k c i 1 n j j i t i 1 n a a i t δ t where k 0 is the base mortality rate k 1 is a time dependent mortality rate coefficient associated to variation in environmental conditions while k c is a coefficient of density dependent mortality or crowding table 1 technical details of the implementation of the mortality rate can be found in the supplementary section s 2 varying the parameters of eq 9 leads to a total of four nested hypotheses on the different processes affecting mortality base model no time and density dependence k 1 0 k c 0 model extensions t only time dependent mortality k 1 0 k c 0 c only density dependent mortality k 1 0 k c 0 tc time and density dependent mortality k 1 0 k c 0 again the simpler model structures can be obtained by setting parameters to specific values in this case zero note that explicit time dependence of mortality seems to be a strange assumption for an ecological model this hypothesis entered the model selection process at a later iteration as the initial increase and fast decline of the populations for some treatments could not be described otherwise combining the four hypotheses for fertility and the four hypotheses for mortality we obtain 16 different nested model versions fig 3 to be fitted to the data with up to six model parameters table 1 the priors of the parameters have been chosen to be quite wide and generally for most of the model versions the parameters are identifiable see section 3 1 3 these nested model versions will allow us to infer the need for model extensions by the marginal posterior of the corresponding parameters 2 3 4 model application strategy given r 5 replicated population time series data per treatment and a model version with n θ parameters each model version can be fitted to the data separately for every treatment using at least two strategies j joint fit the model is fitted jointly to the data of all replicas leading to a total of n θ parameters r replica by replica fit inference is split into r independent fits of n θ parameters leading to a total of r n θ parameters given replicated time series data for the three stages y obs combining model versions and application strategies we end up with 32 models to make inference with for every treatment each model can be represented by the joint probability distribution 10 p y obs y θ p y obs y θ p y θ p θ where y are the internal model states numbers of individuals of each age class at each time step p y obs y θ is the observation model p y θ is the age structured population model p θ is the prior of the model parameters θ f r π k 0 k 1 k c table 1 for the model application strategies j and r 2 4 a posteriori model structure selection in this study we do not have sufficient data to split the time series into a calibration and a validation period for using cross validation for model selection roberts et al 2017 houlahan et al 2017 this would require stable or multiple increase and decline patterns in both of these time periods to have all relevant patterns available for calibration as well as for validation however as explained in section 2 2 our time series typically show an increase in population size followed by a decline with some superimposed fluctuations see fig 1 this does not allow for a sufficiently good model calibration with using only the first part of the time series in addition the variation among replicated experiments indicate strong stochasticity so that the predictive performance of even the best model can only be quite poor see also section 4 the use of information criteria that are based on a trade off between model fit and model complexity is the most widely applied alternative to cross validation spiegelhalter et al 2002 johnson and omland 2004 plummer 2008 spiegelhalter et al 2014 hooten and hobbs 2015 however these criteria have some conceptual problems o hagan 1995 tenan et al 2014 robert 2016 tendeiro and kiers 2019 and they do not help to improve the ecological understanding for this reason we prefer to primarily base our considerations on a technique that provides more ecological insight nevertheless we include one of these criteria the deviance information criterion dic in our analysis for comparative purposes see section s 3 and figure s 1 in the supplementary material as we only have a relatively small number of hypotheses to test analyzing marginal posterior distributions of model parameters in a nested model structure as outlined in section 2 3 3 seems to be an adequate model structure selection technique for this study in this approach comparing the marginal posteriors of model parameters with their specific values for a simpler structure allows us to assess the need for additional structural elements if we would have to decide between structurally different models that cannot easily be formulated in a nested structure mixture model estimation would have been a suitable alternative kamary et al 2018 in addition to the identification of relevant processes by marginal posterior distributions of individual parameters we analyze the typical behavior of the model by performing simulations propagating the marginal posterior of all model parameters marginalizing over the states but still joint for all parameters this can be seen as a substitute of cross validation as it does not consider state information explicitly only implicitly through the posterior of the parameters due to the high variability of the replicates that indicates a high stochasticity in the actual microcosms we expect a high prediction uncertainty for these simulations 2 5 numerical methods and implementation bayesian inference for each of the model versions was done separately for each of the four treatments by gibbs sampling from the joint posterior of model parameters and states gelman et al 2003 the implementation was based on the software jags plummer 2003 that was called from r r core team 2021 via its interface rjags http cran r project org package rjags five markov chains with 1 0 6 iterations were run and for each of them the first half was cut to eliminate burn in see also figure s 2 in the supplementary material the data considered in section 3 as well as code to reproduce the results are publicly accessible at https github com gpalam daphnia 3 results to explore the required and identifiable model structure for the data from our experiments we start the analysis with an a posteriori model selection process for the treatment with diazinon dz as this affects daphnia most directly section 3 1 despite the small amount of data the model parameters turn out to be identifiable even for the most complex of the investigated model structures we then proceed with a comparison of all treatments based on the full model to test whether the conclusions regarding the relevance of processes and the need for extended process parameterizations are valid for the other treatments as well section 3 2 3 1 a posteriori model selection we performed a model selection process as described in section 2 4 for the experiments with diazinon treatment testing the 16 model versions described in fig 3 and both application strategies j and r section 2 3 4 3 1 1 convergence we fitted all the model versions to the time series data and checked for convergence of the markov chains the models with poisson fertility and zero inflation pz clearly did not converge see log posterior chains in figure s 2 in the supplementary material the fraction of zero inflation π tended to approach unity whereas the clutch size c became large to keep a reasonable fecundity f c 1 π the inference algorithm appeared to widen the fertility distribution by increasing zero inflation indicating that the negative binomial distribution with its dispersion parameter is better suited to describe fertility the pz model versions were thus discarded from further analysis for poor convergence due to structural deficits none of the other model versions showed severe convergence problems 3 1 2 model output and predictions next we qualitatively discuss the posterior model predictions and rely on the posterior marginals of the parameters for model selection see section 3 1 3 below the predictions based on the posterior marginal of the parameters still joint for all parameters but marginalized over the states are used as a replacement for cross validation see section 2 4 in principle this is a sensitive test for stochastic models because in contrast to the inferred time series of the states the parameters do not contain detailed information about the time series of the data and thus represent typical model behavior however as already mentioned in section 2 4 replication of the data is very poor indicating high stochasticity as the supplementary figures s 3 and s 5 and to a lesser extent the supplementary figures s 4 and s 6 demonstrate this leads to a high uncertainty in predictions induced by the high stochasticity of the model model versions n nz nzt show a general improvement of model predictions compared to the corresponding poisson model versions allowing more variability in the egg time series however predictions obtained using models n and nz show unrealistic population growth in fact all models without time dependent mortality do not show the typical extinction of the populations in the experiments this can be corrected using models with time dependent mortality e g nzt which are able to capture population decline and lead to a better fit of the states 3 1 3 marginal posterior model parameter distributions all marginal parameter distributions except the one for k c are either shifted from or narrower than their priors indicating good identifiability despite the small number of data points see fig 4 and supplementary figures s 7 s 8 this also indicates a minor dependence of the results on the prior parameter distributions over dispersion and zero inflation are important for a realistic description of the empirical egg distributions all model fits especially for replicas three and four show a significant over dispersion quantified by the parameter α equal to the variance divided by the mean α 1 compared to poisson α 1 fig 4 a all models with zero inflation led to zero inflation of 60 to 90 fig 4 b note that results for model pz are not reliable for convergence reasons see section 3 1 1 marginal posterior analysis shows no significant effect of crowding as the posterior coefficient of density dependent mortality k c remains with the prior and leads to a very small contribution to the mortality rate when multiplied with typical population sizes fig 4 c on the other hand we observe a significant effect of time dependent mortality on population dynamics as the marginal posteriors of the coefficients of time dependent mortality k 1 are always significantly larger than zero fig 4 d this effect can be an indication of cumulative effects of diazinon unless the other treatments would show this effect also to stress the importance of the single mechanisms associated to the relevant parameters in fig 4 we show a subset of the simplest model versions see supplementary figures s 7 and s 8 for a complete comparison of all the parameters for all the model versions the two dimensional marginals plots of the posterior parameter distribution see fig 5 show strong negative correlation between the mortality parameters k 0 and k 1 and positive correlation between the parameters c π and r all these results have a clear ecological interpretation k 0 and k 1 both affect mortality positively which results in a negative posterior correlation the clutch size c and the fraction of adults without eggs π lead to a mean fecundity of f c 1 π as the model results are sensitive to the mean fecundity this leads to a positive correlation of c and π overdispersion can either be increased by decreasing values of r or increasing values of π which leads to a positive correlation of these parameters finally c and r are positively correlated because of their positive correlation with π 3 1 4 model selection the results outlined in the previous section are the basis for our reasoning for model selection for nested stochastic ecological model versions table 2 the poisson fertility distribution p clearly demonstrates the difficulty of model structure selection for stochastic models despite the small variance of this distribution a model fit is always possible with low probability due to the stochastic nature of the model only the extensions to negative binomial fertility distributions and to zero inflation demonstrate the weakness of the poisson assumption lindén and mäntyniemi 2011 brooks et al 2019 with strong evidence for the need of these extensions with the models n and nz this need is clearly seen by the marginal posteriors of the parameters α and π in fig 4 which indicate values significantly different from 1 and 0 respectively the result that the joint fit for the model n requires a higher overdispersion than any of the replica fits for this model may be an indication of a structural weakness of this model numerically the need of overdispersion and zero inflation is quantified by the means and standard deviations of the associated parameters given in table 2 second column which demonstrate a significant deviation from the values associated to a poisson fertility distribution note that in this case lack of convergence reveals a structural deficit of the model pz it does not converge as zero inflation tends towards unity and clutch size tends to very large values to keep effective fecundity f c 1 π at a reasonable level finally both marginal posterior analysis and predictions with posterior parameters clearly indicate the need for an increase in mortality over time in the microcosms with diazinon treatment in fact total mortality in models with time dependent mortality k 0 20 k 1 0 23 0 02 d 1 becomes three times higher at the end of the experiment k 0 60 k 1 0 34 0 05 d 1 compared to the total mortality of models without time dependent mortality k 0 0 11 0 008 d 1 similarly we found that density dependence seems not to be relevant for these microcosms in fact the mortality due to crowding k c i 1 n j j i t i 1 n a a i t computed when the population reaches its maximum size is at least one order of magnitude smaller than the average total mortality these arguments were formulated in an iterative process of testing and discarding model versions leading to the selection of the model nztj with a zero inflated negative binomial distribution for fertility and an increasing mortality rate with time for the treatments with diazinon model nztj clearly has the correct behavior with finally leading to extinction of the population in this model version all parameters are identifiable and π and k 1 are clearly different from zero indicating strong evidence for zero inflation and increasing mortality with time and r indicating strong overdispersion of the negative binomial fertility distribution compared to the poisson distribution this choice is confirmed by classical model selection metrics see figure s 1 in supplementary section s 3 the nested model structures made it possible to assess the importance of model extensions by bayesian inference and analysis of marginal posterior parameter distributions giving results that are much easier to explain and communicate than abstract numbers that represent information criteria or bayes factors 3 2 comparison of treatments the careful model structure selection process for the diazinon treatments summarized in table 2 prepares us for the comparative analysis of the different treatments for this analysis we have to consider the zero inflated negative binomial distribution for fertility a potential increase in mortality during the experiment and we will focus on the joint evaluation of all replica for each treatment keeping the replica specific treatments to visualize the variability among replicated experiments although this model nzt is the most parsimonious model for the diazinon treatment as all parameters are identifiable we choose the model nztc that considers a potential density dependence of daphnia mortality for the comparison to check whether density dependence could be an issue for one of the other treatments fig 6 shows the marginal posterior densities of some combinations of the six model parameters for all four treatments these results show a clear separation of average mortality between the treatments with and without the insecticide diazinon fig 6 panel i as the marginals for the parameter of time dependence of the mortality rate demonstrates parameter k 1 in fig 6 panel e the increase in mortality over time identified in section 3 1 3 for the diazinon treatment seems to be a consequence of diazinon and not of generally deteriorating conditions in the microcosms for the treatments that do not contain diazinon the values of this parameter are compatible with zero effective fecundity seems also to increase for the diazinon treatments fig 6 panel i although this increase is less significant than the one we observe for mortality and mortality slope this difference is mostly caused by an increase in the fraction of adults without eggs i e by a decrease in zero inflation parameter π fig 6 panel b and not by the average clutch size that remains around 3 eggs per individual in all treatments fig 6 panel a the differences in the density dependence parameter k c fig 6 panel f may be caused by the better identifiability of this parameter for the treatments without diazinon due to the larger numbers of individuals reached for some treatments see fig 1 in all cases the order of magnitude of the crowding parameter makes its effect negligible for all treatments so that these differences are not relevant for the model outcomes fig 7 shows the time series of posterior knowledge of the number of adult individuals for all the treatments and replicates as obtained by the model red areas as well as the posterior predictions for potential future experiments gray areas an apparent feature of the unconditioned predictions are the large uncertainties resulting from the high demographic stochasticity of the model which reflects the high stochasticity in the data as already the poor replicability of the data demonstrates see fig 1 we cannot expect small prediction uncertainties by the model see also supplementary figures s 10 s 11 for the time series of posterior knowledge of the number of individuals in all developmental stages for all the treatments and replicates and supplementary figures s 12 s 15 for all plots of two dimensional marginals of the posterior parameter distribution for the four treatments 4 discussion to analyze the daphnia population dynamics in our experiments we chose to use an age structured discrete individuals model to consider the observed life stages and to account for demographic stochasticity of the initially small populations the model structure was formulated as a discrete time model with the processes of reproduction aging and mortality this structure was extended to different model versions based on different distributional assumptions for fertility and different parameterizations of the mortality rate bayesian inference was performed for a joint description of replicated experiments and for a replica specific description for each treatment separately with this population based approach we expect to be able to extract as much information as possible from the data forbes et al 2009 2011 as it allows us to investigate shifts in inferred parameter values that characterize different processes across different treatments the high variability between replicated experiments with the same treatment was a strong indication for the need of using a stochastic model our approach is similar to the one by erickson et al 2014 except that we use an age instead of a stage structured model and a different parameterization for potential density dependence of survival also as we only have experimental data for one concentration of each pesticide and their combination we do not formulate a model for the toxic effect erickson et al 2014 by fitting all parameters for each treatment separately and interpreting the resulting shifts in the marginal posterior parameter distribution relative to the control we do not have to make any assumptions about the shape of the response curve nor on the processes that are affected by the pesticide this gives more flexibility in identifying potential treatment effects but also implies that we cannot use the model to make predictions for other pesticide concentrations for this purpose a different experimental design that covers the range of relevant concentrations kreyling et al 2018 would be necessary the high variability among the observations for different replica of the same treatment led to corresponding differences in posterior parameter distributions for replica specific inference as all daphnid individuals were of the same clone and the environmental conditions were kept identical to the degree possible these results can best be explained by remaining mainly demographic stochasticity for this reason joint calibration of all data from replicated experiments using a model that accounts for demographic stochasticity seemed to be the most adequate model application strategy model selection based on the marginal posterior parameter distributions that characterize the different model versions and based on the joint calibration approach led to the conclusions that i modeling fertility with a zero inflated negative binomial distribution leads to a better fit than without zero inflation or with a poisson distribution ii there was no significant effect of density dependence on mortality iii variability resulted primarily from stochasticity in fertility and mortality iv treatments with sublethal concentrations of the insecticide diazinon showed a significant increase in mortality over time as well as in average mortality over the duration of the experiment the same experiments also showed a less significant increase in effective fecundity caused by an increase of the number of adults without eggs the need to account for overdispersion compared to a poisson distribution to appropriately describe variability of the number of eggs across individuals in daphnia populations has been found in many other studies also and in many of those it was also described by a negative binomial distribution delignette muller et al 2014 the increase in mortality is very clear and is an expected result for insecticide treatments that has been reported in other studies also erickson et al 2014 increased fertility has been reported as a possible stress response of daphnia for example in response to kairomones liu and steiner 2014 or presence of fish boersma et al 1999 but also reduced fertility has been observed in response to diazinon fernandez casalderrey et al 1995 as our results regarding fertility are less significant than the effects in mortality it remains unclear whether this result is a true response of the individuals or just an artifact of the high stochasticity in the experiments that would decrease with a larger sample size this would need further investigation our results indicate both the potential of model based analysis of data that are difficult to interpret directly due to high in this case primarily demographic stochasticity as well as the difficulties of drawing final conclusions from such data even with the use of a model that considers the dominant cause of stochasticity the limited amount of replicates given the high demographic stochasticity constrains the complexity of the model structures that still leads to identifiable parameters interesting extensions to be further investigated include adding variability in residence times in different life stages instar period and maturation age are assumed to be constant and adding age dependence to fertility and mortality parameters although we observed little difference in the results when using different survival rates for adults and juveniles a further advantage of the model based analysis of the results is the potential to learn for the design of future experiments the potential gain of information by increasing the number of individuals at the start of the experiment to reduce demographic stochasticity or to increase the number of replications could be investigated to find an optimal compromise between experimental effort and gain of information 5 conclusion in this paper we formulate a set of stochastic age structured discrete population models to analyze experimental data with clonal populations of daphnia galeata that were exposed to sub lethal concentrations of two different pesticides we use a nested multi model approach to make inference with and select among model versions in a way that simplifies model comparison the development of model versions has been performed in an iterative way combining quantitative ecological hypothesis formulation and bayesian inference to provide improved insights into the effects of pesticides on daphnia population dynamics the developed pipeline enables us to identify the main processes affecting population dynamics of daphnia despite the high level of demographic stochasticity observed in the experiments a zero inflated negative binomial distribution provides the best description of fertility for all pesticide treatments while in the treatments with the insecticide diazinon the marginal posterior of the slope of time dependent mortality is significantly greater than zero showing a significant chronic effects of the insecticide on the populations in sum our approach turned out to be adequate for identifying relevant ecological processes affecting reproduction and mortality of daphnia using computationally cheap techniques that complement classical model selection metrics moreover the models we presented can be easily generalized to describe different ecological systems and extended to

24366,identifying sublethal pesticide effects on aquatic organisms is a challenge for environmental risk assessment long term population experiments can help assessing chronic toxicity however population experiments are subject to stochasticity demographic environmental and genetic therefore identifying sublethal chronic effects from noisy data can be difficult model based analysis can support this process we use stochastic age structured population models applied to data from long term population experiments with daphnia galeata in 1l aquaria with and without chronic pesticide treatments diazinon and diuron at sublethal concentrations posterior analysis following bayesian inference of model parameters and states helped choosing an adequate description of life history characteristics under the specific experimental conditions a zero inflated negative binomial distribution for reproduction and mortality without density dependence for the insecticide treatments the inferred marginal posterior parameter distributions indicated the need for a mortality rate that increases with time indicating cumulative chronic toxic effects of diazinon on daphnia populations with

introduction the environmental concentrations of pesticides from agricultural and urban sources raise concerns about their effects on aquatic ecosystems liess et al 2021 environmental risk assessment for pesticides is challenging topping et al 2020 due to the following reasons the intermittent nature of many pollution sources e g increased transport during storm events the large number of compounds and their transformation products mixture toxicity effects the large number of potentially affected species and their poorly known biotic interactions partial knowledge about interacting environmental influence factors and intrinsic stochasticity of ecosystem dynamics therefore the effects of these pollutants in aquatic ecosystems can primarily be assessed indirectly by statistical analyses beketov et al 2013 münze et al 2017 duong et al 2021 belaid and sbartai 2021 silva et al 2021 such integrative studies are of high importance as only investigations of the real systems reflect the full complexity of the environment and the biological communities taub 1997a b nevertheless laboratory experiments are important for environmental risk assessment taub 1997a b they are essential for prospective hazard assessment and complementary tools to explore the effects of specific pesticides on population or community dynamics of selected organisms advantages are the better control of pollutants and environmental conditions the limited community complexity and the opportunity of replicating experiments taub 1997b while short term bioassays for the assessment of acute lethal effects based on single species are routinely used for pesticide registration experiments with higher ecological realism did not make it into the registration procedures due to the challenges of standardization and reproducibility taub 1997a riedl et al 2019 however it is also of particular importance to investigate chronic effects of sublethal concentrations as pesticide concentrations in the environment are usually well below acute lethal concentrations and may prevail for longer time periods moschet et al 2014 de souza et al 2020 despite the advantages of laboratory experiments taub 1997a b there remain significant challenges especially for chronic effect studies erickson et al 2014 maintaining stable communities over a longer time span e g several weeks can be difficult already in the absence of pesticides the effect of sublethal concentrations may be small de souza et al 2020 perfect replication of experiments is difficult regarding the reproduction of the initial state as well as environmental conditions during the course of the experiment and demographic stochasticity may be significant for small populations shoemaker et al 2020 these challenges can make the interpretation of the results difficult integrating population modeling into environmental risk assessment can help to address some of the challenges mentioned above forbes et al 2010 raimondo et al 2021 a population or community model that makes it possible to consider many of these complicating factors can be a tool to support the interpretation of experimental results this usually requires a careful model selection process by fitting multiple model versions to the experimental data and the analysis of inferred posterior distributions of model parameters and states to select the most appropriate model and to learn from the corresponding posterior distribution process based models that can be used for this purpose include a deterministic models at the population level e g integral projection models ellner et al 2016 or models that follow the dynamic energy budget approach kooijman 2010 jager 2020 that are straightforward to use for model based inference but do not account for demographic stochasticity b individual based models ibms that describe life history processes at the individual level and can naturally describe demographic stochasticity grimm et al 2005 but are challenging to use for model based inference kattwinkel and reichert 2017 c age or stage structured stochastic population models nisbet and gurney 2004 lande et al 2003 chou and greenman 2016 that can describe demographic stochasticity while introducing less model complexity than individual based models daphnia is a widely used model organism and many models have been developed to describe its population dynamics classical stage structured population models de roos et al 1992 mccauley et al 2008 lamonica et al 2016 have been extended to include different forms of stochasticity preuss et al 2009 ananthasubramaniam et al 2011 metz and diekmann 2014 erickson et al 2014 stochastic population models are particularly relevant when the number of individuals is low and thus demographic stochasticity becomes important nisbet and gurney 2004 in this study we evaluate the chronic effect of sublethal concentrations of the insecticide diazinon and the herbicide diuron on daphnia galeata feeding on algae acutodesmus obliquus this is a well known model system for toxicological studies brede et al 2009 we then apply a careful model selection process and calibrate the resulting daphnia population model to multiple replications of experiments with and without the application of the pesticides the experimental data includes five replicates of up to 100 day long time series of three different life stages of daphnia of a control a treatment with diazinon a treatment with diuron and a combined treatment with diazinon and diuron we used a stochastic age structured discrete individuals population model to account for demographic stochasticity that was large due to the very small initial population size our model is similar to the stage structured model by erickson et al 2014 but uses age classes to more easily account for the delays between the transitions to the next life stages moreover we used a different parameterization for potential time and density dependence of survival in the absence of empirical data at different pesticide concentrations we do not describe the toxic effect explicitly in the model instead we calibrate the model to the control and the pesticide treatments separately and infer the toxic effect from a comparison of the posterior parameter distributions this helps us to identify empirically the mechanism that best describes the observed toxic effect with the model without the need to decide beforehand which model parameters may be affected by the pesticides the goals of the study are to learn if we can infer chronic effects of diazinon and diuron on the crustacean daphnia galeata from long term population data with a stochastic model and to gain experience with the model selection and calibration process that could be useful for future studies 2 material and methods a model design and selection process consists of an a priori phase in which reasonable model structures are suggested based on ecological knowledge the modeling objective the available data and on considerations regarding the description of the most important mechanisms in the system schuwirth et al 2019 and an a posteriori phase in which the final model structure is selected by the predictive performance of the model roberts et al 2017 houlahan et al 2017 a trade off between the quality of fit to the data and model complexity spiegelhalter et al 2002 plummer 2008 spiegelhalter et al 2014 hooten and hobbs 2015 or inference of parameters that characterize potentially relevant processes or that mix different model structures robert 2016 kamary et al 2018 in the following subsections we therefore first discuss the objectives of the experiment and of the accompanying modeling study we describe the experimental setup and the resulting data then we discuss the a priori model design process for this case study and finally the techniques chosen for a posteriori model structure selection 2 1 objectives the objective of the experiments was to investigate chronic effects of sublethal concentrations of a herbicide and an insecticide on a model community of algae and daphnia the model based analysis should support the identification and quantification of effects on fertility and mortality of daphnia in the presence of high stochasticity that limits the reproducibility of the experiments note that we do not model explicitly the effects of pesticides as only one concentration per treatment was tested instead we calibrate the model separately for each treatment and detect the effects of pesticides by observing the differences in the posterior parameter distributions between the four treatments our approach therefore does not require to impose any toxic effect relationship for selected model parameters but it allows us to identify a posteriori which parameters may be affected by the pesticides experiments at different pesticide concentrations would be needed to infer the response as a function of pesticide concentration 2 2 microcosm experiments we established laboratory communities of the crustacean daphnia galeata and the green alga acutodesmus obliquus in 1 liter microcosms daphnia genotypes were selected from a living library of daphnia galeata genotypes previously collected from lakes throughout europe and maintained in animal care facilities at eawag switzerland for the experiment presented here microcosms were innoculated with three daphnia neonates of a single clone from lake garlata it 45 4 9 0 3 n 9 2 4 3 0 e and with green algae acutodesmus obliquus 3 193mg carbon measured by spectrophotometry 800 nm we exposed five microcosms to each of four different treatments control sublethal concentration of an insecticide diazinon nominal concentration of 0 6 nm 186 ng l sublethal concentration of a herbicide diuron nominal concentration of 3 05 nm 711 ng l and the combination of the two pesticides the microcosms were maintained at 21 with a 16 8 light cycle each microcosm was filled with 1 liter of surface water collected from lake greifensee ch 47 2 1 1 6 n 8 4 0 3 0 e prior to use media were filtered pore size 0 45 μ m then autoclaved after autoclaving media were re gassed overnight using sterile filtered compressed air where appropriate diazinon and or diuron was introduced in ethanol final concentration 0 0004 4 μ l ethanol per l water was aged prior to use to limit effect of volatile organics e g kairomones and laboratory conditions maintained at steady state the microcosms were sampled weekly between june and august or until the daphnia population declined to extinction if extinction occurred in the first 2 weeks of the experiment we established new microcosms to replace them we followed a protocol from similar population experiments beckerman et al 2010 dennis et al 2011 because the goal was to assess long term population effects we chose a natural medium lake water from a lake close to the lab and a daphnia species that naturally occurs in this lake keller et al 2008 the specific clone was originally from another lake but acclimated to the same medium and did well in pre experiments under similar conditions the pesticides were chosen based on the following selection criteria they should be stable under experimental conditions to maintain constant concentrations during the experiments some knowledge about their effects on daphnia and algae was already available and they show measurable sub lethal effects at environmentally relevant concentrations the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor diazinon kretschmann et al 2011a b 2012 and the photosystem ii inhibitor diuron nestler et al 2012a b were identified as the most promising candidates wittmer et al 2014 the test concentrations were chosen based on pre experiments aiming at a roughly 20 reduction of the reproduction rate at each sampling event we filtered 30 μ m populations to census the entire population daphnia were classified by size 0 7 mm neonate juvenile 1 2 mm adult and adult reproductive output was assessed by counting the number of eggs in the brood pouch during each population census a subsample of algae 500 μ l was preserved for algal density assessment next 500 ml of media was transferred to a centrifuge bottle and centrifuged at 5000 rpm and 18 for 5 min the supernatant was discarded a subset retained for nutrient analysis and the algal pellet was resuspended in fresh media before being returned to the microcosm fig 1 provides an overview of the time series of adult and juvenile daphnia of eggs and of the fraction of adults without eggs for all microcosms note the high level of demographic noise shown in the time series in figure s 9 in the supplementary material we show qualitative time series of relative fluorescence measurements related to algal densities 2 3 a priori model structure selection 2 3 1 selection of model class with model class we denote the concept underlying the description of the population or the community how to deal with stochasticity and the temporal and spatial resolution of the model the model class does not describe the detailed equations of the model structure we select the model class for our specific problem according to the following considerations community populations as we only have qualitative data from the algae population see figure s 9 in the supplementary material and do not have indications for food limitation we focus on the description of the daphnia population individuals the small number of individuals three juveniles at the beginning of the experiment and the lack of information to distinguish the individuals during the time course of the experiment suggest using a discrete individuals model that accounts for the discrete nature of the population but does not distinguish the individuals traits the resolution of life stages by the model makes it possible to profit from the full information content of the data increasing the resolution of the model to age classes allows us to better describe the different residence times in different life stages without additional effort life stages are then associated with sets of age classes as the data does not distinguish other traits neither does the model stochasticity due to the small number of individuals demographic stochasticity has a large effect on the population environmental stochasticity was minimized in the experimental setup genetic stochasticity is not relevant because the populations consist of asexually reproducing clones we thus consider demographic stochasticity by going for probabilistic descriptions of birth and death processes space the experiments were carried out in homogeneous microcosms without spatial resolution in observations we thus choose not to resolve the spatial dimension by the model time a discrete time model with the same daily resolution for both time and age simplifies the model description as proceeding one time step increases age by one age class the choice of a stochastic age structured discrete population model in discrete time allows us to formulate a mechanistically correct model structure with the processes of reproduction aging and mortality that naturally contains demographic stochasticity using an age rather than a stage structured model allows us to consider different retention times in different life stages avoids numerical diffusion in the aging process and provides a more detailed description of the population at minor additional costs on the other hand this model uses empirical parameterizations of growth reproduction and mortality processes going beyond such an empirical description could not extract more information from the data nevertheless this model allows us to formulate ecological hypotheses by different parameterizations of these processes and to test these with the data 2 3 2 formulation of model structure model structure formulation within the model class selected in the previous section requires the specification of the number of age classes and how the numbers of individuals in these classes are related through mathematical relations for reproduction here egg production aging and mortality survival in addition to relate model output to observations a description of the observation process is needed individuals are distributed into n e n j n a age classes of length δ t 1 day each where n e 3 n j 5 and n a 45 are the numbers of egg juvenile and adult age classes respectively leading to an instar time of n e δ t 3 days a maturation age of n j δ t 5 days and a maximum age of n j n a δ t 50 days see fig 2 note that δ t defines both the time step for the temporal evolution of the model and age class length we assume every adult produces eggs according to a general fertility distribution f as each adult only gives birth every n e days the distribution of eggs in their different age classes and at time t 1 d are given by 1 e 1 t 1 d i 1 n a j 1 a i t n e f θ f i 2 e i t 1 d e i 1 t i 2 n e here e i t is the number of eggs in egg age class i at time t a i t is the number of adults in adult age class i at time t and θ f i are the parameters of the fertility distribution for adults in age class i the square brackets a i t n e at the top of the sum represent the number of adults that give birth at this time step if necessary rounded down to an integer note that we ignore mortality of eggs in eq 2 aging and mortality of individuals across age classes is defined by 3 j i t 1 d b j i 1 t s i j t j 1 j n j a 1 a n a i 1 n j 4 a i t 1 d b a i 1 t s i a t j 1 j n j a 1 a n a i 1 n a where j i is the number of juvenile individuals in juvenile age class i a i is the number of adult individuals in adult age class i and b is a binomial distribution whose second argument s i j or s i a define the average surviving fractions of adults a or juveniles j of age class i within one day respectively note that the number of juveniles in age class 0 is the number of eggs in age class n e j 0 e n e and that the number of adults in age class 0 is the number of juveniles in age class n j a 0 j n j the observation process is then defined using the sum of individuals among age classes within stages given by 5 e obs t n i 1 n e e i t σ obs 6 j obs t n i 1 n j j i t σ obs 7 a obs t n i 1 n a a i t σ obs where n is a normal distribution with standard deviation σ obs 1 describing complete counting of all individuals in the three developmental stages fig 2 although this distribution does not represent the results of a count process it will only be evaluated at non negative integer values that represent the observations this observation model serves primarily the purpose of supporting convergence of the inference algorithm allowing only for small deviations from actual counts that can be assumed to have only minor errors if the populations would become large in the course of the experiment we would have to replace this observation model with a model that accounts for larger errors for larger populations introducing such an observation process we make our model hierarchical in the context of what are typically described as a state space models in the ecological literature auger méthé et al 2021 newman et al 2022 2 3 3 formulation of hypotheses and associated model versions we can now formulate different ecological hypotheses to be tested against data leading to different model versions within the overarching model structure note that this has been an iterative process where identified deficits of models from earlier iterations provided inspiration regarding hypotheses to be tested during this iterative process we tested hypotheses regarding the fertility distribution as well as density and time dependence of mortality assuming fertility is independent of age in eq 1 leads to an egg distribution given by 8 e 1 t j 1 1 n e i 1 n a a i t f θ f where the square brackets 1 n e i 1 n a a i t at the top of the sum represent the total number of adults that give birth at this time step if necessary rounded down to an integer different assumptions can be made for the choice of the distribution f leading to different model versions we used four hypotheses for fertility the labels p n pz and nz are used to label the model versions p poisson distribution f θ f p f to describe the number of new eggs as a single distribution with the mean equal to the fecundity f mean number of eggs per individual n negative binomial distribution f θ f nb f r often used as an empirical distribution of overdispersed discrete observations lindén and mäntyniemi 2011 here parameterized with the mean equal to the fecundity f and the individual dispersion parameter r pz zero inflated poisson distribution f θ f pz c π where we assume that there is an excess fraction of adults π that does not produce eggs and the other fraction 1 π produces eggs according to a poisson distribution with a mean clutch size of c f 1 π where f c 1 π remains the effective fecundity as above note that π is the excess fraction of adults without eggs in addition to the probability for zero eggs described by the poisson distribution nz zero inflated negative binomial distribution f θ f nbz c r π where we combine the negative binomial distribution nb with zero inflation as for the poisson distribution π characterizes the excess fraction of adults without eggs in addition to the probability of zero eggs of the negative binomial distribution a large value of the dispersion parameter r reduces the fertility distribution of model version n to that of model version p and analogously for model version nz to pz setting π 0 leading to c f reduces model version pz to p and version nz to n respectively the more complex models thus reduce to the simpler models in a nested design fig 3 see supplementary section s 1 for a detailed description of fertility distributions and their numerical implementation note that despite not being mechanistic these distributional assumptions are typically used for describing count data e g egg distributions lindén and mäntyniemi 2011 brooks et al 2019 we then select hypotheses for mortality by parameterizing the mean survival fractions s j a in eqs 3 and 4 assuming mean survival fractions to be equal among age classes and stages and described by a general time and density dependent expression given by 9 s t j 1 j n j a 1 a n a exp k 0 k 1 t δ t k c i 1 n j j i t i 1 n a a i t δ t where k 0 is the base mortality rate k 1 is a time dependent mortality rate coefficient associated to variation in environmental conditions while k c is a coefficient of density dependent mortality or crowding table 1 technical details of the implementation of the mortality rate can be found in the supplementary section s 2 varying the parameters of eq 9 leads to a total of four nested hypotheses on the different processes affecting mortality base model no time and density dependence k 1 0 k c 0 model extensions t only time dependent mortality k 1 0 k c 0 c only density dependent mortality k 1 0 k c 0 tc time and density dependent mortality k 1 0 k c 0 again the simpler model structures can be obtained by setting parameters to specific values in this case zero note that explicit time dependence of mortality seems to be a strange assumption for an ecological model this hypothesis entered the model selection process at a later iteration as the initial increase and fast decline of the populations for some treatments could not be described otherwise combining the four hypotheses for fertility and the four hypotheses for mortality we obtain 16 different nested model versions fig 3 to be fitted to the data with up to six model parameters table 1 the priors of the parameters have been chosen to be quite wide and generally for most of the model versions the parameters are identifiable see section 3 1 3 these nested model versions will allow us to infer the need for model extensions by the marginal posterior of the corresponding parameters 2 3 4 model application strategy given r 5 replicated population time series data per treatment and a model version with n θ parameters each model version can be fitted to the data separately for every treatment using at least two strategies j joint fit the model is fitted jointly to the data of all replicas leading to a

have sufficient data to split the time series into a calibration and a validation period for using cross validation for model selection roberts et al 2017 houlahan et al 2017 this would require stable or multiple increase and decline patterns in both of these time periods to have all relevant patterns available for calibration as well as for validation however as explained in section 2 2 our time series typically show an increase in population size followed by a decline with some superimposed fluctuations see fig 1 this does not allow for a sufficiently good model calibration with using only the first part of the time series in addition the variation among replicated experiments indicate strong stochasticity so that the predictive performance of even the best model can only be quite poor see also section 4 the use of information criteria that are based on a trade off between model fit and model complexity is the most widely applied alternative to cross validation spiegelhalter et al 2002 johnson and omland 2004 plummer 2008 spiegelhalter et al 2014 hooten and hobbs 2015 however these criteria have some conceptual problems o hagan 1995 tenan et al 2014 robert 2016 tendeiro and kiers 2019 and they do not help to improve the ecological understanding for this reason we prefer to primarily base our considerations on a technique that provides more ecological insight nevertheless we include one of these criteria the deviance information criterion dic in our analysis for comparative purposes see section s 3 and figure s 1 in the supplementary material as we only have a relatively small number of hypotheses to test analyzing marginal posterior distributions of model parameters in a nested model structure as outlined in section 2 3 3 seems to be an adequate model structure selection technique for this study in this approach comparing the marginal posteriors of model parameters with their specific values for a simpler structure allows us to assess the need for additional structural elements if we would have to decide between structurally different models that cannot easily be formulated in a nested structure mixture model estimation would have been a suitable alternative kamary et al 2018 in addition to the identification of relevant processes by marginal posterior distributions of individual parameters we analyze the typical behavior of the model by performing simulations propagating the marginal posterior of all model parameters marginalizing over the states but still joint for all parameters this can be seen as a substitute of cross validation as it does not consider state information explicitly only implicitly through the posterior of the parameters due to the high variability of the replicates that indicates a high stochasticity in the actual microcosms we expect a high prediction uncertainty for these simulations 2 5 numerical methods and implementation bayesian inference for each of the model versions was done separately for each of the four treatments by gibbs sampling from the joint posterior of model parameters and states gelman et al 2003 the implementation was based on the software jags plummer 2003 that was called from r r core team 2021 via its interface rjags http cran r project org package rjags five markov chains with 1 0 6 iterations were run and for each of them the first half was cut to eliminate burn in see also figure s 2 in the supplementary material the data considered in section 3 as well as code to reproduce the results are publicly accessible at https github com gpalam daphnia 3 results to explore the required and identifiable model structure for the data from our experiments we start the analysis with an a posteriori model selection process for the treatment with diazinon dz as this affects daphnia most directly section 3 1 despite the small amount of data the model parameters turn out to be identifiable even for the most complex of the investigated model structures we then proceed with a comparison of all treatments based on the full model to test whether the conclusions regarding the relevance of processes and the need for extended process parameterizations are valid for the other treatments as well section 3 2 3 1 a posteriori model selection we performed a model selection process as described in section 2 4 for the experiments with diazinon treatment testing the 16 model versions described in fig 3 and both application strategies j and r section 2 3 4 3 1 1 convergence we fitted all the model versions to the time series data and checked for convergence of the markov chains the models with poisson fertility and zero inflation pz clearly did not converge see log posterior chains in figure s 2 in the supplementary material the fraction of zero inflation π tended to approach unity whereas the clutch size c became large to keep a reasonable fecundity f c 1 π the inference algorithm appeared to widen the fertility distribution by increasing zero inflation indicating that the negative binomial distribution with its dispersion parameter is better suited to describe fertility the pz model versions were thus discarded from further analysis for poor convergence due to structural deficits none of the other model versions showed severe convergence problems 3 1 2 model output and predictions next we qualitatively discuss the posterior model predictions and rely on the posterior marginals of the parameters for model selection see section 3 1 3 below the predictions based on the posterior marginal of the parameters still joint for all parameters but marginalized over the states are used as a replacement for cross validation see section 2 4 in principle this is a sensitive test for stochastic models because in contrast to the inferred time series of the states the parameters do not contain detailed information about the time series of the data and thus represent typical model behavior however as already mentioned in section 2 4 replication of the data is very poor indicating high stochasticity as the supplementary figures s 3 and s 5 and to a lesser extent the supplementary figures s 4 and s 6 demonstrate this leads to a high uncertainty in predictions induced by the high stochasticity of the model model versions n nz nzt show a general improvement of model predictions compared to the corresponding poisson model versions allowing more variability in the egg time series however predictions obtained using models n and nz show unrealistic population growth in fact all models without time dependent mortality do not show the typical extinction of the populations in the experiments this can be corrected using models with time dependent mortality e g nzt which are able to capture population decline and lead to a better fit of the states 3 1 3 marginal posterior model parameter distributions all marginal parameter distributions except the one for k c are either shifted from or narrower than their priors indicating good identifiability despite the small number of data points see fig 4 and supplementary figures s 7 s 8 this also indicates a minor dependence of the results on the prior parameter distributions over dispersion and zero inflation are important for a realistic description of the empirical egg distributions all model fits especially for replicas three and four show a significant over dispersion quantified by the parameter α equal to the variance divided by the mean α 1 compared to poisson α 1 fig 4 a all models with zero inflation led to zero inflation of 60 to 90 fig 4 b note that results for model pz are not reliable for convergence reasons see section 3 1 1 marginal posterior analysis shows no significant effect of crowding as the posterior coefficient of density dependent mortality k c remains with the prior and leads to a very small contribution to the mortality rate when multiplied with typical population sizes fig 4 c on the other hand we observe a significant effect of time dependent mortality on population dynamics as the marginal posteriors of the coefficients of time dependent mortality k 1 are always significantly larger than zero fig 4 d this effect can be an indication of cumulative effects of diazinon unless the other treatments would show this effect also to stress the importance of the single mechanisms associated to the relevant parameters in fig 4 we show a subset of the simplest model versions see supplementary figures s 7 and s 8 for a complete comparison of all the parameters for all the model versions the two dimensional marginals plots of the posterior parameter distribution see fig 5 show strong negative correlation between the mortality parameters k 0 and k 1 and positive correlation between the parameters c π and r all these results have a clear ecological interpretation k 0 and k 1 both affect mortality positively which results in a negative posterior correlation the clutch size c and the fraction of adults without eggs π lead to a mean fecundity of f c 1 π as the model results are sensitive to the mean fecundity this leads to a positive correlation of c and π overdispersion can either be increased by decreasing values of r or increasing values of π which leads to a positive correlation of these parameters finally c and r are positively correlated because of their positive correlation with π 3 1 4 model selection the results outlined in the previous section are the basis for our reasoning for model selection for nested stochastic ecological model versions table 2 the poisson fertility distribution p clearly demonstrates the difficulty of model structure selection for stochastic models despite the small variance of this distribution a model fit is always possible with low probability due to the stochastic nature of the model only the extensions to negative binomial fertility distributions and to zero inflation demonstrate the weakness of the poisson assumption lindén and mäntyniemi 2011 brooks et al 2019 with strong evidence for the need of these extensions with the models n and nz this need is clearly seen by the marginal posteriors of the parameters α and π in fig 4 which indicate values significantly different from 1 and 0 respectively the result that the joint fit for the model n requires a higher overdispersion than any of the replica fits for this model may be an indication of a structural weakness of this model numerically the need of overdispersion and zero inflation is quantified by the means and standard deviations of the associated parameters given in table 2 second column which demonstrate a significant deviation from the values associated to a poisson fertility distribution note that in this case lack of convergence reveals a structural deficit of the model pz it does not converge as zero inflation tends towards unity and clutch size tends to very large values to keep effective fecundity f c 1 π at a reasonable level finally both marginal posterior analysis and predictions with posterior parameters clearly indicate the need for an increase in mortality over time in the microcosms with diazinon treatment in fact total mortality in models with time dependent mortality k 0 20 k 1 0 23 0 02 d 1 becomes three times higher at the end of the experiment k 0 60 k 1 0 34 0 05 d 1 compared to the total mortality of models without time dependent mortality k 0 0 11 0 008 d 1 similarly we found that density dependence seems not to be relevant for these microcosms in fact the mortality due to crowding k c i 1 n j j i t i 1 n a a i t computed when the population reaches its maximum size is at least one order of magnitude smaller than the average total mortality these arguments were formulated in an iterative process of testing and discarding model versions leading to the selection of the model nztj with a zero inflated negative binomial distribution for fertility and an increasing mortality rate with time for the treatments with diazinon model nztj clearly has the correct behavior with finally leading to extinction of the population in this model version all parameters are identifiable and π and k 1 are clearly different from zero indicating strong evidence for zero inflation and increasing mortality with time and r indicating strong overdispersion of the negative binomial fertility distribution compared to the poisson distribution this choice is confirmed by classical model selection metrics see figure s 1 in supplementary section s 3 the nested model structures made it possible to assess the importance of model extensions by bayesian inference and analysis of marginal posterior parameter distributions giving results that are much easier to explain and communicate than abstract numbers that represent information criteria or bayes factors 3 2 comparison of treatments the careful model structure selection process for the diazinon treatments summarized in table 2 prepares us for the comparative analysis of the different treatments for this analysis we have to consider the zero inflated negative binomial distribution for fertility a potential increase in mortality during the experiment and we will focus on the joint evaluation of all replica for each treatment keeping the replica specific treatments to visualize the variability among replicated experiments although this model nzt is the most parsimonious model for the diazinon treatment as all parameters are identifiable we choose the model nztc that considers a potential density dependence of daphnia mortality for the comparison to check whether density dependence could be an issue for one of the other treatments fig 6 shows the marginal posterior densities of some combinations of the six model parameters for all four treatments these results show a clear separation of average mortality between the treatments with and without the insecticide diazinon fig 6 panel i as the marginals for the parameter of time dependence of the mortality rate demonstrates parameter k 1 in fig 6 panel e the increase in mortality over time identified in section 3 1 3 for the diazinon treatment seems to be a consequence of diazinon and not of generally deteriorating conditions in the microcosms for the treatments that do not contain diazinon the values of this parameter are compatible with zero effective fecundity seems also to increase for the diazinon treatments fig 6 panel i although this increase is less significant than the one we observe for mortality and mortality slope this difference is mostly caused by an increase in the fraction of adults without eggs i e by a decrease in zero inflation parameter π fig 6 panel b and not by the average clutch size that remains around 3 eggs per individual in all treatments fig 6 panel a the differences in the density dependence parameter k c fig 6 panel f may be caused by the better identifiability of this parameter for the treatments without diazinon due to the larger numbers of individuals reached for some treatments see fig 1 in all cases the order of magnitude of the crowding parameter makes its effect negligible for all treatments so that these differences are not relevant for the model outcomes fig 7 shows the time series of posterior knowledge of the number of adult individuals for all the treatments and replicates as obtained by the model red areas as well as the posterior predictions for potential future experiments gray areas an apparent feature of the unconditioned predictions are the large uncertainties resulting from the high demographic stochasticity of the model which reflects the high stochasticity in the data as already the poor replicability of the data demonstrates see fig 1 we cannot expect small prediction uncertainties by the model see also supplementary figures s 10 s 11 for the time series of posterior knowledge of the number of individuals in all developmental stages for all the treatments and replicates and supplementary figures s 12 s 15 for all plots of two dimensional marginals of the posterior parameter distribution for the four treatments 4 discussion to analyze the daphnia population dynamics in our experiments we chose to use an age structured discrete individuals model to consider the observed life stages and to account for demographic stochasticity of the initially small populations the model structure was formulated as a discrete time model with the processes of reproduction aging and mortality this structure was extended to different model versions based on different distributional assumptions for fertility and different parameterizations of the mortality rate bayesian inference was performed for a joint description of replicated experiments and for a replica specific description for each treatment separately with this population based approach we expect to be able to extract as much information as possible from the data forbes et al 2009 2011 as it allows us to investigate shifts in inferred parameter values that characterize different processes across different treatments the high variability between replicated experiments with the same treatment was a strong indication for the need of using a stochastic model our approach is similar to the one by erickson et al 2014 except that we use an age instead of a stage structured model and a different parameterization for potential density dependence of survival also as we only have experimental data for one concentration of each pesticide and their combination we do not formulate a model for the toxic effect erickson et al 2014 by fitting all parameters for each treatment separately and interpreting the resulting shifts in the marginal posterior parameter distribution relative to the control we do not have to make any assumptions about the shape of the response curve nor on the processes that are affected by the pesticide this gives more flexibility in identifying potential treatment effects but also implies that we cannot use the model to make predictions for other pesticide concentrations for this purpose a different experimental design that covers the range of relevant concentrations kreyling et al 2018 would be necessary the high variability among the observations for different replica of the same treatment led to corresponding differences in posterior parameter distributions for replica specific inference as all daphnid individuals were of the same clone and the environmental conditions were kept identical to the degree possible these results can best be explained by remaining mainly demographic stochasticity for this reason joint calibration of all data from replicated experiments using a model that accounts for demographic stochasticity seemed to be the most adequate model application strategy model selection based on the marginal posterior parameter distributions that characterize the different model versions and based on the joint calibration approach led to the conclusions that i modeling fertility with a zero inflated negative binomial distribution leads to a better fit than without zero inflation or with a poisson distribution ii there was no significant effect of density dependence on mortality iii variability resulted primarily from stochasticity in fertility and mortality iv treatments with sublethal concentrations of the insecticide diazinon showed a significant increase in mortality over time as well as in average mortality over the duration of the experiment the same experiments also showed a less significant increase in effective fecundity caused by an increase of the number of adults without eggs the need to account for overdispersion compared to a poisson distribution to appropriately describe variability of the number of eggs across individuals in daphnia populations has been found in many other studies also and in many of those it was also described by a negative binomial distribution delignette muller et al 2014 the increase in mortality is very clear and is an expected result for insecticide treatments that has been reported in other studies also erickson et al 2014 increased fertility has been reported as a possible stress response of daphnia for example in response to kairomones liu and steiner 2014 or presence of fish boersma et al 1999 but also reduced fertility has been observed in response to diazinon fernandez casalderrey et al 1995 as our results regarding fertility are less significant than the effects in mortality it remains unclear whether this result is a true response of the individuals or just an artifact of the high stochasticity in the experiments that would decrease with a larger sample size this would need further investigation our results indicate both the potential of model based analysis of data that are difficult to interpret directly due to high in this case primarily demographic stochasticity as well as the difficulties of drawing final conclusions from such data even with the use of a model that considers the dominant cause of stochasticity the limited amount of replicates given the high demographic stochasticity constrains the complexity of the model structures that still leads to identifiable parameters interesting extensions to be further investigated include adding variability in residence times in different life stages instar period and maturation age are assumed to be constant and adding age dependence to fertility and mortality parameters although we observed little difference in the results when using different survival rates for adults and juveniles a further advantage of the model based analysis of the results is the potential to learn for the design of future experiments the potential gain of information by increasing the number of individuals at the start of the experiment to reduce demographic stochasticity or to increase the number of replications could be investigated to find an optimal compromise between experimental effort and gain of information 5 conclusion in this paper we formulate a set of stochastic age structured discrete population models to analyze experimental data with clonal populations of daphnia galeata that were exposed to sub lethal concentrations of two different pesticides we use a nested multi model approach to make inference with and select among model versions in a way that simplifies model comparison the development of model versions has been performed in an iterative way combining quantitative ecological hypothesis formulation and bayesian inference to provide improved insights into the effects of pesticides on daphnia population dynamics the developed pipeline enables us to identify the main processes affecting population dynamics of daphnia despite the high level of demographic stochasticity observed in the experiments a zero inflated negative binomial distribution provides the best description of fertility for all pesticide treatments while in the treatments with the insecticide diazinon the marginal posterior of the slope of time dependent mortality is significantly greater than zero showing a significant chronic effects of the insecticide on the populations in sum our approach turned out to be adequate for identifying relevant ecological processes affecting reproduction and mortality of daphnia using computationally cheap techniques that complement classical model selection metrics moreover the models we presented can be easily generalized to describe different ecological systems and extended to include different ecological processes credit authorship contribution statement gian marco palamara conceived ideas and methodology analyzed the data led writing of the manuscript performed coding and

24367,this study aims at understanding how observed inconsistencies in the response of biotic indicators to multiple stressors may result from different stressor gradient lengths being represented at different areas or temporal windows either as the result of intrinsic natural causes or as the result of sampling bias we simulated a pool of sites showing five types of interactive responses of indicators to two co occurring virtual stressors as well as several sampling constraints resulting in different portions of each stressor s gradient being covered the sampled gradient length showed a strong influence on the detection of single stressor effects both in terms of statistical significance and goodness of fit increasing constraints on gradient coverage also led to an increasingly deficient identification of stressor interactions the fail in detecting significant interactions largely dominated over switches between interaction types the simulations indicated that datasets not fully capturing stressor gradients may hinder the ability to unveil underlying multiple stressor effects as distinct portions of stressor gradients may be present at different contexts and may change over time our simulations stress the importance of adaptive management strategies based on robust sampling designs to minimize potential statistical artefacts and uncertainties graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biomonitoring interactions management multiple stressors sampling data simulation data availability we used simulated data produced with a r code that is available in the supplementary materials 1 introduction as human population booms and the pace of global changes accelerate ecosystems are subjected to an ever increasing number of stressors affecting different levels of biological organization from single organisms to whole communities altering ecosystem functioning and the services they provide côté et al 2016 galic et al 2018 one of the reasons that may explain our current inability to stop ecosystem degradation ipbes 2019 is the failure to fully understand the impacts of multiple stressors on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning grizzetti et al 2017 this constraint often results from methodological limitations to disentangle the complex joint effects of stressors schinegger et al 2016a branco et al 2016 segurado et al 2018 moreover since stressor effects can interact or add in complex ways galic et al 2018 it is now widely acknowledged that the focus on single stressors is ineffective to anticipate their overall effect on biotic responses however this has been commonly ignored in environmental management côté et al 2016 spears et al 2021 requiring further research that facilitates the adoption of the multiple stressor approach in decision making interactions may lead to synergistic responses when joint stressor effects are stronger than the sum of their isolated effects or antagonistic responses when joint stressor effects are weaker than the sum of their isolated effects coors and de meester 2008 crain et al 2008 belarde and railsback 2016 feld et al 2016 alternatively in the absence of interactions stressor joint effects are equal to the sum of their isolated effects leading to an additive response the same categorization may also be applied for null models other than the additive cumulative effect assumption e g multiplicative other variants of interaction categories can be identified when considering that biotic indicators may react in different directions to each stressor piggott et al 2015 several efforts to summarize general trends of how stressors interact with each other have been carried out in recent years with a main focus on freshwater systems c j brown et al 2013 jackson et al 2016 côté et al 2016 however despite these efforts patterns and processes that may lead to interactive effects among multiple stressors remain poorly understood nöges et al 2016 in addition it remains unclear how the detection and classification of multiple stressor effects may vary under biased coverage of stressor gradients in the context of empirical data from field surveys and biomonitoring programmes during the last two decades an increased effort in biomonitoring provided a vast amount of empirical data that led to new challenges and opportunities to further improve the understanding of the effects of multiple stressors in contrast to controlled experiments in which a limited number of stressors usually two or three are tested based on discrete intensities artificially set for each stressor in situ monitoring data involves more stressors continuous stressor gradients and environmental covariation which pose many extra challenges when testing multiple stressor effects schinegger et al 2016a a first challenge arises from sampling constraints including potential statistical artefacts such as spatial autocorrelation and the under representation of certain regions along environmental gradients sánchez fernández et al 2008 schweiger et al 2016 these sampling constrains are often associated with logistic constrictions spatial heterogeneity or shifting baseline syndromes pauly et al 1995 this may lead to inconsistent responses to stressors among studies undertaken at different regions or time frames clements et al 2012 a second challenge may arise from the difficulty of disentangling the complexity of multiple stressor effects because each stressor is acting along continuous gradients that are not necessarily spatially or temporally coincident this is the case for example when an indicator behaves differently along stressor or environmental background gradients leading to complex responses e g gutiérrez cánovas et al 2019 this may occur when synergistic antagonistic and additive responses alternate along the gradients of one or both stressors spatial complexity e g geomorphology and land use may contribute to this intricacy making it harder to parameterize effects and interactions papadimitriou 2020 a third challenge arises from spatial scale effects because different targeted natural or management units e g river catchments may encompass different parts of single stressor gradients or specific stressor gradient combinations e g leps et al 2015 fig 1 this feature will potentially limit our ability to detect multiple stressor effects despite the increasing number of published case studies focused on multiple stressors previous research has seldom referred to or assessed how gradient coverage may influence the correct identification of stressor interactions spatial or temporal inconsistencies in responses to stressors have either been attributed to natural variation of community structure along environmental gradients clements et al 2012 or to unmeasured factors that change over time walker et al 2021 here we claim that context dependent responses to stressors may also arise from multiple stressor gradients being covered inconsistently in different regions or time frames in this sense feld et al 2016 highlighted the need to cover at least 75 of the stressors gradient to identify the most important interactions here using simulations we analyze more thoroughly how encompassing different stressor gradients may affect the identification and parameterization of interactions among stressors we hypothesize that the gradient captured by sampling programs influences our capacity to correctly identify and classify multiple stressor effects with the simulation exercise undertaken in this study we hope to improve our understanding of the statistical consequences of capturing only portions of stressor gradients and the consequent implications for the management of aquatic ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 reasoning interactions among continuous explanatory variables in regression based analyses are typically tested against a null model the standard procedure in linear regression and anova is to assume an independent effect of each explanatory variable as the null model i e the modelled response variable is the result of adding the individual effects of explanatory variables but see schäfer piggott 2018 for a thorough description on null model nuances under different stressor modes of action testing interactions in this case involves checking if the inclusion of multiplicative terms will result in significant goodness of fit improvements over the null model or to more parsimonious models e g when using multi model inference frameworks burnham and anderson 2002 in the simple case of two stressors 1 and 2 acting on a biotic indicator y each term of a regression equation taking the form y b0 b1s1 b2s2 b3s1s2 e involves the estimation of the intercept b0 the value of the response variable when all independent variables equals zero the regression coefficients b1 and b2 for each independent variable and the coefficient of each interaction term b3 usually pairwise note that other types of regression techniques e g logistic regression would involve different equations and null models see schäfer and piggott 2018 we will illustrate our example using linear regression with no higher order terms e g quadratic and additive null models but the statistical issues we highlight might arise irrespectively of the regression technique the shape of responses and the null model used joint effects of pairs of variables are often represented by heat map contour plots where the response is expressed as a surface of varying color intensities against two explanatory variables feld et al 2016 the patterns that arise from these plots are dependent on the relative coefficient magnitude and sign of each stressor and their interaction terms in the model in the simple case of two stressors acting negatively and linearly on a biotic indicator the relative magnitude and direction of these effect sizes gives rise to four main response patterns fig 2 1 additive response when the coefficient of the interaction is not significantly different from 0 resulting in a uniform pattern of response change along stressor gradients 2 synergistic response when both the coefficient of the single and interaction terms are significantly negative hence resulting in a stronger negative response that gives rise to heat maps with a convergent direction along the joint stressors gradient 3 antagonistic response when the coefficient of the interaction is significantly positive giving rise to heat maps with a divergent direction along the joint stressors gradient 4 complex antagonistic response when the coefficient of the interaction is significantly positive but higher than a given turning point value above which the effect of each stressor is inverted when the other stressor reaches a given intensity this means that lower stressor effects on the response variable occur when both stressors are simultaneously weak or simultaneously high for simplicity we restrict our focus on stressors that exert a monotonic and deleterious effect on a given indicator in which a linear negative response can be considered a good approximation to reality the general response patterns also may arise when a quadratic term is included in the regression equation to cope with unimodal responses although with a prevalent negative effect along the stressor gradient the definition of interactions for positive responses may be derived from the definitions given above i e by simply reversing the sign of all coefficients in each definition when data are standardized through centring and scaling data with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one response patterns may change since stressors may now take negative values plotting heat maps must therefore involve a previous rescaling of stressors to the original scales in terms of management decisions the accurate and proper classification of interaction types fig 3 is paramount to design and adapt intervention actions accordingly for an additive interaction when two stressors showing the same effect size on ecological status applying all management efforts in reducing only one stressor or applying 50 of the management effort to each stressor will produce the same outcome if stressors interact synergistically instead of additively devoting all management efforts to one stressor may yield a better result in terms of improving the overall ecological status if stressors interact antagonistically on the other hand it is probable that applying management actions to reduce both stressors is the best course of action versus focusing on a single stressor in fact focusing on a single stressor does not guarantee that the management goal will ever be attained c j brown et al 2013 even with complete suppression of one single stressor fig 3 in the particular case of complex antagonistic interaction because it encompasses several interaction types along the combined stressor gradients the optimal management plan depends on the starting point the combined portion of both stressor gradients that affects a given case e g region basin sub basin lake theoretically in this complex antagonistic interaction there is even a portion of stressor gradients in which adjusting management to reduce the intensity of one stressor would further deteriorate ecological status this implies that management actions should be contingent on the position along stressor gradients 2 2 data simulations the simulation procedure fig 4 first involved the creation of two virtual stressors s1 and s2 each with a different effect size on a common response with s1 having twice the effect size of s2 and each assuming a negative linear relationship with the response to simplify graphical outputs and facilitate interpreting regression coefficients as effect sizes we centered and scaled simulated stressors to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one we first simulated a pool of 10 000 measurements for each stressor following a uniform distribution i e assuming that the full gradient of stressor combinations is equally represented fig 4 steps 1a and 1b we calculated the simulated responses y using the following regression equation with given coefficients and a fixed amount of data stochasticity defined by a random error with a normal distribution and a fixed standard deviation y b 0 b 1 s 1 b 2 s 2 b 3 s 1 s 2 e where b0 is the intercept b1 is the s1 coefficient b2 is the s2 coefficient b3 is the coefficient of the interaction term between s1 and s2 and e is the random error with 0 mean and a 0 1 standard deviation i e 10 of the stressors standard deviation we considered five types of response according to different ways in which the two stressors may interact fig 4 step 2 in each case we assigned different coefficient values expressing different effect sizes for both single and interaction terms 1 additive response using the equation below in which no interaction term is included b3 0 y 0 5 s 1 0 25 s 2 e 2 strong synergistic response using the equation below in which an interaction term with a strong negative coefficient is included b3 1 y 0 5 s 1 0 25 s 2 1 s 1 s 2 e 3 synergistic response using the equation below in which an interaction term with a weak negative coefficient is included b3 0 2 y 0 5 s 1 0 25 s 2 0 2 s 1 s 2 e 4 antagonistic response using the equation below in which an interaction term with a positive coefficient lower than the highest single effect coefficient is included b3 0 2 y 0 5 s 1 0 25 s 2 0 2 s 1 s 2 e 5 complex antagonistic response using the equation below in which an interaction term with a positive coefficient higher than the highest single effect coefficient is included b3 1 y 0 5 s 1 0 25 s 2 1 s 1 s 2 e the category strong synergistic was introduced for comparative purposes with the complex antagonistic type in which the same criteria was used but assuming an interaction term coefficient with an opposite sign 2 3 sampling simulations first to define the sample size to be used in subsequent analyses we selected 500 random subsets from the initial simulated pool n 10 000 considering varying sample sizes i e 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 random observations these subsets included simulated multiple stressor responses covering the five types of interactions and considering the full range of both stressor gradients to select the sample size that optimized computing time we evaluated how statistical power changed depending on the number of analysed observations statistical power measured as the inverse probability of type ii error probability of rejecting false null hypothesis was considered acceptable whenever dispersion ranges of the interaction term estimates did not or only marginally contained zero the minimum sample size that yielded sufficient statistical power for the defined effect sizes and regression error was 200 fig s1 all subsequent analyses used 200 observations to optimize computing times to test the effects of stressor data completeness we considered nine alternative restrictions on the sampled stressors ranges fig 4 step 3 1 full range i e no restrictions considering the whole gradient of the two stressors 2 25 of each stressor gradient 3 50 of each stressor gradient 4 25 of stressor 2 gradient 5 50 of stressor 2 gradient 6 25 of stressor 1 gradient 7 50 of stressor 1 gradient 8 a positive correlated gradient between stressor 1 and 2 9 a negative correlated gradient between stressor 1 and 2 the simulated samplings were taken from the whole stressor gradients with only the constraint of the defined gradient range we only simulated correlated gradients of stressors in which pairwise pearson r 0 7 to avoid biased regression coefficient estimates due to high collinearity e g feld et al 2016 these restricted ranges of stressor gradients can be understood either as a sampling bias of the whole population of observations or constrained stressor ranges inherent to a study area e g catchment in total we ran nine sampling simulations for each of the five interaction types one for each sampling constrain resulting in a total of 45 simulation runs each simulation run consisted of 500 random samples of responses and stressors 200 observations each this resulted in 500 models x nine sampling simulations x five interaction types 22 500 fitted models fig 4 step 4 we computed the r square and regression coefficients effect size for all resulting models for each simulation run set of 500 models we also computed the percentage of significant coefficient estimates confidence intervals not containing zero for each single stressor and interaction terms as well as the percentage of each kind of interaction to which models were classified fig 4 step 5 we assigned a type of response to each simulated model as follows when the confidence intervals of coefficient estimates contained zero models were assigned to the additive type the remaining models were assigned to each type of interaction according to the criteria mentioned in subsection 2 1 models in which estimates of single effect coefficients changed their sign i e were positive were assigned to other all simulations and models were developed in r version 3 3 2 r core team 2020 r codes of functions used in simulations are available in the supporting information appendix 1 3 results 3 1 sampling effects in the goodness of fit our nine alternative restrictions yielded very distinct results depending on the type and degree of sampling restriction goodness of fit fig 5 a measured as r square decreased when the sampled gradients of both stressors were constrained which was more marked for the sampling type with the highest constrained gradient 25 of both stressor gradients captured by random samples when the gradient constraint was restricted to only one stressor the decrease in r square of models using simulated samplings was lower being greater when constraining the gradient range of the stressor with the strongest effect s1 an exception was the complex antagonistic responses where results were highly variable and a less marked decrease was noted for this sampling type when constraining only the gradient range of the weaker stressor s2 r square values were roughly similar to those obtained in the full gradient sampling type remarkably when the simulated sampling captured a positive correlation between stressors we also found minor reductions of r square with respect to the whole range dataset contrarily the negative correlation sampling type resulted in a marked decrease in model goodness of fit 3 2 significance and uncertainty of regression coefficient estimates table 1 shows the percentage of significant single and combined stressor regression coefficients t test p 0 05 of the models analysing simulated data for each type of multiple stressor response overall the percentage of significant single effect coefficients was consistently reduced when constraining the sampled gradient range of both stressors this reduction was particularly marked for the most constrained sampling type 25 of both stressor gradients captured by random samples and for the coefficients of the weakest stressor simulations showed that even for the simulated additive responses there were always a fraction of models with a significant interaction coefficient from 3 6 when no restrictions to the sampled gradient are imposed up to 6 8 when the constraining stressor gradients were negatively correlated for all simulations of synergistic and antagonistic responses less than 60 of the models showed significant interaction coefficients with values decreasing down to 3 antagonistic response considering 25 of both stressor gradients with increasing sampling constraints for strong synergistic and complex antagonistic responses both with the highest interaction term effect sizes the percentage of models with significant interaction coefficients was always above 70 except for simulations with the highest constrained sampling type 25 of both stressor gradients covered model coefficients showed negative or positive values in all types of sampling restriction responses fig 5b with the highest variation occurring for the most constrained sampling type 25 of both stressors gradient covered and the lowest variation occurring for the full gradient sampling simulations we found a reduced variation in the interaction terms for the less constrained and correlated gradient sampling simulations overall the median values of estimated coefficient values were close to the pre established coefficient 3 3 interaction assignment errors the resulting proportion of models assigned to each interaction type fig 6 table s1 indicate that 95 of simulations based on the additive response were correctly assigned to this type wrongly classified effects belonging to the additive response simulations type i errors were mainly assigned either to synergistic or to antagonistic interaction types for example for the full gradient coverage 2 4 and 2 8 of the simulations were assigned respectively to the synergistic and antagonistic interaction types among simulations based on strong synergistic responses all simulations were correctly assigned in the case of a full stressor gradient coverage however for the highest gradient constraint 25 of both stressors gradient covered only 68 0 were classified correctly among simulations based on synergistic responses no interaction was detected in 33 8 of the models for the full stressor gradient scenario for the highest sampling restriction scenario none of the models with significant interactions 8 4 in total were classified as synergistic for correlated stressor gradients scenarios we found the highest percentage of significant synergistic interactions among those using simulations with constrained samplings in the case of antagonistic responses no interaction was detected in 26 6 of the models when the full gradient was covered while for the highest sampling restriction none of the models with significant interactions 8 2 in total were classified as antagonistic for complex antagonistic responses in the case of a full gradient coverage significant interactions were found in all models while for the highest sampling restriction 82 2 of the models showed significant complex antagonistic interactions all misclassified responses were assigned to the additive response type when stressor gradients were correlated we found the highest percentage of significant antagonistic interactions among those for restricted sampling 4 discussion 4 1 multiple stressor effects and gradient length the present work shows that datasets that do not fully capture the entire stressor gradients will limit our ability to identify underlying multiple stressor patterns to an extent that depends on the percentage of sampled gradients and their inter correlation it also shows that under representing the gradient of the stressor with the highest effect size causes a larger impact on the results therefore interaction identification correct interaction classification stressor significance and goodness of fit are all dependent on the proportion of the sampled gradient length these results are coherent between stressor interaction types except for strong synergistic and complex antagonistic interactions in these two cases the percentage of misclassifications was lower possibly because both represented very strong synergistic and antagonistic effects and therefore their effects were more likely to be captured by the sampling design in a recent comprehensive empirical study based on dozens of mesocosm experiments river basin case studies and cross basin analyses it was shown that the share of significant stressor effects and interactions increase with spatial extent namely when cross basin analyses are undertaken birk et al 2020 other spatially extensive studies in freshwaters also found multiple stressor effects to be the rule for example schinegger et al 2016a highlighted that 64 of the impaired sampling sites across europe were affected by two or more stressors and that interactions occurred in most cases 60 while in others the stressors acted additively additionally grizzetti et al 2017 demonstrated how the present status of european rivers can be explained by multiple pressures especially by local pressures acting in conjunction with pressures at the catchment scale according to these studies even with the likely increase in confounding factors at increasing spatial extents which would result in a limited likelihood of detecting individual or interactive stressor effects birk et al 2020 the effect of longer stressor gradients being covered at increasing spatial extents seems to prevail 4 2 implications for management it has been acknowledged that the prevalence of different kinds of interaction has relevant implications for management brown et al 2009 c j 2013 piggott et al 2015 côté et al 2016 recent meta analysis studies found that antagonistic interactions tend to dominate in freshwater environments jackson et al 2016 velasco et al 2018 this is crucial for management because it is well accepted that mitigation measures applied to stressors are less effective in systems where antagonistic effects dominate c j brown et al 2013 piggott et al 2015 however the consequences of antagonistic effects on management may not be so straightforward our results suggest that we should be aware that under some circumstances many of these antagonistic interactions may show a complex pattern if more thoroughly analysed this complex antagonistic response pattern is able to contain within its range both synergistic and antagonistic interactions in portions of the stressor gradient increasing management complexity more empirical evidence for these complex patterns are however needed as they may result from statistical artefacts with little support from data segurado et al 2018 spears et al 2021 4 3 inferring multiple stressor effects from biomonitoring data empirical modeling based on field biomonitoring data can be a useful tool to explore how stressors interact and to predict outcomes of management actions to support improved decision making however a combination of manipulative experiments and empirical modeling is needed to detect meaningful statistical responses especially when parts of the gradients are not sufficiently covered by empirical data in addition regression outcomes should be carefully interpreted and used although practitioners usually devote most interest to evaluating individual stressor and interaction significance p values are uninformative of the stressor effect and importance wasserstein and lazar 2016 for an appropriate evaluation and classification of multiple stressor effects single stressor and interaction effect sizes as well as partitioned explained variance should be also calculated and considered it is also important to realize that whenever analysing pairwise interactions between stressors using regression based empirical approaches the usual course of action when dealing with biomonitoring data deviations from additive effects only arise when one stressor changes the rate of the response variable to the other stressor this makes the empirical modeling approach quite different from multifactorial manipulative experimental approaches in which confounding factors are controlled and only responses to specific doses of stressors are compared to responses in the absence of stressors i e not involving estimates of response rates nonetheless data deficiencies can also produce biased results in manipulative experimental results by not allowing estimation of stressor effect relationships arguably limiting the ability to predict effects beyond treatment levels due to lack of enough stressor gradient range within experimental treatment levels the same two stressors acting simultaneously can be wrongly classified into different interaction types something similar to the effects of constrained stressor gradient sampling found in the present study this is the reason why schäfer piggott 2018 suggested that at least five stress levels should be used in experimental settings whenever possible the use of replicated regression is recommended over analyses based on few discrete stressor levels e g anova due to its higher statistical power when the studied stressors are continuous and a whole gradient can be easily simulated under experimental conditions cottingham et al 2005 our results are in line with a recent computer simulation study which showed that the number of locations representing the whole gradient of environmental drivers and not the level of replication at fewer environmental states yielded the highest amount of mechanistically explainable variance kreyling et al 2018 our results also support the idea that experiments that are supported by well represented stressor gradients ease the interpolation or extrapolation of the response between and beyond stressor treatment levels schäfer and piggott 2018 4 4 is linearity a valid assumption in this study we considered the simplest form of two stressors linearly affecting a single indicator in real world situations a given biological level of organization is affected by a panoply of natural environmental factors that interact with each other and with human induced stressors most likely in a non linear fashion in addition the assumption that stressors act monotonically and linearly along their whole gradient on a given organism population community or other ecosystem health indicators is overly simplistic while there are many examples of abrupt non linear changes brito et al 2020 chen and olden 2020 or wedge shaped responses bryce et al 2010 to stressors that are more appropriately addressed with other regression families a recent meta analysis found most ecological responses to environmental degradation to be essentially gradual hillebrand et al 2020 in contrast to the monotonic responses dealt here different response signs and interaction types may arise at different portions of stressor gradients for instance if the response is ruled by an unimodal subsidy stress gradient odum et al 1979 as is often the case with nutrient enrichment wagenhoff et al 2011 a 2013 positive synergistic and positive antagonistic interactions piggot et al 2015 may arise at subsidy portions of stressor gradients hence using simulations based on this kind of responses would be less straightforward to illustrate the effect of different stressor ranges coverage on interaction identification here we also did not address other forms of interaction such as dominance schäfer and piggott 2018 i e the effect of one stressor dominating other stressors i e cancelling their effects which in turn does not influence the effect of the dominant one although relatively common in multiple stressor contexts birk et al 2020 this type of interaction is equivalent to a single stressor situation and therefore falls outside of the scope of this study different mechanisms governing stressor effects also imply alternative null models to be considered in a regression based framework which differ from the simple additive null model schäfer and piggott 2018 spears et al 2021 for simplicity here we used a paired stressor interaction assuming an additive null model and considering the linear negative response to be a valid approximation to any generic monotonic negative effect of stressors despite the clear over simplification the overall trends found in this study would probably apply to more complex higher order non linear and or non monotonic situations and assuming other interaction null models since the identification testing and parameterization of interactions among different regression approaches are very much alike at the very least our results call for caution when deriving managing implications from highly biased stressor gradients in more complex situations hence we believe our findings are useful to demonstrate the importance of adequately covering stressor gradients and to draw attention to the idea that different systems by containing different portions of stressor gradients may show inconsistent responses to a same set of stressors 4 5 messages to researchers and managers in face of the results of the simulation exercise presented in this study a question that may arise to local managers is whether there is enough gradient of given stressors in their targeted system to allow an adequate detection of multiple stressor interactions and effects firstly it is crucial to focus on stressors to which different portions of their gradients can be adequately represented in the sampling design this requires an a priori and thorough knowledge of stressors occurring throughout the system under study sampling design should then cover as homogeneously temporally and or spatially as possible the full stressor gradient present at the targeted system to minimize wrong identification of stressor interactions moreover an expressive number of observations along the full gradient of the stressors is also paramount for an accurate prediction of response cottingham et al 2005 lange et al 2014 sett et al 2014 this is often hampered by constraints such as insufficient funding or logistic issues and so compromise solutions should be carefully assessed to guarantee reliable results to be attained hughes and peck 2008 we encourage researchers that deal with biomonitoring data to adapt the provided r code appendix 2 to their particular case studies using real stressors instead of virtual ones to assess through similar sampling simulations the sensitivity of interaction identification and parameterization to sample size collinearity among stressors and stressors gradient coverage in addition managers should be aware that effective management actions might differ for similar stressors combination regionally and for different spatial extents as there are stressors that have different impacts at continental basin or site spatial extents clements et al 2012 birk et al 2020 herlihy et al 2020 management actions must be tailored to each spatial extent but should understand their place within the overall gradient of the stressors to avoid being effective only at a given spatial extent there has been recent progress in understanding how mechanisms acting across levels of biological organization and spatio temporal scales may influence the nature of stressor interactions jackson et al 2021 simmons et al 2021 turschwell et al 2022 hence an additional aspect is that users should try to select appropriate biological metrics that relate mechanistically with the studied stressors e g functional trait based metrics poff 1997 chen et al 2019 this will ease a mechanistic interpretation of the patterns that arise from empirical modeling and thereby to generate testable hypothesis about underlying processes 5 conclusions natural environments are continuously facing anthropogenic pressures that result in interacting stressors at various time and spatial extents while studies on multiple stressors have become increasingly frequent in freshwater ecology literature e g ormerod et al 2010 jackson et al 2016 there is still a shortage of mechanistic understanding and more integrative predictive frameworks of stressor interactions effectively diminishing the ability to correctly fashion management and conservation plans schäfer and piggott 2018 orr et al 2020 an incorrect assessment of stressor interaction might even lead to incorrect management actions that can ultimately have an undesired opposed effect spears et al 2021 here we assessed how changing gradient coverage either as the result of sampling constraints or different environmental contexts may affect the ability to detect and to identify interactions between a strong and a weak stressor under certain circumstances our simulations also show that static measures may not be applied in the hopes of a homogeneous effect throughout the gradient of the stressors as stressor gradient lengths are context dependent and may change over time our study supports the need for an adaptive management planning fully informed by data rich monitoring schemes a strategy

24367,this study aims at understanding how observed inconsistencies in the response of biotic indicators to multiple stressors may result from different stressor gradient lengths being represented at different areas or temporal windows either as the result of intrinsic natural causes or as the result of sampling bias we simulated a pool of sites showing five types of interactive responses of indicators to two co occurring virtual stressors as well as several sampling constraints resulting in different portions of each stressor s gradient being covered the sampled gradient length showed a strong influence on the detection of single stressor effects both in terms of statistical significance and goodness of fit increasing constraints on gradient coverage also led to an increasingly deficient identification of stressor interactions the fail in detecting significant interactions largely dominated over switches between interaction types the simulations indicated that datasets not fully capturing stressor gradients may hinder the ability to unveil underlying multiple stressor effects as distinct portions of stressor gradients may be present at different contexts and may change over time our simulations stress the importance of adaptive management strategies based on robust sampling designs to minimize potential statistical artefacts and uncertainties graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biomonitoring interactions management multiple stressors sampling data simulation data availability we used simulated data produced with a r code that is available in the supplementary materials 1 introduction as human population booms and the pace of global changes accelerate ecosystems are subjected to an ever increasing number of stressors affecting different levels of biological organization from single organisms to whole communities altering ecosystem functioning and the services they provide côté et al 2016 galic et al 2018 one of the reasons that may explain our current inability to stop ecosystem degradation ipbes 2019 is the failure to fully understand the impacts of multiple stressors on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning grizzetti et al 2017 this constraint often results from methodological limitations to disentangle the complex joint effects of stressors schinegger et al 2016a branco et al 2016 segurado et al 2018 moreover since stressor effects can interact or add in complex ways galic et al 2018 it is now widely acknowledged that the focus on single stressors is ineffective to anticipate their overall effect on biotic responses however this has been commonly ignored in environmental management côté et al 2016 spears et al 2021 requiring further research that facilitates the adoption of the multiple stressor approach in decision making interactions may lead to synergistic responses when joint stressor effects are stronger than the sum of their isolated effects or antagonistic responses when joint stressor effects are weaker than the sum of their isolated effects coors and de meester 2008 crain et al 2008 belarde and railsback 2016 feld et al 2016 alternatively in the absence of interactions stressor joint effects are equal to the sum of their isolated effects leading to an additive response the same categorization may also be applied for null models other than the additive cumulative effect assumption e g multiplicative other variants of interaction categories can be identified when considering that biotic indicators may react in different directions to each stressor piggott et al 2015 several efforts to summarize general trends of how stressors interact with each other have been carried out in recent years with a main focus on freshwater systems c j brown et al 2013 jackson et al 2016 côté et al 2016 however despite these efforts patterns and processes that may lead to interactive effects among multiple stressors remain poorly understood nöges et al 2016 in addition it remains unclear how the detection and classification of multiple stressor effects may vary under biased coverage of stressor gradients in the context of empirical data from field surveys and biomonitoring programmes during the last two decades an increased effort in biomonitoring provided a vast amount of empirical data that led to new challenges and opportunities to further improve the understanding of the effects of multiple stressors in contrast to controlled experiments in which a limited number of stressors usually two or three are tested based on discrete intensities artificially set for each stressor in situ monitoring data involves more stressors continuous stressor gradients and environmental covariation which pose many extra challenges when testing multiple stressor effects schinegger et al 2016a a first challenge arises from sampling constraints including potential statistical artefacts such as spatial autocorrelation and the under representation of certain regions along environmental gradients sánchez fernández et al 2008 schweiger et al 2016 these sampling constrains are often associated with logistic constrictions spatial heterogeneity or shifting baseline syndromes pauly et al 1995 this may lead to inconsistent responses to stressors among studies undertaken at different regions or time frames clements et al 2012 a second challenge may arise from the difficulty of disentangling the complexity of multiple stressor effects because each stressor is acting along continuous gradients that are not necessarily spatially or temporally coincident this is the case for example when an indicator behaves differently along stressor or environmental background gradients leading to complex responses e g gutiérrez cánovas et al 2019 this may occur when synergistic antagonistic and additive responses alternate along the gradients of one or both stressors spatial complexity e g geomorphology and land use may contribute to this intricacy making it harder to parameterize effects and interactions papadimitriou 2020 a third challenge arises from spatial scale effects because different targeted natural or management units e g river catchments may encompass different parts of single stressor gradients or specific stressor gradient combinations e g leps et al 2015 fig 1 this feature will potentially limit our ability to detect multiple stressor effects despite the increasing number of published case studies focused on multiple stressors previous research has seldom referred to or assessed how gradient coverage may influence the correct identification of stressor interactions spatial or temporal inconsistencies in responses to stressors have either been attributed to natural variation of community structure along environmental gradients clements et al 2012 or to unmeasured factors that change over time walker et al 2021 here we claim that context dependent responses to stressors may also arise from multiple stressor gradients being covered inconsistently in different regions or time frames in this sense feld et al 2016 highlighted the need to cover at least 75 of the stressors gradient to identify the most important interactions here using simulations we analyze more thoroughly how encompassing different stressor gradients may affect the identification and parameterization of interactions among stressors we hypothesize that the gradient captured by sampling programs influences our capacity to correctly identify and classify multiple stressor effects with the simulation exercise undertaken in this study we hope to improve our understanding of the statistical consequences of capturing only portions of stressor gradients and the consequent implications for the management of aquatic ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 reasoning interactions among continuous explanatory variables in regression based analyses are typically tested against a null model the standard procedure in linear regression and anova is to assume an independent effect of each explanatory variable as the null model i e the modelled response variable is the result of adding the individual effects of explanatory variables but see schäfer piggott 2018 for a thorough description on null model nuances under different stressor modes of action testing interactions in this case involves checking if the inclusion of multiplicative terms will result in significant goodness of fit improvements over the null model or to more parsimonious models e g when using multi model inference frameworks burnham and anderson 2002 in the simple case of two stressors 1 and 2 acting on a biotic indicator y each term of a regression equation taking the form y b0 b1s1 b2s2 b3s1s2 e involves the estimation of the intercept b0 the value of the response variable when all independent variables equals zero the regression coefficients b1 and b2 for each independent variable and the coefficient of each interaction term b3 usually pairwise note that other types of regression techniques e g logistic regression would involve different equations and null models see schäfer and piggott 2018 we will illustrate our example using linear regression with no higher order terms e g quadratic and additive null models but the statistical issues we highlight might arise irrespectively of the regression technique the shape of responses and the null model used joint effects of pairs of variables are often represented by heat map contour plots where the response is expressed as a surface of varying color intensities against two explanatory variables feld et al 2016 the patterns that arise from these plots are dependent on the relative coefficient magnitude and sign of each stressor and their interaction terms in the model in the simple case of two stressors acting negatively and linearly on a biotic indicator the relative magnitude and direction of these effect sizes gives rise to four main response patterns fig 2 1 additive response when the coefficient of the interaction is not significantly different from 0 resulting in a uniform pattern of response change along stressor gradients 2 synergistic response when both the coefficient of the single and interaction terms are significantly negative hence resulting in a stronger negative response that gives rise to heat maps with a convergent direction along the joint stressors gradient 3 antagonistic response when the coefficient of the interaction is significantly positive giving rise to heat maps with a divergent direction along the joint stressors gradient 4 complex antagonistic response when the coefficient of the interaction is significantly positive but higher than a given turning point value above which the effect of each stressor is inverted when the other stressor reaches a given intensity this means that lower stressor effects on the response variable occur when both stressors are simultaneously weak or simultaneously high for simplicity we restrict our focus on stressors that exert a monotonic and deleterious effect on a given indicator in which a linear negative response can be considered a good approximation to reality the general response patterns also may arise when a quadratic term is included in the regression equation to cope with unimodal responses although with a prevalent negative effect along the stressor gradient the definition of interactions for positive responses may be derived from the definitions given above i e by simply reversing the sign of all coefficients in each definition when data are standardized through centring and scaling data with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one response patterns may change since stressors may now take negative values plotting heat maps must therefore involve a previous rescaling of stressors to the original scales in terms of management decisions the accurate and proper classification of interaction types fig 3 is paramount to design and adapt intervention actions accordingly for an additive interaction when two stressors showing the same effect size on ecological status applying all management efforts in reducing only one stressor or applying 50 of the management effort to each stressor will produce the same outcome if stressors interact synergistically instead of additively devoting all management efforts to one stressor may yield a better result in terms of improving the overall ecological status if stressors interact antagonistically on the other hand it is probable that applying management actions to reduce both stressors is the best course of action versus focusing on a single stressor in fact focusing on a single stressor does not guarantee that the management goal will ever be attained c j brown et al 2013 even with complete suppression of one single stressor fig 3 in the particular case of complex antagonistic interaction because it encompasses several interaction types along the combined stressor gradients the optimal management plan depends on the starting point the combined portion of both stressor gradients that affects a given case e g region basin sub basin lake theoretically in this complex antagonistic interaction there is even a portion of stressor gradients in which adjusting management to reduce the intensity of one stressor would further deteriorate ecological status this implies that management actions should be contingent on the position along stressor gradients 2 2 data simulations the simulation procedure fig 4 first involved the creation of two virtual stressors s1 and s2 each with a different effect size on a common response with s1 having twice the effect size of s2 and each assuming a negative linear relationship with the response to simplify graphical outputs and facilitate interpreting regression coefficients as effect sizes we centered and scaled simulated stressors to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one we first simulated a pool of 10 000 measurements for each stressor following a uniform distribution i e assuming that the full gradient of stressor combinations is equally represented fig 4 steps 1a and 1b we calculated the simulated responses y using the following regression equation with given coefficients and a fixed amount of data stochasticity defined by a random error with a normal distribution and a fixed standard deviation y b 0 b 1 s 1 b 2 s 2 b 3 s 1 s 2 e where b0 is the intercept b1 is the s1 coefficient b2 is the s2 coefficient b3 is the coefficient of the interaction term between s1 and s2 and e is the random error with 0 mean and a 0 1 standard deviation i e 10 of the stressors standard deviation we considered five types of response according to different ways in which the two stressors may interact fig 4 step 2 in each case we assigned different coefficient values expressing different effect sizes for both single and interaction terms 1 additive response using the equation below in which no interaction term is included b3 0 y 0 5 s 1 0 25 s 2 e 2 strong synergistic response using the equation below in which an interaction term with a strong negative coefficient is included b3 1 y 0 5 s 1 0 25 s 2 1 s 1 s 2 e 3 synergistic response using the equation below in which an interaction term with a weak negative coefficient is included b3 0 2 y 0 5 s 1 0 25 s 2 0 2 s 1 s 2 e 4 antagonistic response using the equation below in which an interaction term with a positive coefficient lower than the highest single effect coefficient is included b3 0 2 y 0 5 s 1 0 25 s 2 0 2 s 1 s 2 e 5 complex antagonistic response using the equation below in which an interaction term with a positive coefficient higher than the highest single effect coefficient is included b3 1 y 0 5 s 1 0 25 s 2 1 s 1 s 2 e the category strong synergistic was introduced for comparative purposes with the complex antagonistic type in which the same criteria was used but assuming an interaction term coefficient with an opposite sign 2 3 sampling simulations first to define the sample size to be used in subsequent analyses we selected 500 random subsets from the initial simulated pool n 10 000 considering varying sample sizes i e 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 random observations these subsets included simulated multiple stressor responses covering the five types of interactions and considering the full range of both stressor gradients to select the sample size that optimized computing time we evaluated how statistical power changed depending on the number of analysed observations statistical power measured as the inverse probability of type ii error probability of rejecting false null hypothesis was considered acceptable whenever dispersion ranges of the interaction term estimates did not or only marginally contained zero the minimum sample size that yielded sufficient statistical power for the defined effect sizes and regression error was 200 fig s1 all subsequent analyses used 200 observations to optimize computing times to test the effects of stressor data completeness we considered nine alternative restrictions on the sampled stressors ranges fig 4 step 3 1 full range i e no restrictions considering the whole gradient of the two stressors 2 25 of each stressor gradient 3 50 of each stressor gradient 4 25 of stressor 2 gradient 5 50 of stressor 2 gradient 6 25 of stressor 1 gradient 7 50 of stressor 1 gradient 8 a positive correlated gradient between stressor 1 and 2 9 a negative correlated gradient between stressor 1 and 2 the simulated samplings were taken from the whole stressor gradients with only the constraint of the defined gradient range we only simulated correlated gradients of stressors in which pairwise pearson r 0 7 to avoid biased regression coefficient estimates due to high collinearity e g feld et al 2016 these restricted ranges of stressor gradients can be understood either as a sampling bias of the whole population of observations or constrained stressor ranges inherent to a study area e g catchment in total we ran nine sampling simulations for each of the five interaction types one for each sampling constrain resulting in a total of 45 simulation runs each simulation run consisted of 500 random samples of responses and stressors 200 observations each this resulted in 500 models x nine sampling simulations x five interaction types 22 500 fitted models fig 4 step 4 we computed the r square and regression coefficients effect size for all resulting models for each simulation run set of 500 models we also computed the percentage of significant coefficient estimates confidence intervals not containing zero for each single stressor and interaction terms as well as the percentage of each kind of interaction to which models were classified fig 4 step 5 we assigned a type of response to each simulated model as follows when the confidence intervals of coefficient estimates contained zero models were assigned to the additive type the remaining models were assigned to each type of interaction according to the criteria mentioned in subsection 2 1 models in which estimates of single effect coefficients changed their sign i e were positive were assigned to other all simulations and models were developed in r version 3 3 2 r core team 2020 r codes of functions used in simulations are available in the supporting information appendix 1 3 results 3 1 sampling effects in the goodness of fit our nine alternative restrictions yielded very distinct results depending on the type and degree of sampling restriction goodness of fit fig 5 a measured as r square decreased when the sampled gradients of both stressors were constrained which was more marked for the sampling type with the highest constrained gradient 25 of both stressor gradients captured by random samples when the gradient constraint was restricted to only one stressor the decrease in r square of models using simulated samplings was lower being greater when constraining the gradient range of the stressor with the strongest effect s1 an exception was the complex antagonistic responses where results were highly variable and a less marked decrease was noted for this sampling type when constraining only the gradient range of the weaker stressor s2 r square values were roughly similar to those obtained in the full gradient sampling type remarkably when the simulated sampling captured a positive correlation between stressors we also found minor reductions of r square with respect to the whole range dataset contrarily the negative correlation sampling type resulted in a marked decrease in model goodness of fit 3 2 significance and uncertainty of regression coefficient estimates table 1 shows the percentage of significant single and combined stressor regression coefficients t test p 0 05 of the models analysing simulated data for each type of multiple stressor response overall the percentage of significant single effect coefficients was consistently reduced when constraining the sampled gradient range of both stressors this reduction was particularly marked for the most constrained sampling type 25 of both stressor gradients captured by random samples and for the coefficients of the weakest stressor simulations showed that even for the simulated additive responses there were always a fraction of models with a significant interaction coefficient from 3 6 when no restrictions to the sampled gradient are imposed up to 6 8 when the constraining stressor gradients were negatively correlated for all simulations of synergistic and antagonistic responses less than 60 of the models showed significant interaction coefficients with values decreasing down to 3 antagonistic response considering 25 of both stressor gradients with increasing sampling constraints for strong synergistic and complex antagonistic responses both with the highest interaction term effect sizes the percentage of models with significant interaction coefficients was always above 70 except for simulations with the highest constrained sampling type 25 of both stressor gradients covered model coefficients showed negative or positive values in all types of sampling restriction responses fig 5b with the highest variation occurring for the most constrained sampling type 25 of both stressors gradient covered and the lowest variation occurring for the full gradient sampling simulations we found a reduced variation in the interaction terms for the less constrained and correlated gradient sampling simulations overall the median values of estimated coefficient values were close to the pre established coefficient 3 3 interaction assignment errors the resulting proportion of models assigned to each interaction type fig 6 table s1 indicate that 95 of simulations based on the additive response were correctly assigned to this type wrongly classified effects belonging to the additive response simulations type i errors were mainly assigned either to synergistic or to antagonistic interaction types for example for the full gradient coverage 2 4 and 2 8 of the simulations were assigned respectively to the synergistic and antagonistic interaction types among simulations based on strong synergistic responses all simulations were correctly assigned in the case of a full stressor gradient coverage however for the highest gradient constraint 25 of both stressors gradient covered only 68 0 were classified correctly among simulations based on synergistic responses no interaction was detected in 33 8 of the models for the full stressor gradient scenario for the highest sampling restriction scenario none of the models with significant interactions 8 4 in total were classified as synergistic for correlated stressor gradients scenarios we found the highest percentage of significant synergistic interactions among those using simulations with constrained samplings in the case of antagonistic responses no interaction was detected in 26 6 of the models when the full gradient was covered while for the highest sampling restriction none of the models with significant interactions 8 2 in total were classified as antagonistic for complex antagonistic responses in the case of a full gradient coverage significant interactions were found in all models while for the highest sampling restriction 82 2 of the models showed significant complex antagonistic interactions all misclassified responses were assigned to the additive response type when stressor gradients were correlated we found the highest percentage of significant antagonistic interactions among those for restricted sampling 4 discussion 4 1 multiple stressor effects and gradient length the present work shows that datasets that do not fully capture the entire stressor gradients will limit our ability to identify underlying multiple stressor patterns to an extent that depends on the percentage of sampled gradients and their inter correlation it also shows that under representing the gradient of the stressor with the highest effect size causes a larger impact on the results therefore interaction identification correct interaction classification stressor significance and goodness of fit are all dependent on the proportion of the sampled gradient length these results are coherent between stressor interaction types except for strong synergistic and complex antagonistic interactions in these two cases the percentage of misclassifications was lower possibly because both represented very strong synergistic and antagonistic effects and therefore their effects were more likely to be captured by the sampling design in a recent comprehensive empirical study based on dozens of mesocosm experiments river basin case studies and cross basin analyses it was shown that the share of significant stressor effects and interactions increase with spatial extent namely when cross basin analyses are undertaken birk et al 2020 other spatially extensive studies in freshwaters also found multiple stressor effects to be the rule for example schinegger et al 2016a highlighted that 64 of the impaired sampling sites across europe were affected by two or more stressors and that interactions occurred in most cases 60 while in others the stressors acted additively additionally grizzetti et al 2017 demonstrated how the present status of european rivers can be explained by multiple pressures especially by local pressures acting in conjunction with pressures at the catchment scale according to these studies even with the likely increase in confounding factors at increasing spatial extents which would result in a limited likelihood of detecting individual or interactive stressor effects birk et al 2020 the effect of longer stressor gradients being covered at increasing spatial extents seems to prevail 4 2 implications for management it has been acknowledged that the prevalence of different kinds of interaction has relevant implications for management brown et al 2009 c j 2013 piggott et al 2015 côté et al 2016 recent meta analysis studies found that antagonistic interactions tend to dominate in freshwater environments jackson et al 2016 velasco et al 2018 this is crucial for management because it is well accepted that mitigation measures applied to stressors are less effective in systems where antagonistic effects dominate c j brown et al 2013 piggott et al 2015 however the consequences of antagonistic effects on management may not be so straightforward our results suggest that we should be aware that under some circumstances many of these antagonistic interactions may show a complex pattern if more thoroughly analysed this complex antagonistic response pattern is able to contain within its range both synergistic and antagonistic interactions in portions of the stressor gradient increasing management complexity more empirical evidence for these complex patterns are however needed as they may result from statistical artefacts with little support from data segurado et al 2018 spears et al 2021 4 3 inferring multiple stressor effects from biomonitoring data empirical modeling based on field biomonitoring data can be a useful tool to explore how stressors interact and to predict outcomes of management actions to support improved decision making however a combination of manipulative experiments and empirical modeling is needed to detect meaningful statistical responses especially when parts of the gradients are not sufficiently covered by empirical data in addition regression outcomes should be carefully interpreted and used although practitioners usually devote most interest to evaluating individual stressor and interaction significance p values are uninformative of the stressor effect and importance wasserstein and lazar 2016 for an appropriate evaluation and classification of multiple stressor effects single stressor and interaction effect sizes as well as partitioned explained variance should be also calculated and considered it is also important to realize that whenever analysing pairwise interactions between stressors using regression based empirical approaches the usual course of action when dealing with biomonitoring data deviations from additive effects only arise when one stressor changes the rate of the response variable to the other stressor this makes the empirical modeling approach quite different from multifactorial manipulative experimental approaches in which confounding factors are controlled and only responses to specific doses of stressors are compared to responses in the absence of stressors i e not involving estimates of response rates nonetheless data deficiencies can also produce biased results in manipulative experimental results by not allowing estimation of stressor effect relationships arguably limiting the ability to predict effects beyond treatment levels due to lack of enough stressor gradient range within experimental treatment levels the same two stressors acting simultaneously can be wrongly classified into different interaction types something similar to the effects of constrained stressor gradient sampling found in the present study this is the reason why schäfer piggott 2018 suggested that at least five stress levels should be used in experimental settings whenever possible the use of replicated regression is recommended over analyses based on few discrete stressor levels e g anova due to its higher statistical power when the studied stressors are continuous and a whole gradient can be easily simulated under experimental conditions cottingham et al 2005 our results are in line with a recent computer simulation study which showed that the number of locations representing the whole gradient of environmental drivers and not the level of replication at fewer environmental states yielded the highest amount of mechanistically explainable variance kreyling et al 2018 our results also support the idea that experiments that are supported by well represented stressor gradients ease the interpolation or extrapolation of the response between and beyond stressor treatment levels schäfer and piggott 2018 4 4 is linearity a valid assumption in this study we considered the simplest form of two stressors linearly affecting a single indicator in real world situations a given biological level of organization is affected by a panoply of natural environmental factors that interact with each other and with human induced stressors most likely in a non linear fashion in addition the assumption that stressors act monotonically and linearly along their whole gradient on a given organism population community or other ecosystem health indicators is overly simplistic while there are many examples of abrupt non linear changes brito et al 2020 chen and olden 2020 or wedge shaped responses bryce et al 2010 to stressors that are more appropriately addressed with other regression families a recent meta analysis found most ecological responses to environmental degradation to be essentially gradual hillebrand et al 2020 in contrast to the monotonic responses dealt here different response signs and interaction types may arise at different portions of stressor gradients for instance if the response is ruled by an unimodal subsidy stress gradient odum et al 1979 as is often the case with nutrient enrichment wagenhoff et al 2011 a 2013 positive synergistic and positive antagonistic interactions piggot et al 2015 may arise at subsidy portions of stressor gradients hence using simulations based on this kind of responses would be less straightforward to illustrate the effect of different stressor ranges coverage on interaction identification here we also did not address other forms of interaction such as dominance schäfer and piggott 2018 i e the effect of one stressor dominating other stressors i e cancelling their effects which in turn does not influence the effect of the dominant one although relatively common in multiple stressor contexts birk et al 2020 this type of interaction is equivalent to a single stressor situation and therefore falls outside of the scope of this study different mechanisms governing stressor effects also imply alternative null models to be considered in a regression based framework which differ from the simple additive null model schäfer and piggott 2018 spears et al 2021 for simplicity here we used a paired stressor interaction assuming an additive null model and considering the linear negative response to be a valid approximation to any generic monotonic negative effect of stressors despite the clear over simplification the overall trends found in this study would probably apply to more complex higher order non linear and or non monotonic situations and assuming other interaction null models since the identification testing and parameterization of interactions among different regression approaches are very much alike at the very least our results call for caution when deriving managing implications from highly biased stressor gradients in more complex situations hence we believe our findings are useful to demonstrate the importance of adequately covering stressor gradients and to draw attention to the idea that different systems by containing different portions of stressor gradients may show inconsistent responses to a same set of stressors 4 5 messages to researchers and managers in face of the results of the simulation exercise presented in this study a question that may arise to local managers is whether there is enough gradient of given stressors in their targeted system to allow an adequate detection of multiple stressor interactions and effects firstly it is crucial to focus on stressors to which different portions of their gradients can be adequately represented in the sampling design this requires an a priori and thorough knowledge of stressors occurring throughout the system under study sampling design should then cover as homogeneously temporally and or spatially as possible the full stressor gradient present at the targeted system to minimize wrong identification of stressor interactions moreover an expressive number of observations along the full gradient of the stressors is also paramount for an accurate prediction of response cottingham et al 2005 lange et al 2014 sett et al 2014 this is often hampered by constraints such as insufficient funding or logistic issues and so compromise solutions should be carefully assessed to guarantee reliable results to be attained hughes and peck 2008 we encourage researchers that deal with biomonitoring data to adapt the provided r code appendix 2 to their particular case studies using real stressors instead of virtual ones to assess through similar sampling simulations the sensitivity of interaction identification and parameterization to sample size collinearity among stressors and stressors gradient coverage in addition managers should be aware that effective management actions might differ for similar stressors combination regionally and for different spatial extents as there are stressors that have different impacts at continental basin or site spatial extents clements et al 2012 birk et al 2020 herlihy et al 2020 management actions must be tailored to each spatial extent but should understand their place within the overall gradient of the stressors to avoid being effective only at a given spatial extent there has been recent progress in understanding how mechanisms acting across levels of biological organization and spatio temporal scales may influence the nature of stressor interactions jackson et al 2021 simmons et al 2021 turschwell et al 2022 hence an additional aspect is that users should try to select appropriate biological metrics that relate mechanistically with the studied stressors e g functional trait based metrics poff 1997 chen et al 2019 this will ease a mechanistic interpretation of the patterns that arise from empirical modeling and thereby to generate testable hypothesis about underlying processes 5 conclusions natural environments are continuously facing anthropogenic pressures that result in interacting stressors at various time and spatial extents while studies on multiple stressors have become increasingly frequent in freshwater ecology literature e g ormerod et al 2010 jackson et al 2016 there is still a shortage of mechanistic understanding and more integrative predictive frameworks of stressor interactions effectively diminishing the ability to correctly fashion management and conservation plans schäfer and piggott 2018 orr et al 2020 an incorrect assessment of stressor interaction might even lead to incorrect management actions that can ultimately have an undesired opposed effect spears et al 2021 here we assessed how changing gradient coverage either as the result of sampling constraints or different environmental contexts may affect the ability to detect and to identify interactions between a strong and a weak stressor under certain circumstances our simulations also show that static measures may not be applied in the hopes of a homogeneous effect throughout the gradient of the stressors as stressor gradient lengths are context dependent and may change over time our study supports the need for an adaptive management planning fully informed by data rich monitoring schemes a strategy

24368,the decline of pollinators is a widespread problem in today s agriculture affecting the yield of many crops improved pollination management is therefore essential and honey bee colonies are often used to improve pollination levels in this work we applied a spatially explicit agent based model for the simulation of crop pollination by honey bees under different management scenarios and landscape configurations the model includes 1 a representation of honey bee social dynamics 2 an explicit representation of resource dynamics 3 a probabilistic approach to the foraging site search process and 4 a mechanism of competition for limited resources we selected 60 sample units from the rural landscape of the chilean region with the largest apple growing area and evaluated the effectiveness of different pollination strategies in terms of number of visits and number of pollinated flowers per hectare of apple crops finally we analyzed how the effects of these practices depended on the structure of adjacent landscapes higher colony density per hectare in the focal crop increased the number of honey bee visits to apple inflorescences however the effects were nonlinear for rates of pollinated flowers suggesting that there is an optimum beyond which a greater number of honey bees does not signify increased levels of crop pollination furthermore high relative proportions of mass flowering crops and natural habitats in the landscape led to a decrease in honey bee densities in apple fields in landscapes with high relative cover of apple orchards dilution effect our results indicate that for optimal crop pollination strategies for management of pollinator species should consider the modulating effects of the surrounding landscape on pollination effectiveness this model could thus be a useful tool to help farmers beekeepers and policy makers plan the provision of pollination services while also promoting the biodiversity and sustainability of agroecosystems keywords pollination agriculture landscape ecology apis mellifera spill over competition data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction there is widespread recognition that the absence or shortage of pollinators is limiting crop yields around the world garibaldi et al 2011 and managed honey bee colonies are commonly used to address this problem the european honey bee apis mellifera is the most widely managed species both in open pollination fields and enclosed systems garibaldi et al 2017 managed honey bee colonies have certain advantages they can be supplied on demand to coincide with blooming and the location of colonies in the crop is relatively unconstrained cunningham et al 2016 however even though biotic pollination is important for many crops potts et al 2016 it is rarely monitored garibaldi et al 2020 current management strategies for optimal pollination commonly involve providing managed pollinators such as honey bees at times of high demand indeed many pollination reference handbooks e g delaplane and meyer 2000 lesser preuss 2004 and empirical evidence isaacs and kirk 2010 howlett et al 2015 cunningham et al 2016 suggest placing a particular number of honey bee colonies per crop cultivated area to saturate crop flowers with foraging bees brought in at the beginning of the target crop blooming period james and pitts singer 2008 colony density is only one aspect of the strategy optimal pollination also depends on the spatial organization of honey bee colonies since distance between colony placements may influence the spatial pattern of bee activity affecting the depletion rate of pollen from flowers cunningham et al 2016 except in some highly pollinator dependent crops e g almonds where the use of managed pollinators is routine the effectiveness of managed pollination practices has been under studied understanding how landscape structure i e landscape composition and configuration determines the densities of functionally relevant species is critical for maintaining ecosystem services like pollination in anthropogenically transformed landscapes tscharnkte et al 2012 movement across habitats is a common phenomenon in many species and the spillover of pollinators from natural habitats to agroecosystems has been well documented in human dominated landscapes garibaldi et al 2011 while there is much evidence for spillover from natural habitats to managed areas little attention has been given to flow in the opposite direction blitzer et al 2012 for instance mass flowering crops may alter pollination services to other simultaneously blooming crops either decreasing pollination via competition for pollinators or facilitating it via pollination spillover holzschuh et al 2011 holzschuh et al 2016 osterman et al 2021 the response of managed honey bee abundance and service to landscape predictors is nonlinear and depends on interactions between landscape composition and configuration and the pollination strategy used nevertheless to our knowledge this has not been examined mechanistic models can help us investigate the implications of colony management practices for crop pollination and their interaction with landscape structure effects many models have been developed to explore how pollination services are delivered across landscapes and how these services are affected by changes in landscape structure several of these models include a spatial dimension and incorporate seasonal aspects of floral resources and population dynamics lonsdorf et al 2009 zulian et al 2013 olsson and bolin 2014 olsson et al 2015 hӓussler et al 2017 some spatially explicit models can also predict how management interventions in a particular landscape affect pollination olsson et al 2015 hӓussler et al 2017 and address the impact of various combinations of stressors on pollinators becher et al 2018 becher et al 2016 becher et al 2014 although these models are of interest in addressing this question they assume that there is no resource depletion which is key to understanding honey bee foraging behavior and particularly how exploitative competition can affect foraging site choice inouye 1978 balfour et al 2015 one exception is the paper by bolin et al 2018 that demonstrates the existence of a coexistence mechanism by developing a spatially explicit mechanistic model for exploitative competition using an existing general framework for habitat selection by central place foragers olsson et al 2008 2015 olsson and bolin 2014 however this model has no relation to the use of managed honey bee colonies for crop pollination furthermore although some models can provide relative measures of pollinator visitation to crops lonsdorf et al 2009 zulian et al 2013 or relatively realistic predictions of visitation rates becher et al 2014 olsson et al 2015 hӓussler et al 2017 they do not incorporate process based ecological production functions that would enable assessment of the effects of pollination levels on crop fruit set one exception is the spatially explicit simulation model developed by sáez et al 2018b which addresses the processes of pollen removal and deposition within apple orchards with emphasis on how the spatial design of trees in orchards and honey bee locations modify the pollination process however the spatial scale considered a field of 1 ha does not allow examination of how landscape structure moderates pollinator performance on pollinator dependent crops in this study we assess the effect of honey bee colony management on apple pollination in the central southern region of chile considering particularly the number of colonies per hectare and their spatial arrangement we also analyze how the effects of these strategies differ according to the characteristics of the surrounding landscape to this end we apply a spatially explicit agent based model joseph et al 2020 to simulate the pollinator activity of honey bees in real agricultural landscapes we expand the model by incorporating an ecological production function that describes the pollination and post pollination processes that determine fruit set 2 materials and methods 2 1 honey bee colonies we used a spatially explicit agent based model joseph et al 2020 to simulate crop pollination by honey bees this model represents honey bee colonies as unique and independent entities that interact with each other through their local environment another important characteristic of the colonies is that they have adaptive behavior i e they collect nectar and pollen from food sources in the surrounding landscape to store in their nest and feed to the brood however to exploit a food source the bees need to find it in the first place because floral resources are limited the food collected by a colony in a foraging site necessarily reduces the food available to other colonies at the site affecting the foraging decisions and patch visitation rates of the bees and in consequence colony development and survival each honey bee colony in the model is characterized by its location its number of bees and its quantity of honey intra colony demography and life history characteristics are based on the model proposed by khoury et al 2013 where colony growth is determined by food availability and its interaction with behavioral and social processes in the colony the only difference is that while in this model the food stores increase proportionally to the number of foragers in our model it increases with the daily gain of the foragers g t which depends on the resource availability in the surrounding landscape the equation for the amount of food that is stored in the hive and available for colony use is 1 f t 1 f t γ a n f n w γ b n b g t with f t representing the amount of food on day t γ a the consumption of stored food by workers and foragers γ b the consumption of stored food by broods and n f n w n b are the number of foragers workers and broods respectively the khoury et al 2013 model uses simple differential equations to represent the transitions of eggs laid by the queen to brood which then become hive bees and finally forager bees and the process of social inhibition that regulates the rate at which hive bees begin to forage the model assumes that food availability can influence both the number of broods successfully reared to adulthood and the rate at which bees transition from hive duties to foraging 2 2 land cover and floral resource dynamics the input data for the model are from land cover maps composed of a discrete number of land cover classes where honey bee colonies can search for food each land cover class is paired to a resource carrying capacity k a daily resource renewal rate r a value for floral attractiveness for honey bees fa and a flowering period carrying capacity k is the amount of nectar and or pollen resources available in each cell for a certain number of land cover classes which represent fields with crops or habitats with wild flowers we assume that the carrying capacity is constant during the flowering period and equal to zero the rest of the year and that these resources are renewed daily at a constant rate r during the flowering period we do not distinguish between pollen and nectar protein and carbohydrates here time evolves in discrete steps with a time unit of one day we keep the carrying capacity constant assuming that the new flowers during the flowering period compensate for the loss of production due to pollination and damage as implemented in joseph et al 2020 floral attractiveness was defined as a score ranging from zero not at all attractive never used to one very attractive preferred over other flowers we assume that attractiveness scores reflect both attractiveness per se and nutritional quality scoring was based on literature and expert opinion koh et al 2015 zulian et al 2013 appendix a the model uses land cover maps of 3 km by 3 km with a spatial resolution of 10 m where bees can search for food sources this precision level is small enough to capture the size of the apis mellifera foraging area and large enough to be interesting in terms of their flight range since not all colonies will be able to forage across the entire map the maximum foraging distance has been set to 3 km so that bees can forage on almost all the map it is known that bees can make trips farther than 3 km abou shaara 2014 but these trips cannot be seen on the map as currently implemented the average foraging distance of the bees is not a parameter of the model but a result of the foraging process and varies with the exponent γ of the preference function and with the distribution of the food sources in the landscape the exponent γ represents the knowledge that the hive has of the resources in its surroundings the adoption of a foraging site by a group of foragers implies that they constantly come back to this site until the nectar source is exhausted lesser preuss 2004 in the model each day a colony selects a number of foraging sites with a size of 30 m by 30 m 9 cells where it will send a fraction of foragers to collect food the number of foraging sites a colony visits each day is proportional to the number of foragers n f in the colony divided by the size of a squad k a honey bee colony selects their foraging sites at the beginning of each day relying on information provided by scouting bees the foraging resources at the sites and their distance from the colony the probability of choosing a site x y is defined as depending on r t x y which is the total resource on a square lattice composed of a central cell x y and the eight cells that surround it and the flight cost of reaching them f d 2 p x y r t x y f d γ u v r f r t u v f d γ i f d r f 0 o t h e r w i s e where d is the euclidean distance from the hive to x y and r f is the range of flight of the bees the cost f d normalized to the interval 0 1 is an affine decreasing function of d with f 0 1 and f r f 0 the exponent γ represents the knowledge that the colony have of the resource in its surroundings if γ 0 the colony chooses its foraging sites uniformly at random and when γ the colony systematically chooses the site with the highest harvestable resource the precise value of this parameter is less important than the general shape of the function so there is some freedom to choose it within the boundaries of biological significance we have used r f 3 km and γ 3 as in joseph et al 2020 once the foraging sites have been selected the colony sends a fraction v i of foragers to each site i also depending on resource availability and distance from the hive d this parameter v i is a weighting factor so that the more foraging resources there are on a harvesting site the more foragers are sent to it eq 5 joseph et al 2020 as a result of the foraging site selection process several colonies may select the same foraging sites and compete for the resources intra specific competition we implement this possibility of colony competition by sorting each day a random harvesting order τ for each colony sorting this order at every time step averages the effect of the selected order through exploitation colonies interact with each other indirectly responding to a resource level that has been depressed by the activity of competitors r t τ x y the probability of colonies choosing the same site is higher when the resource in their surroundings is globally low and thus the competition is stronger let r t τ x y correspond to the value of the resources after the turn of the colony which feeds at round τ the harvestable resources available for the next colony at the site is the product of r t τ x y and f d let c correspond to the maximum that a forager can carry back if the distance to the hive is null if the resource is in excess the foragers sent to the site collect the maximum quantity they can carry during the day c f d v k n f but if the resource is lower than this value they take it all and deplete the site the daily gain of colony i at site x y can then be described as follows 3 g i t x y m i n c f d v i n f r t τ x y the total daily gain of a colony is then the sum of all the local gains at its foraging sites g t i g i t x y 2 3 pollination function in this work we expand the model of joseph et al 2020 incorporating an indicator of the level of crop pollination this incorporation is directly related to scientific studies that estimate the number of visits required to fully fertilize the receptive ovules of a single flower s k vicens and bosch 2000 s k javoreck et al 2002 godwin et al 2013 sáez et al 2014 sáez et al 2018a garibaldi et al 2020 let us formulate a model for the number of flowers successfully pollinated at each cell this number depends on three factors the number of flowers at the cell multiplied by the probability of pollination and by the probability of remaining viable both of these probabilities depend on the number of visits if we call p the probability that a visit will lead to successful pollination i e mean efficiency of one visit the probability that a flower will be successfully pollinated after a number v t of visits is 1 1 p v t taking into account the damage that can be done to the flower cribb 1990 velthuis and van doorn 2006 morris et al 2010 badano and vergara 2011 garibaldi et al 2013 sáez et al 2014 rollin and garibaldi 2019 sáez et al 2018a let us say that each visit has a constant probability q of damage after repeated visits the probability of remaining viable is 1 q v t which can be recast as an exponential decaying with a constant rate similar to that used in sáez et al 2018a thus the proportion of flowers that will be pollinated can be written as 4 p t x y e x p λ v t 1 1 p v t n f l x y where n f l x y is the number of flowers in the cell λ is a constant decay rate and v t is the number of visits per flower per day fig 1 shows the time dependence of this function the outputs of the model are two matrices one represents the number of visits to each cell while the second shows the number of pollinated flowers in each cell both variables have been used in other studies as a proxy for pollination efficiency rollin and garibaldi 2019 the output matrix of the simulation model using the equation of pollination and post pollination processes is an innovation introduced into the model presented in joseph et al 2020 we programmed the simulations in spyder 3 all codes are written in python using the cuda module for gpu computation all the parameters used for the colony model have been kept from the study by khoury et al 2013 a summary of the parameters and their values is provided in appendix b 2 4 baseline landscapes we focused on agricultural landscapes of the maule region in chile characterized by the heterogeneous distribution of grasslands and crop fields combined with plantation forestry and natural areas mostly sclerophyllous forest we used a national land cover map zhao et al 2016 and the regional fruit census odepa 2016 to obtain a regional land cover map first we standardized the map classification to six land use classes croplands natural and semi natural habitats hereafter natural habitats water bodies urban areas barren lands and snow and ice the natural habitats include forests grasslands shrubs and wetlands we then identified the fruit crops with the largest cultivated area in the region based on the regional fruit census the major crops were apples cherries olives kiwis walnuts and pears while hazelnuts blueberries raspberries and blackberries were cultivated on a smaller scale odepa 2016 finally we worked on the land cover classification scheme on a more detailed level performing an overlay of the fruit crop classes in the cropland class increasing the number of land cover classes to 16 in total appendix a this map was resampled to change the cell size from 30 to 10 m the spatial resolution at which the model works a total of 60 maps of 3 km x 3 km were selected along independent gradients of landscape composition of apple crops and configuration edge density fig 2 sp 0 10 p 0 43 to determine landscape composition on each map we quantified the percentage cover of apple crops natural habitats and mass flowering crops mass flowering crops included all fruit nut crops present in the study landscapes whose flowering periods overlapped at least in part with apple crops but did not include them the flowering periods of cherries pears blueberries raspberries and walnuts partially matched the apple blooming period de la cuadra et al 2019 we also calculated landscape configuration as the total length of edges per area of each map edge density in m ha landscapes with high edge density increase opportunities for exchange thus favoring the spillover of energy resources and organisms across habitats including between managed and natural ecosystems this measure has been frequently used in other studies fahrig 2003 martin et al 2019 nicholson et al 2017 to obtain these landscape metrics we used fragstats 4 2 software mcgarigal and ene 2014 the percentage area covered by apple crops spanned a gradient of 0 5 to 60 6 percent mean sd 14 5 12 9 natural habitats covered a gradient of 0 to 81 8 percent mean sd 19 3 21 2 and mass flowering crops spanned a gradient of 0 to 27 69 percent mean sd 10 2 7 9 additionally the selected maps covered a gradient of edge density within the range of 60 6 242 2 m ha mean sd 124 3 38 6 m ha 2 5 landscapes with simulated colony density and arrangement strategies we generated management scenarios by adding honey bee colonies virtually following a factorial design that combines two factors colony density with two levels 4 and 8 hives per ha of apple crop and the distance between groups of colonies also with two levels 125 and 250 m a total of 4 total treatments and 60 replications were therefore carried out for each treatment we represented the distance between groups of colonies by treating their location as the center of a circle whose diameter indicates the distance between groups from this value we generated a network of circles for each distance on each map and estimated how many circles could fit inside each apple orchard we considered the center of each circle as a colony group so we used these coordinates to determine the spatial arrangement of colony groups within each apple orchard for each treatment on each map fig 3 to determine the number of colonies in each apple field for each selected colony density we multiplied the number of colonies for each density level by the size of each focal crop field we then divided the number of colonies in each apple field by the number of circles contained in each field for each of the distance factor levels we considered only spring and summer seasons when most crops bloom and the demand for honey bee colonies for crop pollination usually increases natural habitats begin to bloom in the spring and extend to summer due to their greater floral diversity in contrast crops have shorter blooming periods of around 30 days at different moments of both seasons since not all crops bloom simultaneously most flowering and therefore the demand for pollination services occurs between august and november in the central northern and central southern regions of chile de la cuadra et al 2019 estay 2012 simulated honey bee colonies were active for 40 days we considered a flowering period of 30 days for apple cultivars moreover we included a period of 10 days 5 days before and 5 after the beginning of flowering which enabled us to incorporate the variability of times in pollination contracts for instance placement of the colonies 2 6 statistical analyses we used general linear models with a normal error distribution to analyze the effects of landscape composition and configuration crop pollination management and the interaction between these variables on the number of visits and the number of pollinated flowers per hectare in the apple fields visits to the apple crops were estimated as the average number of visits per hectare of apples cultivated and visits to the adjacent landscape were estimated as the average number of visits per hectare of the landscape surrounding the apple crops the numbers of pollinated flowers were estimated as the number of pollinated flowers by hectare of cultivated apple crops and the number of pollinated flowers per hectare of landscape adjacent to these crops to avoid collinearity between variables a non parametric multiple correlation matrix expressed in a correlogram was performed using the spearman correlation sp fig 2 we checked for multicollinearity between our chosen variables using the variance inflation factor vif variance inflation factors vifs for all predictors colony density apple cover mass flowering crops natural habitats edge density were always lower than 1 8 in all models the models considered the effects of honey bee colony density categorical variable the distance between groups of colonies categorical variable the proportion of apple crops quantitative variable the proportion of mass flowering crops quantitative variable the proportion of natural habitats quantitative variable the landscape edge density quantitative variable and their interactions the squared focal crop proportion and the logarithm of the focal crop proportion were also included in order to consider nonlinear responses to the different colony management strategies we used multi model inference burnham et al 2011 to select the minimum adequate model by the lowest akaike information criteria value aic using the model sel function of the mumin package package mumin of the r version 4 1 1 statistical software r core team 2020 the objective of aic model selection is to estimate the information loss when model g i is used to approximate full reality f a measure for the discrepancy between full reality and model g i is given by the kullback leibler k l information quantity i f g which is equal to the negative boltzmann s 1877 generalized entropy akaike 1973 has shown that choosing the model with the lowest expected information loss is asymptotically equivalent to choosing a model m i i 1 2 k that has the lowest aic value the aic is defined as 5 a i c i 2 l o g l i 2 v i where l i the maximum likelihood for the candidate model i is determined by adjusting the v i free parameters in such a way as to maximize the probability that the candidate model has generated the observed data eq 5 shows that the aic rewards descriptive accuracy via the maximum likelihood and penalizes lack of parsimony according to the number of free parameters the model with the smallest aic value was selected as the best among the models tested the aic differences δ i a i c i a i c m i n were computed over all candidate models g i to quantify the plausibility of each model given the data and the set of models the akaike weight w i of each model was calculated where 6 w i e x p 1 2 δ i j 1 r e x p 1 2 δ r the akaike weight is considered as the weight of evidence in favor of model i being the actual best model of the available set of models burnham and anderson 2002 burnham et al 2011 we also estimated the relative importance r i of predictor variables x j in the set of models with the importance function of the mumin package package mumin which sums the akaike weights across all the models in the set where variable j occurs thus the relative importance of variable j is reflected in the sum w j the larger the w j the more important variable j is relative to the other variables burnham and anderson 2002 predictors with r i 0 6 were considered strongly related to response variables we performed a graphical inspection of the models to evaluate their adequacy by plotting i standardized residuals against fitted values and the predictive variables and ii a quantile quantile distribution of standardized residuals 2 7 return on investment analysis return on investment roi analysis was used to evaluate the efficiency of different colony management decisions in pollination the definition of roi used in finance is the ratio of net benefits to costs the roi calculation organizes a project s costs and benefits into a useful profitability measure we estimated the total number of fruits ha 1 by multiplying the number of pollinated flowers per hectare by the fruit to flower ratio of apple crops 0 1 hünicken et al 2020 on average 70 of apple production is sold f torres pers com we obtained monthly wholesale values for apples at the closest reference markets from march to november 2019 odepa gob cl precios avance por productos de frutas y hortalizas the price depended on the quality of

honey bee colonies excluded averaged 0 30 us kg 1 the average price paid for colony rental for the whole pollination season was 42 us for each scenario we estimated a farmer s profit in us ha 1 as

efficiency δroi 9 δ r o i r o i 8 r o i 4 3 results 3 1 apple crops the general linear models showed that for the number of visits and number of pollinated flowers the important predictors were colony density proportions of focal crop natural habitats mass flowering crops and edge density in the landscape distance between colony groups within the apple fields was not found to be important see estimated coefficients of the models in table 1 and the relative importance of each predictor variable in appendix c our results show that as apple cover increased the number of visits per hectare to the crop increased this increase was not constant however being more marked at low cover than at high cover of apple crops fig 4 a the main difference in number of visits per hectare between treatments was that on average the number of visits increased more with a high density of honey bee colonies 8 per hectare than with a low density 4 per hectare for each 1 increase in the area of cultivated apples in the landscape appendix d with respect to the number of pollinated flowers per hectare we observed that as apple cover increased within the landscape the number of pollinated flowers also increased however the rate of increase was not constant being more marked at low cover of apple crops than at high cover fig 4b this implies deceleration of the rate of increase in the number of pollinated flowers per hectare of the crop as crop cover in the landscapes increased fig 5 in apple crops the number of flowers pollinated was explained by an interaction between the cover of apple crops and colony density table 1 in landscapes with a high cover of apple crops the difference in the number of flowers pollinated between colony densities was lower than for low cover fig 4b in fact when the cover of apple crops exceeded 38 of the landscape the higher colony density generated a decrease in the number of flowers pollinated per hectare fig 4b according to these models the number of visits and the number of flowers pollinated decreased with each percentual increment in the cover of mass flowering crops fig 4c and fig 4d and natural habitats fig 4e and fig 4f in the surrounding landscape for both colony densities table 1 finally the number of visits and the number of flowers pollinated decreased with increasing edge density in the landscape these relationships were consistent for both colony density factor levels fig 4g and fig 4h 3 2 surrounding landscape the general linear models showed that for both response variables the important predictors were colony density and the proportions of apple crops natural habitats and mass flowering crops the remaining predictors were not strongly related to the response variables see estimated coefficients of the models in table 1 and relative importance values in appendix c in the landscapes surrounding the apple crops the number of visits shows nonlinear increases with increasing cover of apple crops both with 4 and 8 colonies per hectare fig 6 a table 2 furthermore as apple crop cover increased the number of visits in the landscape increased more rapidly however the number of visits to the landscape varied with colony density comparing landscapes with the low and high colony densities the model predicted a greater increase in the number of visits in landscapes with high colony density fig 6a table 2 in the case of the number of pollinated flowers in the landscape surrounding apple crops the effect was different the number of pollinated flowers in the surrounding landscape increased with increasing cover of apple crops but this increase was not constant being higher at low cover of apple crops and lower at high cover of apple crops fig 6b table 2 this implies a decrease in the rate of increase of the number of pollinated flowers in the landscape this decrease is even greater with higher honey bee colony density in apple crops thus when the cover of apple crops in the landscape exceeded 48 of the total the average rate of change became negative indicating a decrease in the number of pollinated flowers in nearby patches within these landscapes in the case of the lower colony density this phenomenon was observed when the cover of apple crops in the landscape exceeded 60 of the total landscape fig 6b table 2 in the landscapes surrounding the apple crops the number of visits and the number of pollinated flowers increased with increasing cover of mass flowering crops for both colony densities fig 6c and fig 6d table 2 finally the number of visits and the number of pollinated flowers in the landscapes adjacent to the apple crops also increased with increasing cover of natural habitats for both colony densities fig 6e and fig 6f table 2 3 3 return on investment analysis when analyzing the return on investment for the different colony management strategies we observed that the average roi for the scenarios where honey bee colonies were stocked at 8 per hectare was 29 3 5 6 us ha mean se while for the scenarios supplied with 4 colonies per hectare it was 31 5 8 6 us ha mean se however on closer analysis of the results the decision to use a density of 8 colonies per hectare of crop was more profitable in apple orchards with an area of less than 100 cultivated hectares 13 of the total landscape in which context the performance was superior to that of the investment using 4 colonies per hectare on the other hand in apple orchards that exceeded 100 cultivated hectares it was observed that using a density of 4 hives per hectare of crop was a more efficient and profitable investment than using a higher density of colonies fig 7 4 discussion honey bee pollination services directly impact the productivity of many important crops that require these services for their viability applying the model of joseph et al 2020 in real agricultural landscapes we have demonstrated that colony density has a positive effect on the number of visits to the crop but this does not always ensure a higher number of pollinated flowers our results show that higher colony density can increase the number of pollinated flowers per hectare only up to a point since when the cover of apples 40 of landscape area increasing honey bee density through the introduction of a large quantity of colonies does not necessarily ensure higher flower pollination fig 5b these results have strong implications for the management practices of crop pollination providing information on how to maximize pollination services we found not only a decrease in the number of pollinated flowers per hectare of the target crop at the highest colony density but also an increase in the number of visits to the surrounding landscapes mainly mass flowering crops and the natural habitats this is due to the increasing cover of apple crops and the resulting higher density of honey bee colonies in the crops appendix d this increase in the number of visits to the landscape is the result of redistribution of honey bee foragers in search of new foraging sites due to a decrease in the availability of resources in the targeted crop because of high honey bee densities and the consequent increase in competition among foragers moreover this change in the spatial distribution of honey bee foragers was modulated by the blooming period and relative attractiveness of floral resources in each land cover class riedinger et al 2014 this spillover mechanism of the honey bee foragers from the crops to the adjacent habitats has been surprisingly under researched even though it is very likely to occur frequently in productive landscapes dicks et al 2010 blitzer et al 2012 tscharntke et al 2012 holzschuh et al 2016 osterman et al 2021 our results show that the landscape complexity that surrounds the target crop fields moderates the distribution of pollinators in productive landscapes this is because an increase in cover of mass flowering crops and natural habitats generates a decrease in the number of visits to the crop especially when colony density is high colony densities were greater in landscapes with high cover of apple crops which led to higher densities of honey bees in nearby habitat patches when blooming apple crops acted as an attractant for honey bees reducing their densities in nearby habitat patches however a sizeable honey bee spillover from apple crops into adjacent habitats occurred before and after crop bloom while blooming apple crops can retain to some extent the hive mediated surplus of foragers on a landscape scale however this transient attraction effect turned into a massive spillover effect in periods before and after the blooming of apple crops resulting in higher visitation rates in other habitats that provide food resources mainly other mass flowering crops cherries blueberries etc and natural habitats appendix e this spillover was resource mediated since it happened at the same time as a sudden shortage in floral resources in apple crops these results are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the cross habitat spillover of mobile organisms across the managed natural system interface blitzer et al 2012 tscharntke et al 2012 and previous studies that document such effects in oilseed rape holzschuh et al 2011 and orange groves gonzález varo and vilá 2017 the spatially explicit model presented in this work provides a valuable insight into the efficiency of different management strategies and the effects of landscape composition and configuration on crop pollination with managed honey bee colonies this represents an opportunity to improve crop productivity through better management of pollinators in our analysis we have shown a positive effect of honey bee densities on crop visitation rates however this relationship seems to be nonlinear for the number of pollinated flowers in this context increasing the number of colonies in the landscape and consequently the number of honey bee foragers does not necessarily signify a proportional increase of honey bee foragers in the targeted crop or higher pollination in fact stocking a field with more colonies does not necessary result in higher fruit production e g viana et al 2014 our results have direct implications for farmers profits we estimated that the mean return on investment for farmers averaged across all apple orchards studied was 29 3 us for the high colony density and 31 5 us for the low colony density comparing across management strategies the best return of investment outcomes was gained with a low colony density 4 cph except in smaller apple orchards 100 ha where the most efficient strategy proved to be high colony density 8 cph this finding is positive for farmers because routine management practices in bee pollination uses the honey bee colony as a management unit with beekeeper and farmer agreeing on a rental price per colony therefore our model can help guide decision making regarding the number of colonies needed to increase the efficiency of pollination activity at the lowest possible cost it is important to note that our assumption that the values of the number of visits per flower needed to ensure full ovule fertilization are homogeneous for all land cover types is an extrapolation the model input parameters are based on values that are still unclear for most crops so sufficient data are not always available to parameterize the model consequently we recommend validating the model against observational data to ensure its predictions reflect current observed reality another factor to consider is the estimation of floral attractiveness based on expert opinion experts scored land cover types independently so expert opinion scores may be inaccurate or not yield the most appropriate values within our modeling scenario a more sophisticated elicitation method may have provided more reliable final scores allowing the experts to collectively review all opinions and iteratively refine and discuss their scores gardner et al 2020 finally management recommendations are highly variable with strong fluctuations depending on the crop cultivar and spatial context therefore we recommend building the modeling scenarios according to the local pollination strategies to be evaluated maximizing production and reducing yield gaps in pollinator dependent crops are key challenges with strong implications for farmers and consumers worldwide garibaldi et al 2016 the model presented here can serve as a useful tool to assess the effectiveness of current pollination practices and could be used to improve pollination practices in different applied contexts based on our model results improving pollination through effective management can have a potentially large economic effect on farmers income furthermore as the model can handle cases of resource supplementation tscharntke et al 2012 it can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving the occurrence and magnitude of honey bee spillover namely temporal changes in floral resources on local and landscape scales and increased beekeeping on a landscape scale both to provide pollination services to crops and produce honey given that in some places pollinators are managed at densities that are higher than optimal we expect that this model can help guide local management decision making and result in more limited spillover garibaldi et al 2017 of managed pollinators from crop areas into natural areas thus reducing their potentially detrimental effects goulson 2003 herbertsson

24368,the decline of pollinators is a widespread problem in today s agriculture affecting the yield of many crops improved pollination management is therefore essential and honey bee colonies are often used to improve pollination levels in this work we applied a spatially explicit agent based model for the simulation of crop pollination by honey bees under different management scenarios and landscape configurations the model includes 1 a representation of honey bee social dynamics 2 an explicit representation of resource dynamics 3 a probabilistic approach to the foraging site search process and 4 a mechanism of competition for limited resources we selected 60 sample units from the rural landscape of the chilean region with the largest apple growing area and evaluated the effectiveness of different pollination strategies in terms of number of visits and number of pollinated flowers per hectare of apple crops finally we analyzed how the effects of these practices depended on the structure of adjacent landscapes higher colony density per hectare in the focal crop increased the number of honey bee visits to apple inflorescences however the effects were nonlinear for rates of pollinated flowers suggesting that there is an optimum beyond which a greater number of honey bees does not signify increased levels of crop pollination furthermore high relative proportions of mass flowering crops and natural habitats in the landscape led to a decrease in honey bee densities in apple fields in landscapes with high relative cover of apple orchards dilution effect our results indicate that for optimal crop pollination strategies for management of pollinator species should consider the modulating effects of the surrounding landscape on pollination effectiveness this model could thus be a useful tool to help farmers beekeepers and policy makers plan the provision of pollination services while also promoting the biodiversity and sustainability of agroecosystems keywords pollination agriculture landscape ecology apis mellifera spill over competition data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction there is widespread recognition that the absence or shortage of pollinators is limiting crop yields around the world garibaldi et al 2011 and managed honey bee colonies are commonly used to address this problem the european honey bee apis mellifera is the most widely managed species both in open pollination fields and enclosed systems garibaldi et al 2017 managed honey bee colonies have certain advantages they can be supplied on demand to coincide with blooming and the location of colonies in the crop is relatively unconstrained cunningham et al 2016 however even though biotic pollination is important for many crops potts et al 2016 it is rarely monitored garibaldi et al 2020 current management strategies for optimal pollination commonly involve providing managed pollinators such as honey bees at times of high demand indeed many pollination reference handbooks e g delaplane and meyer 2000 lesser preuss 2004 and empirical evidence isaacs and kirk 2010 howlett et al 2015 cunningham et al 2016 suggest placing a particular number of honey bee colonies per crop cultivated area to saturate crop flowers with foraging bees brought in at the beginning of the target crop blooming period james and pitts singer 2008 colony density is only one aspect of the strategy optimal pollination also depends on the spatial organization of honey bee colonies since distance between colony placements may influence the spatial pattern of bee activity affecting the depletion rate of pollen from flowers cunningham et al 2016 except in some highly pollinator dependent crops e g almonds where the use of managed pollinators is routine the effectiveness of managed pollination practices has been under studied understanding how landscape structure i e landscape composition and configuration determines the densities of functionally relevant species is critical for maintaining ecosystem services like pollination in anthropogenically transformed landscapes tscharnkte et al 2012 movement across habitats is a common phenomenon in many species and the spillover of pollinators from natural habitats to agroecosystems has been well documented in human dominated landscapes garibaldi et al 2011 while there is much evidence for spillover from natural habitats to managed areas little attention has been given to flow in the opposite direction blitzer et al 2012 for instance mass flowering crops may alter pollination services to other simultaneously blooming crops either decreasing pollination via competition for pollinators or facilitating it via pollination spillover holzschuh et al 2011 holzschuh et al 2016 osterman et al 2021 the response of managed honey bee abundance and service to landscape predictors is nonlinear and depends on interactions between landscape composition and configuration and the pollination strategy used nevertheless to our knowledge this has not been examined mechanistic models can help us investigate the implications of colony management practices for crop pollination and their interaction with landscape structure effects many models have been developed to explore how pollination services are delivered across landscapes and how these services are affected by changes in landscape structure several of these models include a spatial dimension and incorporate seasonal aspects of floral resources and population dynamics lonsdorf et al 2009 zulian et al 2013 olsson and bolin 2014 olsson et al 2015 hӓussler et al 2017 some spatially explicit models can also predict how management interventions in a particular landscape affect pollination olsson et al 2015 hӓussler et al 2017 and address the impact of various combinations of stressors on pollinators becher et al 2018 becher et al 2016 becher et al 2014 although these models are of interest in addressing this question they assume that there is no resource depletion which is key to understanding honey bee foraging behavior and particularly how exploitative competition can affect foraging site choice inouye 1978 balfour et al 2015 one exception is the paper by bolin et al 2018 that demonstrates the existence of a coexistence mechanism by developing a spatially explicit mechanistic model for exploitative competition using an existing general framework for habitat selection by central place foragers olsson et al 2008 2015 olsson and bolin 2014 however this model has no relation to the use of managed honey bee colonies for crop pollination furthermore although some models can provide relative measures of pollinator visitation to crops lonsdorf et al 2009 zulian et al 2013 or relatively realistic predictions of visitation rates becher et al 2014 olsson et al 2015 hӓussler et al 2017 they do not incorporate process based ecological production functions that would enable assessment of the effects of pollination levels on crop fruit set one exception is the spatially explicit simulation model developed by sáez et al 2018b which addresses the processes of pollen removal and deposition within apple orchards with emphasis on how the spatial design of trees in orchards and honey bee locations modify the pollination process however the spatial scale considered a field of 1 ha does not allow examination of how landscape structure moderates pollinator performance on pollinator dependent crops in this study we assess the effect of honey bee colony management on apple pollination in the central southern region of chile considering particularly the number of colonies per hectare and their spatial arrangement we also analyze how the effects of these strategies differ according to the characteristics of the surrounding landscape to this end we apply a spatially explicit agent based model joseph et al 2020 to simulate the pollinator activity of honey bees in real agricultural landscapes we expand the model by incorporating an ecological production function that describes the pollination and post pollination processes that determine fruit set 2 materials and methods 2 1 honey bee colonies we used a spatially explicit agent based model joseph et al 2020 to simulate crop pollination by honey bees this model represents honey bee colonies as unique and independent entities that interact with each other through their local environment another important characteristic of the colonies is that they have adaptive behavior i e they collect nectar and pollen from food sources in the surrounding landscape to store in their nest and feed to the brood however to exploit a food source the bees need to find it in the first place because floral resources are limited the food collected by a colony in a foraging site necessarily reduces the food available to other colonies at the site affecting the foraging decisions and patch visitation rates of the bees and in consequence colony development and survival each honey bee colony in the model is characterized by its location its number of bees and its quantity of honey intra colony demography and life history characteristics are based on the model proposed by khoury et al 2013 where colony growth is determined by food availability and its interaction with behavioral and social processes in the colony the only difference is that while in this model the food stores increase proportionally to the number of foragers in our model it increases with the daily gain of the foragers g t which depends on the resource availability in the surrounding landscape the equation for the amount of food that is stored in the hive and available for colony use is 1 f t 1 f t γ a n f n w γ b n b g t with f t representing the amount of food on day t γ a the consumption of stored food by workers and foragers γ b the consumption of stored food by broods and n f n w n b are the number of foragers workers and broods respectively the khoury et al 2013 model uses simple differential equations to represent the transitions of eggs laid by the queen to brood which then become hive bees and finally forager bees and the process of social inhibition that regulates the rate at which hive bees begin to forage the model assumes that food availability can influence both the number of broods successfully reared to adulthood and the rate at which bees transition from hive duties to foraging 2 2 land cover and floral resource dynamics the input data for the model are from land cover maps composed of a discrete number of land cover classes where honey bee colonies can search for food each land cover class is paired to a resource carrying capacity k a daily resource renewal rate r a value for floral attractiveness for honey bees fa and a flowering period carrying capacity k is the amount of nectar and or pollen resources available in each cell for a certain number of land cover classes which represent fields with crops or habitats with wild flowers we assume that the carrying capacity is constant during the flowering period and equal to zero the rest of the year and that these resources are renewed daily at a constant rate r during the flowering period we do not distinguish between pollen and nectar protein and carbohydrates here time evolves in discrete steps with a time unit of one day we keep the carrying capacity constant assuming that the new flowers during the flowering period compensate for the loss of production due to pollination and damage as implemented in joseph et al 2020 floral attractiveness was defined as a score ranging from zero not at all attractive never used to one very attractive preferred over other flowers we assume that attractiveness scores reflect both attractiveness per se and nutritional quality scoring was based on literature and expert opinion koh et al 2015 zulian et al 2013 appendix a the model uses land cover maps of 3 km by 3 km with a spatial resolution of 10 m where bees can search for food sources this precision level is small enough to capture the size of the apis mellifera foraging area and large enough to be interesting in terms of their flight range since not all colonies will be able to forage across the entire map the maximum foraging distance has been set to 3 km so that bees can forage on almost all the map it is known that bees can make trips farther than 3 km abou shaara 2014 but these trips cannot be seen on the map as currently implemented the average foraging distance of the bees is not a parameter of the model but a result of the foraging process and varies with the exponent γ of the preference function and with the distribution of the food sources in the landscape the exponent γ represents the knowledge that the hive has of the resources in its surroundings the adoption of a foraging site by a group of foragers implies that they constantly come back to this site until the nectar source is exhausted lesser preuss 2004 in the model each day a colony selects a number of foraging sites with a size of 30 m by 30 m 9 cells where it will send a fraction of foragers to collect food the number of foraging sites a colony visits each day is proportional to the number of foragers n f in the colony divided by the size of a squad k a honey bee colony selects their foraging sites at the beginning of each day relying on information provided by scouting bees the foraging resources at the sites and their distance from the colony the probability of choosing a site x y is defined as depending on r t x y which is the total resource on a square lattice composed of a central cell x y and the eight cells that surround it and the flight cost of reaching them f d 2 p x y r t x y f d γ u v r f r t u v f d γ i f d r f 0 o t h e r w i s e where d is the euclidean distance from the hive to x y and r f is the range of flight of the bees the cost f d normalized to the interval 0 1 is an affine decreasing function of d with f 0 1 and f r f 0 the exponent γ represents the knowledge that the colony have of the resource in its surroundings if γ 0 the colony chooses its foraging sites uniformly at random and when γ the colony systematically chooses the site with the highest harvestable resource the precise value of this parameter is less important than the general shape of the function so there is some freedom to choose it within the boundaries of biological significance we have used r f 3 km and γ 3 as in joseph et al 2020 once the foraging sites have been selected the colony sends a fraction v i of foragers to each site i also depending on resource availability and distance from the hive d this parameter v i is a weighting factor so that the more foraging resources there are on a harvesting site the more foragers are sent to it eq 5 joseph et al 2020 as a result of the foraging site selection process several colonies may select the same foraging sites and compete for the resources intra specific competition we implement this possibility of colony competition by sorting each day a random harvesting order τ for each colony sorting this order at every time step averages the effect of the selected order through exploitation colonies interact with each other indirectly responding to a resource level that has been depressed by the activity of competitors r t τ x y the probability of colonies choosing the same site is higher when the resource in their surroundings is globally low and thus the competition is stronger let r t τ x y correspond to the value of the resources after the turn of the colony which feeds at round τ the harvestable resources available for the next colony at the site is the product of r t τ x y and f d let c correspond to the maximum that a forager can carry back if the distance to the hive is null if the resource is in excess the foragers sent to the site collect the maximum quantity they can carry during the day c f d v k n f but if the resource is lower than this value they take it all and deplete the site the daily gain of colony i at site x y can then be described as follows 3 g i t x y m i n c f d v i n f r t τ x y the total daily gain of a colony is then the sum of all the local gains at its foraging sites g t i g i t x y 2 3 pollination function in this work we expand the model of joseph et al 2020 incorporating an indicator of the level of crop pollination this incorporation is directly related to scientific studies that estimate the number of visits required to fully fertilize the receptive ovules of a single flower s k vicens and bosch 2000 s k javoreck et al 2002 godwin et al 2013 sáez et al 2014 sáez et al 2018a garibaldi et al 2020 let us formulate a model for the number of flowers successfully pollinated at each cell this number depends on three factors the number of flowers at the cell multiplied by the probability of pollination and by the probability of remaining viable both of these probabilities depend on the number of visits if we call p the probability that a visit will lead to successful pollination i e mean efficiency of one visit the probability that a flower will be successfully pollinated after a number v t of visits is 1 1 p v t taking into account the damage that can be done to the flower cribb 1990 velthuis and van doorn 2006 morris et al 2010 badano and vergara 2011 garibaldi et al 2013 sáez et al 2014 rollin and garibaldi 2019 sáez et al 2018a let us say that each visit has a constant probability q of damage after repeated visits the probability of remaining viable is 1 q v t which can be recast as an exponential decaying with a constant rate similar to that used in sáez et al 2018a thus the proportion of flowers that will be pollinated can be written as 4 p t x y e x p λ v t 1 1 p v t n f l x y where n f l x y is the number of flowers in the cell λ is a constant decay rate and v t is the number of visits per flower per day fig 1 shows the time dependence of this function the outputs of the model are two matrices one represents the number of visits to each cell while the second shows the number of pollinated flowers in each cell both variables have been used in other studies as a proxy for pollination efficiency rollin and garibaldi 2019 the output matrix of the simulation model using the equation of pollination and post pollination processes is an innovation introduced into the model presented in joseph et al 2020 we programmed the simulations in spyder 3 all codes are written in python using the cuda module for gpu computation all the parameters used for the colony model have been kept from the study by khoury et al 2013 a summary of the parameters and their values is provided in appendix b 2 4 baseline landscapes we focused on agricultural landscapes of the maule region in chile characterized by the heterogeneous distribution of grasslands and crop fields combined with plantation forestry and natural areas mostly sclerophyllous forest we used a national land cover map zhao et al 2016 and the regional fruit census odepa 2016 to obtain a regional land cover map first we standardized the map classification to six land use classes croplands natural and semi natural habitats hereafter natural habitats water bodies urban areas barren lands and snow and ice the natural habitats include forests grasslands shrubs and wetlands we then identified the fruit crops with the largest cultivated area in the region based on the regional fruit census the major crops were apples cherries olives kiwis walnuts and pears while hazelnuts blueberries raspberries and blackberries were cultivated on a smaller scale odepa 2016 finally we worked on the land cover classification scheme on a more detailed level performing an overlay of the fruit crop classes in the cropland class increasing the number of land cover classes to 16 in total appendix a this map was resampled to change the cell size from 30 to 10 m the spatial resolution at which the model works a total of 60 maps of 3 km x 3 km were selected along independent gradients of landscape composition of apple crops and configuration edge density fig 2 sp 0 10 p 0 43 to determine landscape composition on each map we quantified the percentage cover of apple crops natural habitats and mass flowering crops mass flowering crops included all fruit nut crops present in the study landscapes whose flowering periods overlapped at least in part with apple crops but did not include them the flowering periods of cherries pears blueberries raspberries and walnuts partially matched the apple blooming period de la cuadra et al 2019 we also calculated landscape configuration as the total length of edges per area of each map edge density in m ha landscapes with high edge density increase opportunities for exchange thus favoring the spillover of energy resources and organisms across habitats including between managed and natural ecosystems this measure has been frequently used in other studies fahrig 2003 martin et al 2019 nicholson et al 2017 to obtain these landscape metrics we used fragstats 4 2 software mcgarigal and ene 2014 the percentage area covered by apple crops spanned a gradient of 0 5 to 60 6 percent mean sd 14 5 12 9 natural habitats covered a gradient of 0 to 81 8 percent mean sd 19 3 21 2 and mass flowering crops spanned a gradient of 0 to 27 69 percent mean sd 10 2 7 9 additionally the selected maps covered a gradient of edge density within the range of 60 6 242 2 m ha mean sd 124 3 38 6 m ha 2 5 landscapes with simulated colony density and arrangement strategies we generated management scenarios by adding honey bee colonies virtually following a factorial design that combines two factors colony density with two levels 4 and 8 hives per ha of apple crop and the distance between groups of colonies also with two levels 125 and 250 m a total of 4 total treatments and 60 replications were therefore carried out for each treatment we represented the distance between groups of colonies by treating their location as the center of a circle whose diameter indicates the distance between groups from this value we generated a network of circles for each distance on each map and estimated how many circles could fit inside each apple orchard we considered the center of each circle as a colony group so we used these coordinates to determine the spatial arrangement of colony groups within each apple orchard for each treatment on each map fig 3 to determine the number of colonies in each apple field for each selected colony density we multiplied the number of colonies for each density level by the size of each focal crop field we then divided the number of colonies in each apple field by the number of circles contained in each field for each of the distance factor levels we considered only spring and summer seasons when most crops bloom and the demand for honey bee colonies for crop pollination usually increases natural habitats begin to bloom in the spring and extend to summer due to their greater floral diversity in contrast crops have shorter blooming periods of around 30 days at different moments of both seasons since not all crops bloom simultaneously most flowering and therefore the demand for pollination services occurs between august and november in the central northern and central southern regions of chile de la cuadra et al 2019 estay 2012 simulated honey bee colonies were active for 40 days we considered a flowering period of 30 days for apple cultivars moreover we included a period of 10 days 5 days before and 5 after the beginning of flowering which enabled us to incorporate the variability of times in pollination contracts for instance placement of the colonies 2 6 statistical analyses we used general linear models with a normal error distribution to analyze the effects of landscape composition and configuration crop pollination management and the interaction between these variables on the number of visits and the number of pollinated flowers per hectare in the apple fields visits to the apple crops were estimated as the average number of visits per hectare of apples cultivated and visits to the adjacent landscape were estimated as the average number of visits per hectare of the landscape surrounding the apple crops the numbers of pollinated flowers were estimated as the number of pollinated flowers by hectare of cultivated apple crops and the number of pollinated flowers per hectare of landscape adjacent to these crops to avoid collinearity between variables a non parametric multiple correlation matrix expressed in a correlogram was performed using the spearman correlation sp fig 2 we checked for multicollinearity between our chosen variables using the variance inflation factor vif variance inflation factors vifs for all predictors colony density apple cover mass flowering crops natural habitats edge density were always lower than 1 8 in all models the models considered the effects of honey bee colony density categorical variable the distance between groups of colonies categorical variable the proportion of apple crops quantitative variable the proportion of mass flowering crops quantitative variable the proportion of natural habitats quantitative variable the landscape edge density quantitative variable and their interactions the squared focal crop proportion and the logarithm of the focal crop proportion were also included in order to consider nonlinear responses to the different colony management strategies we used multi model inference burnham et al 2011 to select the minimum adequate model by the lowest akaike information criteria value aic using the model sel function of the mumin package package mumin of the r version 4 1 1 statistical software r core team 2020 the objective of aic model selection is to estimate the information loss when model g i is used to approximate full reality f a measure for the discrepancy between full reality and model g i is given by the kullback leibler k l information quantity i f g which is equal to the negative boltzmann s 1877 generalized entropy akaike 1973 has shown that choosing the model with the lowest expected information loss is asymptotically equivalent to choosing a model m i i 1 2 k that has the lowest aic value the aic is defined as 5 a i c i 2 l o g l i 2 v i where l i the maximum likelihood for the candidate model i is determined by adjusting the v i free parameters in such a way as to maximize the probability that the candidate model has generated the observed data eq 5 shows that the aic rewards descriptive accuracy via the maximum likelihood and penalizes lack of parsimony according to the number of free parameters the model with the smallest aic value was selected as the best among the models tested the aic differences δ i a i c i a i c m i n were computed over all candidate models g i to quantify the plausibility of each model given the data and the set of models the akaike weight w i of each model was calculated where 6 w i e x p 1 2 δ i j 1 r e x p 1 2 δ r the akaike weight is considered as the weight of evidence in favor of model i being the actual best model of the available set of models burnham and anderson 2002 burnham et al 2011 we also estimated the relative importance r i of predictor variables x j in the set of models with the importance function of the mumin package package mumin which sums the akaike weights across all the models in the set where variable j occurs thus the relative importance of variable j is reflected in the sum w j the larger the w j the more important variable j is relative to the other variables burnham and anderson 2002 predictors with r i 0 6 were considered strongly related to response variables we performed a graphical inspection of the models to evaluate their adequacy by plotting i standardized residuals against fitted values and the predictive variables and ii a quantile quantile distribution of standardized residuals 2 7 return on investment analysis return on investment roi analysis was used to evaluate the efficiency of different colony management decisions in pollination the definition of roi used in finance is the ratio of net benefits to costs the roi calculation organizes a project s costs and benefits into a useful profitability measure we estimated the total number of fruits ha 1 by multiplying the number of pollinated flowers per hectare by the fruit to flower ratio of apple crops 0 1 hünicken et al 2020 on average 70 of apple production is sold f torres pers com we obtained monthly wholesale values for apples at the closest reference markets from march to november 2019 odepa gob cl precios avance por productos de frutas y hortalizas the price depended on the quality of the fruit which was estimated by its individual weight so we selected an average size of 150 g medium 130 weight 170 g at 0 70 us kg 1 production costs agrochemicals salary gasoline etc but rental of honey bee colonies excluded averaged 0 30 us kg 1 the average price paid for colony rental for the whole pollination season was 42 us for each scenario we estimated a farmer s profit in us ha 1 as

efficiency δroi 9 δ r o i r o i 8 r o i 4 3 results 3 1 apple crops the general linear models showed that for the number of visits and number of pollinated flowers the important predictors were colony density proportions of focal crop natural habitats mass flowering crops and edge density in the landscape distance between colony groups within the apple fields was not found to be important see estimated coefficients of the models in table 1 and the relative importance of each predictor variable in appendix c our results show that as apple cover increased the number of visits per hectare to the crop increased this increase was not constant however being more marked at low cover than at high cover of apple crops fig 4 a the main difference in number of visits per hectare between treatments was that on average the number of visits increased more with a high density of honey bee colonies 8 per hectare than with a low density 4 per hectare for each 1 increase in the area of cultivated apples in the landscape appendix d with respect to the number of pollinated flowers per hectare we observed that as apple cover increased within the landscape the number of pollinated flowers also increased however the rate of increase was not constant being more marked at low cover of apple crops than at high cover fig 4b this implies deceleration of the rate of increase in the number of pollinated flowers per hectare of the crop as crop cover in the landscapes increased fig 5 in apple crops the number of flowers pollinated was explained by an interaction between the cover of apple crops and colony density table 1 in landscapes with a high cover of apple crops the difference in the number of flowers pollinated between colony densities was lower than for low cover fig 4b in fact when the cover of apple crops exceeded 38 of the landscape the higher colony density generated a decrease in the number of flowers pollinated per hectare fig 4b according to these models the number of visits and the number of flowers pollinated decreased with each percentual increment in the cover of mass flowering crops fig 4c and fig 4d and natural habitats fig 4e and fig 4f in the surrounding landscape for both colony densities table 1 finally the number of visits and the number of flowers pollinated decreased with increasing edge density in the landscape these relationships were consistent for both colony density factor levels fig 4g and fig 4h 3 2 surrounding landscape the general linear models showed that for both response variables the important predictors were colony density and the proportions of apple crops natural habitats and mass flowering crops the remaining predictors were not strongly related to the response variables see estimated coefficients of the models in table 1 and relative importance values in appendix c in the landscapes surrounding the apple crops the number of visits shows nonlinear increases with increasing cover of apple crops both with 4 and 8 colonies per hectare fig 6 a table 2 furthermore as apple crop cover increased the number of visits in the landscape increased more rapidly however the number of visits to the landscape varied with colony density comparing landscapes with the low and high colony densities the model predicted a greater increase in the number of visits in landscapes with high colony density fig 6a table 2 in the case of the number of pollinated flowers in the landscape surrounding apple crops the effect was different the number of pollinated flowers in the surrounding landscape increased with increasing cover of apple crops but this increase was not constant being higher at low cover of apple crops and lower at high cover of apple crops fig 6b table 2 this implies a decrease in the rate of increase of the number of pollinated flowers in the landscape this decrease is even greater with higher honey bee colony density in apple crops thus when the cover of apple crops in the landscape exceeded 48 of the total the average rate of change became negative indicating a decrease in the number of pollinated flowers in nearby patches within these landscapes in the case of the lower colony density this phenomenon was observed when the cover of apple crops in the landscape exceeded 60 of the total landscape fig 6b table 2 in the landscapes surrounding the apple crops the number of visits and the number of pollinated flowers increased with increasing cover of mass flowering crops for both colony densities fig 6c and fig 6d table 2 finally the number of visits and the number of pollinated flowers in the landscapes adjacent to the apple crops also increased with increasing cover of natural habitats for both colony densities fig 6e and fig 6f table 2 3 3 return on investment analysis when analyzing the return on investment for the different colony management strategies we observed that the average roi for the scenarios where honey bee colonies were stocked at 8 per hectare was 29 3 5 6 us ha mean se while for the scenarios supplied with 4 colonies per hectare it was 31 5 8 6 us ha mean se however on closer analysis of the results the decision to use a density of 8 colonies per hectare of crop was more profitable in apple orchards with an area of less than 100 cultivated hectares 13 of the total landscape in which context the performance was superior to that of the investment using 4 colonies per hectare on the other hand in apple orchards that exceeded 100 cultivated hectares it was observed that using a density of 4 hives per hectare of crop was a more efficient and profitable investment than using a higher density of colonies fig 7 4 discussion honey bee pollination services directly impact the productivity of many important crops that require these services for their viability applying the model of joseph et al 2020 in real agricultural landscapes we have demonstrated that colony density has a positive effect on the number of visits to the crop but this does not always ensure a higher number of pollinated flowers our results show that higher colony density can increase the number of pollinated flowers per hectare only up to a point since when the cover of apples 40 of landscape area increasing honey bee density through the introduction of a large quantity of colonies does not necessarily ensure higher flower pollination fig 5b these results have strong implications for the management practices of crop pollination providing information on how to maximize pollination services we found not only a decrease in the number of pollinated flowers per hectare of the target crop at the highest colony density but also an increase in the number of visits to the surrounding landscapes mainly mass flowering crops and the natural habitats this is due to the increasing cover of apple crops and the resulting higher density of honey bee colonies in the crops appendix d this increase in the number of visits to the landscape is the result of redistribution of honey bee foragers in search of new foraging sites due to a decrease in the availability of resources in the targeted crop because of high honey bee densities and the consequent increase in competition among foragers moreover this change in the spatial distribution of honey bee foragers was modulated by the blooming period and relative attractiveness of floral resources in each land cover class riedinger et al 2014 this spillover mechanism of the honey bee foragers from the crops to the adjacent habitats has been surprisingly under researched even though it is very likely to occur frequently in productive landscapes dicks et al 2010 blitzer et al 2012 tscharntke et al 2012 holzschuh et al 2016 osterman et al 2021 our results show that the landscape complexity that surrounds the target crop fields moderates the distribution of pollinators in productive landscapes this is because an increase in cover of mass flowering crops and natural habitats generates a decrease in the number of visits to the crop especially when colony density is high colony densities were greater in landscapes with high cover of apple crops which led to higher densities of honey bees in nearby habitat patches when blooming apple crops acted as an attractant for honey bees reducing their densities in nearby habitat patches however a sizeable honey bee spillover from apple crops into adjacent habitats occurred before and after crop bloom while blooming apple crops can retain to some extent the hive mediated surplus of foragers on a landscape scale however this transient attraction effect turned into a massive spillover effect in periods before and after the blooming of apple crops resulting in higher visitation rates in other habitats that provide food resources mainly other mass flowering crops cherries blueberries etc and natural habitats appendix e this spillover was resource mediated since it happened at the same time as a sudden shortage in floral resources in apple crops these results are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the cross habitat spillover of mobile organisms across the managed natural system interface blitzer et al 2012 tscharntke et al 2012 and previous studies that document such effects in oilseed rape holzschuh et al 2011 and orange groves gonzález varo and vilá 2017 the spatially explicit model presented in this work provides a valuable insight into the efficiency of different management strategies and the effects of landscape composition and configuration on crop pollination with managed honey bee colonies this represents an opportunity to improve crop productivity through better management of pollinators in our analysis we have shown a positive effect of honey bee densities on crop visitation rates however this relationship seems to be nonlinear for the number of pollinated flowers in this context increasing the number of colonies in the landscape and consequently the number of honey bee foragers does not necessarily signify a proportional increase of honey bee foragers in the targeted crop or higher pollination in fact stocking a field with more colonies does not necessary result in higher fruit production e g viana et al 2014 our results have direct implications for farmers profits we estimated that the mean return on investment for farmers averaged across all apple orchards studied was 29 3 us for the high colony density and 31 5 us for the low colony density comparing across management strategies the best return of investment outcomes was gained with a low colony density 4 cph except in smaller apple orchards 100 ha where the most efficient strategy proved to be high colony density 8 cph this finding is positive for farmers because routine management practices in bee pollination uses the honey bee colony as a management unit with beekeeper and farmer agreeing on a rental price per colony therefore our model can help guide decision making regarding the number of colonies needed to increase the efficiency of pollination activity at the lowest possible cost it is important to note that our assumption that the values of the number of visits per flower needed to ensure full ovule fertilization are homogeneous for all land cover types is an extrapolation the model input parameters are based on values that are still unclear for most crops so sufficient data are not always available to parameterize the model consequently we recommend validating the model against observational data to ensure its predictions reflect current observed reality another factor to consider is the estimation of floral attractiveness based on expert opinion experts scored land cover types independently so expert opinion scores may be inaccurate or not yield the most appropriate values within our modeling scenario a more sophisticated elicitation method may have provided more reliable final scores allowing the experts to collectively review all opinions and iteratively refine and discuss their scores gardner et al 2020 finally management recommendations are highly variable with strong fluctuations depending on the crop cultivar and spatial context therefore we recommend building the modeling scenarios according to the local pollination strategies to be evaluated maximizing production and reducing yield gaps in pollinator dependent crops are key challenges with strong implications for farmers and consumers worldwide garibaldi et al 2016 the model presented here can serve as a useful tool to assess the effectiveness of current pollination practices and could be used to improve pollination practices in different applied contexts based on our model results improving pollination through effective management can have a potentially large economic effect on farmers income furthermore as the model can handle cases of resource supplementation tscharntke et al 2012 it can provide important insights into the mechanisms driving the occurrence and magnitude of honey bee spillover namely temporal changes in floral resources on local and landscape scales and increased beekeeping on a landscape scale both to provide pollination services to crops and produce honey given that in some places pollinators are managed at densities that are higher than optimal we expect that this model can help guide local management decision making and result in more limited spillover garibaldi et al 2017 of managed pollinators from crop areas into natural areas thus reducing their potentially detrimental effects goulson 2003 herbertsson

24369,population density estimation is essential for wildlife management and conservation camera trap ct surveys have become popular as non invasive monitoring and several methods have been developed to estimate population densities of individually unrecognizable animals exclusively from ct surveys including the random encounter model rem the random encounter and staying time rest model the instantaneous sampling is model and the space to event ste model however these models assume that individual detections are independent events this assumption is violated when animals live in groups and behave correlatedly thus this study aims to compare the performances of the rem the rest the is and the ste when animals move correlatedly in groups their extensions to account for overdispersion of detection count data and an application of group encounters in the rem were also examined seven group sizes and two cohesive patterns were simulated using correlated random walk moving biased to the group centers mimicking red deer and the detection data were fitted to the models a goodness of fit procedure was used to evaluate the fit of the models it was found that the original model of the is and the rest and the rem of the individual encounters to were robust to the violation of independence in detections while the ste underestimated the density they were however poor at data fitting although their extensions to the overdispersion improved the model fitting the negative binomial nb models biased the estimates upward in the is and the rest due to the limitation of sample size the zero inflated poisson in the is did not bias the estimates but was still poor at fitting in large groups and the lomax in the ste did not resolve the underestimation applying the group encounters in the rem also biased the density upward the overestimation in the nb model occurs when the bayesian p value exceeded 0 5 this relationship would be informative in evaluating the possibility of overestimations in the nb model keywords grouping behavior density estimation unmarked animal population camera trap random walk simulation goodness of fit data availability no data was used for the

recent years the installation of remote camera traps cts in wildlife surveys has become popular dramatically as an effective non invasive monitoring method and cts also have been adopted for estimating the abundance burton et al 2015 delisle et al 2021 gilbert et al 2020 o connell et al 2011 although cts promise facilitative and standardized surveys they need to address detection uncertainties i e errors caused in mechanical environmental and ecological processes burton et al 2015 hofmeester et al 2019 various factors can affect the detection process such as animal density behavior movement and body size as ecological factors of the target temperature humidity luminousness and obstacles in viewshed as environmental factors and sensor sensitivity detection zone and shuttering speed as mechanical factors meek et al 2015 rovero et al 2013 explicitly accounting for the underlying ecological processes and observation processes is needed anderson 2001 burton et al 2015 capture recapture methods are known to be reliable statistical models to estimate density from ct surveys accounting for imperfect detectability in individually recognizable animal species e g gardner et al 2010 but are still difficult to be used for many species with no or few natural markings identifiable from ct pictures but see chandler and royle 2013 occupancy modeling is another framework accounting for imperfect detection and can be applied to unmarked animal populations however the assumption of the site closure across repeated survey occasions which is hard to follow in ct surveys requires careful interpretation of the occupancy and impact of animal behavior efford and dawson 2012 neilson et al 2018 rota et al 2009 some models estimating unmarked animal density in continuous regions have also been developed including ones that model the processes of encounter opportunities and mechanical uncertainties of detections the most applied one is the random encounter model rem rowcliffe et al 2008 the rem uses a framework of ideal gas models hutchinson and waser 2007 and estimates density from a fraction of the distance passing over the cts detection area against the total travel distance thus the rem ordinarily requires day range i e distance traveled per day as well as the ct detections the necessity of telemetry data for estimating travel distance limited the implementation of surveys in some cases but some methods estimating day range exclusively from ct data have been developed and have increased their application palencia et al 2021 rowcliffe et al 2016 there are some other models estimating density exclusively from cts including the random encounter and staying time rest model nakashima et al 2018 the instantaneous sampling is model and the space to event ste model moeller et al 2018 the rest a derivative of the rem employs video cameras and estimates density from the staying time of animals within a certain detection area of cts nakashima et al 2018 the is and the ste were described by moeller et al 2018 the is and the ste use a timelapse camera and take pictures at regular intervals whether animals are present or not this randomized sampling procedure removes ambiguities of sensor detection the is derives the density estimates from the expected value of the detection count of each frame which is equal to the abundance expectation in the viewshed whereas the rem and the rest use the number of encounters per camera the ste uses cumulative sampling space until the first detection in an occasion which is exponentially distributed when detections are poisson events all the models described above assumed that the detection events occur independently that is they hypothesized that the members of the target population behave independently however many animal species live in groups animals aggregate when benefits such as cooperation in infant care communal foraging reduction of predation risk and information sharing exceed the grouping cost which is the ordinary case krause and ruxton 2002 rowcliffe et al 2008 described an approach to deriving the density of group living animals as a product of the group density and average group size this approach however still has another ambiguous point besides the precise estimation of average group size and the feasible setting of intervals after shuttering to avoid duplicated detections of group members that is this model does not consider the range of group area although the rem assumes animals to be particles with no area the animal groups have some ranges where the members hang around the encounter probability differs depending on whether the particles have their own range or not this difference will affect the density estimate but has not been fully considered yet the detection counts in non independent animal populations would show overdispersion in the poisson count which can result in improper estimation models accounting for non independent detection have already been developed in the n mixture model martin et al 2011 and the occupancy model ngoprasert et al 2019 they adopt the beta binomial distribution to correlated bernoulli detection processes for count data including the detection count in ct surveys the negative binomial nb distribution is commonly used instead of the poisson distribution when considering overdispersion bliss and fisher 1953 in addition there are also some other models of overdispersion in different manners of variance expression e g quasi poisson wedderburn 1974 and the random effect model bolker et al 2009 zero inflated poisson zip for cases of data with excess zero counts martin et al 2005 these models differ in the methods of weighting data if improper models are applied they can derive incorrect expectation values of estimates richards 2007 ver hoef and boveng 2007 hence careful consideration is needed when applying overdispersion models lindén and mäntyniemi 2011 okamura et al 2012 ver hoef and boveng 2007 the independence of detections is highlighted as an essential assumption in the unmarked density models but its impact on the accuracy of the estimates has hardly been examined yet in this study we aimed to demonstrate the performance of the rem rest is and ste when animals move correlatedly in groups by simulating random walk animal movement furthermore their extensions accounting for overdispersion of detection counts and the impact of group encounters in the rem were examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 animal movement and camera settings random walk simulations were performed to replicate the movement of animals mimicking the movement speed of red deer cervus elaphus berthelot et al 2021 in several grouping patterns red deer aggregate in various structural patterns with sex rutting seasonal or environmental factors and the groups varies in size from solitary to more than 80 individuals with a median size of about 5 76 in the case of the isle of rum clutton brock et al 1982 animals in groups of 120 were assumed to move within the 3000 4000 m enclosed uniform area 10 individuals per km2 seven grouping patterns were simulated solos groups distributed into 60 40 30 20 and 12 expected grouping size of 2 4 6 8 and 10 members and a mixture of half solos and half groups of expected size of ten members excessive aggregation patterns were not simulated because other approaches such as direct counting would be more appropriate than cts two cohesive aggregation patterns where members of groups gather in narrow or wide ranges were also simulated fig 1 groupings were followed by a multinomial distribution with an equal frequency to each group allowing empty or one member classes individuals belonging to groups moved in correlated random walk biased to the group centers and the individuals of solos and group centers moved in non biased correlated random walks in the area each step of random walks is as follows bailey et al 2018 1 δ x n 1 y n 1 r n 1 ω cos ω t φ n sin ω t φ n 1 ω cos θ n δ n sin θ n δ n where r n 1 is the step length in the current step ω t is the navigational direction representing the direction to the group center position in the current step θ n is the persistent direction representing the movement in the previous step φ n and δ n are the random error terms given by von mises distributions mardia and jupp 1999 with a concentration parameter of 36 and ω is the weighting given to the navigation vector i e the vector to the group center in this study the right side of this equation was given by a weighted vector sum of a navigation term and a persistence term e g ω 0 cancels the navigation term and makes steps to a non biased correlated random walk and conversely ω 1 shows a pure biased random walk the ω 0 was used for steps of the solos and the group center as a non biased correlated random walk ω 0 08 for steps of the members aggregating in a wide range and ω 0 16 for those in a narrow range the step interval was assumed to be 5 s and the step length r n 1 was drawn by an autocorrelated log normal distribution given by 2 r n exp μ σ 1 ρ 2 t 1 n z t ρ n t z 0 ρ n where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of ln r n respectively z is a set of uncorrelated random normal deviates and ρ is the correlation coefficient between successive ln r n values the μ 1 76 and σ 1 were set based on berthelot et al 2021 modified to be fit the 5 sec step intervals the ρ is assumed to be 0 95 a periodic boundary was assumed where animals going out of the area were set to come back from the opposite side as a consequence individuals in groups ranged in approximately sd 11 8 m and 3 6 m from the group centers in wide and narrow range grouping respectively the mean distance to the nearest neighbor in a group ranged depending on the group size 3 2 m 6 6 m in the wide range grouping and 0 8 m 1 6 m in the narrow range appendix 1 the day range of travelling was 4823 m on average although home range behavior and various behavioral states e g foraging resting and exploring are common concepts in animal ecology powell 2000 we did not account them in order to simplify the situation in total 30 cts with viewsheds with a radius of 15 m and an angle of 50 98 17 m2 were randomly installed in random directions in the area apart from the focal range of the cts this viewshed was based on the angle of a standard trail camera model trolliet et al 2014 to the extent where middle size ungulates could be distinguishable in forest hayashi unpublished data timelapse pictures which used in the is and the ste were taken every 5 min and all individual encounters passing over the detection zone were recorded for the rest and the rem misdetections were not assumed for the encounters group encounters were regarded as the detection with a 10 min interval after shooting this is a practical way to record group encounters but it should be noted that it includes double counting the intervals need to be set appropriately in the balance between the loss of opportunity and double counting errors rowcliffe et al 2008 in this simulation 10 min were set as the interval where about 1 0 of detections were duplicated the staying time in focal areas used in the rest was calculated from the time difference of the moments crossing a border of the detection zone the moment was derived from a proportion of the distance from the crossing point to the previous and next steps time truncations i e the limitation of video length were not assumed and the focal area of the sensor was assumed to be the same as the viewshed of the cts in order to simplify the model cts were set to start after the burn in iterations of random walks for one day to cancel the initial position biases and ran for 14 days the generation of the ct detection data set was iterated 1000 times with randomized ct positions 2 2 density estimates the density estimates of the rem the rest the is and the ste were compared in seven group sizes and two cohesive patterns the model structures are described in table 1 the two derivations were simulated in the rem one derived the density from all individual encounters rem individual and the other derived it from group density calculated from group encounters encounters with 10 minute intervals multiplying average group sizes the average group sizes were derived from the set value of group size expectation and 5 5 in the mixture case the intervals after shots were excluded from the research period the day range was set to 4823 232 m which was the average derived from random walk sequences in the rest densities were estimated from the individual encounters and staying time in the focal areas of the cts nakashima et al 2018 the is and the ste use timelapse detections moeller et al 2018 the densities of the is were derived from the expectation of the number of individuals in the viewshed of each frame the ste used the amounts of space until an individual was detected in each occasion which was exponentially distributed when detection events were poisson distributed although moeller et al 2018 estimated density simply from the average number of individuals per picture per viewshed area density was estimated from an expectation of detection count in a bayesian framework to compare it with other estimators in the same framework the nb distribution was applied to the is and the rest is nb and rest nb to account for overdispersion in detection count when animals move correlatedly in the groups furthermore the zip and the lomax were applied to the is is zip and the ste ste lomax respectively the zip assumes the two processes of detection the bernoulli process which represents whether groups positioned are potentially detectable or not and the poisson process where some parts of group members are detected when the group is detectable in other words the zip models the excess of undetectability over the poisson event whereas the nb expresses the fluctuation of expectation of poisson events where the expectation is gamma distributed the lomax distribution lomax 1954 is a derivative of the pareto distribution and is equal to a mixture of exponential distributions where the rate is gamma distributed therefore it can express the periods between the nb events like exponential periods of poisson events the performance of the models in relation to the number of cameras was also examined in the case of the group size of 10 with narrow range aggregation which was the most extreme aggregation pattern in this simulation the simulation was performed in 500 iterations where 10 to 200 cameras were randomly sampled to be uniform in log scale from 5000 pre generated camera positions the parameter estimations of all the models were performed using a bayesian framework posterior samples of parameters were obtained via the mcmc method using program jags plummer 2003 executed from r r core team 2020 and r package runjags denwood 2016 a uniform 0 100 prior for the parameters d and t in the rest a uniform 0 100 prior for λ in the is the ste and the is zip a gamma 10 3 103 prior for the nb dispersion size parameter γ in the is nb and the rest nb and a uniform 0 1 prior for the bernoulli process parameter ω in the is zip were set three parallel mcmc chains were run with 10 000 iterations in the ste and 1000 iterations in the other models after initial burn in of 1000 iterations the sampled values were thinned to 10 in the ste while not thinned in the other models mcmc sampling was considered to converge when the r hat value was less than 1 1 gelman et al 2004 to assess the goodness of fit of the models the posterior predictive distributions were checked gelman et al 1996 kéry and schaub 2011 this procedure uses parameters estimated from the observed data from models to be evaluated to generate simulated data sets chi square or similar statistic quantities were computed in each mcmc iteration and bayesian p values were calculated as the proportion of iterations where the fit statistic for simulated replicated data sets was greater than that for the observed data a bayesian p value close to 0 5 indicates a model that appears to fit the data whereas a p value close to 0 or 1 suggests that a model does not adequately fit the data and represents over or under dispersion of observed data than assumed in the model respectively 3 results the summaries of encounters and timelapse detections derived from random walk simulations are shown in appendix 1 in the simulations about the group size and aggregation range all mcmc iterations of the rest and the rem 99 9 of the is and 98 9 of the ste converged i e r 1 1 estimated animal densities in the original poisson distribution model of the is is poisson the rest rest poisson and the rem derived from individual encounters rem individual had larger errors but were not biased even in the larger group sizes fig 2 when nb was applied to the is is nb and the rest rest nb their estimation biased upward the larger the group size the greater the bias and the standard deviations of the mcmc posterior the magnitude of the bias did not differ between the is nb and the rest nb in the narrow range groupings but was smaller in the is nb of wide range groupings which were barely biased the is of the zip model is zip did not bias the estimation of density the ste of both the original exponential ste exp model and the lomax ste lomax model underestimated the density in larger group sizes and differed little the rem derived from group encounters rem group obtained by allowing 10 minute intervals after shots overestimated the density in larger group sizes contrary to the other biased models the magnitude of bias was larger in the wider range group than in the narrow one in the mixture of solos and groups group size 10 the estimates and their deviations indicated intermediate values between the estimates of the solos and the group size of 10 in the is rest ste and rem individual in contrast the rem group in the mixture group pattern overestimated the density more strongly than that in the pattern of groups only goodness of fit procedures in the poisson models the is poisson the rest poisson the rem individual and the rem group indicated that the bayesian p values were close to zero in all the group sizes and cohesive patterns except for the is poisson in solos where the mean value of p was 0 51 the p value of the is nb and the rest nb tended to be more than 0 5 in grouping cases except for the mixture one p 0 5 the upward bias of the wide range groupings was greater than that of the narrow range groupings in the is nb while they differed little in the rest nb although the p value in the is zip was closer to 0 5 than that in the is poisson it declined and got apart from 0 5 when the grouping size increased in the rest poisson the goodness of fit procedure resulted in a p value of 0 05 even when the members moved independently although the p value in the rest nb p 0 42 was closer to 0 5 than that in the rest poisson it increased as the grouping size increased and exceeded 0 5 the tendency of estimation against the number of cts was simulated in the case of the group size of 10 members with a narrow range aggregation which was the most extreme pattern of the simulated groupings fig 3 all the mcmc iterations of the rest and the rem 94 8 of the is and 93 6 of the ste converged i e r 1 1 the upward bias of the is nb and rest nb shrank as the number of cts increased and the estimates converged in the true density at more than approximately 100 cts on the other hand the downward bias of both the ste exp and the ste lomax were constant regardless of the number of cameras the upward bias of the rem group estimates also did not change 4 discussion the main findings of this study were that 1 the estimates of all the original models estimated in this study except for the ste were robust to the violation to independent detections whereas they were poor at data fitting 2 their extensions for the overdispersion improved the model fitting to some extent but resulted in the nb overestimating density in the is and the rest due to the small sample size the zip in the is was still poor at fitting in large groups and the lomax in the ste did not resolve the underestimation of the original 3 applying the group encounters in the rem overestimated the density the original models of the is is poisson the ste ste exp the rest rest poisson and the rem derive from individual encounters rem individual assume that the detections are independent of each other and the correlation due to the aggregation is not considered gilbert et al 2020 although the ste exp underestimated the density the is poisson the rest poisson and the rem individuals were robust to the violation of the independence of individuals in the density estimates the is uses detection counts per frame and the rest and the rem use the number of encounters per camera when the poisson distribution is fitted to the counts the expectation is equal to the mean value of the counts and it is constant regardless of group size because individual detection frequencies throughout a period do not change whether they move independently or not the original ste ste exp on the other hand underestimated the density the higher the cohesion and size of the grouping the more biased the estimates as a result the estimated density in the ste exp was about 1 5 of the actual one the mean posterier value 2 12 0 65 this trend of underestimation did not change no matter how many cameras were installed the ste exp uses the exponential process of total viewshed area until a first individual is detected in each occasion where the detections are independent of each other moeller et al 2018 the number of detection events will decrease from assumed in the poisson process when members move in groups and detections are not independent events which made the ste exp underestimate the density the goodness of fit procedure of the is and rest poisson however resulted in a bayesian p value close to zero and a lack of fit to the data when animals moved in groups indeed these original poisson models might be sufficient if the purpose is just to obtain density estimates but the models should fit well to the data at least when more intricate analyses like accounting for spatial or temporal homogeneity were intended the nb is commonly used to express the overdispersed poisson events in ecology lindén and mäntyniemi 2011 and is also expected to fit the correlated detections in cts however our result showed the tendency to overestimate the density in the is nb and the rest nb and this tendency was related to sample size the uncertainty of the nb estimation with a small sample size has been reported in previous studies clark and perry 1989 lloyd smith 2007 lord 2006 piegorsch 1990 the upward bias of expectation could be induced by the disproportionate effect of some large counts when the data have large dispersion low mean values or small sample size lloyd smith 2007 the sample sizes used in the is nb and the rest nb were different the is nb had a large amount of data counts per frame whereas the rest nb had a small amount counts per ct the reason for the bias of the is nb with big data would be that most of these counts are zeros not detected and few meaningful non zero data would have the disproportional effect although the sample sizes were different their bias related to the number of cts was similar both models were biased with less than about 100 cameras in the simulated case note that this was the extreme case where an average of 10 members aggregated to sd of 3 4 m the magnitude of the bias was different in the case of looser cohesiveness the is nb was barely biased in the wide range grouping whereas the rest nb was therefore the is nb would be still better for density estimation than the rest if the aggregation is not too intensive in the biased trials of both the is nb and the rest nb the bayesian p values exceeded 0 5 the p values were calculated as the proportion of iterations where the fit statistic for simulated replicated data sets was greater than for the observed data thus excess of p value over 0 5 implies that the dispersion of observed detections was smaller than expected in the nb to the contrary the estimations were not biased when the bayesian p value was 0 5 or less the most extreme case was the estimation in the poisson model where the overdispersion was ignored this would be because larger values could be assumed than observations in the trials where the expectation was biased upward due to the disproportional effect but did not occur when underestimating the dispersion therefore the bayesian p value would serve as an indicator of the possibility of overestimation because it could occur when p value exceeded 0 5 the lomax distribution lomax 1954 is the mixture of exponential distributions where the rate follows gamma distributions bryson 1974 this distribution can express the periods between the nb events in this study however the ste lomax could not estimate the density accurately and differed little from the estimate of the ste exp this underestimation was not resolved however many cameras were installed fig 3 there seem to be two discrepancies between the summation of the viewshed in the ste and the distribution of the lomax 1 the summation of the viewshed in the ste takes discrete values whereas the lomax is a continuous probability function and 2 the sum of the viewshed cannot catch adjacent events when the neighbor individuals are shortly found when they move correlatedly these discrepancies made the probability density function of the ste different from the lomax distribution as shown in appendix 2 because accounting for the correlation in detection is difficult checking independence in each detection is required when applying the ste to estimate density rowcliffe et al 2008 derived group living animal densities from the product of group encounters and group sizes our simulation however resulted in this rem of the group encounter model overestimating density when the groups were large this tendency was more apparent in groups cohesive in a broad range than in a narrow range a possible explanation for this overestimation is a lack of consideration of the area of the group the rem considers the encounters of ct areas and points of animals but does not consider the area of animal bodies animal groups however have non negligible areas the encounter probability of the group will be higher than that of particles without spatial extension and this difference will be huge in the group cohesive in a broad range the overestimating would happen not only in the rem but also in the rest if group encounters are adopted because they share the way to model encounters taking account of the group range in the rem would not be easy because it is difficult to define or measure the group range and furthermore animals are not always detected when a ct area and the group range overlap our result showed that individual encounters should be adopted in the rem and the rest for detecting individual encounters it is important to set no or minimal intervals after shots not to miss the accompanied individuals and detection data should be processed carefully not to duplicate counts although the mixture of solos and large groups was an extreme pattern of overdispersed detections and would violate the gamma distribution in the nb its estimation bias became moderate and it represented the intermediate pattern of solos and groups except for the rem of group encounters if more variations of group patterns are mixed detections would get close to the nb because the dispersion of expectation of detection counts fitted better to the gamma distribution in the rem of group encounters the upward bias of density was greater in the mixed pattern because more groups including solos existed than expected from the mean group size the encounter opportunities increased we should be more careful about the overestimation if applying group encounters to the rem when group sizes vary the precision of the is and the rest estimates did not differ and that of the rem was slightly higher in our results the power of these models is derived from the summation of detection areas rather than the proportion of the covered landscape moeller et al 2018 nakashima et al 2018 although the simulations assumed the same detection area in all the models the detection area of real ct viewsheds of the is and sensor detection area of the rest and the rem are different and the sensor area is smaller than the viewshed in most cases marcus rowcliffe et al 2011 therefore the rest and the rem may have lower precision than the is when the same number of cts are installed for the moderate density situation of common species as in this study on the other hand timelapse detections require a high cost in low density cases a collection of a massive number of frames is required to obtain sufficient animal detections which would be a disadvantage of the is and the ste for rare species furthermore as grouping sizes increased the precision of the estimator decreased this implies that efforts should be made to locate more cts in the case of a non independent population the is uses timelapse cameras and thus adopts random detections and this is one of the strengths of the is because the ambiguity of sensor detection such as a differentiation of sensing and viewshed area time lag and sensitivity to the environment is not relevant indeed timelapse cts generate a large number of pictures 120 960 pictures in this case study and man and time power are required to process them machine learning methods for classifying ct data have been developed recently such as the megadetector beery et al 2019 which would be helpful in the effective processing of timelapse pictures our random walk simulation simplified the movement and was not comprehensive to focus on the consequence of grouping behavior we assumed only a small error term in the turn angle i e few sharp turns in a step and no interactive behavior with the nearest neighbors indeed our simulations might differ from the reality in this respect but the impact of these factors on density estimation would be little and the correlations in ct detections were well represented in addition animals in general exhibit more intricate behavior than our random walks home range behavior territoriality and habitat selection would cause spatial heterogeneity hence got detection frequency per camera deviating chandler and royle 2013 nakashima et al 2020 distinguishing these from deviations of grouping would be difficult for the rest and the rem which use detections per camera but would be possible for the is which explicitly expresses variations per frame and camera shifts in behavioral states e g resting foraging and exploring also affect the detection frequency and make density estimates biased or less precise nakashima et al 2018 santini et al 2022 these factors besides the grouping should be considered as sources of deviation when we introduce the models into field surveys the aggregation is a usual occurrence in the animal kingdom krause and ruxton 2002 additionally correlations of movements may also occur depending on the synchronicity in patterns of daily activities land use or flighting behavior although the poisson model of the is the rest and the rem showed robustness to the aggregation in this study accounting for the correlation of detections and fitting the model to the data is still important when the intricate model is considered the nb is the common model of overdispersion but careful consideration was needed when the nb was attached to the is the rest and the rem because of the restriction of the number of detections or the number of cts although we tested only the nb the lomax and the zip to take overdispersion into account there are also some other dispersion models expressing the overdispersion of count data e g the quasi poisson and the random effect model they will derive different expected values due to the difference in the ways to weight ver hoef and boveng 2007 thus it is necessary to consider which overdispersion model to use decision making based on considerations of the background of dispersion is certainly important but model selection can also confirm which model is better to fit the data lindén and mäntyniemi 2011 okamura et al 2012 richards 2007 ver hoef and boveng 2007 goodness of fit procedures are one of the appropriate ways to check a lack of fit it has been pointed out that bayesian p values tend to be conservative and can fail to reject model fitness precisely because the data are used twice that is they are used both to fit the model and to calculate a tail probability yuan and johnson 2012 zhang 2014 however this bayesian p value can be useful in diagnosing obvious cases of lack of fit and in selecting more biologically practical models conn et al 2018 and it would serve as an indicator of overestimation in the nb model limitations of the number of cameras or the non zero detection counts would exist in many ct surveys if the independence of animal detections is assured and more than just the average density is needed it would be important to utilize goodness of fit to determine the possibility of overestimation carefully in the nb or fit a more appropriate model the is would be recommended in moderate densities of common species because of the lower bias in the not so cohesive group besides the clarity of random sampling if a large number of pictures are able to be processed funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public

24369,population density estimation is essential for wildlife management and conservation camera trap ct surveys have become popular as non invasive monitoring and several methods have been developed to estimate population densities of individually unrecognizable animals exclusively from ct surveys including the random encounter model rem the random encounter and staying time rest model the instantaneous sampling is model and the space to event ste model however these models assume that individual detections are independent events this assumption is violated when animals live in groups and behave correlatedly thus this study aims to compare the performances of the rem the rest the is and the ste when animals move correlatedly in groups their extensions to account for overdispersion of detection count data and an application of group encounters in the rem were also examined seven group sizes and two cohesive patterns were simulated using correlated random walk moving biased to the group centers mimicking red deer and the detection data were fitted to the models a goodness of fit procedure was used to evaluate the fit of the models it was found that the original model of the is and the rest and the rem of the individual encounters to were robust to the violation of independence in detections while the ste underestimated the density they were however poor at data fitting although their extensions to the overdispersion improved the model fitting the negative binomial nb models biased the estimates upward in the is and the rest due to the limitation of sample size the zero inflated poisson in the is did not bias the estimates but was still poor at fitting in large groups and the lomax in the ste did not resolve the underestimation applying the group encounters in the rem also biased the density upward the overestimation in the nb model occurs when the bayesian p value exceeded 0 5 this relationship would be informative in evaluating the possibility of overestimations in the nb model keywords grouping behavior density estimation unmarked animal population camera trap random walk simulation goodness of fit data availability no data was used for the

recent years the installation of remote camera traps cts in wildlife surveys has become popular dramatically as an effective non invasive monitoring method and cts also have been adopted for estimating the abundance burton et al 2015 delisle et al 2021 gilbert et al 2020 o connell et al 2011 although cts promise facilitative and standardized surveys they need to address detection uncertainties i e errors caused in mechanical environmental and ecological processes burton et al 2015 hofmeester et al 2019 various factors can affect the detection process such as animal density behavior movement and body size as ecological factors of the target temperature humidity luminousness and obstacles in viewshed as environmental factors and sensor sensitivity detection zone and shuttering speed as mechanical factors meek et al 2015 rovero et al 2013 explicitly accounting for the underlying ecological processes and observation processes is needed anderson 2001 burton et al 2015 capture recapture methods are known to be reliable statistical models to estimate density from ct surveys accounting for imperfect detectability in individually recognizable animal species e g gardner et al 2010 but are still difficult to be used for many species with no or few natural markings identifiable from ct pictures but see chandler and royle 2013 occupancy modeling is another framework accounting for imperfect detection and can be applied to unmarked animal populations however the assumption of the site closure across repeated survey occasions which is hard to follow in ct surveys requires careful interpretation of the occupancy and impact of animal behavior efford and dawson 2012 neilson et al 2018 rota et al 2009 some models estimating unmarked animal density in continuous regions have also been developed including ones that model the processes of encounter opportunities and mechanical uncertainties of detections the most applied one is the random encounter model rem rowcliffe et al 2008 the rem uses a framework of ideal gas models hutchinson and waser 2007 and estimates density from a fraction of the distance passing over the cts detection area against the total travel distance thus the rem ordinarily requires day range i e distance traveled per day as well as the ct detections the necessity of telemetry data for estimating travel distance limited the implementation of surveys in some cases but some methods estimating day range exclusively from ct data have been developed and have increased their application palencia et al 2021 rowcliffe et al 2016 there are some other models estimating density exclusively from cts including the random encounter and staying time rest model nakashima et al 2018 the instantaneous sampling is model and the space to event ste model moeller et al 2018 the rest a derivative of the rem employs video cameras and estimates density from the staying time of animals within a certain detection area of cts nakashima et al 2018 the is and the ste were described by moeller et al 2018 the is and the ste use a timelapse camera and take pictures at regular intervals whether animals are present or not this randomized sampling procedure removes ambiguities of sensor detection the is derives the density estimates from the expected value of the detection count of each frame which is equal to the abundance expectation in the viewshed whereas the rem and the rest use the number of encounters per camera the ste uses cumulative sampling space until the first detection in an occasion which is exponentially distributed when detections are poisson events all the models described above assumed that the detection events occur independently that is they hypothesized that the members of the target population behave independently however many animal species live in groups animals aggregate when benefits such as cooperation in infant care communal foraging reduction of predation risk and information sharing exceed the grouping cost which is the ordinary case krause and ruxton 2002 rowcliffe et al 2008 described an approach to deriving the density of group living animals as a product of the group density and average group size this approach however still has another ambiguous point besides the precise estimation of average group size and the feasible setting of intervals after shuttering to avoid duplicated detections of group members that is this model does not consider the range of group area although the rem assumes animals to be particles with no area the animal groups have some ranges where the members hang around the encounter probability differs depending on whether the particles have their own range or not this difference will affect the density estimate but has not been fully considered yet the detection counts in non independent animal populations would show overdispersion in the poisson count which can result in improper estimation models accounting for non independent detection have already been developed in the n mixture model martin et al 2011 and the occupancy model ngoprasert et al 2019 they adopt the beta binomial distribution to correlated bernoulli detection processes for count data including the detection count in ct surveys the negative binomial nb distribution is commonly used instead of the poisson distribution when considering overdispersion bliss and fisher 1953 in addition there are also some other models of overdispersion in different manners of variance expression e g quasi poisson wedderburn 1974 and the random effect model bolker et al 2009 zero inflated poisson zip for cases of data with excess zero counts martin et al 2005 these models differ in the methods of weighting data if improper models are applied they can derive incorrect expectation values of estimates richards 2007 ver hoef and boveng 2007 hence careful consideration is needed when applying overdispersion models lindén and mäntyniemi 2011 okamura et al 2012 ver hoef and boveng 2007 the independence of detections is highlighted as an essential assumption in the unmarked density models but its impact on the accuracy of the estimates has hardly been examined yet in this study we aimed to demonstrate the performance of the rem rest is and ste when animals move correlatedly in groups by simulating random walk animal movement furthermore their extensions accounting for overdispersion of detection counts and the impact of group encounters in the rem were examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 animal movement and camera settings random walk simulations were performed to replicate the movement of animals mimicking the movement speed of red deer cervus elaphus berthelot et al 2021 in several grouping patterns red deer aggregate in various structural patterns with sex rutting seasonal or environmental factors and the groups varies in size from solitary to more than 80 individuals with a median size of about 5 76 in the case of the isle of rum clutton brock et al 1982 animals in groups of 120 were assumed to move within the 3000 4000 m enclosed uniform area 10 individuals per km2 seven grouping patterns were simulated solos groups distributed into 60 40 30 20 and 12 expected grouping size of 2 4 6 8 and 10 members and a mixture of half solos and half groups of expected size of ten members excessive aggregation patterns were not simulated because other approaches such as direct counting would be more appropriate than cts two cohesive aggregation patterns where members of groups gather in narrow or wide ranges were also simulated fig 1 groupings were followed by a multinomial distribution with an equal frequency to each group allowing empty or one member classes individuals belonging to groups moved in correlated random walk biased to the group centers and the individuals of solos and group centers moved in non biased correlated random walks in the area each step of random walks is as follows bailey et al 2018 1 δ x n 1 y n 1 r n 1 ω cos ω t φ n sin ω t φ n 1 ω cos θ n δ n sin θ n δ n where r n 1 is the step length in the current step ω t is the navigational direction representing the direction to the group center position in the current step θ n is the persistent direction representing the movement in the previous step φ n and δ n are the random error terms given by von mises distributions mardia and jupp 1999 with a concentration parameter of 36 and ω is the weighting given to the navigation vector i e the vector to the group center in this study the right side of this equation was given by a weighted vector sum of a navigation term and a persistence term e g ω 0 cancels the navigation term and makes steps to a non biased correlated random walk and conversely ω 1 shows a pure biased random walk the ω 0 was used for steps of the solos and the group center as a non biased correlated random walk ω 0 08 for steps of the members aggregating in a wide range and ω 0 16 for those in a narrow range the step interval was assumed to be 5 s and the step length r n 1 was drawn by an autocorrelated log normal distribution given by 2 r n exp μ σ 1 ρ 2 t 1 n z t ρ n t z 0 ρ n where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of ln r n respectively z is a set of uncorrelated random normal deviates and ρ is the correlation coefficient between successive ln r n values the μ 1 76 and σ 1 were set based on berthelot et al 2021 modified to be fit the 5 sec step intervals the ρ is assumed to be 0 95 a periodic boundary was assumed where animals going out of the area were set to come back from the opposite side as a consequence individuals in groups ranged in approximately sd 11 8 m and 3 6 m from the group centers in wide and narrow range grouping respectively the mean distance to the nearest neighbor in a group ranged depending on the group size 3 2 m 6 6 m in the wide range grouping and 0 8 m 1 6 m in the narrow range appendix 1 the day range of travelling was 4823 m on average although home range behavior and various behavioral states e g foraging resting and exploring are common concepts in animal ecology powell 2000 we did not account them in order to simplify the situation in total 30 cts with viewsheds with a radius of 15 m and an angle of 50 98 17 m2 were randomly installed in random directions in the area apart from the focal range of the cts this viewshed was based on the angle of a standard trail camera model trolliet et al 2014 to the extent where middle size ungulates could be distinguishable in forest hayashi unpublished data timelapse pictures which used in the is and the ste were taken every 5 min and all individual encounters passing over the detection zone were recorded for the rest and the rem misdetections were not assumed for the encounters group encounters were regarded as the detection with a 10 min interval after shooting this is a practical way to record group encounters but it should be noted that it includes double counting the intervals need to be set appropriately in the balance between the loss of opportunity and double counting errors rowcliffe et al 2008 in this simulation 10 min were set as the interval where about 1 0 of detections were duplicated the staying time in focal areas used in the rest was calculated from the time difference of the moments crossing a border of the detection zone the moment was derived from a proportion of the distance from the crossing point to the previous and next steps time truncations i e the limitation of video length were not assumed and the focal area of the sensor was assumed to be the same as the viewshed of the cts in order to simplify the model cts were set to start after the burn in iterations of random walks for one day to cancel the initial position biases and ran for 14 days the generation of the ct detection data set was iterated 1000 times with randomized ct positions 2 2 density estimates the density estimates of the rem the rest the is and the ste were compared in seven group sizes and two cohesive patterns the model structures are described in table 1 the two derivations were simulated in the rem one derived the density from all individual encounters rem individual and the other derived it from group density calculated from group encounters encounters with 10 minute intervals multiplying average group sizes the average group sizes were derived from the set value of group size expectation and 5 5 in the mixture case the intervals after shots were excluded from the research period the day range was set to 4823 232 m which was the average derived from random walk sequences in the rest densities were estimated from the individual encounters and staying time in the focal areas of the cts nakashima et al 2018 the is and the ste use timelapse detections moeller et al 2018 the densities of the is were derived from the expectation of the number of individuals in the viewshed of each frame the ste used the amounts of space until an individual was detected in each occasion which was exponentially distributed when detection events were poisson distributed although moeller et al 2018 estimated density simply from the average number of individuals per picture per viewshed area density was estimated from an expectation of detection count in a bayesian framework to compare it with other estimators in the same framework the nb distribution was applied to the is and the rest is nb and rest nb to account for overdispersion in detection count when animals move correlatedly in the groups furthermore the zip and the lomax were applied to the is is zip and the ste ste lomax respectively the zip assumes the two processes of detection the bernoulli process which represents whether groups positioned are potentially detectable or not and the poisson process where some parts of group members are detected when the group is detectable in other words the zip models the excess of undetectability over the poisson event whereas the nb expresses the fluctuation of expectation of poisson events where the expectation is gamma distributed the lomax distribution lomax 1954 is a derivative of the pareto distribution and is equal to a mixture of exponential distributions where the rate is gamma distributed therefore it can express the periods between the nb events like exponential periods of poisson events the performance of the models in relation to the number of cameras was also examined in the case of the group size of 10 with narrow range aggregation which was the most extreme aggregation pattern in this simulation the simulation was performed in 500 iterations where 10 to 200 cameras were randomly sampled to be uniform in log scale from 5000 pre generated camera positions the parameter estimations of all the models were performed using a bayesian framework posterior samples of parameters were obtained via the mcmc method using program jags plummer 2003 executed from r r core team 2020 and r package runjags denwood 2016 a uniform 0 100 prior for the parameters d and t in the rest a uniform 0 100 prior for λ in the is the ste and the is zip a gamma 10 3 103 prior for the nb dispersion size parameter γ in the is nb and the rest nb and a uniform 0 1 prior for the bernoulli process parameter ω in the is zip were set three parallel mcmc chains were run with 10 000 iterations in the ste and 1000 iterations in the other models after initial burn in of 1000 iterations the sampled values were thinned to 10 in the ste while not thinned in the other models mcmc sampling was considered to converge when the r hat value was less than 1 1 gelman et al 2004 to assess the goodness of fit of the models the posterior predictive distributions were checked gelman et al 1996 kéry and schaub 2011 this procedure uses parameters estimated from the observed data from models to be evaluated to generate simulated data sets chi square or similar statistic quantities were computed in each mcmc iteration and bayesian p values were calculated as the proportion of iterations where the fit statistic for simulated replicated data sets was greater than that for the observed data a bayesian p value close to 0 5 indicates a model that appears to fit the data whereas a p value close to 0 or 1 suggests that a model does not adequately fit the data and represents over or under dispersion of observed data than assumed in the model respectively 3 results the summaries of encounters and timelapse detections derived from random walk simulations are shown in appendix 1 in the simulations about the group size and aggregation range all mcmc iterations of the rest and the rem 99 9 of the is and 98 9 of the ste converged i e r 1 1 estimated animal densities in the original poisson distribution model of the is is poisson the rest rest poisson and the rem derived from individual encounters rem individual had larger errors but were not biased even in the larger group sizes fig 2 when nb was applied to the is is nb and the rest rest nb their estimation biased upward the larger the group size the greater the bias and the standard deviations of the mcmc posterior the magnitude of the bias did not differ between the is nb and the rest nb in the narrow range groupings but was smaller in the is nb of wide range groupings which were barely biased the is of the zip model is zip did not bias the estimation of density the ste of both the original exponential ste exp model and the lomax ste lomax model underestimated the density in larger group sizes and differed little the rem derived from group encounters rem group obtained by allowing 10 minute intervals after shots overestimated the density in larger group sizes contrary to the other biased models the magnitude of bias was larger in the wider range group than in the narrow one in the mixture of solos and groups group size 10 the estimates and their deviations indicated intermediate values between the estimates of the solos and the group size of 10 in the is rest ste and rem individual in contrast the rem group in the mixture group pattern overestimated the density more strongly than that in the pattern of groups only goodness of fit procedures in the poisson models the is poisson the rest poisson the rem individual and the rem group indicated that the bayesian p values were close to zero in all the group sizes and cohesive patterns except for the is poisson in solos where the mean value of p was 0 51 the p value of the is nb and the rest nb tended to be more than 0 5 in grouping cases except for the mixture one p 0 5 the upward bias of the wide range groupings was greater than that of the narrow range groupings in the is nb while they differed little in the rest nb although the p value in the is zip was closer to 0 5 than that in the is poisson it declined and got apart from 0 5 when the grouping size increased in the rest poisson the goodness of fit procedure resulted in a p value of 0 05 even when the members moved independently although the p value in the rest nb p 0 42 was closer to 0 5 than that in the rest poisson it increased as the grouping size increased and exceeded 0 5 the tendency of estimation against the number of cts was simulated in the case of the group size of 10 members with a narrow range aggregation which was the most extreme pattern of the simulated groupings fig 3 all the mcmc iterations of the rest and the rem 94 8 of the is and 93 6 of the ste converged i e r 1 1 the upward bias of the is nb and rest nb shrank as the number of cts increased and the estimates converged in the true density at more than approximately 100 cts on the other hand the downward bias of both the ste exp and the ste lomax were constant regardless of the number of cameras the upward bias of the rem group estimates also did not change 4 discussion the main findings of this study were that 1 the estimates of all the original models estimated in this study except for the ste were robust to the violation to independent detections whereas they were poor at data fitting 2 their extensions for the overdispersion improved the model fitting to some extent but resulted in the nb overestimating density in the is and the rest due to the small sample size the zip in the is was still poor at fitting in large groups and the lomax in the ste did not resolve the underestimation of the original 3 applying the group encounters in the rem overestimated the density the original models of the is is poisson the ste ste exp the rest rest poisson and the rem derive from individual encounters rem individual assume that the detections are independent of each other and the correlation due to the aggregation is not considered gilbert et al 2020 although the ste exp underestimated the density the is poisson the rest poisson and the rem individuals were robust to the violation of the independence of individuals in the density estimates the is uses detection counts per frame and the rest and the rem use the number of encounters per camera when the poisson distribution is fitted to the counts the expectation is equal to the mean value of the counts and it is constant regardless of group size because individual detection frequencies throughout a period do not change whether they move independently or not the original ste ste exp on the other hand underestimated the density the higher the cohesion and size of the grouping the more biased the estimates as a result the estimated density in the ste exp was about 1 5 of the actual one the mean posterier value 2 12 0 65 this trend of underestimation did not change no matter how many cameras were installed the ste exp uses the exponential process of total viewshed area until a first individual is detected in each occasion where the detections are independent of each other moeller et al 2018 the number of detection events will decrease from assumed in the poisson process when members move in groups and detections are not independent events which made the ste exp underestimate the density the goodness of fit procedure of the is and rest poisson however resulted in a bayesian p value close to zero and a lack of fit to the data when animals moved in groups indeed these original poisson models might be sufficient if the purpose is just to obtain density estimates but the models should fit well to the data at least when more intricate analyses like accounting for spatial or temporal homogeneity were intended the nb is commonly used to express the overdispersed poisson events in ecology lindén and mäntyniemi 2011 and is also expected to fit the correlated detections in cts however our result showed the tendency to overestimate the density in the is nb and the rest nb and this tendency was related to sample size the uncertainty of the nb estimation with a small sample size has been reported in previous studies clark and perry 1989 lloyd smith 2007 lord 2006 piegorsch 1990 the upward bias of expectation could be induced by the disproportionate effect of some large counts when the data have large dispersion low mean values or small sample size lloyd smith 2007 the sample sizes used in the is nb and the rest nb were different the is nb had a large amount of data counts per frame whereas the rest nb had a small amount counts per ct the reason for the bias of the is nb with big data would be that most of these counts are zeros not detected and few meaningful non zero data would have the disproportional effect although the sample sizes were different their bias related to the number of cts was similar both models were biased with less than about 100 cameras in the simulated case note that this was the extreme case where an average of 10 members aggregated to sd of 3 4 m the magnitude of the bias was different in the case of looser cohesiveness the is nb was barely biased in the wide range grouping whereas the rest nb was therefore the is nb would be still better for density estimation than the rest if the aggregation is not too intensive in the biased trials of both the is nb and the rest nb the bayesian p values exceeded 0 5 the p values were calculated as the proportion of iterations where the fit statistic for simulated replicated data sets was greater than for the observed data thus excess of p value over 0 5 implies that the dispersion of observed detections was smaller than expected in the nb to the contrary the estimations were not biased when the bayesian p value was 0 5 or less the most extreme case was the estimation in the poisson model where the overdispersion was ignored this would be because larger values could be assumed than observations in the trials where the expectation was biased upward due to the disproportional effect but did not occur when underestimating the dispersion therefore the bayesian p value would serve as an indicator of the possibility of overestimation because it could occur when p value exceeded 0 5 the lomax distribution lomax 1954 is the mixture of exponential distributions where the rate follows gamma distributions bryson 1974 this distribution can express the periods between the nb events in this study however the ste lomax could not estimate the density accurately and differed little from the estimate of the ste exp this underestimation was not resolved however many cameras were installed fig 3 there seem to be two discrepancies between the summation of the viewshed in the ste and the distribution of the lomax 1 the summation of the viewshed in the ste takes discrete values whereas the lomax is a continuous probability function and 2 the sum of the viewshed cannot catch adjacent events when the neighbor individuals are shortly found when they move correlatedly these discrepancies made the probability density function of the ste different from the lomax distribution as shown in appendix 2 because accounting for the correlation in detection is difficult checking independence in each detection is required when applying the ste to estimate density rowcliffe et al 2008 derived group living animal densities from the product of group encounters and group sizes our simulation however resulted in this rem of the group encounter model overestimating density when the groups were large this tendency was more apparent in groups cohesive in a broad range than in a narrow range a possible explanation for this overestimation is a lack of consideration of the area of the group the rem considers the encounters of ct areas and points of animals but does not consider the area of animal bodies animal groups however have non negligible areas the encounter probability of the group will be higher than that of particles without spatial extension and this difference will be huge in the group cohesive in a broad range the overestimating would happen not only in the rem but also in the rest if group encounters are adopted because they share the way to model encounters taking account of the group range in the rem would not be easy because it is difficult to define or measure the group range and furthermore animals are not always detected when a ct area and the group range overlap our result showed that individual encounters should be adopted in the rem and the rest for detecting individual encounters it is important to set no or minimal intervals after shots not to miss the accompanied individuals and detection data should be processed carefully not to duplicate counts although the mixture of solos and large groups was an extreme pattern of overdispersed detections and would violate the gamma distribution in the nb its estimation bias became moderate and it represented the intermediate pattern of solos and groups except for the rem of group encounters if more variations of group patterns are mixed detections would get close to the nb because the dispersion of expectation of detection counts fitted better to the gamma distribution in the rem of group encounters the upward bias of density was greater in the mixed pattern because more groups including solos existed than expected from the mean group size the encounter opportunities increased we should be more careful about the overestimation if applying group encounters to the rem when group sizes vary the precision of the is and the rest estimates did not differ and that of the rem was slightly higher in our results the power of these models is derived from the summation of detection areas rather than the proportion of the covered landscape moeller et al 2018 nakashima et al 2018 although the simulations assumed the same detection area in all the models the detection area of real ct viewsheds of the is and sensor detection area of the rest and the rem are different and the sensor area is smaller than the viewshed in most cases marcus rowcliffe et al 2011 therefore the rest and the rem may have lower precision than the is when the same number of cts are installed for the moderate density situation of common species as in this study on the other hand timelapse detections require a high cost in low density cases a collection of a massive number of frames is required to obtain sufficient animal detections which would be a disadvantage of the is and the ste for rare species furthermore as grouping sizes increased the precision of the estimator decreased this implies that efforts should be made to locate more cts in the case of a non independent population the is uses timelapse cameras and thus adopts random detections and this is one of the strengths of the is because the ambiguity of sensor detection such as a differentiation of sensing and viewshed area time lag and sensitivity to the environment is not relevant indeed timelapse cts generate a large number of pictures 120 960 pictures in this case study and man and time power are required to process them machine learning methods for classifying ct data have been developed recently such as the megadetector beery et al 2019 which would be helpful in the effective processing of timelapse pictures our random walk simulation simplified the movement and was not comprehensive to focus on the consequence of grouping behavior we assumed only a small error term in the turn angle i e few sharp turns in a step and no interactive behavior with the nearest neighbors indeed our simulations might differ from the reality in this respect but the impact of these factors on density estimation would be little and the correlations in ct detections were well represented in addition animals in general exhibit more intricate behavior than our random walks home range behavior territoriality and habitat selection would cause spatial heterogeneity hence got detection frequency per camera deviating chandler and royle 2013 nakashima et al 2020 distinguishing these from deviations of grouping would be difficult for the rest and the rem which use detections per camera but would be possible for the is which explicitly expresses variations per frame and camera shifts in behavioral states e g resting foraging and exploring also affect the detection frequency and make density estimates biased or less precise nakashima et al 2018 santini et al 2022 these factors besides the grouping should be considered as sources of deviation when we introduce the models into field surveys the aggregation is a usual occurrence in the animal kingdom krause and ruxton 2002 additionally correlations of movements may also occur depending on the synchronicity in patterns of daily activities land use or flighting behavior although the poisson model of the is the rest and the rem showed robustness to the aggregation in this study accounting for the correlation of detections and fitting the model to the data is still important when the intricate model is considered the nb is the common model of overdispersion but careful consideration was needed when the nb was attached to the is the rest and the rem because of the restriction of the number of detections or the number of cts although we tested only the nb the lomax and the zip to take overdispersion into account there are also some other dispersion models expressing the overdispersion of count data e g the quasi poisson and the random effect model they will derive different expected values due to the difference in the ways to weight ver hoef and boveng 2007 thus it is necessary to consider which overdispersion model to use decision making based on considerations of the background of dispersion is certainly important but model selection can also confirm which model is better to fit the data lindén and mäntyniemi 2011 okamura et al 2012 richards 2007 ver hoef and boveng 2007 goodness of fit procedures are one of the appropriate ways to check a lack of fit it has been pointed out that bayesian p values tend to be conservative and can fail to reject model fitness precisely because the data are used twice that is they are used both to fit the model and to calculate a tail probability yuan and johnson 2012 zhang 2014 however this bayesian p value can be useful in diagnosing obvious cases of lack of fit and in selecting more biologically practical models conn et al 2018 and it would serve as an indicator of overestimation in the nb model limitations of the number of cameras or the non zero detection counts would exist in many ct surveys if the independence of animal detections is assured and more than just the average density is needed it would be important to utilize goodness of fit to determine the possibility of overestimation carefully in the nb or fit a more appropriate model the is would be recommended in moderate densities of common species because of the lower bias in the not so cohesive group besides the clarity of random sampling if a large number of pictures are able to be processed funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public
