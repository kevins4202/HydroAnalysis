6835,cascade dams are known to influence the river water cycle but their cumulative effects ces are still not well understood water hydrogen h and oxygen o isotopes are hypothesized to be used to characterize the ces to test this hypothesis we investigated water δd δ18o and related environmental factors in cascade reservoirs on the wujiang river southwest china the δd and δ18o ranged from 64 2 to 45 4 and from 9 7 to 6 8 respectively and showed obvious temporal and spatial variations water temperature is an important factor influencing these variations after damming an increase of water retention time caused the enrichment of heavy h o isotopes in reservoir surface water and thermal stratification induced a decrease of δd and δ18o with depth due to bottom discharge released water showed more negative δd and δ18o than reservoir surface water and these δd and δ18o differences were controlled by water retention time and mean water depth of the reservoir overall the ces of cascade dams caused δd and δ18o to display a jagged increase from upstream to downstream in the impounded wujiang river therefore h o isotopes can be used to estimate the ces of cascade dams as cascade dams can modify h o isotope signatures caution should be exercised when using h and o isotopes to trace the source of the impounded river water keywords hydrogen and oxygen isotopes cumulative effects

vapor will be enriched in light isotopes whereas precipitation will be enriched in heavy isotopes due to weaker evaporation groundwater has lighter isotopes than surface water gat 1996 rozanski et al 2001 hence different water sources have different h o isotope signatures and the isotopes can therefore be used to discriminate water sources kendall and coplen 2001 lachniet and patterson 2002 meredith et al 2009 as temperature and latitude also affect the h o isotope signatures of precipitation dansgaard 1964 dutton et al 2005 h o isotopes are also used to study the response of lakes to climate factors such as temperature and seasonal precipitation and the sensitivity of h o isotopes to precipitation is usually higher in lakes with short retention time than in lakes with long retention time leng et al 2006 jonsson et al 2009 recently h o isotopes have been used to understand the effect of the dam on the river water cycle deng et al 2016 li et al 2016 in this study we hypothesize that h o isotopes can be used to characterize ces of cascade dams the impounded wujiang river southwest china is an ideal place to test this hypothesis as there are many different aged reservoirs along this river and these reservoirs are usually under similar environmental conditions therefore we have investigated water δd δ18o and related environmental factors in these reservoirs to understand their temporal and spatial variations and related control mechanism then based on this understanding ces of cascade dams were estimated this study could be of great significance for expanding the application of h o isotopes in river hydrological studies 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the wujiang river is a tributary of the changjiang yangtze river with a total length of 1037 km and a drainage area of 88 267 km2 to the south of the changjiang the study area has a characteristic subtropical humid monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 12 3 c with extreme temperatures of 35 4 c in summer and 10 1 c in winter the annual precipitation ranges from 1100 to 1300 mm and precipitation from may to october accounts for about 75 of the annual total the wujiang river has a fall of 2124 m and is one of the main rivers in a west to east power transmission project eleven reservoirs have been built on the main stream of the river four of which were selected for the study fig 1 they are hongjiadu hjd dongfeng df suofengying sfy and wujiangdu wjd reservoirs and the main features of these reservoirs are described in table 1 2 2 sampling and analysis the survey was conducted in october 2015 and january april and july 2016 which represent autumn winter spring and summer respectively a total of 19 sites were selected including the inflowing reservoir and released waters fig 1 water samples were taken down the depth profile at 0 5 15 30 and 60 m at sites w5 w10 and w16 and from the surface middle and bottom layers at sites w3 w4 w8 w9 w14 and w15 the other sites were collected for surface water upper 0 5 m water samples were obtained using niskin bottle general oceanics usa water temperature ph and dissolved oxygen were measured in situ with a calibrated automated multiparameter profiler model ysi 6600 ysi inc yellow springs oh usa water samples for δd and δ18o measurements were filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane millipore corporation within 12 h at room temperature and then put into 15 ml centrifuge tubes the tubes were immediately closed without headspace with caps and sealed with film seal parafilm the δd and δ18o of water were measured using a liquid water isotope analyzer lgr iwa 45ep usa with values reported using the standard δ notation relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow the analytical precision for δd and δ18o were 0 3 and 0 1 respectively deuterium excess d excess or d was calculated from the equation d δd 8δ18o dansgaard 1964 statistical analysis of the data was done using the spss package version 22 0 ibm spss pearson s correlation coefficient analysis was conducted 3 results 3 1 longitudinal variation along the wujiang river surface water temperature t ranged from 10 98 c to 28 23 c with an average of 17 93 c average t did not show significant difference between the reservoirs but the reservoir surface water showed clearly higher t than river water fig 2 a the t gradually increased from inflowing water to reservoir surface water while that of released water was notably decreased for example in the hjd reservoir the average t of released water decreased up to 6 37 c thus the surface t of the main stream showed a jagged variation as for the tributaries sites w2 s7 and m14 their average t was lower than that of the main stream in surface water the δd ranged from 63 8 to 45 4 with an average of 57 1 and the δ18o ranged from 9 4 to 6 9 with an average of 8 4 the δd and δ18o showed similar longitudinal variation but notably different between the reservoirs fig 2b and c the δd and δ18o were higher in reservoir surface water than corresponding inflowing and released waters and generally they showed a gradual increase from upstream to downstream of the river among the reservoirs wjd had the highest average δd and δ18o 54 3 and 8 0 respectively while df showed the lowest ones 58 4 and 8 5 respectively and compared to their inflowing water the δd and δ18o in wjd reservoir increased by 7 3 and 11 0 respectively while those in df reservoir only increased by 0 2 and 1 3 respectively the δd and δ18o in released water were notably lower than those in reservoir surface water for example in wjd reservoir the average δd and δ18o of released water decreased by 3 4 and 3 5 respectively the d excess ranged from 2 7 to 14 0 with an average of 9 7 they did not show obvious longitudinal variation along the river however inflowing water usually showed higher d excess than reservoir surface water fig 2d 3 2 seasonal variation in surface water t d excess δd and δ18o showed seasonal variations fig 3 t exhibited more obvious variation than other parameters with the highest average of 23 53 c in july and the lowest of 13 64 c in january comparatively d excess had the least seasonal variation but it still showed a high value and large amplitude in july the δd and δ18o showed moderate seasonal variations with a large amplitude in july and a small amplitude in january 3 3 stratification the hjd df and wjd reservoirs showed obvious thermal stratification in summer and the thermocline appeared at a layer of 5 20 m depths fig 4 the δd and δ18o of each reservoir were obviously stratified in summer and changed most dramatically in the thermocline however they showed weak stratification in other seasons water profile of the wjd reservoir exhibited the most obvious stratification and the δd and δ18o successively decreased from july to january generally average t δd and δ18o decreased with depth however the δd in df reservoir was most negative in the thermocline and then weakly increased with water depth in the hypolimnion fig 4 3 4 the relationship between δd and δ18o the δd and δ18o of all dataset ranged from 64 2 to 45 4 and from 9 7 to 6 8 with an average of 57 6 and 8 5 respectively there was a significant linear positive correlation between δd and δ18o and slope and intercept of this linear regression line were lower than the global meteoric water line gmwl and local meteoric water line lmwl fig 5 most of the data were under the lmwl and the heavy isotopes were enriched indicating that h o isotope signatures were changed in the water cycle of these cascade reservoirs and thus deviated from that of local precipitation the data from the wjd reservoir system were located in the upper right hjd reservoir system in the lower left and df and sfy reservoir systems in the middle fig 5 indicating that δd and δ18o gradually increased from upstream to downstream 4 discussion 4 1 environmental factors influencing h o isotope signatures in the global water cycle land surface water is mainly supplied by precipitation and rivers usually inherit the h o isotope signatures of the precipitation kendall and coplen 2001 in general h o isotope compositions of atmospheric precipitation are affected by factors including temperature altitude latitude and the source and total amount of vapor dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 clark and fritz 1997 the d excess derived from δ18o and δd can reflect the difference in humidity between vapor source and evaporation rozanski et al 1993 the d value in this study showed an average of 10 1 similar to that of precipitation in the temperate zone ca 10 dansgaard 1964 and exhibited a comparatively small temporal and spatial variation indicating that these reservoirs have similar humidity condition assuming that the effects of altitude and latitude can be neglected in the comparatively small study area the h o isotope signatures of precipitation will be mainly affected by temperature and vapor source water temperature showed significant correlations with δd r 0 41 n 170 p 0 01 and with δ18o r 0 39 n 170 p 0 01 indicating that temperature is the main factor controlling the h o isotope signatures in these cascade reservoirs while δd and δ18o did not show significant correlations with ph dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll data are not shown here suggesting that other chemical and biological factors seldom influence the h o isotope signatures here hydroelectric reservoirs are usually very deep and show seasonal thermal stratification e g elci 2008 han et al 2018 which was also observed in the studied reservoirs in summer strong solar radiation leads to higher water t at the surface and lower water t at the bottom producing thermal stratification by contrast in winter as surface water t decreased the water profile mixed evenly and the stratification disappeared fig 4 thermal stratification caused corresponding variation of water density in the vertical profile which finally led to the presence of h o isotope stratification evaporation caused the enrichment of heavy h o isotopes in surface water and so the h o isotope compositions gradually become negative with depth fig 4 due to bottom discharge for power generation the downstream water of dam exhibited relatively negative h o isotope values considering that groundwater is enriched in light isotopes an input of groundwater could also make the h o isotopes of the bottom water more negative however this possibility can be ignored because the contribution of groundwater to the reservoirs was comparatively minor 4 2 cumulative effects of cascade dams water retention time usually increases after river damming vörösmarty and sahagian 2000 and h o isotope differences induced by evaporation will be larger with longer water retention time leading to increased enrichment of heavy isotopes in the surface water as a result the surface δd and δ18o of the reservoirs were higher than those of inflowing water and the reservoirs with longer retention time i e hjd and wjd reservoirs had higher δd and δ18o than those with shorter retention time i e df and sfy reservoirs fig 2 a similar effect of retention time on lake water δd and δ18o has been reported leng et al 2006 jonsson et al 2009 strong evaporation can lead to a low d excess peng et al 2012 the d excess of inflowing water was usually higher than that of reservoir water fig 2 which also supported the presence of heavier h o isotopes in the reservoir surface water there were notable differences in h o isotope compositions between the surface water above the dam and the corresponding released water i e δδd and δδ18o fig 2 these differences showed positive correlation with the water retention time and the mean water depth of the reservoir respectively fig 6 but did not exhibit significant correlation with reservoir age or total reservoir capacity a shallow reservoir is readily homogenized due to the strong water exchange between the upper and lower layers while a deep reservoir usually has thermal stratification which may result in the stratification of δd and δ18o as discussed above as a result the δδd and δδ18o increased with the increase of mean water depth of the reservoir when mean water depth and retention time were both small δd and δ18o stratification was insignificant but strong evaporation during bottom discharge could cause the δd and δ18o of released water to be higher than those of surface water above the dam and δδd and δδ18o would be negative this effect has been previously observed in the xinzheng and dongxiguan reservoirs on the jialing river china fig 6 and also reported for reservoirs on the euphrates river syria kattan 2012 in general the h o isotope signatures of released water are totally different from those of inflowing water after storage in the reservoir and this effect can be accumulated by a cascade of dams consequently δd and δ18o increases gradually from upstream to downstream the dammed river and abrupt drops of δd and δ18o in released water are interspersed in this gradual trend fig 7 a limited number of other reports have also supported the increase of δd and δ18o after river damming table 2 finally the δd and δ18o showed a jagged increase along the impounded wujiang river 5 conclusions there were notable spatial and temporal variations of δd and δ18o in the impounded wujiang river δd from 64 2 to 45 4 and δ18o from 9 7 to 6 8 respectively after river damming an increase of water retention time strengthened the evaporation of surface water and thus resulted in the enrichment of heavy h o isotopes and thermal stratification induced the decrease of δd and δ18o with water depth therefore water released from the reservoir showed more negative δd and δ18o due to the bottom discharge for hydroelectricity water retention time and mean water depth of the reservoir were two important factors controlling h o isotope differences between the reservoir surface water and the corresponding released water overall ces of cascade dams made δd and δ18o a jagged increase from upstream to downstream of the impounded wujiang river and this finding demonstrates that h o isotopes can be used to characterize the ces of cascade dams h o isotopes are widely used to discern the contribution of different water source such as atmospheric precipitation and groundwater to a river jonsson et al 2009 meredith et al 2009 as cascade dams can change river h o isotope signatures caution should be exercised in using these signatures to trace the water source of the impounded river acknowledgments we are grateful to jing xiao jie shi xiaolong qiu and qiong han for their help in

6836,we analyzed the relationships between meteorological drought and hydrological drought using very dense and diverse network of gauged natural drainage basins across the conterminous u s specifically this work utilized a dataset of 289 gauging stations covering the period 1940 2013 drainage basins were obtained for each gauging station using a digital terrain model in addition to meteorological data e g precipitation air temperature and the atmospheric evaporative demand we obtained a number of topographic soil and remote sensing variables for each defined drainage basin a hydrological drought index the standardized streamflow index ssi was computed for each basin and linked to the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which was used as a metric of climatic drought severity the relationships between different spei time scales and their corresponding ssi were assessed by means of a pearson correlation coefficient also the general patterns of response of hydrological droughts to climatic droughts were identified using a principal component analysis overall results demonstrate a positive response of ssi to spei at shorter time scales with strong seasonality and clear spatial differences we also assessed the role of some climatic and environmental factors in explaining these different responses using a predictive discriminant analysis results indicate that elevation and vegetation coverage are the main drivers of the diverse response of ssi to spei time scales similar analyses were made for three sub periods 1940 1964 1965 1989 and 1989 2013 whose results confirm considerable differences in the response of ssi to spei over the past eighty years keywords hydrological drought climatic drought time scales drought propagation spei natural basins climate variability 1 introduction hydrological drought has the potential for having severe economic social and environmental consequences van loon 2015 being a complex phenomenon that is yet not fully understood tallaksen and van lanen 2004 while there is an evident connection between hydrological droughts and climatic variability other human and environmental factors may impact the duration extent and severity of hydrological droughts along with their associated damage lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 bąk and kubiak wójcicka 2017 tijdeman et al 2018 furthermore correctly attributing the causes of hydrological droughts remains a challenge given the varying and complex relationship between climate moisture deficits and water deficits in different systems which is a consequence of the complex character of drought propagation throughout the hydrological cycle particularly in drainage basins with diverse physical characteristics and management practices tallaksen et al 2004 sheffield and wood 2011 van loon 2015 mckee et al 1993 developed the concept of drought time scale to characterize the system response period from the arrival of water inputs to the time water is available for different usable resources e g soil moisture groundwater snowpack streamflow lake levels and reservoir storages indeed the response time to a climatic drought condition varies significantly between these different usable water sources for example soil moisture usually responds at short climate drought time scales scaini et al 2015 while reservoir storages and groundwater levels respond to drought at longer time scales bloomfield et al 2015 lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 and 2017 streamflows show a complex response that is dependent on a variety of natural and anthropogenic factors including among others climatic and topographic characteristics land cover and use and management practices lópez moreno et al 2013 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 barker et al 2016 recent studies show that the response of streamflows to climatic droughts of different time scales is complex and multifaceted merheb et al 2016 huang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 tijdeman et al 2018 although some studies have argued that anthropogenic factors e g water management practices water regulation and use are the most important in determining the response of streamflow droughts to different climatic drought time scales lópez moreno et al 2009 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 wu et al 2017 the physical characteristics of a basin area are also very important factors and contribute critical information to explaining the different response of streamflow droughts to climatic drought time scales for example vicente serrano et al 2011 analyzed the response of two relatively undisturbed upstream watersheds located in northeastern spain and found they presented a complex and contrasting response to climatic drought time scales in particular while one of these two watersheds responded to short 3 months climatic drought time scales the other responded to a very long 40 months time scales this contrasting response was mainly attributed to the differing dominant lithology of each basin similarly barker et al 2016 analyzed the relationship between hydrological and climatic droughts in different natural catchments in the uk they reported strong differences in the response of hydrological droughts to climatic droughts linked to the different lithology and aquifer characteristics of the catchments for instance physiographic variables e g area topography slope etc and vegetation coverage are important controls mediating the effect of climatological drought on streamflows as confirmed by many studies worldwide one representative example is van loon and laaha 2015 who concluded that streamflow drought duration in austria is controlled primarily by catchment properties that define storage and release dynamics e g geology and land use what these studies show is that biophysical factors control not only streamflow drought characteristics e g duration and severity but also the sensitivity of streamflow drought to climatic drought at different time scales however disentangling the role of individual factors and attributing their contribution to the response of hydrological drought to climatic drought conditions is an unresolved problem which is complicated by anthropogenic modifications as well as by the intrinsic non linear dynamics of hydrologic systems in the united states abatzoglou et al 2014 used a range of drought indices to analyze streamflow anomalies in the u s pacific northwest and the stationarity of the relationship between climatic and streamflow dynamics while tijdeman et al 2016 analyzed streamflow drought duration in 800 catchments across the us they found that drought duration characteristics vary among the different climate regimes with precipitation playing the main role in these spatial variations however these studies did not analyze the role that catchment characteristics play on the propagation of climatic drought to streamflows in this study we fill a gap in our understanding of how climatic droughts propagate through the hydrologic system the objectives of this study are fourfold i to determine the climatic drought time scales that better explain the hydrologic drought as reflected in streamflow anomalies over a wide range of natural basins across the conterminous united states conus ii to identify and analyze spatial patterns and gradients in the climatic hydrologic drought response iii to explore the role that different environmental factors play in shaping the sensitivity of streamflows to climatic drought and iv to identify possible non stationarities in the climate streamflow relationship this study employs long term monthly streamflow records from the usgs hydro climatic data network which covers all hydroclimatic regions in the conus and provides a solid base from which we can gain insight into how streamflow responds to climatic drought 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets 2 1 1 streamflow time series streamflow time series for our analysis were obtained from the usgs hydro climatic data network 2009 hcdn 2009 which includes monthly streamflow records from 702 hydrological gauges located in catchments with low anthropogenic perturbations further details about the characteristics of this dataset e g data quality data completeness spatial and temporal coverage etc can be obtained at http water usgs gov osw hcdn 2009 from the 702 gauges included in the hcdn 2009 we restricted our analysis to those gauges covering the period 1940 2013 and with less than 15 missing data following these criteria we selected 289 stations whose spatial distribution is illustrated in fig 1 the selected gauges cover the entire conus although sampling densities are higher along the eastern and western coasts the inter mountain west and the midwest regions of the country gaps in the streamflow time series were completed using data from a standardized composite reference series built from the most correlated series with the target series and using percentiles with the purpose of maintaining the temporal variance of the series 2 1 2 climatic information monthly gridded precipitation and temperature data were obtained from the prism parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model product developed by oregon state university http www prism oregonstate edu daly et al 2008 prism has been widely used for climatic hydrological agricultural and environmental applications in the u s e g lutz et al 2010 bandaru et al 2017 bodner and robles 2017 in this study we employed monthly precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures from 1940 to 2013 provided by prism at 30 s approximately 10 km resolution monthly reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated from using the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 the hargreaves samani method is recommended under data scarcity conditions allen 1998 as it estimates eto using only maximum and minimum air temperatures and the extraterrestrial solar radiation calculated using the latitude and the julian day finally precipitation and eto grids were used to calculate the climatic balance defined as the difference between precipitation and eto 2 1 3 physiography and land cover elevation data for the conus was obtained from the usgs digital elevation model dem https lta cr usgs gov gmted2010 vegetation characteristics were assessed using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi dataset derived from reflectance bands obtained by the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr sensor https www star nesdis noaa gov smcd emb vci vh vh browse php at a spatial resolution of 1 1 km the ndvi is a reflectance based variable closely related to the vegetation coverage biomass and leaf area index carlson and ripley 1997 relevant high resolution soil variables e g depth of soil layer soil drainage water field capacity infiltration capacity and soil permeability were obtained from the usda s state soil geographic statsgo 1991 database usda 1991 data of all variables were derived for each individual basin incorporating some of the selected streamflow gauges the boundaries of each drainage basin were defined using the dem data within the arcgis platform average monthly and seasonal climate data were obtained for each basin independently seasons were defined as cold season ondjfm and warm season amjjas 2 2 methods 2 2 1 hydrological drought definition we used the standardized streamflow index ssi to quantify streamflow drought severity vicente serrano et al 2012 since the ssi is a standardized quantity it permits direct comparison between gauges and between different time periods irrespective of the magnitude and seasonality of streamflow series the ssi transforms monthly streamflow time series into a time series of probabilities by first calculating a dimensionless time series of standardized streamflow anomalies using different distribution fits for each month station we used a wide range of candidate probability distributions including the general extreme value the pearson type iii piii the log logistic the log normal the generalized pareto and the weibull distributions the selection based on the minimum orthogonal distance between the l moments of the sampled dataset and the l moment of a candidate continuous distribution more details on the ssi calculation can be found in vicente serrano et al 2012 2 2 2 climatic drought indices there is a large amount of drought indices based on climate information heim 2002 existing recent developments like the evaporative demand drought index eddi hobbins et al 2016 or the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi vicente serrano et al 2018 here to characterize climatic anomalies we used two of the most common climatic drought indices the standardization precipitation index spi and the standardization precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the spi was proposed by mckee et al 1993 and has been widely used during the last two decades due to its solid theoretical development robustness and versatility in drought analyses redmond 2002 as such it has been recommended by the world meteorological organization as the reference index for meteorological drought wmo 2012 like the ssi the spi is based on the conversion of precipitation anomalies to probabilities using long term records the anomalies are accumulated over periods of a specified length which produce a time series of anomalies representing a characteristic time scale the main advantage of the spi is that it allows for analyzing drought impacts at different temporal scales which can then be compared to anomalies from datasets representing other drought types i e meteorological hydrological and economic the spi has been widely used for this purpose in several studies e g vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 fiorillo and guadagno 2010 lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 vicente serrano et al 2011 the main criticism of the spi is that its calculation is based solely on precipitation data and does not account for other meteorological factors e g atmospheric evaporative demand aed which may have a strong influence on drought severity as evidenced in many hydrological vicente serrano et al 2014 and ecological allen et al 2015 adams et al 2017 applications to overcome this we have also included in our analysis another popular drought index the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei unlike the spi the spei accounts for both precipitation p and reference evapotranspiration eto as a representative metric to quantify the aed the spei is based on a monthly climatic water balance p eto and is equally sensitive to variations in these two input variables vicente serrano et al 2015 the p eto series of anomalies are adjusted using a three parameter log logistic distribution the anomalies are accumulated at different time scales following the same approach used in the spi and converted to standard deviations with respect to average value z scores details on the calculation procedure of the spei can be found in vicente serrano et al 2010 and beguería et al 2014 the eto was computed from air temperature data using the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 as explained in the section 2 1 2 2 2 3 statistical analysis to quantify drought severity for each watershed and the sensitivity of streamflows to anomalies in each month of the year we calculated the spi and spei at time scales varying from 1 to 48 months for each month of the year using the corresponding spatially averaged series of p and eto for each watershed we obtained 576 series 12 months 48 time scales for each drought index then to account for the links between climatic droughts and hydrological droughts we used the pearson correlation coefficient computed between the time series of spei spi for each time scale and month of the year all calculations were made for the entire study period 1940 2013 as well as for some selected sub periods 1940 1964 1965 1989 and 1990 2013 to evaluate the stationarity of this correlation to summarize the high spatial variability exhibited by the relationship between ssi and spei spi we performed a principal component analysis pca in s mode richman 1986 in this mode the data i e correlations between spei spi and ssi in each basin were structured in a matrix with 12 months rows by 48 time scales columns per site which represent the spi ssi or spei ssi correlation structure in a month time scale space pca analysis decomposes this month time scale correlation space into a series of modes that represent independent amounts of the complexity variance in the spi ssi and or spei ssi correlation space the pca procedure allows for the classification of 289 basins on the basis of the similarities of the principal components of the correlations between the spei spi and the ssi and permits us to identify general patterns in these correlations the number of the retained components was defined based on the percentage of the variance of the original month time series correlation space explained by each component according to a scree plot we also mapped the pca loadings for each watershed which in our case is equivalent to the square root of the variance of the original space retained by each component and identifies how much each principal component relates to the spi spei ssi relationship of each watershed we also classified the watersheds according to the maximum loading rule in which each watershed was assigned to the pc that showed the highest loading this analysis was conducted for the three selected sub periods of the data record to analyze stationarity we also integrated information on soil climate topography and ndvi variables see section 2 1 in each watershed and analyzed how well they explain the spatial distribution of the loading patterns this was done by spatially averaging and plotting the values of these biophysical variables and the pc groups obtained from the maximum loading rule by means of boxplots for the entire period 1940 2013 as well as the three selected sub periods finally to quantify the relative contribution of each of the biophysical variables explaining the spatial differences in ssi response to the spei at different time scales we applied a predictive discriminant analysis pda the pda explains the value of a dependent categorical variable based on its relationship to one or more predictors huberty 1994 given the presence of different independent variables the pda identifies the possible linear combinations of those predictors that best separate the groups of cases of the predicted these combinations are termed discriminant functions hair et al 1998 the pda allowed identifying which predictors contributed more to the inter category differences of the pc modes that summarize ssi spei dependency 3 results 3 1 general patterns of response 1940 2013 fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the maximum correlation of the series of timescales between spei and ssi for each month and for the series of all months results are presented for the entire study period 1940 2013 and irrespective of any climatic and hydrological seasonal variations overall fig 2 reveals high positive correlations in the majority of the analyzed basins with only a few exceptions one example of such an exception is the lower correlation found between spei and ssi along the rocky mountains and in the northeastern u s for the period february to april these spatial patterns are very similar to the correlations between the spei and ssi supplementary fig 1 in both cases there is clear dominance of positive and high correlations between ssi and spei during the different months of the year supplementary fig 2 in general maximum correlations between spei and ssi tend to be achieved at shorter time scales with averages ranging between 2 and 3 month spei supplementary fig 3 however there are some regions that present maximum correlations at longer time scales notably the snow regulated basins particularly those in the western portions of the country respond to longer spei time scales than other basins this pattern is evident for all months of the year and for the series of all months this suggests differences in how these watersheds mediate the response of streamflow to climatic droughts see fig 3 the principal component analysis confirms the existence of substantial variability in the patterns of hydrological droughts response specifically it takes seven principal components to account for more than 80 of the total explained variance supplementary fig 4 each representing different spatial patterns of the month and time scale correlation between the spei and ssi figs 4 and 5 show the principal components and the principal component loadings respectively these figures identify the main hydrological drought response patterns to the range of climatic drought time scales used in this analysis the figures show substantial variations in the response of the analyzed basins with coherent geographical patterns in general the pcs indicate a dominance of response to short spei time scales which is clearly represented in the first two components fig 4 these two pcs explain 55 of the total variance the loadings of pc1 show that this pc is representative of watersheds in the southeast and the midwest u s fig 5 the mode of variation for pc1 fig 4 show high correlations at spei time scales lower than 10 months fig 4 while the loadings of pc 2 show that this mode represents northeastern basins fig 5 which show the strongest response at very short spei time scales less than 3 months between april and january fig 4 pc3 is representative of spei ssi correlations in the us pacific northwest region with the highest correlation found at short spei time scales between september and february significant correlations are also found between may and august but only for longer spei time scales the loadings of pc 4 represents the spei ssi relationship in the watersheds located in the rocky mountains and the pc scores indicate that these basins are most responsive to climatic anomalies occurring between june and february at time scales ranging from 8 to 18 months the remaining pcs pcs 5 7 represent local patterns and small clusters of basins the pc analysis showing the spatial patterns of the spi ssi correlations are presented in supplementary figs 5 through 7 these results show that the spatial modes of variation are similar to those analyzed using the spei and increases our confidence that the response of hydrological drought to climatic drought time scales shows consistent spatial patterns irrespective of the selected drought index 3 2 factors explaining the general response of ssi to spei time scales fig 6 shows the average values of the different topographic and environmental variables as a function of the pcs that summarize correlation patterns between spei and ssi annual average ndvi presents strong differences between pcs with pcs 1 2 6 and 7 correlating with higher average ndvi than pcs 3 4 and 5 notably pcs 3 and 6 show high intra basin variability also soil characteristics vary significantly between pcs especially those related to water field capacity and depth of soil layer the highest being recorded for pc 1 in contrast soil drainage infiltration and soil permeability do not present substantial differences between the different pcs similarly basin area does not differ significantly between pcs average annual streamflow shows higher values for pcs 7 and 3 with high intra basin variability among the basins belonging to these components average basin elevation presents noticeable differences between the pcs with pcs 3 and 4 associated with higher elevations than the remaining components similarly the pcs seem to vary with average annual minimum maximum temperature and eto pcs 3 4 and 5 are characterized by lower temperatures than other components table 1 shows the structure matrix following the results of the predictive discriminant analysis pda with three functions representing 43 8 27 7 and 10 5 of the total variance respectively table 2 shows the centroids of the different components for the three predictive discriminant functions pdfs pc 1 and pc 2 show negative values for pdf 1 which has the greatest power to discriminate between the different independent variables on the other hand pcs 3 4 6 and 7 show positive values in pdf 1 indicating that the pattern of relationship between climatic and hydrologic droughts characteristics of pcs 1 and 2 is favored in areas with high vegetation coverage ndvi this feature is particularly evident during the warm season when vegetation is more active positive values in pdf 1 are also associated with low elevations high temperatures during the warm season high precipitation during the warm season and low precipitation during the cold season the patterns of relationship summarized by pcs 3 and 4 and to less extent pcs 6 and 7 are dominant in basins with opposite characteristics i e low ndvi high elevation low temperatures and low precipitation during the warm season and high precipitation during the cold season pdf 2 mostly discriminates between pcs 4 and 5 on the one hand and pc 7 on the other hand demonstrating that pcs 4 and 5 are dominant in basins with low vegetation coverage high elevation and low precipitation while pc7 characterize watershed with high vegetation coverage in low elevation areas with relatively high precipitation pdf 3 had low discrimination capacity and low values for the different variables pda also indicated that soil characteristics average streamflow magnitude and total surface area of the basins contributed less to discriminating between the different patterns of response of ssi to spei time scales 3 3 temporal differences in the response of ssi to spei time scales the analysis applied for the different sub periods 1940 1964 1964 1989 and 1990 2013 reveal some differences in the relationship between climatic drought and hydrologic response in the u s the monthly correlation patterns in the month time scale space between ssi and the spei shows that the general patterns for the entire period 1940 2013 are not exactly stationary in time between 1940 and 1964 the percentage of the variance absorbed by the first few pcs is similar to the variance absorbed by the pcs in the analysis of the entire period fig 7 however the subperiod 1965 1989 distributes the total variance between the pcs more evenly and during the 1990 2013 period pc1 clearly represents a higher percentage of the total variance supplementary fig 8 the first two components of the 1940 1964 period maintain the response of ssi to spei at short time scales but with clear monthly differences fig 7 the remaining components present a ssi response to longer spei time scales also with strong monthly differences nonetheless these patterns have less spatial coherence compared to those defined for the entire period supplementary fig 9 the dominant patterns during 1965 1989 show some differences from those of the earlier period fig 8 pc 1 shows higher correlations from medium to long time scales between february and june and between july and november while pc 2 exhibits significant correlations considering short spei time scales between october and february similarly pc 3 shows significant correlations at very short time scales 1 2 months between may and july pc 4 presents a similar pattern than the same component calculated for the entire period with significant correlations at longer time scales with the exception of april these components show more coherent spatial patterns and are representative of larger regions than those of the earlier period supplementary fig 10 compared to 1940 1964 and 1965 1989 the pcs in the analysis of the 1990 2013 period shows more granularity and variation fig 9 the correlation patterns show distinct monthly responses to the range of spei time scales with smoother and more coherent spatial patterns we noted pcs that represents the basins located in the northeastern pc 1 southeastern u s pc 2 and the rocky mountains pc 5 supplementary fig 11 overall the spatial patterns of pc loadings and the analyzed response of the basins was very similar in the analysis done with any of the two drought indices i e spi and spei supplementary figs 12 18 this may indicate that the role of variations in the climatological water balance p eto is of secondary importance on the development of hydrological drought in the selected basins compared to variations in precipitation which is the common input variable in the calculation of both spi and spei our comparison also indicates that there is a general agreement on the magnitude of the maximum correlations found for the different sub periods supplementary figs 19 and 20 however and despite the overall agreement there are some differences in terms of the spei time scales at which the maximum correlations are recorded supplementary figs 21 and 22 for the sub periods 1940 1964 and 1965 1989 there are clear differences in the maximum correlation patterns found between spei and ssi supplementary fig 23 one representative example is the rocky mountains where correlations increased from january to march while decreased in april in december the magnitude of correlations clearly increased over the basins located in eastern and western portions of the country on the other hand while there are differences in the magnitude of maximum correlation patterns between the 1965 1989 and 1990 2013 periods see for example northern basins in january and february and western basins in april their spatial patterns are more random than those found in the previous period supplementary fig 24 notably spei time scales of maximum correlation are very different between sub periods for some basins in some cases maximum correlations were found at longer spei time scales in one period but at short time scales in the other supplementary figs 25 and 26 these findings indicate that the mechanisms that connect climatic and hydrological droughts may interact and reinforce or cancel each other out between the two periods these mechanisms and their interactions are difficult to identify and evaluate because the small number of instances when maximum correlations shifted differently between spei time scales in two periods makes comparisons with environmental and climatic variables supplementary tables 1 4 positive differences in maximum correlations between 1940 and 1964 and 1965 1989 i e correlation of second period minus correlation of first period are preferentially recorded for basins characterized by low ndvi values high elevations low eto and temperature but with clearly higher temperatures during the second period supplementary table 1 this analysis seems to indicate that correlation differences between these two periods follow a spatial pattern related to the spatial distribution of these climatic and physiographical variables however the spatial patterns of differences in the spei time scales at which maximum correlation is obtained between the two sub periods do not show clear relationship with any of the analyzed climatologic or physiographical variables with the exception of some monthly significant correlations supplementary table 2 the same analysis for sub periods 1965 1989 and 1990 2013 show that the spatial patterns of maximum correlation difference may be controlled by the spatial patterns of precipitation and mostly by the observed change in precipitation between the two sub periods specifically higher correlations during the second period tend to be primarily recorded for basins with low average precipitation which makes an increase in annual and seasonal precipitation during the second sub period more likely supplementary table 3 finally differences in the time scales at which the maximum correlation was recorded between these two periods did not reveal spatial patterns that correlate with the environmental and climatic variables analyzed here 4 discussion in this study we analyzed the response of a hydrological drought index the standardized streamflow index ssi to different time scales of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei in different low anthropogenic perturbation watersheds across the u s our findings indicate high correlations between the spei and ssi during a range of months of the year confirming that the magnitude of hydrological droughts in the conterminous u s is strongly controlled by climatic droughts the correlations found in this study are stronger than those obtained for basins impacted by water regulation and human management e g lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 vicente serrano et al 2017b wu et al 2017 with the exception of the february and april period when correlations are generally lower average correlations were around 0 8 or higher for the all months series the average correlation was 0 9 these results highlight that hydrological droughts in natural basins are more influenced by climatic drought than in highly regulated basins in which the temporal variability of hydrological droughts is controlled by other non climatic factors such as water storage capacity lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 and dam operation rules lópez moreno et al 2009 furthermore water extraction and reallocation for different uses can also disrupt the relationship between climate variability and hydrological droughts tijdeman et al 2018 however the u s basins included in the analysis are considered to be relatively unperturbed by direct human action nevertheless in some cases they can be affected by change in vegetation cover e g recovery from past forest fires ecological transitions which can also affect the relationship between climatic and hydrologic droughts garcía ruiz et al 2008 nevertheless these potential vegetation cover changes are expected to have a local impact and it is most likely that hydrological drought responses in the studied basins are mainly controlled by climate variability another important finding is that ssi variability is mostly controlled by climatic droughts having characteristically short time scales in the majority of the studied basins generally our results show that the spei at time scales between two and four months are often the most correlated with ssi this clearly suggests that ssi in these natural basins responds to high frequency climate variability once again these results are in contrast with results found in other studies for regulated basins e g lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 and 2013 where variability of hydrological drought is mostly linked to climatic droughts of longer characteristic time scales and to streamflow drought conditions prolonged and exacerbated by water abstractions transfers or impoundments tijdeman et al 2018 these differences can reflect increased watershed storage e g reservoir storage which modulates high frequency variations of upstream rain and streamflows which induces temporal autocorrelation and decreases the frequency of high peaks downstream lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 in general because of their higher capacity hydrological drought conditions in reservoirs occur less frequently than in streamflows vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 wu et al 2017 and even less frequently in groundwater systems bloomfield et al 2015 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 our results align with the expectation that hydrologic drought response of the natural basins used in this study is mostly controlled by climatic drought we did however find some exceptions to the pattern of generally short timescales between meteorological and hydrological droughts some watersheds mostly located in the rocky mountains showed low correlations between the spei and ssi during the summer and winter months at shorter time scales and appeared more responsive to long term spei time scales during the spring and fall this may be explained by the specific characteristics of the rivers located in this region with streamflow driven by snow accumulation and melting which are strongly controlled by temperature variability instead of being directly controlled by rainfall variability this was also found by haslinger et al 2014 and rimkus et al 2013 who found strong connections between hydrological and climatic droughts in austria and lithuania except for those basins and seasons in which snow processes are important to ensure the results are robust and consistent we conducted the analysis with two widely used drought indices the spi based only on precipitation data and the spei calculated using both precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand vicente serrano et al 2012 analyzed the relationship between streamflow variability and different drought indices in different basins worldwide they reported that a higher correlation between climatic and streamflow anomalies was obtained when the spei was used instead of the spi however increased aed also affects streamflow drought severity e g cai and cowan 2008 cho et al 2011 teuling et al 2013 vicente serrano et al 2017a in this study there were negligible differences not only in the magnitude of correlations found between the spi or the spei and the ssi but also in the time scales and the seasonal patterns of these correlations this finding suggests that in natural hydrological basins precipitation would have the greater influence on streamflow drought severity vicente serrano et al 2014 showed that ssi in the iberian peninsula rivers responded better to spei than to spi especially in the summer months when the role of the aed is higher however they also reported that correlations between spei and ssi and spi and ssi were similar for watersheds located in the headwaters where human intervention is more restricted and the effects of aed is lower as the rivers reach their medium and low courses temporal variability of streamflows is affected by aed especially in the most regulated basins where there is high surface coverage by irrigated lands vicente serrano et al 2017b in these circumstances the spei explained streamflow anomalies better than the spi although we do not expect that the hydrological drought response patterns of the undisturbed watersheds analyzed in this study have the same degree of complexity than the regulated basins we found remarkable spatial variations this heterogeneity in the response of natural basins was also found by barker et al 2016 in 120 catchments across the uk with a few exceptions u s watersheds dominantly respond to climatic drought of short characteristic time scales but there were clear seasonal differences that confound homogeneous patterns in the correlations between ssi and climatic drought time scales differences in the month time scale correlation space of the different watersheds are mainly associated to differences in temperature vegetation cover use as well as by topography elevation physiographic characteristics and vegetation coverage vary significantly from one river basin to another in this analysis we are considering a wide heterogeneous scenario to assess the response of hydrological drought to the climatic drought in a very diverse number of basins at this respect we found out as well as other studies related to this topic haslinger et al 2014 van loon and laaha 2015 that not only precipitation but also elevation is one of the natural drivers that control the seasonality of the streamflows as aed directly depends on it e g snow melt contribution to streamflows and hence the response of ssi to spei time scales regarding to the land use vegetation has a major role as soil structure is directly related to the hydrological cycle processes e g the runoff occurred during a heavy precipitation event or the water drainage from the aquifers to the watersheds in addition natural vegetation consumes water for respiration processes being this the main disturbing factor that explains climate vs streamflow relationships this topic has been widely studied in the scientific literature e g bosch and hewlett 1982 de jong et al 2009 garcía ruiz et al 2011 llorens and domingo 2007 the magnitude of streamflow precipitation soil characteristics and basin area also bring secondary contributions to these differences the muted contribution of average annual and seasonal precipitation to explaining patterns of response of hydrologic drought contrasts with the findings of tijdeman et al 2016 who concluded that the characteristics and duration of hydrological drought in natural basins of the u s is mostly controlled by the precipitation characteristics of each basin this study also suggests that the mechanisms that propagate climatic droughts to streamflows may not be time stationary this suggestion is based on the differences we have found in the magnitude of correlations and the time scales of maximum correlation between different periods in the record the factors that drive this behavior are unclear but they could be related to the non linearity in the dynamics of watersheds during wet and dry periods which affect how meteorological droughts propagate to become hydrological droughts haslinger et al 2014 during the mega drought recorded in southeastern australia in the 2000s yang et al 2017 showed that the rainfall runoff relationship was non stationary and that there were feedback mechanisms such that the duration and intensity of meteorological droughts were lengthened and amplified by the hydrological drought it generated non stationarity driven by drought severity and catchment land feedbacks adds some uncertainty to how climatological droughts propagate throughout the hydrological cycle none of the explanatory variables used obtain insight into the spatial patterns of hydrologic drought were able to explain adequately why the magnitude of the differences and time scales of maximum correlation was not stable between the analyzed sub periods the lack of explanatory power of the variables used in this study aligns with the results presented by yang et al 2017 who found that the times of recovery of hydrological drought conditions in relation to climatic droughts are not related to the catchment landscape they confirmed that the impact of other hydro climatic factors and catchment properties is minimal recent studies have suggested the use of climatic information to predict hydrological droughts e g zhu et al 2016 yuan et al 2017 which is especially appealing to characterize hydrological drought in regions where streamflow data is not available however results from this study and specifically the evidence of non stationary mechanisms in the response of hydrological droughts to climate variability suggest that making robust predictions using only climatological information will be a challenging task even in natural basins where most of streamflow behavior is expected to respond to climate variability the complexity of physiographic climatic edaphic and mostly vegetation characteristics drive a complex and non stationary behavior which is very difficult to determine in summary we have showed that the response of hydrological droughts to climatic droughts is complex especially in terms of the climatic drought time scales that are more likely to control hydrological drought severity this is expected in strongly modified and regulated basins where water management and or dam operation rules may strongly alter this behavior in this study it has been demonstrated that the response of hydrological droughts to climatic drought conditions can be complex and non stationary even in natural basins within the conterminous u s very different patterns of hydrological drought responses to climatic drought time scales have been detected these natural basins are characterized by different climatological physiographical and vegetation conditions further research is necessary to understand the role of vegetation cover change on the non stationary behavior of hydrological drought response detected in this study and to define to what extent the connection between climatic and hydrologic drought is disrupted by different levels of human management and practices in the united states 5 conclusions in conclusion we summarize the main findings of this study the magnitude of hydrological droughts in u s depends directly on climatic droughts and this relationship is stronger in natural basins than in regulated basins in natural basins the ssi responds predominantly to high frequency climate variability the time scales and seasonal response of ssi to spei and spi suggest that hydrological basins precipitation would have the greatest influence on streamflow drought severity however in the contiguous u s a noteworthy spatial variation and heterogeneity in the response of natural basins exist in mountainous river basins hydrological droughts were found exceptionally to be controlled not only by precipitation variability but also by temperature at long term at this respect not only climatic conditions influence hydrological droughts soil characteristics vegetation or physical characteristics of the basins also determine the different patterns of response found in natural regimes acknowledgements this work was supported by the research project i link1001 validation of

6836,we analyzed the relationships between meteorological drought and hydrological drought using very dense and diverse network of gauged natural drainage basins across the conterminous u s specifically this work utilized a dataset of 289 gauging stations covering the period 1940 2013 drainage basins were obtained for each gauging station using a digital terrain model in addition to meteorological data e g precipitation air temperature and the atmospheric evaporative demand we obtained a number of topographic soil and remote sensing variables for each defined drainage basin a hydrological drought index the standardized streamflow index ssi was computed for each basin and linked to the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei which was used as a metric of climatic drought severity the relationships between different spei time scales and their corresponding ssi were assessed by means of a pearson correlation coefficient also the general patterns of response of hydrological droughts to climatic droughts were identified using a principal component analysis overall results demonstrate a positive response of ssi to spei at shorter time scales with strong seasonality and clear spatial differences we also assessed the role of some climatic and environmental factors in explaining these different responses using a predictive discriminant analysis results indicate that elevation and vegetation coverage are the main drivers of the diverse response of ssi to spei time scales similar analyses were made for three sub periods 1940 1964 1965 1989 and 1989 2013 whose results confirm considerable differences in the response of ssi to spei over the past eighty years keywords hydrological drought climatic drought time scales drought propagation spei natural basins climate variability 1 introduction hydrological drought has the potential for having severe economic social and environmental consequences van loon 2015 being a complex phenomenon that is yet not fully understood tallaksen and van lanen 2004 while there is an evident connection between hydrological droughts and climatic variability other human and environmental factors may impact the duration extent and severity of hydrological droughts along with their associated damage lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 bąk and kubiak wójcicka 2017 tijdeman et al 2018 furthermore correctly attributing the causes of hydrological droughts remains a challenge given the varying and complex relationship between climate moisture deficits and water deficits in different systems which is a consequence of the complex character of drought propagation throughout the hydrological cycle particularly in drainage basins with diverse physical characteristics and management practices tallaksen et al 2004 sheffield and wood 2011 van loon 2015 mckee et al 1993 developed the concept of drought time scale to characterize the system response period from the arrival of water inputs to the time water is available for different usable resources e g soil moisture groundwater snowpack streamflow lake levels and reservoir storages indeed the response time to a climatic drought condition varies significantly between these different usable water sources for example soil moisture usually responds at short climate drought time scales scaini et al 2015 while reservoir storages and groundwater levels respond to drought at longer time scales bloomfield et al 2015 lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 and 2017 streamflows show a complex response that is dependent on a variety of natural and anthropogenic factors including among others climatic and topographic characteristics land cover and use and management practices lópez moreno et al 2013 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 barker et al 2016 recent studies show that the response of streamflows to climatic droughts of different time scales is complex and multifaceted merheb et al 2016 huang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 tijdeman et al 2018 although some studies have argued that anthropogenic factors e g water management practices water regulation and use are the most important in determining the response of streamflow droughts to different climatic drought time scales lópez moreno et al 2009 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 wu et al 2017 the physical characteristics of a basin area are also very important factors and contribute critical information to explaining the different response of streamflow droughts to climatic drought time scales for example vicente serrano et al 2011 analyzed the response of two relatively undisturbed upstream watersheds located in northeastern spain and found they presented a complex and contrasting response to climatic drought time scales in particular while one of these two watersheds responded to short 3 months climatic drought time scales the other responded to a very long 40 months time scales this contrasting response was mainly attributed to the differing dominant lithology of each basin similarly barker et al 2016 analyzed the relationship between hydrological and climatic droughts in different natural catchments in the uk they reported strong differences in the response of hydrological droughts to climatic droughts linked to the different lithology and aquifer characteristics of the catchments for instance physiographic variables e g area topography slope etc and vegetation coverage are important controls mediating the effect of climatological drought on streamflows as confirmed by many studies worldwide one representative example is van loon and laaha 2015 who concluded that streamflow drought duration in austria is controlled primarily by catchment properties that define storage and release dynamics e g geology and land use what these studies show is that biophysical factors control not only streamflow drought characteristics e g duration and severity but also the sensitivity of streamflow drought to climatic drought at different time scales however disentangling the role of individual factors and attributing their contribution to the response of hydrological drought to climatic drought conditions is an unresolved problem which is complicated by anthropogenic modifications as well as by the intrinsic non linear dynamics of hydrologic systems in the united states abatzoglou et al 2014 used a range of drought indices to analyze streamflow anomalies in the u s pacific northwest and the stationarity of the relationship between climatic and streamflow dynamics while tijdeman et al 2016 analyzed streamflow drought duration in 800 catchments across the us they found that drought duration characteristics vary among the different climate regimes with precipitation playing the main role in these spatial variations however these studies did not analyze the role that catchment characteristics play on the propagation of climatic drought to streamflows in this study we fill a gap in our understanding of how climatic droughts propagate through the hydrologic system the objectives of this study are fourfold i to determine the climatic drought time scales that better explain the hydrologic drought as reflected in streamflow anomalies over a wide range of natural basins across the conterminous united states conus ii to identify and analyze spatial patterns and gradients in the climatic hydrologic drought response iii to explore the role that different environmental factors play in shaping the sensitivity of streamflows to climatic drought and iv to identify possible non stationarities in the climate streamflow relationship this study employs long term monthly streamflow records from the usgs hydro climatic data network which covers all hydroclimatic regions in the conus and provides a solid base from which we can gain insight into how streamflow responds to climatic drought 2 data and methods 2 1 datasets 2 1 1 streamflow time series streamflow time series for our analysis were obtained from the usgs hydro climatic data network 2009 hcdn 2009 which includes monthly streamflow records from 702 hydrological gauges located in catchments with low anthropogenic perturbations further details about the characteristics of this dataset e g data quality data completeness spatial and temporal coverage etc can be obtained at http water usgs gov osw hcdn 2009 from the 702 gauges included in the hcdn 2009 we restricted our analysis to those gauges covering the period 1940 2013 and with less than 15 missing data following these criteria we selected 289 stations whose spatial distribution is illustrated in fig 1 the selected gauges cover the entire conus although sampling densities are higher along the eastern and western coasts the inter mountain west and the midwest regions of the country gaps in the streamflow time series were completed using data from a standardized composite reference series built from the most correlated series with the target series and using percentiles with the purpose of maintaining the temporal variance of the series 2 1 2 climatic information monthly gridded precipitation and temperature data were obtained from the prism parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model product developed by oregon state university http www prism oregonstate edu daly et al 2008 prism has been widely used for climatic hydrological agricultural and environmental applications in the u s e g lutz et al 2010 bandaru et al 2017 bodner and robles 2017 in this study we employed monthly precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures from 1940 to 2013 provided by prism at 30 s approximately 10 km resolution monthly reference evapotranspiration eto was calculated from using the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 the hargreaves samani method is recommended under data scarcity conditions allen 1998 as it estimates eto using only maximum and minimum air temperatures and the extraterrestrial solar radiation calculated using the latitude and the julian day finally precipitation and eto grids were used to calculate the climatic balance defined as the difference between precipitation and eto 2 1 3 physiography and land cover elevation data for the conus was obtained from the usgs digital elevation model dem https lta cr usgs gov gmted2010 vegetation characteristics were assessed using the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi dataset derived from reflectance bands obtained by the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr sensor https www star nesdis noaa gov smcd emb vci vh vh browse php at a spatial resolution of 1 1 km the ndvi is a reflectance based variable closely related to the vegetation coverage biomass and leaf area index carlson and ripley 1997 relevant high resolution soil variables e g depth of soil layer soil drainage water field capacity infiltration capacity and soil permeability were obtained from the usda s state soil geographic statsgo 1991 database usda 1991 data of all variables were derived for each individual basin incorporating some of the selected streamflow gauges the boundaries of each drainage basin were defined using the dem data within the arcgis platform average monthly and seasonal climate data were obtained for each basin independently seasons were defined as cold season ondjfm and warm season amjjas 2 2 methods 2 2 1 hydrological drought definition we used the standardized streamflow index ssi to quantify streamflow drought severity vicente serrano et al 2012 since the ssi is a standardized quantity it permits direct comparison between gauges and between different time periods irrespective of the magnitude and seasonality of streamflow series the ssi transforms monthly streamflow time series into a time series of probabilities by first calculating a dimensionless time series of standardized streamflow anomalies using different distribution fits for each month station we used a wide range of candidate probability distributions including the general extreme value the pearson type iii piii the log logistic the log normal the generalized pareto and the weibull distributions the selection based on the minimum orthogonal distance between the l moments of the sampled dataset and the l moment of a candidate continuous distribution more details on the ssi calculation can be found in vicente serrano et al 2012 2 2 2 climatic drought indices there is a large amount of drought indices based on climate information heim 2002 existing recent developments like the evaporative demand drought index eddi hobbins et al 2016 or the standardized evapotranspiration deficit index sedi vicente serrano et al 2018 here to characterize climatic anomalies we used two of the most common climatic drought indices the standardization precipitation index spi and the standardization precipitation evapotranspiration index spei the spi was proposed by mckee et al 1993 and has been widely used during the last two decades due to its solid theoretical development robustness and versatility in drought analyses redmond 2002 as such it has been recommended by the world meteorological organization as the reference index for meteorological drought wmo 2012 like the ssi the spi is based on the conversion of precipitation anomalies to probabilities using long term records the anomalies are accumulated over periods of a specified length which produce a time series of anomalies representing a characteristic time scale the main advantage of the spi is that it allows for analyzing drought impacts at different temporal scales which can then be compared to anomalies from datasets representing other drought types i e meteorological hydrological and economic the spi has been widely used for this purpose in several studies e g vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 fiorillo and guadagno 2010 lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 vicente serrano et al 2011 the main criticism of the spi is that its calculation is based solely on precipitation data and does not account for other meteorological factors e g atmospheric evaporative demand aed which may have a strong influence on drought severity as evidenced in many hydrological vicente serrano et al 2014 and ecological allen et al 2015 adams et al 2017 applications to overcome this we have also included in our analysis another popular drought index the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei unlike the spi the spei accounts for both precipitation p and reference evapotranspiration eto as a representative metric to quantify the aed the spei is based on a monthly climatic water balance p eto and is equally sensitive to variations in these two input variables vicente serrano et al 2015 the p eto series of anomalies are adjusted using a three parameter log logistic distribution the anomalies are accumulated at different time scales following the same approach used in the spi and converted to standard deviations with respect to average value z scores details on the calculation procedure of the spei can be found in vicente serrano et al 2010 and beguería et al 2014 the eto was computed from air temperature data using the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 as explained in the section 2 1 2 2 2 3 statistical analysis to quantify drought severity for each watershed and the sensitivity of streamflows to anomalies in each month of the year we calculated the spi and spei at time scales varying from 1 to 48 months for each month of the year using the corresponding spatially averaged series of p and eto for each watershed we obtained 576 series 12 months 48 time scales for each drought index then to account for the links between climatic droughts and hydrological droughts we used the pearson correlation coefficient computed between the time series of spei spi for each time scale and month of the year all calculations were made for the entire study period 1940 2013 as well as for some selected sub periods 1940 1964 1965 1989 and 1990 2013 to evaluate the stationarity of this correlation to summarize the high spatial variability exhibited by the relationship between ssi and spei spi we performed a principal component analysis pca in s mode richman 1986 in this mode the data i e correlations between spei spi and ssi in each basin were structured in a matrix with 12 months rows by 48 time scales columns per site which represent the spi ssi or spei ssi correlation structure in a month time scale space pca analysis decomposes this month time scale correlation space into a series of modes that represent independent amounts of the complexity variance in the spi ssi and or spei ssi correlation space the pca procedure allows for the classification of 289 basins on the basis of the similarities of the principal components of the correlations between the spei spi and the ssi and permits us to identify general patterns in these correlations the number of the retained components was defined based on the percentage of the variance of the original month time series correlation space explained by each component according to a scree plot we also mapped the pca loadings for each watershed which in our case is equivalent to the square root of the variance of the original space retained by each component and identifies how much each principal component relates to the spi spei ssi relationship of each watershed we also classified the watersheds according to the maximum loading rule in which each watershed was assigned to the pc that showed the highest loading this analysis was conducted for the three selected sub periods of the data record to analyze stationarity we also integrated information on soil climate topography and ndvi variables see section 2 1 in each watershed and analyzed how well they explain the spatial distribution of the loading patterns this was done by spatially averaging and plotting the values of these biophysical variables and the pc groups obtained from the maximum loading rule by means of boxplots for the entire period 1940 2013 as well as the three selected sub periods finally to quantify the relative contribution of each of the biophysical variables explaining the spatial differences in ssi response to the spei at different time scales we applied a predictive discriminant analysis pda the pda explains the value of a dependent categorical variable based on its relationship to one or more predictors huberty 1994 given the presence of different independent variables the pda identifies the possible linear combinations of those predictors that best separate the groups of cases of the predicted these combinations are termed discriminant functions hair et al 1998 the pda allowed identifying which predictors contributed more to the inter category differences of the pc modes that summarize ssi spei dependency 3 results 3 1 general patterns of response 1940 2013 fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the maximum correlation of the series of timescales between spei and ssi for each month and for the series of all months results are presented for the entire study period 1940 2013 and irrespective of any climatic and hydrological seasonal variations overall fig 2 reveals high positive correlations in the majority of the analyzed basins with only a few exceptions one example of such an exception is the lower correlation found between spei and ssi along the rocky mountains and in the northeastern u s for the period february to april these spatial patterns are very similar to the correlations between the spei and ssi supplementary fig 1 in both cases there is clear dominance of positive and high correlations between ssi and spei during the different months of the year supplementary fig 2 in general maximum correlations between spei and ssi tend to be achieved at shorter time scales with averages ranging between 2 and 3 month spei supplementary fig 3 however there are some regions that present maximum correlations at longer time scales notably the snow regulated basins particularly those in the western portions of the country respond to longer spei time scales than other basins this pattern is evident for all months of the year and for the series of all months this suggests differences in how these watersheds mediate the response of streamflow to climatic droughts see fig 3 the principal component analysis confirms the existence of substantial variability in the patterns of hydrological droughts response specifically it takes seven principal components to account for more than 80 of the total explained variance supplementary fig 4 each representing different spatial patterns of the month and time scale correlation between the spei and ssi figs 4 and 5 show the principal components and the principal component loadings respectively these figures identify the main hydrological drought response patterns to the range of climatic drought time scales used in this analysis the figures show substantial variations in the response of the analyzed basins with coherent geographical patterns in general the pcs indicate a dominance of response to short spei time scales which is clearly represented in the first two components fig 4 these two pcs explain 55 of the total variance the loadings of pc1 show that this pc is representative of watersheds in the southeast and the midwest u s fig 5 the mode of variation for pc1 fig 4 show high correlations at spei time scales lower than 10 months fig 4 while the loadings of pc 2 show that this mode represents northeastern basins fig 5 which show the strongest response at very short spei time scales less than 3 months between april and january fig 4 pc3 is representative of spei ssi correlations in the us pacific northwest region with the highest correlation found at short spei time scales between september and february significant correlations are also found between may and august but only for longer spei time scales the loadings of pc 4 represents the spei ssi relationship in the watersheds located in the rocky mountains and the pc scores indicate that these basins are most responsive to climatic anomalies occurring between june and february at time scales ranging from 8 to 18 months the remaining pcs pcs 5 7 represent local patterns and small clusters of basins the pc analysis showing the spatial patterns of the spi ssi correlations are presented in supplementary figs 5 through 7 these results show that the spatial modes of variation are similar to those analyzed using the spei and increases our confidence that the response of hydrological drought to climatic drought time scales shows consistent spatial patterns irrespective of the selected drought index 3 2 factors explaining the general response of ssi to spei time scales fig 6 shows the average values of the different topographic and environmental variables as a function of the pcs that summarize correlation patterns between spei and ssi annual average ndvi presents strong differences between pcs with pcs 1 2 6 and 7 correlating with higher average ndvi than pcs 3 4 and 5 notably pcs 3 and 6 show high intra basin variability also soil characteristics vary significantly between pcs especially those related to water field capacity and depth of soil layer the highest being recorded for pc 1 in contrast soil drainage infiltration and soil permeability do not present substantial differences between the different pcs similarly basin area does not differ significantly between pcs average annual streamflow shows higher values for pcs 7 and 3 with high intra basin variability among the basins belonging to these components average basin elevation presents noticeable differences between the pcs with pcs 3 and 4 associated with higher elevations than the remaining components similarly the pcs seem to vary with average annual minimum maximum temperature and eto pcs 3 4 and 5 are characterized by lower temperatures than other components table 1 shows the structure matrix following the results of the predictive discriminant analysis pda with three functions representing 43 8 27 7 and 10 5 of the total variance respectively table 2 shows the centroids of the different components for the three predictive discriminant functions pdfs pc 1 and pc 2 show negative values for pdf 1 which has the greatest power to discriminate between the different independent variables on the other hand pcs 3 4 6 and 7 show positive values in pdf 1 indicating that the pattern of relationship between climatic and hydrologic droughts characteristics of pcs 1 and 2 is favored in areas with high vegetation coverage ndvi this feature is particularly evident during the warm season when vegetation is more active positive values in pdf 1 are also associated with low elevations high temperatures during the warm season high precipitation during the warm season and low precipitation during the cold season the patterns of relationship summarized by pcs 3 and 4 and to less extent pcs 6 and 7 are dominant in basins with opposite characteristics i e low ndvi high elevation low temperatures and low precipitation during the warm season and high precipitation during the cold season pdf 2 mostly discriminates between pcs 4 and 5 on the one hand and pc 7 on the other hand demonstrating that pcs 4 and 5 are dominant in basins with low vegetation coverage high elevation and low precipitation while pc7 characterize watershed with high vegetation coverage in low elevation areas with relatively high precipitation pdf 3 had low discrimination capacity and low values for the different variables pda also indicated that soil characteristics average streamflow magnitude and total surface area of the basins contributed less to discriminating between the different patterns of response of ssi to spei time scales 3 3 temporal differences in the response of ssi to spei time scales the analysis applied for the different sub periods 1940 1964 1964 1989 and 1990 2013 reveal some differences in the relationship between climatic drought and hydrologic response in the u s the monthly correlation patterns in the month time scale space between ssi and the spei shows that the general patterns for the entire period 1940 2013 are not exactly stationary in time between 1940 and 1964 the percentage of the variance absorbed by the first few pcs is similar to the variance absorbed by the pcs in the analysis of the entire period fig 7 however the subperiod 1965 1989 distributes the total variance between the pcs more evenly and during the 1990 2013 period pc1 clearly represents a higher percentage of the total variance supplementary fig 8 the first two components of the 1940 1964 period maintain the response of ssi to spei at short time scales but with clear monthly differences fig 7 the remaining components present a ssi response to longer spei time scales also with strong monthly differences nonetheless these patterns have less spatial coherence compared to those defined for the entire period supplementary fig 9 the dominant patterns during 1965 1989 show some differences from those of the earlier period fig 8 pc 1 shows higher correlations from medium to long time scales between february and june and between july and november while pc 2 exhibits significant correlations considering short spei time scales between october and february similarly pc 3 shows significant correlations at very short time scales 1 2 months between may and july pc 4 presents a similar pattern than the same component calculated for the entire period with significant correlations at longer time scales with the exception of april these components show more coherent spatial patterns and are representative of larger regions than those of the earlier period supplementary fig 10 compared to 1940 1964 and 1965 1989 the pcs in the analysis of the 1990 2013 period shows more granularity and variation fig 9 the correlation patterns show distinct monthly responses to the range of spei time scales with smoother and more coherent spatial patterns we noted pcs that represents the basins located in the northeastern pc 1 southeastern u s pc 2 and the rocky mountains pc 5 supplementary fig 11 overall the spatial patterns of pc loadings and the analyzed response of the basins was very similar in the analysis done with any of the two drought indices i e spi and spei supplementary figs 12 18 this may indicate that the role of variations in the climatological water balance p eto is of secondary importance on the development of hydrological drought in the selected basins compared to variations in precipitation which is the common input variable in the calculation of both spi and spei our comparison also indicates that there is a general agreement on the magnitude of the maximum correlations found for the different sub periods supplementary figs 19 and 20 however and despite the overall agreement there are some differences in terms of the spei time scales at which the maximum correlations are recorded supplementary figs 21 and 22 for the sub periods 1940 1964 and 1965 1989 there are clear differences in the maximum correlation patterns found between spei and ssi supplementary fig 23 one representative example is the rocky mountains where correlations increased from january to march while decreased in april in december the magnitude of correlations clearly increased over the basins located in eastern and western portions of the country on the other hand while there are differences in the magnitude of maximum correlation patterns between the 1965 1989 and 1990 2013 periods see for example northern basins in january and february and western basins in april their spatial patterns are more random than those found in the previous period supplementary fig 24 notably spei time scales of maximum correlation are very different between sub periods for some basins in some cases maximum correlations were found at longer spei time scales in one period but at short time scales in the other supplementary figs 25 and 26 these findings indicate that the mechanisms that connect climatic and hydrological droughts may interact and reinforce or cancel each other out between the two periods these mechanisms and their interactions are difficult to identify and evaluate because the small number of instances when maximum correlations shifted differently between spei time scales in two periods makes comparisons with environmental and climatic variables supplementary tables 1 4 positive differences in maximum correlations between 1940 and 1964 and 1965 1989 i e correlation of second period minus correlation of first period are preferentially recorded for basins characterized by low ndvi values high elevations low eto and temperature but with clearly higher temperatures during the second period supplementary table 1 this analysis seems to indicate that correlation differences between these two periods follow a spatial pattern related to the spatial distribution of these climatic and physiographical variables however the spatial patterns of differences in the spei time scales at which maximum correlation is obtained between the two sub periods do not show clear relationship with any of the analyzed climatologic or physiographical variables with the exception of some monthly significant correlations supplementary table 2 the same analysis for sub periods 1965 1989 and 1990 2013 show that the spatial patterns of maximum correlation difference may be controlled by the spatial patterns of precipitation and mostly by the observed change in precipitation between the two sub periods specifically higher correlations during the second period tend to be primarily recorded for basins with low average precipitation which makes an increase in annual and seasonal precipitation during the second sub period more likely supplementary table 3 finally differences in the time scales at which the maximum correlation was recorded between these two periods did not reveal spatial patterns that correlate with the environmental and climatic variables analyzed here 4 discussion in this study we analyzed the response of a hydrological drought index the standardized streamflow index ssi to different time scales of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei in different low anthropogenic perturbation watersheds across the u s our findings indicate high correlations between the spei and ssi during a range of months of the year confirming that the magnitude of hydrological droughts in the conterminous u s is strongly controlled by climatic droughts the correlations found in this study are stronger than those obtained for basins impacted by water regulation and human management e g lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 vicente serrano et al 2017b wu et al 2017 with the exception of the february and april period when correlations are generally lower average correlations were around 0 8 or higher for the all months series the average correlation was 0 9 these results highlight that hydrological droughts in natural basins are more influenced by climatic drought than in highly regulated basins in which the temporal variability of hydrological droughts is controlled by other non climatic factors such as water storage capacity lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 and dam operation rules lópez moreno et al 2009 furthermore water extraction and reallocation for different uses can also disrupt the relationship between climate variability and hydrological droughts tijdeman et al 2018 however the u s basins included in the analysis are considered to be relatively unperturbed by direct human action nevertheless in some cases they can be affected by change in vegetation cover e g recovery from past forest fires ecological transitions which can also affect the relationship between climatic and hydrologic droughts garcía ruiz et al 2008 nevertheless these potential vegetation cover changes are expected to have a local impact and it is most likely that hydrological drought responses in the studied basins are mainly controlled by climate variability another important finding is that ssi variability is mostly controlled by climatic droughts having characteristically short time scales in the majority of the studied basins generally our results show that the spei at time scales between two and four months are often the most correlated with ssi this clearly suggests that ssi in these natural basins responds to high frequency climate variability once again these results are in contrast with results found in other studies for regulated basins e g lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 and 2013 where variability of hydrological drought is mostly linked to climatic droughts of longer characteristic time scales and to streamflow drought conditions prolonged and exacerbated by water abstractions transfers or impoundments tijdeman et al 2018 these differences can reflect increased watershed storage e g reservoir storage which modulates high frequency variations of upstream rain and streamflows which induces temporal autocorrelation and decreases the frequency of high peaks downstream lorenzo lacruz et al 2010 in general because of their higher capacity hydrological drought conditions in reservoirs occur less frequently than in streamflows vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2005 wu et al 2017 and even less frequently in groundwater systems bloomfield et al 2015 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 our results align with the expectation that hydrologic drought response of the natural basins used in this study is mostly controlled by climatic drought we did however find some exceptions to the pattern of generally short timescales between meteorological and hydrological droughts some watersheds mostly located in the rocky mountains showed low correlations between the spei and ssi during the summer and winter months at shorter time scales and appeared more responsive to long term spei time scales during the spring and fall this may be explained by the specific characteristics of the rivers located in this region with streamflow driven by snow accumulation and melting which are strongly controlled by temperature variability instead of being directly controlled by rainfall variability this was also found by haslinger et al 2014 and rimkus et al 2013 who found strong connections between hydrological and climatic droughts in austria and lithuania except for those basins and seasons in which snow processes are important to ensure the results are robust and consistent we conducted the analysis with two widely used drought indices the spi based only on precipitation data and the spei calculated using both precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand vicente serrano et al 2012 analyzed the relationship between streamflow variability and different drought indices in different basins worldwide they reported that a higher correlation between climatic and streamflow anomalies was obtained when the spei was used instead of the spi however increased aed also affects streamflow drought severity e g cai and cowan 2008 cho et al 2011 teuling et al 2013 vicente serrano et al 2017a in this study there were negligible differences not only in the magnitude of correlations found between the spi or the spei and the ssi but also in the time scales and the seasonal patterns of these correlations this finding suggests that in natural hydrological basins precipitation would have the greater influence on streamflow drought severity vicente serrano et al 2014 showed that ssi in the iberian peninsula rivers responded better to spei than to spi especially in the summer months when the role of the aed is higher however they also reported that correlations between spei and ssi and spi and ssi were similar for watersheds located in the headwaters where human intervention is more restricted and the effects of aed is lower as the rivers reach their medium and low courses temporal variability of streamflows is affected by aed especially in the most regulated basins where there is high surface coverage by irrigated lands vicente serrano et al 2017b in these circumstances the spei explained streamflow anomalies better than the spi although we do not expect that the hydrological drought response patterns of the undisturbed watersheds analyzed in this study have the same degree of complexity than the regulated basins we found remarkable spatial variations this heterogeneity in the response of natural basins was also found by barker et al 2016 in 120 catchments across the uk with a few exceptions u s watersheds dominantly respond to climatic drought of short characteristic time scales but there were clear seasonal differences that confound homogeneous patterns in the correlations between ssi and climatic drought time scales differences in the month time scale correlation space of the different watersheds are mainly associated to differences in temperature vegetation cover use as well as by topography elevation physiographic characteristics and vegetation coverage vary significantly from one river basin to another in this analysis we are considering a wide heterogeneous scenario to assess the response of hydrological drought to the climatic drought in a very diverse number of basins at this respect we found out as well as other studies related to this topic haslinger et al 2014 van loon and laaha 2015 that not only precipitation but also elevation is one of the natural drivers that control the seasonality of the streamflows as aed directly depends on it e g snow melt contribution to streamflows and hence the response of ssi to spei time scales regarding to the land use vegetation has a major role as soil structure is directly related to the hydrological cycle processes e g the runoff occurred during a heavy precipitation event or the water drainage from the aquifers to the watersheds in addition natural vegetation consumes water for respiration processes being this the main disturbing factor that explains climate vs streamflow relationships this topic has been widely studied in the scientific literature e g bosch and hewlett 1982 de jong et al 2009 garcía ruiz et al 2011 llorens and domingo 2007 the magnitude of streamflow precipitation soil characteristics and basin area also bring secondary contributions to these differences the muted contribution of average annual and seasonal precipitation to explaining patterns of response of hydrologic drought contrasts with the findings of tijdeman et al 2016 who concluded that the characteristics and duration of hydrological drought in natural basins of the u s is mostly controlled by the precipitation characteristics of each basin this study also suggests that the mechanisms that propagate climatic droughts to streamflows may not be time stationary this suggestion is based on the differences we have found in the magnitude of correlations and the time scales of maximum correlation between different periods in the record the factors that drive this behavior are unclear but they could be related to the non linearity in the dynamics of watersheds during wet and dry periods which affect how meteorological droughts propagate to become hydrological droughts haslinger et al 2014 during the mega drought recorded in southeastern australia in the 2000s yang et al 2017 showed that the rainfall runoff relationship was non stationary and that there were feedback mechanisms such that the duration and intensity of meteorological droughts were lengthened and amplified by the hydrological drought it generated non stationarity driven by drought severity and catchment land feedbacks adds some uncertainty to how climatological droughts propagate throughout the hydrological cycle none of the explanatory variables used obtain insight into the spatial patterns of hydrologic drought were able to explain adequately why the magnitude of the differences and time scales of maximum correlation was not stable between the analyzed sub periods the lack of explanatory power of the variables used in this study aligns with the results presented by yang et al 2017 who found that the times of recovery of hydrological drought conditions in relation to climatic droughts are not related to the catchment landscape they confirmed that the impact of other hydro climatic factors and catchment properties is minimal recent studies have suggested the use of climatic information to predict hydrological droughts e g zhu et al 2016 yuan et al 2017 which is especially appealing to characterize hydrological drought in regions where streamflow data is not available however results from this study and specifically the evidence of non stationary mechanisms in the response of hydrological droughts to climate variability suggest that making robust predictions using only climatological information will be a challenging task even in natural basins where most of streamflow behavior is expected to respond to climate variability the complexity of physiographic climatic edaphic and mostly vegetation characteristics drive a complex and non stationary behavior which is very difficult to determine in summary we have showed that the response of hydrological droughts to climatic droughts is complex especially in terms of the climatic drought time scales that are more likely to control hydrological drought severity this is expected in strongly modified and regulated basins where water management and or dam operation rules may strongly alter this behavior in this study it has been demonstrated that the response of hydrological droughts to climatic drought conditions can be complex and non stationary even in natural basins within the conterminous u s very different patterns of hydrological drought responses to climatic drought time scales have been detected these natural basins are characterized by different climatological physiographical and vegetation conditions further research is necessary to understand the role of vegetation cover change on the non stationary behavior of hydrological drought response detected in this study and to define to what extent the connection between climatic and hydrologic drought is disrupted by different levels of human management and practices in the united states 5 conclusions in conclusion we summarize the main findings of this study the magnitude of hydrological droughts in u s depends directly on climatic droughts and this relationship is stronger in natural basins than in regulated basins in natural basins the ssi responds predominantly to high frequency climate variability the time scales and seasonal response of ssi to spei and spi suggest that hydrological basins precipitation would have the greatest influence on streamflow drought severity however in the contiguous u s a noteworthy spatial variation and heterogeneity in the response of natural basins exist in mountainous river basins hydrological droughts were found exceptionally to be controlled not only by precipitation variability but also by temperature at long term at this respect not only climatic conditions influence hydrological droughts soil characteristics vegetation or physical characteristics of the basins also determine the different patterns of response found in natural regimes acknowledgements this work was supported by the research project i link1001 validation of

6837,green infrastructure gi is considered to be an innovative stormwater management approach that offers numerous other environmental benefits including reduction in air pollution and climate change mitigation compared with conventional gray infrastructures and it has been gradually accepted and used worldwide this review mainly focuses on the hydrological aspect of gi and provides a summary of the knowledge about gi as a stormwater management alternative in this review we discuss the operating mechanisms of a few widely used gis in the aspect of stormwater management we critically examine policies for promoting gi implementation in some countries including the sponge city in china and water sensitive urban design wsud in australia and review the effectiveness of gi on treating stormwater quantity in real world applications in addition we also used bibliometrics to analyze the gi research trends and found gi has been popular in an increasing number of countries and regions which china has the greatest future growth potential in gis research moreover many barriers impeding the further development of gi and strategies to overcome these barriers are also summarized this review gathers knowledge from many sources to provide an overview of gi to better understand its mechanisms and applications and to highlight the areas that require future study keywords green infrastructure gi innovate stormwater approach operating mechanism barrier and strategy application and implementation 1 introduction urbanization occurring in the past several decades has considerably changed land use and increased the proportion of impervious surfaces across the world berndtsson 2010 guan et al 2015 yao et al 2016 urban hydrological systems have been affected by this increasing imperviousness as evidenced by increased surface runoff and peak flow decreased rainwater infiltration and groundwater recharge and deterioration of water quality bell et al 2016 chen et al 2017 du et al 2012 valtanen et al 2014 yang et al 2011 with the combined effects of climate change the risk of urban flooding may be amplified due to the increasing occurrence of heavy rainfall events and the insufficient capacity of drainage systems tao et al 2014 wu et al 2012 moreover potential property damage and aquatic ecology deterioration from floods may worsen if this situation persists liu et al 2014c zhou et al 2013 therefore several different strategies and technologies have been developed in some countries such as the low impact development lid in the united states the water sensitive urban design wsud in australia and the sponge city in china which providing a broader framework with a holistic urban water cycle for stormwater management issues wong 2006 jia et al 2013 huang et al 2015 among these strategies green infrastructure gi as an innovate stormwater management approach to mitigate urban hydrology and water quality issues has been widely applied in many cities around the world ahiablame et al 2012a liu et al 2015a wright et al 2016 compared with conventional gray infrastructures focused on the reduction of the peak runoff discharge rate by removing water quickly from a site to reducing flooding using conveyance piping systems gi practices implement some on site infrastructures that work with nature to reduce the stormwater runoff and improve water quality from sources using landscape natural features ahiablame et al 2013 dhakal and chevalier 2017 liu et al 2014c vogel et al 2015 thus gi practices can maintain the site s pre development hydrological features or reduce the impacts of post development on urban hydrology liu et al 2014a liu et al 2015b therefore gi practices have environmental advantages for reducing surface runoff and peak flow enhancing stormwater quality at the source with natural or semi natural landscapes thus reducing the occurrence of urban waterlogging and the subsequent damage to urban infrastructure ahiablame et al 2013 huang et al 2015 liu et al 2014c wilson et al 2015 numerous studies have shown the effectiveness and benefits of gi practices in reducing stormwater quantity and enhancing water quality on laboratory scales in situ scales and modeling evaluations autixier et al 2014 berndtsson 2010 qin et al 2013 zhuang et al 2016 for example some practices such as stormwater wetlands and retention ponds are large scale practices implemented at the watershed scale to store and control runoff the other small scale practices such as bioretention systems and green roofs are distributed throughout the site at the source of pollution to treat water quantity and improve water quality bell et al 2016 davis et al 2012 pennino et al 2016 even though previous research demonstrated the beneficial uses of gi practices wong et al 2010 zimmerman et al 2010 the techniques and widespread implementations of gi practices still need to be greatly improved and promoted to ensure it is accepted as an effective control stormwater management measure in more countries and cities and to cope with rapid future climate change hence this paper integrates recent literature including research articles peer reviews technical books and design and maintenance manuals to support continuing in depth research and help gi practices attain this goal the objectives of this paper are to 1 describe the fundamental processing mechanisms of several gi practices specifically rain garden green roof and permeable pavement to deepen understanding and increase use 2 summarize recent and current research progress related to the effectiveness of the gi practices on stormwater control and 3 illustrate key barriers to the implementation of green infrastructure from different countries or regions and propose integrated solutions on promoting sustainable storm water management in general this review looks to elaborate upon the current development of gi technology including progress and barriers from different perspectives to provide recommendations and strategies for the implementation of gi and to explore and fill the research gaps 2 overview of green infrastructure lid was first introduced in maryland as an alternative land development and ecological engineering design approach to compensate for land development impacts on hydrology and water quality fletcher et al 2015 vogel et al 2015 due to concept similarity the term lid is also interchangeable with gi practices in urban settings in the united states fletcher et al 2015 liu et al 2017b mwangi et al 2015 struck et al 2010 green infrastructure has been defined by multiple studies and reports so no single universally accepted definition of gi exists with reference to the available literature gi is broadly defined as the interconnected network of natural and semi natural elements that provide multiple functions and ecosystem services ess including positive ecological economic and social benefits for humans and other species jacobs et al 2014 koc et al 2017 naumann 2011 sussams et al 2015 according to the literature review gi assets were grouped into four high level categories 1 tree canopy tc 2 green open spaces gos 3 green roofs gr and 4 vertical greenery systems vgs koc et al 2017 2 1 development of green infrastructure the concept of green infrastructure originated from the best management practices bmps proposedby the united states in the mid 1980s to accomplish more holistic stormwater quantity management goals for runoff volume reduction erosion prevention and groundwater recharge schueler 1987 and the term formally emerged in 1990s alternative terminology includes stormwater source controls and the lid practices mentioned above additionally many countries around the world have developed and implemented similar approaches using different terminology for stormwater control vogel et al 2015 sustainable urban drainage systems suds first initiated in the u k and germany have been used since the 1990s to mitigate stormwater issues keeley 2011 the concept of water sensitive urban design wusd was first introduced by australia as early as the 1960 s but the official national wusd guidelines were released in the early 1990s fletcher et al 2015 wusd is being increasingly used internationally particularly in the u k and new zealand ashley et al 2013 the development and evolution of these interchangeable terminologies are shown in fig 1 2 2 goals of implementing gi practices the goal of gi practices is to maintain post development hydrology of a site close to the natural condition present before development occurs ahiablame et al 2012a different from conventional stormwater treatment systems gi approaches manage and control stormwater runoff through the combined use of vegetation topography soil and bioengineered systems which contribute to the reduction of stormwater quantity bowman et al 2012 mullaney et al 2015 similarly gi focuses on treating contaminated stormwater runoff prior to entering aquifers streams or other receiving water bodies using ecological methods such as soil filtration chemical sorption and biological processes hunt et al 2010 moreover with the ubiquitous natural and semi natural landscape features gi practices can substantially decrease the urban flooding risks through reducing stormwater runoff and delaying the lag time thereby reducing the property losses caused by floods 2 3 significance of implementing gi practices numerous research studies and practical applications concluded that gi approaches could effectively mitigate urban hydrology problems gregoire and clausen 2011 kong et al 2017 while providing substantial environmental social and economic benefits to communities companies and citizens roseen et al 2015 vogel et al 2015 and cost analyses of the construction and maintenance of lid practices indicate the implementation of these approaches is less expensive than conventional end of pipe approaches roseen et al 2015 therefore gi can be applied to a wide range of landscape scales instead of or in addition to traditional storm runoff control elements as well as preserve or restore hydrologic and ecological functions of an urban ecosystem liu et al 2014c consequently the substantial use and widespread adoption of gi practices can reduce the need for expensive gray stormwater drainage systems as well as the burden of stormwater runoff on urban infrastructure which can change stormwater management toward a more distributed and at source approach fletcher et al 2015 3 gi mechanisms for stormwater control to better manage urban stormwater runoff better understanding the operation mechanism of green infrastructure is an imperative in this paper we selected three widely used green infrastructures 1 bioretention 2 green roof and 3 permeable pavement to introduce its fundamental mechanisms for peak flow control and runoff reduction with a theoretical hydrological model and formula 3 1 conceptual model 3 1 1 bioretention a bioretention system is a landscaped depression designed to receive stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces composed of several layers of vegetation filter media storage and an optional underdrain ahiablame et al 2012b liu et al 2014a within a bioretention cell stormwater treatment is performed by a range of chemical biological and physical processes of plants microbes and soils to remove pollutants from urban runoff and reduce peak flow and runoff volume by lucke and nichols 2015 increasing evapotranspiration through vegetation uptake and the lag time via soil infiltration brown and iii 2011 lucke et al 2017 brown and iii 2011 fig 2 a shows a conceptual bioretention model that is divided into three layers to replicate the hydrological behavior of the system stormwater runoff entering the bioretention system infiltrates the vegetation layer then the infiltrated water percolates through the soil layer until it reaches the storage layer where the stormwater is temporarily stored the stormwater is finally either discharged downstream through underdrain pipes or infiltrated into the subsoil below the soil bed mangangka et al 2015 protection 2016 when the inflow rate exceeds the infiltration rate of the soil column water starts ponding on the ground surface when the surface depression depth is exceeded the excess water becomes overflow and flows out mangangka et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 eventually most water intercepted by vegetation and retained by depression is converted into vapor and returns into the atmosphere via evapotranspiration chui et al 2016 mangangka et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 therefore rainfall runoff processes can be reduced by increasing soil infiltration as well as vegetation evapotranspiration and interception davis et al 2009 luan et al 2017 as a landscaped depression bioretention mainly reduces stormwater runoff and peak flow rate through surface depression storage evaporation and infiltration tang et al 2016 the proportion of water intercepted by vegetation canopy and evaporation is relatively small compared with methods mentioned above which are not discussed here 3 1 2 green roof green roofs also known as vegetative roofs or eco roofs are normally constructed with three major layers a vegetation layer a lightweight growing medium layer and a storage or drainage layer placed on top of a waterproof membrane carson et al 2013 soulis et al 2017 yang et al 2015 green roofs are commonly divided into two categories extensive or intensive according to the thickness of the growing substrate layer extensive green roofs are established with thin substrate layers typically 15 cm thick or less whereas intensive green roofs are established with deep substrate layers that greater than 15 cm thick berndtsson 2010 gregoire and clausen 2011 carson et al 2013 generally extensive green roofs are more often applied and studied because of its lightweight cheap and maintenance free properties carson et al 2013 nektarios et al 2015 green roofs can significantly reduce the peak flow of most of the rainfall runoff and delay the initial time of runoff formation due to their capacity to store water karteris et al 2016 a conceptual model for water routing through an extensive green roof system was adapted from a hydrological processes of stovin et al 2012 to predict the green roof runoff response fig 2b firstly some of the precipitation entering the roof surface is intercepted by vegetation and the other proportion infiltrates into the substrate medium then the infiltrated water continues to percolate through the drainage mat and leaves the green roof system through the drainage mat and by filtration onto the building top during this process if the soil becomes saturated or rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration rate the excess stormwater overflows yang et al 2015 the retained precipitation is eventually released back into the atmosphere through evapotranspiration soulis et al 2017 in general the hydrological processes simulated by the proposed conceptual model can be expressed as follows the first process intercepts the rainfall with the vegetation layer and the second process allows the rain water to infiltrate the substrate layer which is then stored at the storage drainage layer soulis et al 2017 consequently the total amount of runoff is reduced by the retaining part of the rainfall that is intercepted by vegetation and the peak flow rate is reduced by slowly distributing the stormwater that is temporarily stored in the soil layer of the green roof over a long time period li et al 2015 3 1 3 permeable pavement system a permeable pavement system typically consists of a durable and permeable paving surface a storage bed of open graded aggregate and an optional underdrain system drake et al 2013b lee et al 2015 the system is able to facilitate groundwater recharge and decrease surface runoff by capturing water on the pavement surface and then allowing the water to infiltrate the subgrade layer and groundwater imran et al 2013 kamali et al 2017 a schematic diagram of the major hydrologic processes of permeable pavement is depicted in fig 2c as rain falls onto or flows in from upgradient areas but flows into the surface layer of permeable pavement the runoff starts to infiltrate into the pavement layer and the next storage layer as the porous spaces in the permeable layers and storage layer are filled water percolates into the natural subsoil or discharges downstream through an underdrain pipe zhang et al 2010 simultaneously surface runoff occurs if the rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration rate of the porous pavement and water captured in the porous space evaporates back into the atmosphere lee et al 2015 the rainfall runoff reduction processes of a permeable pavement system mainly include infiltration evaporation and water storage which effectively contribute to the reduction of pavement runoff volume and peak flow chopra et al 2010 imran et al 2013 as an infrastructure facility the permeable pavement processes that mitigate stormwater runoff mainly include infiltration void spaces storage and evaporation in terms of vertical and horizontal exfiltration detailed information can be found from lee et al 2015 this study excludes this part due to its complexity and lack of being widely applied in the analysis 3 2 hydrological process modeling to quantify the effectiveness of green infrastructure on runoff volume reduction and peak flow control the colorado urban hydrograph procedure cuhp method swmm model and rational method used to calculate and simulate hydrological performance including infiltration depression losses evaporation and peak runoff rate are reviewed in this paper in terms of the reduction in the amount of stormwater runoff the interception and transpiration by the vegetation canopy are not considered in this study owing to their limited contribution in comparison to the total losses of the rainfall runoff process liu et al 2014c 3 2 1 infiltration the horton model horton 1941 provides a good balance between simplicity and a reasonable physical description of the infiltration process for use in both swmm and cuhp and was selected to calculate the infiltration rate in eq 1 luan et al 2017 1 f f o f i f o e a t where f is the infiltration rate at any given time t from the start of rainfall mm min fo is the final infiltration rate mm min fi is the initial infiltration rate mm min a is the decay coefficient one minute and t is time minutes similarly the modified green ampt equation green and ampt 1911 mein and larson 1973 can also be used in swmm to simulate the infiltration process the infiltration rate f is calculated as follows 2a f k s k s ψ f θ s θ i f t t p 2b f p t t p where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity mm min θ s is the saturated moisture content θ i is the initial moisture content before infiltration began ψ f is the matric pressure at the wetting front mm f is the cumulative depth of infiltration mm p is rainfall rate mm min and t p is the time when water begins to pond on the surface 3 2 2 depression the rainwater collected and held in small depressions is called depression loss which is the portion not available for runoff depression losses also include water intercepted by trees bushes other vegetation and all other surfaces table 1 summarizes typical numerical values of depression losses for several land cover types udfcd 2017 in addition the calculation of depression losses can also be expressed by mathematical equations the empirical equation introduced by linsley et al 1949 simulates the depression storage process the depression storage sd0 mm at the initial time step is calculated as 3 s d max s d max 1 exp pc s d max where s d max is the depression of the pervious area mm and pc is the accumulated residual rainfall mm which is the rainfall minus the interception and infiltration the calculation of depression in the next time step sd mm is based on mass balance where sdt is the depression in the previous time step mm and es is the evaporation of the pervious depression mm 4 sd pc s d t e s pc s d t e s s d max 0 pc s d t e s s d max 5 e s min s d t e p 3 2 3 evaporation the most known and commonly used formula for the calculation of actual evaporation is the penman monteith formula liu et al 2014c however given its unreliable to define specific parameters the uncomplicated formula proposed by hargreaves and samani 1985 that simulates the evaporation process using only air temperature was used in this paper the equation for calculating potential evaporation ep mm d is 6 e p 0 0023 0 408 r a max λ t max t min 0 5 t α ν 17 8 where ramax is the extraterrestrial radiation of the surface related to latitude mj m2 day λ is the latent heat of vapor mj kg which is usually 2 45 mj kg tmax is the maximum daily temperature c tmin is the minimum daily temperature c and tav is the average daily temperature c the constant 0 408 was used to convert radiation to evaporation equivalents in mm droogers and allen 2002 3 2 4 peak flow rate the rational method is a simple empirical procedure acceptable for use in design storm analysis in urban catchments that are not complex and are smaller than 90 acres hua et al 2010 the rational method properly understood and applied can produce satisfactory results for urban storm drain and small on site detention design and its calculation formula is as follows 7 q 2 78 c i a where q is the peak rate of runoff cfs c is the runoff coefficient a non dimensional coefficient equal to the ratio of runoff volume to rainfall volume i is the peak five minute rainfall intensity mm hour and a is the tributary area ha among them the runoff coefficient c reflects the integrated effects of catchment imperviousness infiltration evaporation natural retention and interception all of which affect the runoff volume council 2011 c is mainly affected by soil type and rainstorm recurrence period which can be calculated as shown in table 2 where i is the percentage of imperviousness expressed as a decimal ca runoff coefficient for natural resources conservation service nrcs hsg a soils cb runoff coefficient for nrcs hsg b soils cc d runoff coefficient for nrcs hsg c and d soils 4 applications of gi for stormwater control green infrastructure has been proven to be provide a valuable tool for stormwater control and flooding mitigation and has been increasingly applied around the world since the late 1990s chini et al 2017 koc et al 2017 in this paper some gi application case studies on different scales across different countries from north america to europe from neighborhood sites to pilot city scales or even to the entire country are shown in table 3 4 1 performance evaluation runoff reduction and flood alleviation the effectiveness of gi practices can be determined by evaluating hydrological functioning and pollutant removal capabilities the most commonly used structural gi practices including bioretention permeable pavement green roof and bioswale which can promote runoff reduction and urban flooding alleviation were selected to determine their hydrological benefits using field studies and modeling simulations chini et al 2017 eckart et al 2017 this section describes and summarizes the performance of the implementation of these gi practices on flood control and stormwater management by reviewing some published articles books and official reports the effectiveness of gi practices on flood alleviation has been investigated by comparing a base case with various scenarios the effectiveness can be measured by several indexes such as runoff volume reduction peak flow control and lag time attenuation liu et al 2014c qin et al 2013 table 4 summarizes the efficiencies of different gi practices on flooding mitigation indexes under various conditions 4 1 1 bioretention lucke and nichols 2015 revealed that the percentage reduction in runoff volume and peak outflow rate varied from 32 7 to 84 3 and 79 5 to 93 6 respectively between three 10 year old street side bioretention basins during a series of simulated two year interval recurrence rainfall events located in caloundra australia they noted that the peak flow reduction and attenuation performance of bioretention systems under higher and naturally occurring inflow rates may be different from these simulated results during the monitoring period from october 2013 to november 2014 the three bioretention cells were constructed in low permeability soils in northeast ohio reduced runoff volume calculated as the sum of exfiltration and et by 36 0 42 1 and 59 2 during events exceeding the designed one year rainfall intensities peak flow mitigation varied from 24 to 96 generally as rainfall intensity increased peak flow mitigation decreased especially for storms with overflow winston et al 2016 4 1 2 green roofs using a prototype green roof constructed in pittsburgh pennsylvania u s bliss et al 2009 determined that the impact of a green roof on stormwater runoff was substantially better than the control roof monitoring and analysis of this site demonstrated that the peak flow rate reduction ranged from 5 to 71 and runoff volume reduction varied from 5 to 69 compared to the conventional control roof for all storms during the monitoring period from the experimental data of stovin et al 2012 for a u k green roof test bed on runoff mitigation over a 29 month period the performance characteristics of the green roof were recorded as 0 04 to 99 95 for rainfall volume reduction 19 81 to 99 93 for peak attenuation and the stormwater was delayed by an average of 87 70 min compared with the conventional system these figures provided a clear indication that green roofs could play a significant role in providing source controls as part of suds treatment stovin et al 2012 4 1 3 permeable pavement system an impervious surface can be converted into porous permeable pavement to decrease runoff a community located in haidian district of beijing was selected as a case study to simulate the effect of gi practices on urban flooding reduction the simulation results showed that runoff volumes were reduced by 46 2 42 0 and peak flows were reduced by 37 9 35 7 under 1 2 5 and 10 year storm events with 50 of impervious surfaces being converted into porous brick pavement if the impervious surfaces decreased to 0 under the same storm recurrence intervals that reduction rate would change to 66 5 59 6 and 54 2 51 0 respectively liu et al 2014c drake et al 2013a evaluated the hydrologic performance of three partial infiltration permeable pavement systems in vaughan ontario canada over 22 months the results showed that the pps completely captured most rainfall events that were less than seven mm deep a 43 reduction in outflow volume occurred and peak flows were reduced by at least 50 throughout the study period these results support that permeable pavement systems can provide sustainable stormwater management for a wide range of complex areas imran et al 2013 tota maharaj and scholz 2010 4 1 4 optimal combination fry and maxwell 2015 indicated that distributed gi practices bioretention cells and rain gardens have the largest impact on peak flow and runoff volume reduction for smaller storm events in the range of 25 41 and 15 5 25 respectively under different configurations of two year storms in a neighborhood site denver u s a another comparative study showed that site outflow volume significantly decreased using a lid process grassed swales pretreatment bioretention cell underground detention chamber and underground infiltration trenches ranging from an 89 runoff reduction for a 79 5 mm storm event to a 100 runoff reduction for a small storm and a significant peak discharge reduction for all storms sampled with reduction ranging from 98 to 100 wilson et al 2015 luan et al 2017 revealed that comprehensive measures a combination of a concave greenbelt with 50 concave ratio a permeable pavement a bio retention cell and a vegetative swale compared with individual practices were more effective at reducing peak discharge and runoff for a one year rainfall event and the reduction percentages were 55 7 and 57 3 respectively xu et al 2018 developed a fast and reliable method marginal cost based greedy strategy mcgs for gi lid layout optimization and was applied to three case studies in china to verify its broad applicability results indicate that the simple mcgs has the prominent advantages on the optimization of cost effectiveness and gi layout planning 4 1 5 summary the performance of gi systems is significantly impacted by the size of the storm event including event duration and peak flow intensity the reduction efficiency also depends to some extent on the magnitude of rainfall events tao et al 2017 gi practices have somewhat better performance for low intensity and short duration events on volume and peak flow reduction compared with high intensity storm events regardless of duration tao et al 2017 for example bioretention facilities can readily capture the entire inflow volume during small events ahiablame et al 2013 however the reduction capacity for single gi facilities was limited especially during bigger storm events instead integrating gi facilities can enhance the reduction effectiveness for different storms therefore the optimal combination of integrated green infrastructures is imperative to minimize the impacts of storm runoffs and implementation in communities may have considerable contribution to urban flood control liu et al 2014c reduction in runoff logically led to a reduction in flood events during a simulation study in illinois u s ahiablame and shakya 2016 implementation with 50 100 permeable pavement and 100 rain gardens in parking lots were the most effective at reducing flooding in the watershed with the rate of flooding reduction varying from 45 5 to 54 5 for major floods 28 8 40 8 for action floods 36 4 for major floods and 21 6 for action floods thus these practices identified by numerous studies have shown their significant ecological importance given their ability to quickly infiltrate rainwater reduce the runoff in the catchment area and decrease runoff peak flows that may otherwise result in high influent flows to water reclamation plants wrps and affect operations or cause local flooding and combined sewer overflow kumar et al 2016 4 2 analysis and implication of gi applications around the world as an emerging and popular stormwater management approach many published articles and practical applications of gi around the world have been completed to analyze the global research trends and patterns of gi practices bibliometrics an effective tool used to reveal research trends in different scientific fields li et al 2014 was applied in this study the relevant data were obtained from science citation index database using web of science core collection which is deemed to be the most reliable bibliographic source zhuang et al 2016 many documents related to gi practice have been published therefore all available publications of different gi types were not included in this analysis to review the most commonly used and representative types to be included in this review the search and selection criteria were as follows 1 five representative gi categories were selected to analyze trends green roof bioretention bioswale permeable pavement and rainwater harvesting system relative keywords like green roof were used to search all publications that contained these words in the title abstract or keywords 2 only articles proceedings papers and reviews were chosen to represent the professional publications 3 the literature belonging to these categories and types were published from 2008 to 2017 using the above mentioned search method a total of 2763 original and peer reviewed articles between 2008 and 2017 were identified as being gi related and were chosen for further analysis then seven countries were chosen from the world to represent different continents with a two year interval during the selected period to analyze the trends in gi fig 3 a shows the number of papers and research trends of these five gi types the gi related research experienced significant global expansion in the study period among them the study of green roofs represented the largest proportion followed by bioretention and pervious pavement fig 3b presents the articles published by the seven countries at four different stages from 2008 until 2011 the united states was responsible for the largest contribution in the seven countries accounting for more than half of the published literature from 2011 to 2017 research expanded in most continents and china the u k and australia have been gradually increasing their research contributions representing 16 39 12 30 12 29 of the research in 2014 and 19 66 11 37 8 29 in 2017 respectively the combined total number of their published articles was almost the same as that of the united states alone according to these figures we concluded that north america mainly including the united states and canada dominated gi research followed by western europe mainly including the united kingdom germany and france eastern asia mainly including china and south korea and oceania mainly including australia and new zealand demonstrating a distinct geographic bias which is similar to the previous research results koc et al 2017 zhuang et al 2016 moreover fig 3b reveals that the growth rate in china was the greatest indicating that china has the greatest future growth potential in gis research through cross national comparative analysis key differences between these regions and the increase in gi research around the world were identified indicating that the application of gi practices has been gradually increasing overall the implementation of gi planning would be relatively easy and various examples of gi application in different countries provided more detailed information about appropriate approaches and techniques this information provided positive references for the other countries when applying gi to urban construction and stormwater management in addition to the practical application of green infrastructure approaches ranging from large centralized public projects to small scattered applications on private properties zaręba 2014 many new and current software modeling tools have been gradually applied to the modeling of stormwater management and economic aspects of gi such as swmm music sustain and storm wise model these model tools provide cost benefit or economic analysis of gi practices for decision makers to select the most cost effective solution in stormwater management jayasooriya et al 2014 metropolitan areas like portland oregon u s have already seen the economic benefits of using gi to reduce runoff flowing through their combined sewers therefore the implementation of gi practices can reduce stormwater runoff and result in fewer combined sewer overflow cso events with significant reductions in infrastructure expenditures mangangka et al 2015 5 gi implementation barriers and strategies 5 1 barriers and challenges although gi has gained popularity given its environmental benefits and economic advantages compared with traditional gray infrastructure the process of gi implementation remains slow traditional gray infrastructure is still ubiquitous in urban areas throughout the world dhakal and chevalier 2017 the conflicting relationship between knowledge and practice reveals the barriers that exist to the implementation of gi around the world according to the literature review including published papers government reports and public interviews both at home and aboard the main barriers to implementing gi practices can be classified into four categories institutional regulatory technological and financial table 5 presents the recognized barriers for establishing gi practices in four selected countries the details of each barrier are illustrated in later sections 5 1 1 institutional barriers as shown in table 5 despite government promotion of the implementation of gi practices and issuance of technical guidelines implementation remains slow at the local official and community scales due to the inertia of tradition and inflexibility of manuals as evidenced in china where centralized technical guidance does not apply to local city with different geographical and social conditions jia et al 2017 xia et al 2017 regarding the inertia of tradition scholars and researchers argue for institutional change and the strengthening of legitimization processes but local institutions are still unwilling or resistant to adapt especially without a successful and secure business case brown and farrelly 2009 for example the current price of municipal water in american cities is so low so residents believe that adopting new water harvesting techniques is not a cost effective method and are thus reluctant to support new gi practices labadie 2011 5 1 2 technical barriers gi is suffering from the lack of sufficient technical support that prevent instant widespread implementation based on survey results most participants agreed that the lack of professional knowledge such as performance and cost data design standards and maintenance guidance and lack of skilled labor were the largest barriers to implementing gi kim et al 2017 o donnell et al 2017 because if gi practices are not well constructed or applied properly then they may require special maintenance to perform at a desirable level or otherwise may result in the unsuccessful operation of gi practices bergman 2013 edmonton 2016 shafique 2018 these technical barriers aroused the uncertainty and skepticism of people toward the use of gi for managing stormwater and complicating the ability of local governments to allocate funds to gi projects and develop and implement new stormwater policies tian 2011 for areas that lack technical support even though they could gain experience from surrounding areas time and effort are required to adjust measures to local conditions due to specific climates and geography 5 1 3 financial barriers financial constraints are also considered an important barrier hampering the wider adoption of new stormwater management alternatives at the local level a variety of financial barriers are outlined in table 5 such as increased overall development costs limited available investments a lack of incentives to encourage implementation and cost benefits analysis that show the economic feasibility of gi implementation although evidence proved that the use of gi is less costly and more cost effective compared with conventional approaches the initial cost of introducing and initiating gi could be high and periodic labor and cost inputs are needed for maintenance after construction tian 2011 additionally many participants stated a lack of local political will for lid gi has leading to officials being reluctant to support increased fees or taxes which also involve legal and political issues labadie 2011 roy et al 2008 5 1 4 regulatory barriers although gi has been developed and applied since the early 2000s no mature and specific laws and regulations exist yet to supervise and regulate gi implementation li et al 2017 in many countries limitations on local and central government rules regulations and laws can create significant barriers to the increased adoption of gi for example unclear and decentralized responsibilities that lack the close inter agency cooperation at the local level would postpone gi implementation especially the shifting of responsibilities between departments that the effective operation management and maintenance of gi infeasible jia et al 2017 tian 2011 when gi areas are located on private properties conflicts between local ordinances and property rights also complicate the completion of long term and proper maintenance 5 2 integrated and innovative future solutions overcoming the barriers to the implementation of gi can be achieved using various methods regardless of barriers being government or individual academia or enterprise all can participate in the continued efforts to conquer identified obstacles and facilitate broader adoption of gi practices in order to develop and improve social educational law and economic conditions required by gi practices a wide perspective and the participation of different stakeholders are needed barbosa et al 2012 fig 4 shows the strategies needed to overcome the institutional regulatory technical and financial barriers to the implementation of gi practices these include 1 raising public awareness and offering professional education 2 providing technical support and maintenance guidance 3 enhancing partnership and cooperation and coordination responsibility 4 developing financial sources and economic incentives and 5 modifying policies and establishing regulations and laws firstly the correct guidance and effective government promotion of gi implementation must be improved this mainly includes two regulatory and institutional aspects specific and appropriate laws and regulations should be introduced by the national government to control stormwater runoff and should be implemented at all levels of government from top to bottom to effectively remove barriers in local codes and ordinances simultaneously gi practices would be easier to be implement at the local level while complying with national requirements similarly integrated collaboration across different levels of government and interdepartmental coordination with local authority are critical for identifying the responsibilities across various departments which are arranged and designated by the government thus a stormwater management committee that plays a significant role in the effective collaboration and coordination could be established to promote coordination efforts across levels of government and increase the feasibility of gi construction and development hammitt and geosciences 2010 for example an intergovernmental committee was formed to provide guidance on the implementation of water sensitive urban design wsud practices in australia roy et al 2008 in addition sufficient funding resources and economic incentives should be guaranteed and established by the government to provide financial assistance for long term gi operation and maintenance and to motivate local authorities and individuals to adopt gi practices frederick et al 2015 secondly academic and business institutions should undertake the responsibility for knowledge propaganda and technical support to cultivate technical talents raise public awareness of new sustainable stormwater practices and create cost benefit performance database for example professional educators can not only open the stormwater management gi related curricula and help the government organize public education activities but can also strengthen scientific research such as improve the techniques of gi facilities integrate the gi performance and cost data and develop design manuals and maintenance guidelines applicable to local climate and soil conditions for engineers and builders for enterprises successful design and construction techniques from previous studies and construction experience can be used to reduce construction costs and provide bonuses for expedited and excellent projects tayouga and gagné 2016 finally homeowners who have encountered environmental and ecological issues education and have engineering construction training experience can also incorporate gi into their existing landscape such as rain gardens and rain barrels which are easily implemented into yards in addition to the collaboration and coordination mentioned above facilitated partnerships between stormwater managers urban planners engineers landscape architects and urban residents are critical for the increased implementation of gi to stormwater management stockwell 2009 6 conclusions since gi was introduced in the 1990s it has been increasingly studied and implemented globally liu et al 2017b based on its natural design ideas and environmental friendly performances gi was identified by sustainable development as one of the five strategic areas that provide a comprehensive approach to sustainable community development walmsley 2006 impervious surfaces not only have the largest footprint but also aggravate rainstorm disasters in urban communities however installing green infrastructures would have a profound impact on mitigating urban flooding this paper presents the operating mechanisms of a few widely used gi in the aspect of stormwater management including infiltration evaporation and precipitation policies for promoting gi implementation in some countries around the world were reviewed including the sponge city in china and water sensitive urban design wsud in australia the effectiveness of gi for treating stormwater and urban flooding were summarized and analysis results revealed that the efficiency of gi varies under different conditions and different regions and the efficiency of the same gi would change over time in addition as the environmental and economic benefits of gi have attracted increasing attention gi research has grown explosively in the past few decades with north america takes the leading edge but china has the greatest potential in the field although gi has been gradually applied throughout the world applying gi on a large scale and achieving the expected goal remains challenging this paper explored the four barriers to the implementation of gi in different countries institutional regulatory technological and financial barriers and the available strategies to overcome these obstacles including gi design standards adapted to the local ecological environment for more effective watershed management continued future research is necessary to improve the gi performance data especially about the lag time for gi for stormwater according to the analysis of existing and new data gi combinations can be optimally selected to achieve the greatest environmental benefit with the lowest expenditure for different conditions and regions liu et al 2014b liu et al 2016a liu et al 2016b researchers should also attempt to help decision makers create effective and better gi implementation plans for watershed stormwater management acknowledgements this work is financially supported by national key research and development program

6837,green infrastructure gi is considered to be an innovative stormwater management approach that offers numerous other environmental benefits including reduction in air pollution and climate change mitigation compared with conventional gray infrastructures and it has been gradually accepted and used worldwide this review mainly focuses on the hydrological aspect of gi and provides a summary of the knowledge about gi as a stormwater management alternative in this review we discuss the operating mechanisms of a few widely used gis in the aspect of stormwater management we critically examine policies for promoting gi implementation in some countries including the sponge city in china and water sensitive urban design wsud in australia and review the effectiveness of gi on treating stormwater quantity in real world applications in addition we also used bibliometrics to analyze the gi research trends and found gi has been popular in an increasing number of countries and regions which china has the greatest future growth potential in gis research moreover many barriers impeding the further development of gi and strategies to overcome these barriers are also summarized this review gathers knowledge from many sources to provide an overview of gi to better understand its mechanisms and applications and to highlight the areas that require future study keywords green infrastructure gi innovate stormwater approach operating mechanism barrier and strategy application and implementation 1 introduction urbanization occurring in the past several decades has considerably changed land use and increased the proportion of impervious surfaces across the world berndtsson 2010 guan et al 2015 yao et al 2016 urban hydrological systems have been affected by this increasing imperviousness as evidenced by increased surface runoff and peak flow decreased rainwater infiltration and groundwater recharge and deterioration of water quality bell et al 2016 chen et al 2017 du et al 2012 valtanen et al 2014 yang et al 2011 with the combined effects of climate change the risk of urban flooding may be amplified due to the increasing occurrence of heavy rainfall events and the insufficient capacity of drainage systems tao et al 2014 wu et al 2012 moreover potential property damage and aquatic ecology deterioration from floods may worsen if this situation persists liu et al 2014c zhou et al 2013 therefore several different strategies and technologies have been developed in some countries such as the low impact development lid in the united states the water sensitive urban design wsud in australia and the sponge city in china which providing a broader framework with a holistic urban water cycle for stormwater management issues wong 2006 jia et al 2013 huang et al 2015 among these strategies green infrastructure gi as an innovate stormwater management approach to mitigate urban hydrology and water quality issues has been widely applied in many cities around the world ahiablame et al 2012a liu et al 2015a wright et al 2016 compared with conventional gray infrastructures focused on the reduction of the peak runoff discharge rate by removing water quickly from a site to reducing flooding using conveyance piping systems gi practices implement some on site infrastructures that work with nature to reduce the stormwater runoff and improve water quality from sources using landscape natural features ahiablame et al 2013 dhakal and chevalier 2017 liu et al 2014c vogel et al 2015 thus gi practices can maintain the site s pre development hydrological features or reduce the impacts of post development on urban hydrology liu et al 2014a liu et al 2015b therefore gi practices have environmental advantages for reducing surface runoff and peak flow enhancing stormwater quality at the source with natural or semi natural landscapes thus reducing the occurrence of urban waterlogging and the subsequent damage to urban infrastructure ahiablame et al 2013 huang et al 2015 liu et al 2014c wilson et al 2015 numerous studies have shown the effectiveness and benefits of gi practices in reducing stormwater quantity and enhancing water quality on laboratory scales in situ scales and modeling evaluations autixier et al 2014 berndtsson 2010 qin et al 2013 zhuang et al 2016 for example some practices such as stormwater wetlands and retention ponds are large scale practices implemented at the watershed scale to store and control runoff the other small scale practices such as bioretention systems and green roofs are distributed throughout the site at the source of pollution to treat water quantity and improve water quality bell et al 2016 davis et al 2012 pennino et al 2016 even though previous research demonstrated the beneficial uses of gi practices wong et al 2010 zimmerman et al 2010 the techniques and widespread implementations of gi practices still need to be greatly improved and promoted to ensure it is accepted as an effective control stormwater management measure in more countries and cities and to cope with rapid future climate change hence this paper integrates recent literature including research articles peer reviews technical books and design and maintenance manuals to support continuing in depth research and help gi practices attain this goal the objectives of this paper are to 1 describe the fundamental processing mechanisms of several gi practices specifically rain garden green roof and permeable pavement to deepen understanding and increase use 2 summarize recent and current research progress related to the effectiveness of the gi practices on stormwater control and 3 illustrate key barriers to the implementation of green infrastructure from different countries or regions and propose integrated solutions on promoting sustainable storm water management in general this review looks to elaborate upon the current development of gi technology including progress and barriers from different perspectives to provide recommendations and strategies for the implementation of gi and to explore and fill the research gaps 2 overview of green infrastructure lid was first introduced in maryland as an alternative land development and ecological engineering design approach to compensate for land development impacts on hydrology and water quality fletcher et al 2015 vogel et al 2015 due to concept similarity the term lid is also interchangeable with gi practices in urban settings in the united states fletcher et al 2015 liu et al 2017b mwangi et al 2015 struck et al 2010 green infrastructure has been defined by multiple studies and reports so no single universally accepted definition of gi exists with reference to the available literature gi is broadly defined as the interconnected network of natural and semi natural elements that provide multiple functions and ecosystem services ess including positive ecological economic and social benefits for humans and other species jacobs et al 2014 koc et al 2017 naumann 2011 sussams et al 2015 according to the literature review gi assets were grouped into four high level categories 1 tree canopy tc 2 green open spaces gos 3 green roofs gr and 4 vertical greenery systems vgs koc et al 2017 2 1 development of green infrastructure the concept of green infrastructure originated from the best management practices bmps proposedby the united states in the mid 1980s to accomplish more holistic stormwater quantity management goals for runoff volume reduction erosion prevention and groundwater recharge schueler 1987 and the term formally emerged in 1990s alternative terminology includes stormwater source controls and the lid practices mentioned above additionally many countries around the world have developed and implemented similar approaches using different terminology for stormwater control vogel et al 2015 sustainable urban drainage systems suds first initiated in the u k and germany have been used since the 1990s to mitigate stormwater issues keeley 2011 the concept of water sensitive urban design wusd was first introduced by australia as early as the 1960 s but the official national wusd guidelines were released in the early 1990s fletcher et al 2015 wusd is being increasingly used internationally particularly in the u k and new zealand ashley et al 2013 the development and evolution of these interchangeable terminologies are shown in fig 1 2 2 goals of implementing gi practices the goal of gi practices is to maintain post development hydrology of a site close to the natural condition present before development occurs ahiablame et al 2012a different from conventional stormwater treatment systems gi approaches manage and control stormwater runoff through the combined use of vegetation topography soil and bioengineered systems which contribute to the reduction of stormwater quantity bowman et al 2012 mullaney et al 2015 similarly gi focuses on treating contaminated stormwater runoff prior to entering aquifers streams or other receiving water bodies using ecological methods such as soil filtration chemical sorption and biological processes hunt et al 2010 moreover with the ubiquitous natural and semi natural landscape features gi practices can substantially decrease the urban flooding risks through reducing stormwater runoff and delaying the lag time thereby reducing the property losses caused by floods 2 3 significance of implementing gi practices numerous research studies and practical applications concluded that gi approaches could effectively mitigate urban hydrology problems gregoire and clausen 2011 kong et al 2017 while providing substantial environmental social and economic benefits to communities companies and citizens roseen et al 2015 vogel et al 2015 and cost analyses of the construction and maintenance of lid practices indicate the implementation of these approaches is less expensive than conventional end of pipe approaches roseen et al 2015 therefore gi can be applied to a wide range of landscape scales instead of or in addition to traditional storm runoff control elements as well as preserve or restore hydrologic and ecological functions of an urban ecosystem liu et al 2014c consequently the substantial use and widespread adoption of gi practices can reduce the need for expensive gray stormwater drainage systems as well as the burden of stormwater runoff on urban infrastructure which can change stormwater management toward a more distributed and at source approach fletcher et al 2015 3 gi mechanisms for stormwater control to better manage urban stormwater runoff better understanding the operation mechanism of green infrastructure is an imperative in this paper we selected three widely used green infrastructures 1 bioretention 2 green roof and 3 permeable pavement to introduce its fundamental mechanisms for peak flow control and runoff reduction with a theoretical hydrological model and formula 3 1 conceptual model 3 1 1 bioretention a bioretention system is a landscaped depression designed to receive stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces composed of several layers of vegetation filter media storage and an optional underdrain ahiablame et al 2012b liu et al 2014a within a bioretention cell stormwater treatment is performed by a range of chemical biological and physical processes of plants microbes and soils to remove pollutants from urban runoff and reduce peak flow and runoff volume by lucke and nichols 2015 increasing evapotranspiration through vegetation uptake and the lag time via soil infiltration brown and iii 2011 lucke et al 2017 brown and iii 2011 fig 2 a shows a conceptual bioretention model that is divided into three layers to replicate the hydrological behavior of the system stormwater runoff entering the bioretention system infiltrates the vegetation layer then the infiltrated water percolates through the soil layer until it reaches the storage layer where the stormwater is temporarily stored the stormwater is finally either discharged downstream through underdrain pipes or infiltrated into the subsoil below the soil bed mangangka et al 2015 protection 2016 when the inflow rate exceeds the infiltration rate of the soil column water starts ponding on the ground surface when the surface depression depth is exceeded the excess water becomes overflow and flows out mangangka et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 eventually most water intercepted by vegetation and retained by depression is converted into vapor and returns into the atmosphere via evapotranspiration chui et al 2016 mangangka et al 2015 zhang et al 2010 therefore rainfall runoff processes can be reduced by increasing soil infiltration as well as vegetation evapotranspiration and interception davis et al 2009 luan et al 2017 as a landscaped depression bioretention mainly reduces stormwater runoff and peak flow rate through surface depression storage evaporation and infiltration tang et al 2016 the proportion of water intercepted by vegetation canopy and evaporation is relatively small compared with methods mentioned above which are not discussed here 3 1 2 green roof green roofs also known as vegetative roofs or eco roofs are normally constructed with three major layers a vegetation layer a lightweight growing medium layer and a storage or drainage layer placed on top of a waterproof membrane carson et al 2013 soulis et al 2017 yang et al 2015 green roofs are commonly divided into two categories extensive or intensive according to the thickness of the growing substrate layer extensive green roofs are established with thin substrate layers typically 15 cm thick or less whereas intensive green roofs are established with deep substrate layers that greater than 15 cm thick berndtsson 2010 gregoire and clausen 2011 carson et al 2013 generally extensive green roofs are more often applied and studied because of its lightweight cheap and maintenance free properties carson et al 2013 nektarios et al 2015 green roofs can significantly reduce the peak flow of most of the rainfall runoff and delay the initial time of runoff formation due to their capacity to store water karteris et al 2016 a conceptual model for water routing through an extensive green roof system was adapted from a hydrological processes of stovin et al 2012 to predict the green roof runoff response fig 2b firstly some of the precipitation entering the roof surface is intercepted by vegetation and the other proportion infiltrates into the substrate medium then the infiltrated water continues to percolate through the drainage mat and leaves the green roof system through the drainage mat and by filtration onto the building top during this process if the soil becomes saturated or rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration rate the excess stormwater overflows yang et al 2015 the retained precipitation is eventually released back into the atmosphere through evapotranspiration soulis et al 2017 in general the hydrological processes simulated by the proposed conceptual model can be expressed as follows the first process intercepts the rainfall with the vegetation layer and the second process allows the rain water to infiltrate the substrate layer which is then stored at the storage drainage layer soulis et al 2017 consequently the total amount of runoff is reduced by the retaining part of the rainfall that is intercepted by vegetation and the peak flow rate is reduced by slowly distributing the stormwater that is temporarily stored in the soil layer of the green roof over a long time period li et al 2015 3 1 3 permeable pavement system a permeable pavement system typically consists of a durable and permeable paving surface a storage bed of open graded aggregate and an optional underdrain system drake et al 2013b lee et al 2015 the system is able to facilitate groundwater recharge and decrease surface runoff by capturing water on the pavement surface and then allowing the water to infiltrate the subgrade layer and groundwater imran et al 2013 kamali et al 2017 a schematic diagram of the major hydrologic processes of permeable pavement is depicted in fig 2c as rain falls onto or flows in from upgradient areas but flows into the surface layer of permeable pavement the runoff starts to infiltrate into the pavement layer and the next storage layer as the porous spaces in the permeable layers and storage layer are filled water percolates into the natural subsoil or discharges downstream through an underdrain pipe zhang et al 2010 simultaneously surface runoff occurs if the rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration rate of the porous pavement and water captured in the porous space evaporates back into the atmosphere lee et al 2015 the rainfall runoff reduction processes of a permeable pavement system mainly include infiltration evaporation and water storage which effectively contribute to the reduction of pavement runoff volume and peak flow chopra et al 2010 imran et al 2013 as an infrastructure facility the permeable pavement processes that mitigate stormwater runoff mainly include infiltration void spaces storage and evaporation in terms of vertical and horizontal exfiltration detailed information can be found from lee et al 2015 this study excludes this part due to its complexity and lack of being widely applied in the analysis 3 2 hydrological process modeling to quantify the effectiveness of green infrastructure on runoff volume reduction and peak flow control the colorado urban hydrograph procedure cuhp method swmm model and rational method used to calculate and simulate hydrological performance including infiltration depression losses evaporation and peak runoff rate are reviewed in this paper in terms of the reduction in the amount of stormwater runoff the interception and transpiration by the vegetation canopy are not considered in this study owing to their limited contribution in comparison to the total losses of the rainfall runoff process liu et al 2014c 3 2 1 infiltration the horton model horton 1941 provides a good balance between simplicity and a reasonable physical description of the infiltration process for use in both swmm and cuhp and was selected to calculate the infiltration rate in eq 1 luan et al 2017 1 f f o f i f o e a t where f is the infiltration rate at any given time t from the start of rainfall mm min fo is the final infiltration rate mm min fi is the initial infiltration rate mm min a is the decay coefficient one minute and t is time minutes similarly the modified green ampt equation green and ampt 1911 mein and larson 1973 can also be used in swmm to simulate the infiltration process the infiltration rate f is calculated as follows 2a f k s k s ψ f θ s θ i f t t p 2b f p t t p where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity mm min θ s is the saturated moisture content θ i is the initial moisture content before infiltration began ψ f is the matric pressure at the wetting front mm f is the cumulative depth of infiltration mm p is rainfall rate mm min and t p is the time when water begins to pond on the surface 3 2 2 depression the rainwater collected and held in small depressions is called depression loss which is the portion not available for runoff depression losses also include water intercepted by trees bushes other vegetation and all other surfaces table 1 summarizes typical numerical values of depression losses for several land cover types udfcd 2017 in addition the calculation of depression losses can also be expressed by mathematical equations the empirical equation introduced by linsley et al 1949 simulates the depression storage process the depression storage sd0 mm at the initial time step is calculated as 3 s d max s d max 1 exp pc s d max where s d max is the depression of the pervious area mm and pc is the accumulated residual rainfall mm which is the rainfall minus the interception and infiltration the calculation of depression in the next time step sd mm is based on mass balance where sdt is the depression in the previous time step mm and es is the evaporation of the pervious depression mm 4 sd pc s d t e s pc s d t e s s d max 0 pc s d t e s s d max 5 e s min s d t e p 3 2 3 evaporation the most known and commonly used formula for the calculation of actual evaporation is the penman monteith formula liu et al 2014c however given its unreliable to define specific parameters the uncomplicated formula proposed by hargreaves and samani 1985 that simulates the evaporation process using only air temperature was used in this paper the equation for calculating potential evaporation ep mm d is 6 e p 0 0023 0 408 r a max λ t max t min 0 5 t α ν 17 8 where ramax is the extraterrestrial radiation of the surface related to latitude mj m2 day λ is the latent heat of vapor mj kg which is usually 2 45 mj kg tmax is the maximum daily temperature c tmin is the minimum daily temperature c and tav is the average daily temperature c the constant 0 408 was used to convert radiation to evaporation equivalents in mm droogers and allen 2002 3 2 4 peak flow rate the rational method is a simple empirical procedure acceptable for use in design storm analysis in urban catchments that are not complex and are smaller than 90 acres hua et al 2010 the rational method properly understood and applied can produce satisfactory results for urban storm drain and small on site detention design and its calculation formula is as follows 7 q 2 78 c i a where q is the peak rate of runoff cfs c is the runoff coefficient a non dimensional coefficient equal to the ratio of runoff volume to rainfall volume i is the peak five minute rainfall intensity mm hour and a is the tributary area ha among them the runoff coefficient c reflects the integrated effects of catchment imperviousness infiltration evaporation natural retention and interception all of which affect the runoff volume council 2011 c is mainly affected by soil type and rainstorm recurrence period which can be calculated as shown in table 2 where i is the percentage of imperviousness expressed as a decimal ca runoff coefficient for natural resources conservation service nrcs hsg a soils cb runoff coefficient for nrcs hsg b soils cc d runoff coefficient for nrcs hsg c and d soils 4 applications of gi for stormwater control green infrastructure has been proven to be provide a valuable tool for stormwater control and flooding mitigation and has been increasingly applied around the world since the late 1990s chini et al 2017 koc et al 2017 in this paper some gi application case studies on different scales across different countries from north america to europe from neighborhood sites to pilot city scales or even to the entire country are shown in table 3 4 1 performance evaluation runoff reduction and flood alleviation the effectiveness of gi practices can be determined by evaluating hydrological functioning and pollutant removal capabilities the most commonly used structural gi practices including bioretention permeable pavement green roof and bioswale which can promote runoff reduction and urban flooding alleviation were selected to determine their hydrological benefits using field studies and modeling simulations chini et al 2017 eckart et al 2017 this section describes and summarizes the performance of the implementation of these gi practices on flood control and stormwater management by reviewing some published articles books and official reports the effectiveness of gi practices on flood alleviation has been investigated by comparing a base case with various scenarios the effectiveness can be measured by several indexes such as runoff volume reduction peak flow control and lag time attenuation liu et al 2014c qin et al 2013 table 4 summarizes the efficiencies of different gi practices on flooding mitigation indexes under various conditions 4 1 1 bioretention lucke and nichols 2015 revealed that the percentage reduction in runoff volume and peak outflow rate varied from 32 7 to 84 3 and 79 5 to 93 6 respectively between three 10 year old street side bioretention basins during a series of simulated two year interval recurrence rainfall events located in caloundra australia they noted that the peak flow reduction and attenuation performance of bioretention systems under higher and naturally occurring inflow rates may be different from these simulated results during the monitoring period from october 2013 to november 2014 the three bioretention cells were constructed in low permeability soils in northeast ohio reduced runoff volume calculated as the sum of exfiltration and et by 36 0 42 1 and 59 2 during events exceeding the designed one year rainfall intensities peak flow mitigation varied from 24 to 96 generally as rainfall intensity increased peak flow mitigation decreased especially for storms with overflow winston et al 2016 4 1 2 green roofs using a prototype green roof constructed in pittsburgh pennsylvania u s bliss et al 2009 determined that the impact of a green roof on stormwater runoff was substantially better than the control roof monitoring and analysis of this site demonstrated that the peak flow rate reduction ranged from 5 to 71 and runoff volume reduction varied from 5 to 69 compared to the conventional control roof for all storms during the monitoring period from the experimental data of stovin et al 2012 for a u k green roof test bed on runoff mitigation over a 29 month period the performance characteristics of the green roof were recorded as 0 04 to 99 95 for rainfall volume reduction 19 81 to 99 93 for peak attenuation and the stormwater was delayed by an average of 87 70 min compared with the conventional system these figures provided a clear indication that green roofs could play a significant role in providing source controls as part of suds treatment stovin et al 2012 4 1 3 permeable pavement system an impervious surface can be converted into porous permeable pavement to decrease runoff a community located in haidian district of beijing was selected as a case study to simulate the effect of gi practices on urban flooding reduction the simulation results showed that runoff volumes were reduced by 46 2 42 0 and peak flows were reduced by 37 9 35 7 under 1 2 5 and 10 year storm events with 50 of impervious surfaces being converted into porous brick pavement if the impervious surfaces decreased to 0 under the same storm recurrence intervals that reduction rate would change to 66 5 59 6 and 54 2 51 0 respectively liu et al 2014c drake et al 2013a evaluated the hydrologic performance of three partial infiltration permeable pavement systems in vaughan ontario canada over 22 months the results showed that the pps completely captured most rainfall events that were less than seven mm deep a 43 reduction in outflow volume occurred and peak flows were reduced by at least 50 throughout the study period these results support that permeable pavement systems can provide sustainable stormwater management for a wide range of complex areas imran et al 2013 tota maharaj and scholz 2010 4 1 4 optimal combination fry and maxwell 2015 indicated that distributed gi practices bioretention cells and rain gardens have the largest impact on peak flow and runoff volume reduction for smaller storm events in the range of 25 41 and 15 5 25 respectively under different configurations of two year storms in a neighborhood site denver u s a another comparative study showed that site outflow volume significantly decreased using a lid process grassed swales pretreatment bioretention cell underground detention chamber and underground infiltration trenches ranging from an 89 runoff reduction for a 79 5 mm storm event to a 100 runoff reduction for a small storm and a significant peak discharge reduction for all storms sampled with reduction ranging from 98 to 100 wilson et al 2015 luan et al 2017 revealed that comprehensive measures a combination of a concave greenbelt with 50 concave ratio a permeable pavement a bio retention cell and a vegetative swale compared with individual practices were more effective at reducing peak discharge and runoff for a one year rainfall event and the reduction percentages were 55 7 and 57 3 respectively xu et al 2018 developed a fast and reliable method marginal cost based greedy strategy mcgs for gi lid layout optimization and was applied to three case studies in china to verify its broad applicability results indicate that the simple mcgs has the prominent advantages on the optimization of cost effectiveness and gi layout planning 4 1 5 summary the performance of gi systems is significantly impacted by the size of the storm event including event duration and peak flow intensity the reduction efficiency also depends to some extent on the magnitude of rainfall events tao et al 2017 gi practices have somewhat better performance for low intensity and short duration events on volume and peak flow reduction compared with high intensity storm events regardless of duration tao et al 2017 for example bioretention facilities can readily capture the entire inflow volume during small events ahiablame et al 2013 however the reduction capacity for single gi facilities was limited especially during bigger storm events instead integrating gi facilities can enhance the reduction effectiveness for different storms therefore the optimal combination of integrated green infrastructures is imperative to minimize the impacts of storm runoffs and implementation in communities may have considerable contribution to urban flood control liu et al 2014c reduction in runoff logically led to a reduction in flood events during a simulation study in illinois u s ahiablame and shakya 2016 implementation with 50 100 permeable pavement and 100 rain gardens in parking lots were the most effective at reducing flooding in the watershed with the rate of flooding reduction varying from 45 5 to 54 5 for major floods 28 8 40 8 for action floods 36 4 for major floods and 21 6 for action floods thus these practices identified by numerous studies have shown their significant ecological importance given their ability to quickly infiltrate rainwater reduce the runoff in the catchment area and decrease runoff peak flows that may otherwise result in high influent flows to water reclamation plants wrps and affect operations or cause local flooding and combined sewer overflow kumar et al 2016 4 2 analysis and implication of gi applications around the world as an emerging and popular stormwater management approach many published articles and practical applications of gi around the world have been completed to analyze the global research trends and patterns of gi practices bibliometrics an effective tool used to reveal research trends in different scientific fields li et al 2014 was applied in this study the relevant data were obtained from science citation index database using web of science core collection which is deemed to be the most reliable bibliographic source zhuang et al 2016 many documents related to gi practice have been published therefore all available publications of different gi types were not included in this analysis to review the most commonly used and representative types to be included in this review the search and selection criteria were as follows 1 five representative gi categories were selected to analyze trends green roof bioretention bioswale permeable pavement and rainwater harvesting system relative keywords like green roof were used to search all publications that contained these words in the title abstract or keywords 2 only articles proceedings papers and reviews were chosen to represent the professional publications 3 the literature belonging to these categories and types were published from 2008 to 2017 using the above mentioned search method a total of 2763 original and peer reviewed articles between 2008 and 2017 were identified as being gi related and were chosen for further analysis then seven countries were chosen from the world to represent different continents with a two year interval during the selected period to analyze the trends in gi fig 3 a shows the number of papers and research trends of these five gi types the gi related research experienced significant global expansion in the study period among them the study of green roofs represented the largest proportion followed by bioretention and pervious pavement fig 3b presents the articles published by the seven countries at four different stages from 2008 until 2011 the united states was responsible for the largest contribution in the seven countries accounting for more than half of the published literature from 2011 to 2017 research expanded in most continents and china the u k and australia have been gradually increasing their research contributions representing 16 39 12 30 12 29 of the research in 2014 and 19 66 11 37 8 29 in 2017 respectively the combined total number of their published articles was almost the same as that of the united states alone according to these figures we concluded that north america mainly including the united states and canada dominated gi research followed by western europe mainly including the united kingdom germany and france eastern asia mainly including china and south korea and oceania mainly including australia and new zealand demonstrating a distinct geographic bias which is similar to the previous research results koc et al 2017 zhuang et al 2016 moreover fig 3b reveals that the growth rate in china was the greatest indicating that china has the greatest future growth potential in gis research through cross national comparative analysis key differences between these regions and the increase in gi research around the world were identified indicating that the application of gi practices has been gradually increasing overall the implementation of gi planning would be relatively easy and various examples of gi application in different countries provided more detailed information about appropriate approaches and techniques this information provided positive references for the other countries when applying gi to urban construction and stormwater management in addition to the practical application of green infrastructure approaches ranging from large centralized public projects to small scattered applications on private properties zaręba 2014 many new and current software modeling tools have been gradually applied to the modeling of stormwater management and economic aspects of gi such as swmm music sustain and storm wise model these model tools provide cost benefit or economic analysis of gi practices for decision makers to select the most cost effective solution in stormwater management jayasooriya et al 2014 metropolitan areas like portland oregon u s have already seen the economic benefits of using gi to reduce runoff flowing through their combined sewers therefore the implementation of gi practices can reduce stormwater runoff and result in fewer combined sewer overflow cso events with significant reductions in infrastructure expenditures mangangka et al 2015 5 gi implementation barriers and strategies 5 1 barriers and challenges although gi has gained popularity given its environmental benefits and economic advantages compared with traditional gray infrastructure the process of gi implementation remains slow traditional gray infrastructure is still ubiquitous in urban areas throughout the world dhakal and chevalier 2017 the conflicting relationship between knowledge and practice reveals the barriers that exist to the implementation of gi around the world according to the literature review including published papers government reports and public interviews both at home and aboard the main barriers to implementing gi practices can be classified into four categories institutional regulatory technological and financial table 5 presents the recognized barriers for establishing gi practices in four selected countries the details of each barrier are illustrated in later sections 5 1 1 institutional barriers as shown in table 5 despite government promotion of the implementation of gi practices and issuance of technical guidelines implementation remains slow at the local official and community scales due to the inertia of tradition and inflexibility of manuals as evidenced in china where centralized technical guidance does not apply to local city with different geographical and social conditions jia et al 2017 xia et al 2017 regarding the inertia of tradition scholars and researchers argue for institutional change and the strengthening of legitimization processes but local institutions are still unwilling or resistant to adapt especially without a successful and secure business case brown and farrelly 2009 for example the current price of municipal water in american cities is so low so residents believe that adopting new water harvesting techniques is not a cost effective method and are thus reluctant to support new gi practices labadie 2011 5 1 2 technical barriers gi is suffering from the lack of sufficient technical support that prevent instant widespread implementation based on survey results most participants agreed that the lack of professional knowledge such as performance and cost data design standards and maintenance guidance and lack of skilled labor were the largest barriers to implementing gi kim et al 2017 o donnell et al 2017 because if gi practices are not well constructed or applied properly then they may require special maintenance to perform at a desirable level or otherwise may result in the unsuccessful operation of gi practices bergman 2013 edmonton 2016 shafique 2018 these technical barriers aroused the uncertainty and skepticism of people toward the use of gi for managing stormwater and complicating the ability of local governments to allocate funds to gi projects and develop and implement new stormwater policies tian 2011 for areas that lack technical support even though they could gain experience from surrounding areas time and effort are required to adjust measures to local conditions due to specific climates and geography 5 1 3 financial barriers financial constraints are also considered an important barrier hampering the wider adoption of new stormwater management alternatives at the local level a variety of financial barriers are outlined in table 5 such as increased overall development costs limited available investments a lack of incentives to encourage implementation and cost benefits analysis that show the economic feasibility of gi implementation although evidence proved that the use of gi is less costly and more cost effective compared with conventional approaches the initial cost of introducing and initiating gi could be high and periodic labor and cost inputs are needed for maintenance after construction tian 2011 additionally many participants stated a lack of local political will for lid gi has leading to officials being reluctant to support increased fees or taxes which also involve legal and political issues labadie 2011 roy et al 2008 5 1 4 regulatory barriers although gi has been developed and applied since the early 2000s no mature and specific laws and regulations exist yet to supervise and regulate gi implementation li et al 2017 in many countries limitations on local and central government rules regulations and laws can create significant barriers to the increased adoption of gi for example unclear and decentralized responsibilities that lack the close inter agency cooperation at the local level would postpone gi implementation especially the shifting of responsibilities between departments that the effective operation management and maintenance of gi infeasible jia et al 2017 tian 2011 when gi areas are located on private properties conflicts between local ordinances and property rights also complicate the completion of long term and proper maintenance 5 2 integrated and innovative future solutions overcoming the barriers to the implementation of gi can be achieved using various methods regardless of barriers being government or individual academia or enterprise all can participate in the continued efforts to conquer identified obstacles and facilitate broader adoption of gi practices in order to develop and improve social educational law and economic conditions required by gi practices a wide perspective and the participation of different stakeholders are needed barbosa et al 2012 fig 4 shows the strategies needed to overcome the institutional regulatory technical and financial barriers to the implementation of gi practices these include 1 raising public awareness and offering professional education 2 providing technical support and maintenance guidance 3 enhancing partnership and cooperation and coordination responsibility 4 developing financial sources and economic incentives and 5 modifying policies and establishing regulations and laws firstly the correct guidance and effective government promotion of gi implementation must be improved this mainly includes two regulatory and institutional aspects specific and appropriate laws and regulations should be introduced by the national government to control stormwater runoff and should be implemented at all levels of government from top to bottom to effectively remove barriers in local codes and ordinances simultaneously gi practices would be easier to be implement at the local level while complying with national requirements similarly integrated collaboration across different levels of government and interdepartmental coordination with local authority are critical for identifying the responsibilities across various departments which are arranged and designated by the government thus a stormwater management committee that plays a significant role in the effective collaboration and coordination could be established to promote coordination efforts across levels of government and increase the feasibility of gi construction and development hammitt and geosciences 2010 for example an intergovernmental committee was formed to provide guidance on the implementation of water sensitive urban design wsud practices in australia roy et al 2008 in addition sufficient funding resources and economic incentives should be guaranteed and established by the government to provide financial assistance for long term gi operation and maintenance and to motivate local authorities and individuals to adopt gi practices frederick et al 2015 secondly academic and business institutions should undertake the responsibility for knowledge propaganda and technical support to cultivate technical talents raise public awareness of new sustainable stormwater practices and create cost benefit performance database for example professional educators can not only open the stormwater management gi related curricula and help the government organize public education activities but can also strengthen scientific research such as improve the techniques of gi facilities integrate the gi performance and cost data and develop design manuals and maintenance guidelines applicable to local climate and soil conditions for engineers and builders for enterprises successful design and construction techniques from previous studies and construction experience can be used to reduce construction costs and provide bonuses for expedited and excellent projects tayouga and gagné 2016 finally homeowners who have encountered environmental and ecological issues education and have engineering construction training experience can also incorporate gi into their existing landscape such as rain gardens and rain barrels which are easily implemented into yards in addition to the collaboration and coordination mentioned above facilitated partnerships between stormwater managers urban planners engineers landscape architects and urban residents are critical for the increased implementation of gi to stormwater management stockwell 2009 6 conclusions since gi was introduced in the 1990s it has been increasingly studied and implemented globally liu et al 2017b based on its natural design ideas and environmental friendly performances gi was identified by sustainable development as one of the five strategic areas that provide a comprehensive approach to sustainable community development walmsley 2006 impervious surfaces not only have the largest footprint but also aggravate rainstorm disasters in urban communities however installing green infrastructures would have a profound impact on mitigating urban flooding this paper presents the operating mechanisms of a few widely used gi in the aspect of stormwater management including infiltration evaporation and precipitation policies for promoting gi implementation in some countries around the world were reviewed including the sponge city in china and water sensitive urban design wsud in australia the effectiveness of gi for treating stormwater and urban flooding were summarized and analysis results revealed that the efficiency of gi varies under different conditions and different regions and the efficiency of the same gi would change over time in addition as the environmental and economic benefits of gi have attracted increasing attention gi research has grown explosively in the past few decades with north america takes the leading edge but china has the greatest potential in the field although gi has been gradually applied throughout the world applying gi on a large scale and achieving the expected goal remains challenging this paper explored the four barriers to the implementation of gi in different countries institutional regulatory technological and financial barriers and the available strategies to overcome these obstacles including gi design standards adapted to the local ecological environment for more effective watershed management continued future research is necessary to improve the gi performance data especially about the lag time for gi for stormwater according to the analysis of existing and new data gi combinations can be optimally selected to achieve the greatest environmental benefit with the lowest expenditure for different conditions and regions liu et al 2014b liu et al 2016a liu et al 2016b researchers should also attempt to help decision makers create effective and better gi implementation plans for watershed stormwater management acknowledgements this work is financially supported by national key research and development program

6838,the net amount of rainfall entering into the soil and its spatial distribution at the patch scale are key drivers of ecosystem processes in drylands the spatial distribution of water is mainly controlled by vegetation canopy which determines the partitioning of rainfall into interception throughfall and stemflow in this paper we synthesized and analyzed rainfall partitioning for 68 woody plant species in drylands delimited by a rainfall potential evapotranspiration ratio 0 65 46 papers we explored the role of rainfall inputs and plant morphological attributes life form phenology leaf type and bark type by considering a rainfall gradient from 145 to 805 mm year 1 on average interception throughfall and stemflow accounted for 24 0 69 8 and 6 2 of total rainfall respectively stemflow was the most variable flux coefficient of variation 107 8 while interception and throughfall were less variable fluxes coefficient of variation 39 2 and 20 4 respectively along the increasing rainfall gradient interception showed a tendency to decrease from 27 1 to 18 9 p 0 12 throughfall increased from 61 4 to 81 2 p 0 01 and stemflow decreased from 10 0 to 1 6 p 0 0001 shrubs presented higher stemflow than trees 9 4 vs 3 5 respectively p 0 0001 while trees presented higher throughfall than shrubs 72 3 vs 63 0 respectively p 0 05 species with smooth barks presented higher stemflow than species with rough barks 8 3 vs 4 2 respectively p 0 0001 both phenology and leaf type had no effect on interception throughfall and stemflow p 0 05 for all cases shrubs were more abundant towards the dry edge of the rainfall gradient 145 500 mm year 1 while trees were more abundant towards the subhumid edge 500 805 mm year 1 these results suggested that higher stemflow found towards the dry edge of the rainfall gradient was caused by the higher abundance of shrubs which generated more stemflow than trees our findings highlighted the ecohydrological key role of vegetation life form and rainfall inputs affecting the amount of water entering into the soil and its spatial distribution in drylands keywords aridity ecohydrology precipitation rangelands 1 introduction drylands cover about 40 of the earth s land surface and provide important ecosystem goods and services schimel 2010 baldi and jobbágy 2012 maestre et al 2012 drylands net primary productivity npp depends on how limited rainfall inputs are transpired by vegetation noy meir 1973 loik et al 2004 transpiration is strongly controlled by the net amount of rainfall entering into the soil and its spatial distribution at the patch scale ludwig et al 2005 breshears et al 2009 magliano et al 2015 vegetation canopy affects the spatial distribution of water and also nutrients by partitioning rainfall in three fluxes interception throughfall and stemflow llorens and domingo 2007 aboal et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b the need to better understand how rainfall is partitioned in drylands becomes particularly important because directly affects the transpiration flux and consequently may determine the npp of the ecosystem or the survival of plants in the dry periods martinez meza and whitford 1996 li et al 2009 interception is the fraction of water retained on the canopy and evaporated after or during rainfall events dunkerley 2000 hence this flux exerts a negative effect on plant water consumption by preventing water from reaching the soil surface dunkerley 2000 zhang et al 2017b in contrast the remaining rainfall i e net rainfall reaches the soil surface either as throughfall or stemflow throughfall is the fraction of water that reaches the soil surface directly through the canopy gaps without hitting the canopy surfaces or indirectly through dripping from the leaves and branches zhang et al 2016 throughfall affects the spatial distribution of water and nutrients content in the soil especially in the top layer shachnovich et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 stemflow is the fraction of water that reaches the base of the shrubs or trees through their stems or trunks levia and germer 2015 stemflow affects the vertical distribution of soil water by infiltrating it deeper and next to the roots whitford et al 1997 li et al 2008 in general comparing the water fluxes reaching the soil surface throughfall represents the largest fraction of rainfall partitioning while stemflow represents the smallest one crockford and richardson 2000 levia and frost 2003 fig 1 even though the number of assessments about rainfall partitioning increases year by year the role of either life forms or climate conditions is poorly known crockford and richardson 2000 levia and frost 2003 carlyle moses 2004 johnson and lehmann 2006 notably shrubs are less studied than trees johnson and lehmann 2006 llorens and domingo 2007 and drylands are less studied than subhumid or tropical regions in spite of the fact that they generally present higher stemflow values levia and frost 2003 in addition most of previous studies were focused on one or two species growing on a specific site although these studies allowed us to a better understanding of rainfall partitioning and the role of plant morphological attributes and meteorological conditions they provided no information about general patterns in this paper we explored rainfall partitioning trends and their biophysical controls in drylands firstly we surveyed and mapped field studies that assessed rainfall partitioning in drylands rainfall potential evapotranspiration ratio 0 65 secondly we explored rainfall partitioning as a function of a rainfall gradient from 145 to 805 mm year 1 thirdly we determined the effect of life form phenology leaf type and bark type on rainfall partitioning finally for each life form we i explored stemflow as a function of the rainfall gradient and ii we determined its frequency distribution 2 materials and methods we analyzed papers that met the following conditions 1 rainfall partitioning data was exclusively obtained from field experiments modeled or estimated values were not considered 2 study sites were located on drylands defined by the rainfall potential evapotranspiration ratio 0 65 trabucco and zomer 2009 and 3 papers that were published in peer reviewed journals for each species at each study site we used the percentage values of interception throughfall and stemflow found in the papers surveyed see table 1 whereas the absolute amount of water of interception throughfall and stemflow was obtained by multiplying these percentages with the mean annual rainfall obtained at each study site in the cases where a range of minimum and maximum rainfall values was informed we averaged both values in order to get a single one those papers on which rainfall partitioning for each individual species could not be identified were excluded from the analysis see carlyle moses 2004 medeiros et al 2009 návar and bryan 1990 navar 1999 we averaged the values of interception throughfall and stemflow percentages considering all the species involved in the surveyed papers we explored interception throughfall and stemflow percentage and absolute amount of each species at each site along a rainfall gradient from 145 to 805 mm year 1 using simple linear regression models the statistical significance of each linear model was checked assuming a significance level of 0 05 we classified each plant species according to its life form shrubs or trees phenology deciduous or evergreen leaf type needle broad or pinnate and bark type rough or smooth categories life form was classified by considering the height of each species determining a limit of 2 5 m between shrubs and trees based on richardson and rejmánek 2011 below this value species were considered shrubs and above it species were considered trees richardson and rejmánek 2011 salix psammophila and hippophae rhamnoides surpassed the 2 5 m height threshold but they were classified as shrubs according to the classifications of yuan et al 2016 and zhang et al 2017 respectively phenology leaf type and bark type classification were based on the missouri botanical garden www missouribotanicalgarden org identification guide for the wild trees of the canary archipelago http www arbolappcanarias es and efloras http www efloras org botanical databases we compared the differences in interception throughfall and stemflow between each life form leaf type and bark type categories using t tests and we tested phenology differences using anova in the cases with significant differences were found we performed tukey tests for each life form we explored the response of stemflow to mean annual rainfall using simple linear regression models and its frequency distribution along the rainfall gradient results of all analyses were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 all analyses were performed in r version 3 1 1 r core team 2014 3 results we surveyed 46 papers that have assessed 68 different plant species in 31 sites around the world table 1 on average interception throughfall and stemflow accounted for 24 0 69 8 and 6 2 of total rainfall respectively values ranged from 10 8 to 45 0 in the case of interception 31 5 88 0 for throughfall and 0 3 43 3 for stemflow stemflow achieved the maximum variability coefficient of variation 107 8 whereas interception and throughfall were less variable coefficient of variation 39 2 and 20 4 respectively based on the geographical distribution of the reviewed papers fig 2 we identified three regions of the world that concentrated 76 of the research effort i south western usa and north eastern mexico 14 papers 18 species ii the iberian peninsula 7 papers 15 species and iii central china 14 papers 13 species it is worth mentioning that all papers in central china were published in the last decade in this sense most drylands of the world are poorly explored particularly those in africa except the canary is and southern and central asia interception throughfall and stemflow were significantly affected by rainfall in a gradient from 145 to 805 mm year 1 fig 3 along the increasing rainfall gradient interception showed a tendency to decrease from 27 1 to 18 9 p 0 12 throughfall increased from 61 4 to 81 2 p 0 01 and stemflow decreased from 10 0 to 1 6 p 0 0001 fig 3a stemflow was the most sensitive flux to rainfall decreasing its mean value 6 25 times through a gradient of 660 mm year 1 from 145 to 805 mm year 1 while throughfall was the least sensitive increasing 32 in the same conditions when rainfall partitioning was analyzed as an absolute amount of water mm throughfall and interception increased with the increment of rainfall p 0 0001 in both cases while stemflow remained constant throughout the rainfall gradient averaging 29 mm fig 3b life form conditioned rainfall partitioning shrubs displayed significantly higher stemflow than trees 9 4 vs 3 5 respectively p 0 0001 table 2 and trees presented higher throughfall than shrubs 72 3 vs 63 0 respectively p 0 05 notably no differences were found in terms of interception averaging 24 for shrubs and trees when both life forms were compared at similar rainfall conditions from 273 to 723 mm year 1 no trees were found below the first value and no shrubs were found above the second value shrubs also achieved significantly higher stemflow values than trees 7 6 vs 3 4 respectively p 0 0001 regarding bark types species with smooth barks achieved twice the stemflow values of those with rough barks 8 3 vs 4 2 p 0 0001 it should be noted that 83 of shrubs presented smooth bark textures while in trees this percentage was only 31 phenology and leaf type had no significant effect on interception throughfall and stemflow p 0 05 table 2 notably stemflow of shrubs and trees presented no significant relation with the rainfall gradient p 0 08 and p 0 14 for shrubs and trees respectively fig 4 a it is important to mention that the fig 4a was configured using the same data of fig 3a and the only difference was the disaggregation of the life form shrubs were more abundant towards drier sites whereas trees predominated towards the more subhumid ones as shown in the frequency distribution analysis fig 4b so the higher stemflow found towards the dry edge of the rainfall gradient fig 3a was caused by the higher abundance of shrubs fig 4 which generated more stemflow than trees table 2 4 discussion rainfall partitioning affects the spatial distribution of water entering into the soil deeply controlling net primary productivity in drylands based on the 46 papers surveyed and organized along an increasing rainfall gradient we found that stemflow proportion decreased whereas throughfall proportion increased fig 3 the increment of the stemflow towards drier sites was caused by the higher abundance of shrubs that generated more stemflow than trees table 2 and fig 4 in this line species with smooth barks presented higher stemflow probably due to the greater abundance of smooth barked shrubs while phenology and leaf type had no effect on rainfall partitioning table 2 previous studies demonstrated that stemflow is mainly controlled by rainfall characteristics and plant morphological attributes more specifically stemflow increases with larger rainfall events yang et al 2008 yuan et al 2016 and in plant species with a higher number of stems as well as a lower angle of stem insertion levia and frost 2003 zhang et al 2017a although it is not clear which of these two biophysical controls on rainfall partitioning exerts a more important role our findings suggested that the plant morphological attributes prevail shrubs commonly have more than one stem next to the soil surface which are vertically oriented looking like an inverted cone martinez meza and whitford 1996 li et al 2008 zhang et al 2015b on the contrary trees commonly present one dominant stem or trunk with branches horizontally orientated such as pinus spp or in different directions such as quercus spp crockford and richardson 2000 richardson and rejmánek 2011 molina and del campo 2012 bialkowski and buttle 2015 looking like a cone and a sphere respectively so there are three main canopy forms that could explain the effects of plant morphological attributes on stemflow generation fig 5 in the case of shrubs the combination of canopy form and root induced preferential flow described as double funneling process johnson and lehmann 2006 would be a critical mechanism that maximize the flow of water close to roots in deeper soil layers therefore they may provide an adaptative advantage to survive in water stressed periods whitford et al 1997 reynolds et al 1999 so far rainfall partitioning was largely explored on isolated species and or specific sites making difficult not only the identification of general patterns but also the extrapolation of data between sites this study was focused on determining the global patterns and on identifying their main biophysical controls of rainfall partitioning e g mean annual rainfall plant morphological attributes we considered that the linear regression models fitted fig 3 would be useful to simulate water inputs in dry sites where interception losses and stemflow generation data is seldom available in addition we think that next step to continue exploring rainfall partitioning in drylands could be by assessing the effect of event size and or rainfall intensity moreover relating rainfall with other physical attributes such as temperature air humidity and wind direction and speed would open the need of future investigations for instance we did not find significant trends for interception throughfall and stemflow along mean annual temperature gradient p 0 05 in all the cases data not shown however based on our results field observations and laboratory experiments levia and frost 2003 garcia estringana et al 2010 we hypothesize that the water storage capacity of different bark roughness together with the size and intensity of rainfall events would be very important in determining the ratio between interception losses and stemflow generation in drylands 5 conclusions we showed a global synthesis and a meta analysis of field studies that assessed rainfall partitioning in drylands we found that on average interception throughfall and stemflow accounted for 24 0 69 8 and 6 2 of total rainfall respectively stemflow was the most variable flux along an increasing rainfall gradient stemflow proportion decreased whereas throughfall proportion increased the increment in the stemflow towards drier sites was caused by the higher abundance of shrubs that generate more stemflow than trees

6838,the net amount of rainfall entering into the soil and its spatial distribution at the patch scale are key drivers of ecosystem processes in drylands the spatial distribution of water is mainly controlled by vegetation canopy which determines the partitioning of rainfall into interception throughfall and stemflow in this paper we synthesized and analyzed rainfall partitioning for 68 woody plant species in drylands delimited by a rainfall potential evapotranspiration ratio 0 65 46 papers we explored the role of rainfall inputs and plant morphological attributes life form phenology leaf type and bark type by considering a rainfall gradient from 145 to 805 mm year 1 on average interception throughfall and stemflow accounted for 24 0 69 8 and 6 2 of total rainfall respectively stemflow was the most variable flux coefficient of variation 107 8 while interception and throughfall were less variable fluxes coefficient of variation 39 2 and 20 4 respectively along the increasing rainfall gradient interception showed a tendency to decrease from 27 1 to 18 9 p 0 12 throughfall increased from 61 4 to 81 2 p 0 01 and stemflow decreased from 10 0 to 1 6 p 0 0001 shrubs presented higher stemflow than trees 9 4 vs 3 5 respectively p 0 0001 while trees presented higher throughfall than shrubs 72 3 vs 63 0 respectively p 0 05 species with smooth barks presented higher stemflow than species with rough barks 8 3 vs 4 2 respectively p 0 0001 both phenology and leaf type had no effect on interception throughfall and stemflow p 0 05 for all cases shrubs were more abundant towards the dry edge of the rainfall gradient 145 500 mm year 1 while trees were more abundant towards the subhumid edge 500 805 mm year 1 these results suggested that higher stemflow found towards the dry edge of the rainfall gradient was caused by the higher abundance of shrubs which generated more stemflow than trees our findings highlighted the ecohydrological key role of vegetation life form and rainfall inputs affecting the amount of water entering into the soil and its spatial distribution in drylands keywords aridity ecohydrology precipitation rangelands 1 introduction drylands cover about 40 of the earth s land surface and provide important ecosystem goods and services schimel 2010 baldi and jobbágy 2012 maestre et al 2012 drylands net primary productivity npp depends on how limited rainfall inputs are transpired by vegetation noy meir 1973 loik et al 2004 transpiration is strongly controlled by the net amount of rainfall entering into the soil and its spatial distribution at the patch scale ludwig et al 2005 breshears et al 2009 magliano et al 2015 vegetation canopy affects the spatial distribution of water and also nutrients by partitioning rainfall in three fluxes interception throughfall and stemflow llorens and domingo 2007 aboal et al 2015 zhang et al 2015b the need to better understand how rainfall is partitioned in drylands becomes particularly important because directly affects the transpiration flux and consequently may determine the npp of the ecosystem or the survival of plants in the dry periods martinez meza and whitford 1996 li et al 2009 interception is the fraction of water retained on the canopy and evaporated after or during rainfall events dunkerley 2000 hence this flux exerts a negative effect on plant water consumption by preventing water from reaching the soil surface dunkerley 2000 zhang et al 2017b in contrast the remaining rainfall i e net rainfall reaches the soil surface either as throughfall or stemflow throughfall is the fraction of water that reaches the soil surface directly through the canopy gaps without hitting the canopy surfaces or indirectly through dripping from the leaves and branches zhang et al 2016 throughfall affects the spatial distribution of water and nutrients content in the soil especially in the top layer shachnovich et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 stemflow is the fraction of water that reaches the base of the shrubs or trees through their stems or trunks levia and germer 2015 stemflow affects the vertical distribution of soil water by infiltrating it deeper and next to the roots whitford et al 1997 li et al 2008 in general comparing the water fluxes reaching the soil surface throughfall represents the largest fraction of rainfall partitioning while stemflow represents the smallest one crockford and richardson 2000 levia and frost 2003 fig 1 even though the number of assessments about rainfall partitioning increases year by year the role of either life forms or climate conditions is poorly known crockford and richardson 2000 levia and frost 2003 carlyle moses 2004 johnson and lehmann 2006 notably shrubs are less studied than trees johnson and lehmann 2006 llorens and domingo 2007 and drylands are less studied than subhumid or tropical regions in spite of the fact that they generally present higher stemflow values levia and frost 2003 in addition most of previous studies were focused on one or two species growing on a specific site although these studies allowed us to a better understanding of rainfall partitioning and the role of plant morphological attributes and meteorological conditions they provided no information about general patterns in this paper we explored rainfall partitioning trends and their biophysical controls in drylands firstly we surveyed and mapped field studies that assessed rainfall partitioning in drylands rainfall potential evapotranspiration ratio 0 65 secondly we explored rainfall partitioning as a function of a rainfall gradient from 145 to 805 mm year 1 thirdly we determined the effect of life form phenology leaf type and bark type on rainfall partitioning finally for each life form we i explored stemflow as a function of the rainfall gradient and ii we determined its frequency distribution 2 materials and methods we analyzed papers that met the following conditions 1 rainfall partitioning data was exclusively obtained from field experiments modeled or estimated values were not considered 2 study sites were located on drylands defined by the rainfall potential evapotranspiration ratio 0 65 trabucco and zomer 2009 and 3 papers that were published in peer reviewed journals for each species at each study site we used the percentage values of interception throughfall and stemflow found in the papers surveyed see table 1 whereas the absolute amount of water of interception throughfall and stemflow was obtained by multiplying these percentages with the mean annual rainfall obtained at each study site in the cases where a range of minimum and maximum rainfall values was informed we averaged both values in order to get a single one those papers on which rainfall partitioning for each individual species could not be identified were excluded from the analysis see carlyle moses 2004 medeiros et al 2009 návar and bryan 1990 navar 1999 we averaged the values of interception throughfall and stemflow percentages considering all the species involved in the surveyed papers we explored interception throughfall and stemflow percentage and absolute amount of each species at each site along a rainfall gradient from 145 to 805 mm year 1 using simple linear regression models the statistical significance of each linear model was checked assuming a significance level of 0 05 we classified each plant species according to its life form shrubs or trees phenology deciduous or evergreen leaf type needle broad or pinnate and bark type rough or smooth categories life form was classified by considering the height of each species determining a limit of 2 5 m between shrubs and trees based on richardson and rejmánek 2011 below this value species were considered shrubs and above it species were considered trees richardson and rejmánek 2011 salix psammophila and hippophae rhamnoides surpassed the 2 5 m height threshold but they were classified as shrubs according to the classifications of yuan et al 2016 and zhang et al 2017 respectively phenology leaf type and bark type classification were based on the missouri botanical garden www missouribotanicalgarden org identification guide for the wild trees of the canary archipelago http www arbolappcanarias es and efloras http www efloras org botanical databases we compared the differences in interception throughfall and stemflow between each life form leaf type and bark type categories using t tests and we tested phenology differences using anova in the cases with significant differences were found we performed tukey tests for each life form we explored the response of stemflow to mean annual rainfall using simple linear regression models and its frequency distribution along the rainfall gradient results of all analyses were considered statistically significant when p 0 05 all analyses were performed in r version 3 1 1 r core team 2014 3 results we surveyed 46 papers that have assessed 68 different plant species in 31 sites around the world table 1 on average interception throughfall and stemflow accounted for 24 0 69 8 and 6 2 of total rainfall respectively values ranged from 10 8 to 45 0 in the case of interception 31 5 88 0 for throughfall and 0 3 43 3 for stemflow stemflow achieved the maximum variability coefficient of variation 107 8 whereas interception and throughfall were less variable coefficient of variation 39 2 and 20 4 respectively based on the geographical distribution of the reviewed papers fig 2 we identified three regions of the world that concentrated 76 of the research effort i south western usa and north eastern mexico 14 papers 18 species ii the iberian peninsula 7 papers 15 species and iii central china 14 papers 13 species it is worth mentioning that all papers in central china were published in the last decade in this sense most drylands of the world are poorly explored particularly those in africa except the canary is and southern and central asia interception throughfall and stemflow were significantly affected by rainfall in a gradient from 145 to 805 mm year 1 fig 3 along the increasing rainfall gradient interception showed a tendency to decrease from 27 1 to 18 9 p 0 12 throughfall increased from 61 4 to 81 2 p 0 01 and stemflow decreased from 10 0 to 1 6 p 0 0001 fig 3a stemflow was the most sensitive flux to rainfall decreasing its mean value 6 25 times through a gradient of 660 mm year 1 from 145 to 805 mm year 1 while throughfall was the least sensitive increasing 32 in the same conditions when rainfall partitioning was analyzed as an absolute amount of water mm throughfall and interception increased with the increment of rainfall p 0 0001 in both cases while stemflow remained constant throughout the rainfall gradient averaging 29 mm fig 3b life form conditioned rainfall partitioning shrubs displayed significantly higher stemflow than trees 9 4 vs 3 5 respectively p 0 0001 table 2 and trees presented higher throughfall than shrubs 72 3 vs 63 0 respectively p 0 05 notably no differences were found in terms of interception averaging 24 for shrubs and trees when both life forms were compared at similar rainfall conditions from 273 to 723 mm year 1 no trees were found below the first value and no shrubs were found above the second value shrubs also achieved significantly higher stemflow values than trees 7 6 vs 3 4 respectively p 0 0001 regarding bark types species with smooth barks achieved twice the stemflow values of those with rough barks 8 3 vs 4 2 p 0 0001 it should be noted that 83 of shrubs presented smooth bark textures while in trees this percentage was only 31 phenology and leaf type had no significant effect on interception throughfall and stemflow p 0 05 table 2 notably stemflow of shrubs and trees presented no significant relation with the rainfall gradient p 0 08 and p 0 14 for shrubs and trees respectively fig 4 a it is important to mention that the fig 4a was configured using the same data of fig 3a and the only difference was the disaggregation of the life form shrubs were more abundant towards drier sites whereas trees predominated towards the more subhumid ones as shown in the frequency distribution analysis fig 4b so the higher stemflow found towards the dry edge of the rainfall gradient fig 3a was caused by the higher abundance of shrubs fig 4 which generated more stemflow than trees table 2 4 discussion rainfall partitioning affects the spatial distribution of water entering into the soil deeply controlling net primary productivity in drylands based on the 46 papers surveyed and organized along an increasing rainfall gradient we found that stemflow proportion decreased whereas throughfall proportion increased fig 3 the increment of the stemflow towards drier sites was caused by the higher abundance of shrubs that generated more stemflow than trees table 2 and fig 4 in this line species with smooth barks presented higher stemflow probably due to the greater abundance of smooth barked shrubs while phenology and leaf type had no effect on rainfall partitioning table 2 previous studies demonstrated that stemflow is mainly controlled by rainfall characteristics and plant morphological attributes more specifically stemflow increases with larger rainfall events yang et al 2008 yuan et al 2016 and in plant species with a higher number of stems as well as a lower angle of stem insertion levia and frost 2003 zhang et al 2017a although it is not clear which of these two biophysical controls on rainfall partitioning exerts a more important role our findings suggested that the plant morphological attributes prevail shrubs commonly have more than one stem next to the soil surface which are vertically oriented looking like an inverted cone martinez meza and whitford 1996 li et al 2008 zhang et al 2015b on the contrary trees commonly present one dominant stem or trunk with branches horizontally orientated such as pinus spp or in different directions such as quercus spp crockford and richardson 2000 richardson and rejmánek 2011 molina and del campo 2012 bialkowski and buttle 2015 looking like a cone and a sphere respectively so there are three main canopy forms that could explain the effects of plant morphological attributes on stemflow generation fig 5 in the case of shrubs the combination of canopy form and root induced preferential flow described as double funneling process johnson and lehmann 2006 would be a critical mechanism that maximize the flow of water close to roots in deeper soil layers therefore they may provide an adaptative advantage to survive in water stressed periods whitford et al 1997 reynolds et al 1999 so far rainfall partitioning was largely explored on isolated species and or specific sites making difficult not only the identification of general patterns but also the extrapolation of data between sites this study was focused on determining the global patterns and on identifying their main biophysical controls of rainfall partitioning e g mean annual rainfall plant morphological attributes we considered that the linear regression models fitted fig 3 would be useful to simulate water inputs in dry sites where interception losses and stemflow generation data is seldom available in addition we think that next step to continue exploring rainfall partitioning in drylands could be by assessing the effect of event size and or rainfall intensity moreover relating rainfall with other physical attributes such as temperature air humidity and wind direction and speed would open the need of future investigations for instance we did not find significant trends for interception throughfall and stemflow along mean annual temperature gradient p 0 05 in all the cases data not shown however based on our results field observations and laboratory experiments levia and frost 2003 garcia estringana et al 2010 we hypothesize that the water storage capacity of different bark roughness together with the size and intensity of rainfall events would be very important in determining the ratio between interception losses and stemflow generation in drylands 5 conclusions we showed a global synthesis and a meta analysis of field studies that assessed rainfall partitioning in drylands we found that on average interception throughfall and stemflow accounted for 24 0 69 8 and 6 2 of total rainfall respectively stemflow was the most variable flux along an increasing rainfall gradient stemflow proportion decreased whereas throughfall proportion increased the increment in the stemflow towards drier sites was caused by the higher abundance of shrubs that generate more stemflow than trees these findings highlighted the ecohydrological key role of vegetation life form and rainfall inputs affecting the amount of water entering into the soil and its spatial distribution in drylands

6839,streamflow is typically divided into two components for hydrograph separation quickflow and baseflow baseflow is the portion of streamflow that contains groundwater flow and flow from other delayed sources and is of key importance for river basin ecology and water resources planning and management the baseflow index bfi is defined as the ratio of long term mean baseflow to total streamflow knowledge of the bfi is not directly available for ungauged catchments and hence for most of the terrestrial land surface in this study the bfi was determined for all river reaches in new zealand first a recursive digital filtering technique was applied to separate baseflow from total streamflow for 482 gauged sites across new zealand whereby an individual filter parameter was determined for each catchment based on the baseflow and total streamflow data the long term bfi for each gauged site was determined as well as seasonal values of bfi bfi varies between 0 20 and 0 96 with an average of 0 53 which indicates that 53 of long term streamflow in new zealand is likely to originate from groundwater discharge and other delayed sources long term bfi values for all river reaches that comprise the new zealand river network were predicted using the random forest technique furthermore the winter to summer bfi for all river reaches in new zealand were also determined distinct spatial patterns of the bfi were identified while the spatial distribution and the magnitude of the bfi was determined by a combination of factors certain patterns can be attributed to geological formations in new zealand namely the volcanic plateau region and the southern alps while the dataset determined in this work can support work specifically pertaining to water resources planning and management in new zealand in particular water supply stream ecology and pollution risk the methodology devised to calculate the bfi for gauged sites and to predict the bfi for ungauged sites is applicable to any region around the world keywords baseflow quickflow prediction bfi random forests technique 1 introduction water resources planning and management decisions need to be based on reliable hydrological data one challenge for hydrologists is to provide planners and decision makers with accurate information regarding the components of streamflow hydrographs streamflow separation is one example of how these components can be represented streamflow is typically divided into two components for hydrograph separation quickflow or stormflow as in bosch et al 2017 and baseflow whereby quickflow contains true surface runoff and the quickflow portion of interflow while baseflow contains groundwater flow the portion of interflow moving slowly through the subsoil and flow from other delayed sources tallaksen 1995 bosch et al 2017 singh and stenger 2018 baseflow sustains streamflow between storm events and during low rainfall periods delleur 1999 lott and stewart 2016 baseflow is critical for regulating seasonal distribution of river flows sustaining aquatic habitats and stabilizing water supplies fan et al 2013 gan et al 2015 and at the same time being critical for the transport of both nutrients and chemicals hence separation of streamflow hydrographs into quickflow and baseflow can vastly improve our understanding of streamflow and chemical transport schilling 2002 santhi et al 2008 because surface runoff moves rapidly into the stream while baseflow moves more slowly through the soil matrix separating and understanding these two processes is fundamental to improving our knowledge about the hydrologic and water quality effects of many watershed processes bosch et al 2017 and to develop appropriate water quantity and water quality management strategies in general santhi et al 2008 examples are the relationship between baseflow or the baseflow index bfi and nitrate or between bfi and dissolved organic carbon which is of particularly high importance in agricultural landscapes heppell et al 2017 further water resources management areas where knowledge of the baseflow regime is crucial are aquatic ecosystem preservation hydropower generation and low flow forecasting beck et al 2013 the bfi is the ratio of the baseflow volume to total flow volume over a specified time period e g nathan and mcmahon 1990 smakhtin 2001 ladson et al 2013 longobardi and villani 2008 expressed as fraction or percentage it is determined after the hydrograph separation has been completed the bfi depends on climatic and physiographic characteristics of catchments beck et al 2013 within any given catchment it can vary as the vadose zone within the watershed changes in water content as a function of varying levels of evapotranspiration and aquifer storage bosch et al 2017 in general flow regimes which comprise a comparably large number of floods and low baseflows are highly variable and have low bfi values the opposite applies to stable flow regimes mfe 1998 the bfi has been determined in many hydrological studies around the globe to support regional low flow studies to map recharge and discharge zones in a spatially explicit manner to investigate the impact of climate change on groundwater resources and to relate flood response of catchments to storm events farquharson et al 2015 various methods have been proposed for quantifying the baseflow component and to separate it from total streamflow reviews are provided in hall 1968 tallaksen 1995 arnold and allen 1999 chapman 1999 smakhtin 2001 brodie and hostetler 2005 eckhardt 2008 gonzales et al 2009 graszkiewicz et al 2011 techniques typically fall into the categories manual graphical automated filtering and tracer based methods stewart 2015 bosch et al 2017 the most widely used methods of separating a stream hydrograph into two components baseflow and quickflow are analytical filtering or smoothing methods lott and stewart 2016 in general such methods do not reflect underlying hydrological processes but aim to generate an objective repeatable and easily automated method to derive baseflow response of a catchment bosch et al 2017 the next challenge is to transfer the knowledge from gauged to ungauged catchments in order to provide baseflow and baseflow index values across landscapes to support management of river catchments such knowledge is not directly available for ungauged catchments and hence for most of the terrestrial land surface fekete and vörösmarty 2007 robust techniques to estimate accurate baseflow and bfi values at ungauged sites are required in order to achieve continuously improved data coverage based on a review of studies zhang et al 2013 conclude that regression models have the advantage of being implemented relatively easily to estimate baseflow with reasonable accuracy at ungauged catchments beck et al 2013 report that attempts to estimate bfi using multivariate linear models gave poor results and hence artificial neural networks were used in their study to estimate bfi globally santhi et al 2008 applied inverse distance weighting to the bfi values determined from gauging sites to produce a bfi grip map of the conterminous united states the goal of the current study is to devise a generally applicable methodology to determine the bfi in ungauged basins and specifically to determine the bfi at national level for every river reach across new zealand the specific objectives are to i determine the bfi for all currently available gauged sites in new zealand and to ii predict the bfi for all ungauged river reaches across new zealand both the long term mean bfi and the seasonal bfi are considered in this study the latter specifically since irrigation demand in some farmland areas is particularly high during summer booker 2018 and water availability varies throughout the year 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area and data in this work data from the currently available 482 gauged catchments across new zealand the same flow time series at daily time step as those previously used by mcmillan et al 2016 to test their national hydrological model were used fig 1 the time series were chosen to cover at least 5 years the catchment area varies from 0 3 to 6600 km2 the catchments ranged between order 1 and order 7 of the strahler classification with the majority of catchments being order 5 new zealand catchments represent a very wide range of hydrological conditions with different topography geology soil type land cover and land use mosley 1981 however the majority of the catchments are rural with only minor urbanised areas the main land uses are dairy and sheep farming and forestry mean daily runoff data were obtained from the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa and various regional councils see booker and woods 2014 for more details of these gauging stations daily temperature and precipitation were available from the new zealand s virtual climate station network tait et al 2006 the digital river network was taken from the river environment classification rec snelder and biggs 2002 and land cover and soils data were retrieved from the land cover database and land resource inventory newsome et al 2000 furthermore a digital elevation model at 30 m resolution was utilised 2 2 baseflow separation baseflow originates from rainfall and or snowmelt which infiltrates into the subsurface and eventually discharges to streams methods for quantifying and predicting baseflow separation from total streamflow are critical to better manage water resources for example decisions regarding water extraction from the groundwater stores may affect baseflow and in turn potentially alter total streamflow with further possible effects on freshwater ecosystems booker et al 2016 arnold et al 1995 the choice of techniques applied to separate baseflow tends to affect the results and since the true baseflow contribution is not known the choice of techniques remains somewhat subjective beck et al 2013 partington et al 2012 indicated that no baseflow separation methods are clearly superior to the others as the performance varies with different soil types antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall events hence the present study did not attempt to investigate superiority of any baseflow separation technique here baseflow was separated from streamflow using the lyne and hollick recursive digital filter method originally used in signal processing lyne and hollick 1979 this method has been adopted for baseflow separation by nathan and mcmahon 1990 is considered easy to automate objective and repeatable nathan and mcmahon 1991 arnold and allen 1999 provides smooth time series eckhardt 2008 and has been applied successfully in a large number of studies see e g arnold et al 2000 santhi et al 2008 ladson et al 2013 who list and discuss applications of the method and zhang et al 2017b zhang et al 2017b assess four baseflow separation methods the united kingdom institute of hydrology ukih method and three digital filtering methods through a comparison with tracer based hydrograph separation and subsequent bfi calculation for five catchments in eastern australia the one parameter methods by lyne hollick nathan and mcmahon 1990 and by chapman maxwell chapman and maxwell 1996 chapman 1999 as well as the two parameter method by eckhardt 2005 the authors report that it was critical to obtain appropriate parameter s before applying the digital filtering methods while the results of the four methods do not differ substantially once the parameter s have been identified zhang et al 2017b recommend the lyne hollick method the basic principle of the method is to separate the high frequency signal surface runoff and the low frequency signal baseflow of the total stream flow record the digital filter equation according to nathan and mcmahon 1990 is 1 q f t α q f t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 for q f t 0 0 otherwise where q is the original streamflow volume time qf is the quickflow volume time α is the filter parameter and t is the time step we followed the standard approach to baseflow separation by ladson et al 2013 applying three filter passes the filter parameter α has been determined for each catchment based on the work by henderson et al 2004 and booker and woods 2014 through assessment of the recession behaviour of the available measured hydrograph time series in brief the recession formula put forth by brutsaert and nieber 1977 was scaled by a reference flow 2 dq dt q b t 0 where the scaled flow is defined as 3 q q q 0 and t0 time is defined as 4 t 0 q 0 1 b a the reference flow q0 was determined as the median of the measured flow and a m3 1 b t2 b and b are parameters for each gauged site t0 and b were determined by geometric regression from 5 l o g d q dt b l o g q l o g t 0 details can be found in the references provided following zhang et al 2017b we estimate α for each gauged site as 6 α e x p 1 t 0 the baseflow qb is calculated by 7 q b t q t q f t the baseflow was separated from daily flow series and then the bfi was calculated at a daily time step then the bfi values were averaged over the entire time period the seasonal bfi values were determined by first calculating the bfi for the entire time series then split into seasons and finally the bfi was averaged for each season lastly since summer demands for irrigation are higher than in winter with potential consequences on aquifers streamflow and ecosystems the winter to summer ratio of bfi was calculated as the ratio of the average winter bfi to the average summer bfi 2 3 spatial bfi prediction the regression approach random forests was employed to predict the bfi at ungauged locations by regressing bfi as a function of catchment characteristics spatial patterns in several hydrological indices have previously been successfully predicted from catchment characteristics using random forest regression models these indices include lake water levels flow intermittence low flow characteristics mean flow flow variability seasonality and characteristics of flow duration curves booker and snelder 2012 booker 2013 booker and woods 2014 li et al 2016 snelder et al 2013a longobardi and villani 2008 random forests rf are a machine learning ensemble regression technique that relate a response to a set of predictors whilst incorporating non linear and interacting relationships by repeatedly growing decision trees random forest thereby combine many regression trees into an ensemble to produce more accurate regressions by drawing several bootstrap samples from the original training data and fitting a tree to each sample hastie et al 2009 full details are provided by breiman 2001 cutler et al 2007 and ellis et al 2012 essentially a rf is comprised of many trees each tree is grown by repeatedly selecting a bootstrap sample an independent sample selected with replacement of the training data each split within a tree represents a value of a predictor the combination of predictor and split is derived such that it leads to the smallest total impurity defined as the sum of squared deviations about the group mean splitting occurs repeatedly until a minimum number of observations in the partition is attained at which point the partition becomes a terminal node of the tree trees that do not include a particular data point in their bootstrap sample are labelled the out of bag oob set of trees with respect to that data point predictions that are independent from each data point labelled oob predictions are the averages of all response values from the bootstrap sample that fall in each terminal node for each tree subsequently averaged over all trees that did not include the data point of interest within their training data these oob samples can therefore be used to assess model predictive performance independently from the fitted data and to calculate the importance of each predictor e g booker and snelder 2012 importance is calculated as the increase in mean square prediction error when each predictor is randomly permuted and is based on the oob samples importance represents the contribution to accuracy of independent predictions for each predictor and is equivalent to the increase in error when a term is dropped from a linear model rf predictions of the response resulting from a new set of predictor values representing new locations new environmental conditions or potential future states are calculated as the average of all observed values that fall in each terminal node for each tree averaged over all trees derived this method provided estimates for all reaches that comprise the new zealand river network as the number of trees within an rf increases the generalisation error always converges and it was assumed that use of 500 trees was sufficiently high to ensure convergence thanh noi and kappas 2018 in several previous booker and snelder 2012 booker 2013 booker and woods 2014 snelder et al 2013b studies hydrological indices were predicted from data describing catchment physical properties relating to hydrological regimes available from a variety of national scale sources including a digital river network river environment classification snelder and biggs 2002 30 m digital elevation model and land cover and soils databases land cover database land resource inventory newsome et al 2000 a similar approach was applied here to predict bfi and winter to summer bfi while random forest regression is a purely empirical approach that does not explicitly include any physical processes only variables that could be linked to bfi using a physical basis were applied as predictors table 1 number of high intensity rain days and variability in rainfall were included to represent variability in rainfall at two different time scales catchment elevation was included as a proxy indicator for the influence of climate on the hydrograph shape upstream average slope was added due to its effect on the hydrograph shape and infiltration catchment area affects flow magnitude and timing and was hence included potential evaporation included as a predictor to represent its influence on low flow behaviour and the steepness of recession limbs geological category and average particle size of underlying geology complement the set of variables to represent the timing and nature of sub surface flows the distribution of each predictor variable for gauged sites are shown in fig 2 the shape of these distributions varies between the predictor variables for example particle size of the rocks a variable reflecting flow paths and infiltration capacity has a rather flat distribution with a distinct peak further transformation of predictors was not applied since random forests are invariant to monotonic transformations of the predictors de ath and fabricius 2000 fig 3 provides an overview of the analysis steps applied in this study the available streamflow time series form the basis for which the baseflow is separated from total streamflow using the lyne and hollick recursive digital filter method to then determine the bfi for the entire time period averaged and for the entire time period for each season random forests regression was then applied to predict the long term average bfi and the winter to summer bfi ratio for each reach within the new zealand national river network 2 4 evaluation of performance oob predictions from random forests models were used to assess model performance this cross validation procedure was applied to test spatial predictions as if each site was ungauged this is the same procedure applied by mcmillan et al 2016 and is similar to a leave one out cross validation procedure because it can be used to assess both the robustness and reliability for estimation at ungauged sites castellarin et al 2004 ganora et al 2009 following the approach laid out by moriasi et al 2007 predictive performance of oob predictions was quantified by calculating the coefficient of linear determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 root mean square error gupta et al 1999 and percent bias legates and mccabe 1999 these performance metrics were applied across all 482 observed sites but also applied separately to various groupings of the data to allow assessment of model performance across contrasting hydrological conditions as defined by snelder and biggs 2002 such as topographic setting table 2 climatic or landcover conditions 3 results 3 1 bfi for gauged sites across new zealand the long term average bfi values for 482 gauged sites across new zealand are shown in fig 4 bfi values were generally found to be higher 0 8 0 96 for the centre north regions of the north island of new zealand e g the bay of plenty region and south west thereof and parts of the centre along the main divide the southern alps and centre east regions of the south island e g parts of canterbury 0 7 0 96 the bay of plenty and parts south west thereof are in the volcanic plateau region which may result in comparably low surface flow the eastern coastline of the north island has consistently low values in the 0 2 0 4 range and the same holds for the auckland region and the northernmost part of the north island comparably low values are found in the nelson region of the south island and in parts of the east coast of the south island the seasonal bfi was estimated for all available gauged sites and shown in fig 5 while the spatial patterns for spring september october november summer december january february fall march april may and winter june july august are similar the magnitudes differ the lowest bfi values overall were found to occur during fall it remains challenging to clearly explain what defines a certain bfi value as multiple factors some of which vary greatly throughout the year e g precipitation vegetation evapotranspiration influence the bfi however it can be noted that for all seasons the central volcanic plateau region on the north island has the highest bfi values 3 2 bfi for ungauged sites across new zealand 3 2 1 power of predictors the eight predictors to determine the long term average bfi and the bfi winter to summer ratio for ungauged sites were assessed in terms of their importance fig 6 shows the relative importance of each of the predictors the pattern in importance varied between the two cases of average bfi and the winter to summer ratio of bfi which is expected many predictors were of similar importance for average bfi except catchment elevation which was by far the most important predictor catchment elevation was also the most important predictor for winter to summer ratio of bfi bi variate partial plots are shown in fig 7 to describe patterns between predictors and both long term average bfi and the winter to summer ratio of bfi the bfi was predicted to be greatest in alluvial and volcanic catchments with comparably large elevation and low number of rainfall days greater than 10 mm the predictive behaviour is overall similar for alluvial and volcanic catchments whereas it differs for the other two categories hard and soft sedimentary catchments in both distribution and magnitude for the bfi winter to summer ratio all four cases are similar regarding the general predictive behaviour while the ratio is found highest for the hard sedimentary and volcanic category it peaks for all four at mid range values of rain days greater than 10 mm and elevation 3 2 2 validation the assessment of the performance of oob predictions for long term average bfi and winter to summer ratio of bfi wintertosummer for all sites and sites split by various classifications is summarised in table 3 for the long term bfi the coefficient of determination r2 is overall satisfactory lower values are observed for the categories lakefed mountain warm extremely wet and scrub which represent smaller subsets of the overall number of sites the results are similar for the winter to summer ratio of bfi with the difference that the landcover categories bare and urban do show lower values as well nash sutcliffe efficiency values are in line with the coefficient of determination results the root mean square deviation rmsd is overall 0 08 for both bfi variables the percent bias pbias provides a fourth performance metric categories with poor performance for r2 nse and rmsd also show relatively larger biases in fig 8 the oob validation for all sites is presented visually the overall agreement between out of bag blind cross validation as if each site were ungauged predicted and observed values is satisfactory indicating good ability to distinguish between site patterns across the observed dataset the categories that were identified in table 3 to have lower predictive performance can be seen clearly in fig 9 as they do not follow the 1 1 line as closely as the bulk of the data points this is illustrated in fig 9 for the category topography 3 2 3 long term average bfi and bfi winter to summer ratio the new zealand wide generalised long term average bfi values for all river reaches of the rec v1 of order 2 and greater are shown in fig 10 from this country wide analysis the spatial differentiation in bfi values can clearly be identified the volcanic plateau region where a large part is characterised by very permeable quaternary volcanic deposits clausen and pearson 1995 has the highest bfi values on the north island the lowest bfi values country wide are found in coastal regions of the north island in particular on the east coast where gravel sand mud and sandstone are dominant similar observations can be made for the northernmost tip of the north island the auckland region and for the south island in the nelson region and the gore bay region in canterbury the west and east coast of the south island are separated by the southern alps and clearly the west coast of the south island has lower values throughout when compared to the east coast this was also observed by clausen and pearson 1995 who analysed bfi results by hutchinson 1983 and attribute this to the west coast geology which is dominated by plutonic igneous rocks to the north and metamorphosed rocks to the south plus the main land cover in the region dense rain forest clausen and pearson 1995 the geology in the east coast region differs significantly from the west coast with triassic greywacke argillite and sandstone the vegetation is mainly grass and the terrain rapidly transitions from mountains to lowlands between the southern alps and the ocean these combined may at least in part lead to the observed decreasing overall bfi values between the main divide and the coastal region this was also observed by clausen and pearson 1995 while in some situations bfi values and their spatial distribution may coincide with for example a certain terrain feature it must be noted that in general the influences on the bfi are complex and considering a single aspect may lead to erroneous conclusions this was also noted by ahiablame et al 2013 who state in their work on bfi in indiana usa that the northern heavily drained region tended to have slightly higher bfi values compared to the remainder of indiana indicating that increasing baseflow may be affected by water storage for example created by tile drainage or natural storage or the combination of both considering this direct dependence of baseflow on geology and precipitation would be less likely the generalised winter to summer bfi values also show a distinct pattern fig 11 while the north island has high winter to summer bfi values except for regions along the east coast the southern island has comparably lower winter to summer bfi values throughout whereby the lowest values are found along the southern alps 4 discussion the baseflow index is an important hydrological index for various water resources planning and management tasks for example baseflow reflects the connection to groundwater and it comprises the majority of the total flow volume in rivers with stable flow regimes in the absence of any restrictions to water abstraction locations with higher baseflow would be expected to be more vulnerable to significant reduction in their flow regimes resulting from groundwater abstractions at the same time surface water abstraction from a river with variable flow regimes will result in large reductions relative to natural flows during low flow periods and very small relative reductions at times of high flow similarly flood flows comprise the majority of the total flow volume in rivers with variable flow regimes and therefore the natural flow volume may not be significantly reduced by water abstraction knowledge of baseflow and the baseflow index can hence support water resources planning and management in areas such as water supply stream ecology and pollution risk other scholars have determined bfi values for a number of gauged catchments in new zealand with successive prediction of bfi for ungauged catchments hutchinson 1983 applied an approach developed by the institute of hydrology of the uk institute of hydrology 1980 to predict the bfi for ungauged catchments in new zealand thereby mainly relying on geology as described above we found that the relative magnitude had a similar spatial distribution when compared to the current work jowett and duncan 1990 determined flow variability indices bfi coefficient of variation of flow ratio of mean to median flow mean annual maximum flow divided by median flow mean annual minimum divided by median flow coefficient of variation of annual maximum flows and coefficient of variation of annual minimum flows for 130 flow recording sites for catchments across new zealand and classified these sites into six groups based on flow variability while the main aim of their work was to link flow variability to in stream habitat and biota it provided a rudimentary means to estimate the bfi for sites where no flow record was available simply by establishing baseflow indices for other rivers close to those studied considering that jowett and duncan 1990 assessed a smaller dataset than the current study we find where a comparison is feasible that our predicted patterns in bfi corresponded well to those described by jowett and duncan 1990 the recent comprehensive study by beck et al 2013 2015 resulted in a rich dataset whereby the authors used observed streamflow data from 3394 small to medium sized catchments 10 10 000 km2 around the globe to train neural network ensembles to then estimate 17 streamflow characteristics at 0 125 resolution including four different estimates of bfi based on climate and physiographic characteristics of the catchments while this dataset spans new zealand a comparison with the results obtained in the current study was not attempted as the four different bfi datasets provided by beck et al 2013 2015 are highly correlated but show systematic differences beck et al 2015 and it is hence not clear which dataset one should choose for a comparison lastly another option suggested is to determine bfi in a given secondary ungauged stream based on observed data in a primary catchment according to griffiths and mckerchar 2015 the concurrent base flow gauging technique is a method of good accuracy for estimating low flow statistics or potentially to derive a synthetic continuous flow record for the secondary unmonitored sites it involves the establishment of a well defined linear regression between concurrent flows at a primary site having a continuous long term flow record and a secondary site having just very limited gauging data according to the authors the primary and secondary sites should be located in catchments having similar hydrologic and physiographic characteristics the regression is then used to predict flow statistics at a secondary site given prescribed values at a primary site here long term bfi values and the bfi winter to summer ratio for all river reaches across new zealand have been determined based on the most complete streamflow dataset available to date for new zealand the resulting dataset may be utilised in support of water resources planning and management decisions for example in their study focussing on three geographical regions in new zealand clausen and pearson 1995 pointed out that a baseflow index integrating the influence of various physical and climatic catchment characteristics on hydrographs was useful in regionalising the mean annual maximum severity and the log normal distributions allowing estimation of extreme droughts and droughts in ungauged catchments in other work clausen et al 1999 highlight the importance of the process of denitrification in riparian zones in preventing high agriculture sourced nitrate loads from entering and polluting rivers and they found that denitrification enzyme activity and bfi were identified to be weakly related with higher dea rates in upstream subcatchments of the 114 km2 study catchment in denmark where the mean flow and bfi are low high proportion of quickflow various other studies also highlight the importance of baseflow for transport schilling and zhang 2004 examine a long record of streamflow and nitrate concentration data from the raccoon river watershed in west central iowa usa to find that nitrate nitrogen export contributes to impairment of downstream water quality baseflow contributed approximately two thirds 17 3 kg ha of the mean annual nitrate export 26 1 kg ha study results demonstrate the utility of assessing the baseflow contribution to nitrate loads to identify appropriate control strategies for reducing baseflow delivery of nitrate in the study by zhu et al 2011 on non point nitrogen loss from mixed land use catchment the majority of no3 n about 75 and total n about 65 were exported in baseflow which contributed about 64 of the total flow in an average year and had greater flow weighted mean no3 n concentration 5 6 mg l 1 than storm flow 3 4 mg l 1 the authors conclude that management practices to reduce n loss from this watershed should target periods of baseflow when no3 n and total n concentrations are greater before and after the crop growing season and target areas along the stream where seeps are present perhaps including perennial plant species in localized riparian buffers and introducing cover crops on the agricultural land during the fallow season hence a detailed dataset on the baseflow index such as the one determined in the work presented here can help to address various water resources planning and management issues note that the importance of higher time resolution and seasonal aspects have been stressed by for example schilling and zhang 2004 who identified that baseflow transport was greatest in spring and late fall when baseflow contributed more than 80 of the total export seasonal patterns of the bfi identified the strong link between the baseflow nitrate loads and seasonal crop nitrogen requirements farquharson et al 2015 reported that international studies have shown that that in tropical climates the bfi is heavily influenced by the seasonal climate regime high index values may be observed downstream of glaciers hisdal et al 2004 found that in snow dominated catchments it is useful to calculate bfi from the period without snow that is to calculate annual summer bfi hence next to the long term bfi seasonal bfi can provide additional useful information for water resources planning and management here the focus was placed on the winter to summer ratio of bfi as water abstractions are largest during the summer months in new zealand while precipitation amounts are higher during winter months although the regression approach applied was purely empirical eight predictor variables that could be linked to bfi using a physical basis were applied the same eight predictor variables were used to predict long term average bfi and the winter to summer bfi ratio to simplify the analysis after having trailed various combinations of other available predictor variables with little or no increase in predictive performance procedures designed to optimise the set of independent variables e g murphy et al 2010 genuer et al 2010 were not applied the combination of a digital recursive filter for baseflow separation and random forest regression is a promising tool to predict baseflow for ungauged catchments in particular when an individual filter parameter for each stream is identified either through field studies or as was employed here by analysis of the recession characteristics of the flow time series note that cheng et al 2016 devised a method for objective determination of the recession constant based on the approach put forth by brutsaert and nieber 1977 successfully applied by zhang et al 2017a b to baseflow analysis of catchments across australia 5 summary and conclusions a recursive digital filtering technique to separate baseflow from total streamflow whereby an individual filter parameter for each stream has been estimated from the recession behaviour has been combined with the random forest regression technique to predict the long term baseflow index for every river reach of the new zealand river network furthermore the seasonal bfi and the ratio of winter to summer bfi for all river reaches have been determined distinct spatial patterns of the bfi were identified bfi values are highest in the volcanic plateau region of the north island on the south island the highest values are found along the southern alps the main divide between the east and the west coast the eastern coastal regions of the north island the auckland region the northernmost part of the north island the nelson region and parts of the east coast of the south island exhibit the lowest bfi values these regions are characterised by gravel sand and sandstone the winter to summer bfi ratio also exhibited a distinct spatial pattern future work can potentially utilise such data to assess specific hydrological questions and to support work pertaining to water resources planning and management the results indicate that 53 of streamflow in new zealand is sustained by groundwater and other delayed sources we agree with ahiablame et al 2013 who found a 60 contribution for sites in indiana usa that for such a substantial contribution an improved understanding of pollutant transport in baseflow is required in order to adequately manage of water resources and improve water quality therefore one crucial application of the method presented here is to elucidate water flow and contaminant transfer through catchments this can be accomplished by establishing a relationship of bfi and streamflow contaminant concentrations since groundwater is an important source for both drinking water and irrigation not only in new zealand but several countries worldwide a second water management aspect that can be informed with the current work is the effect of water withdrawal from aquifers on baseflow the implications for streamflow that follow and in turn the consequences for the ecosystem conflict of interest the authors declared

6839,streamflow is typically divided into two components for hydrograph separation quickflow and baseflow baseflow is the portion of streamflow that contains groundwater flow and flow from other delayed sources and is of key importance for river basin ecology and water resources planning and management the baseflow index bfi is defined as the ratio of long term mean baseflow to total streamflow knowledge of the bfi is not directly available for ungauged catchments and hence for most of the terrestrial land surface in this study the bfi was determined for all river reaches in new zealand first a recursive digital filtering technique was applied to separate baseflow from total streamflow for 482 gauged sites across new zealand whereby an individual filter parameter was determined for each catchment based on the baseflow and total streamflow data the long term bfi for each gauged site was determined as well as seasonal values of bfi bfi varies between 0 20 and 0 96 with an average of 0 53 which indicates that 53 of long term streamflow in new zealand is likely to originate from groundwater discharge and other delayed sources long term bfi values for all river reaches that comprise the new zealand river network were predicted using the random forest technique furthermore the winter to summer bfi for all river reaches in new zealand were also determined distinct spatial patterns of the bfi were identified while the spatial distribution and the magnitude of the bfi was determined by a combination of factors certain patterns can be attributed to geological formations in new zealand namely the volcanic plateau region and the southern alps while the dataset determined in this work can support work specifically pertaining to water resources planning and management in new zealand in particular water supply stream ecology and pollution risk the methodology devised to calculate the bfi for gauged sites and to predict the bfi for ungauged sites is applicable to any region around the world keywords baseflow quickflow prediction bfi random forests technique 1 introduction water resources planning and management decisions need to be based on reliable hydrological data one challenge for hydrologists is to provide planners and decision makers with accurate information regarding the components of streamflow hydrographs streamflow separation is one example of how these components can be represented streamflow is typically divided into two components for hydrograph separation quickflow or stormflow as in bosch et al 2017 and baseflow whereby quickflow contains true surface runoff and the quickflow portion of interflow while baseflow contains groundwater flow the portion of interflow moving slowly through the subsoil and flow from other delayed sources tallaksen 1995 bosch et al 2017 singh and stenger 2018 baseflow sustains streamflow between storm events and during low rainfall periods delleur 1999 lott and stewart 2016 baseflow is critical for regulating seasonal distribution of river flows sustaining aquatic habitats and stabilizing water supplies fan et al 2013 gan et al 2015 and at the same time being critical for the transport of both nutrients and chemicals hence separation of streamflow hydrographs into quickflow and baseflow can vastly improve our understanding of streamflow and chemical transport schilling 2002 santhi et al 2008 because surface runoff moves rapidly into the stream while baseflow moves more slowly through the soil matrix separating and understanding these two processes is fundamental to improving our knowledge about the hydrologic and water quality effects of many watershed processes bosch et al 2017 and to develop appropriate water quantity and water quality management strategies in general santhi et al 2008 examples are the relationship between baseflow or the baseflow index bfi and nitrate or between bfi and dissolved organic carbon which is of particularly high importance in agricultural landscapes heppell et al 2017 further water resources management areas where knowledge of the baseflow regime is crucial are aquatic ecosystem preservation hydropower generation and low flow forecasting beck et al 2013 the bfi is the ratio of the baseflow volume to total flow volume over a specified time period e g nathan and mcmahon 1990 smakhtin 2001 ladson et al 2013 longobardi and villani 2008 expressed as fraction or percentage it is determined after the hydrograph separation has been completed the bfi depends on climatic and physiographic characteristics of catchments beck et al 2013 within any given catchment it can vary as the vadose zone within the watershed changes in water content as a function of varying levels of evapotranspiration and aquifer storage bosch et al 2017 in general flow regimes which comprise a comparably large number of floods and low baseflows are highly variable and have low bfi values the opposite applies to stable flow regimes mfe 1998 the bfi has been determined in many hydrological studies around the globe to support regional low flow studies to map recharge and discharge zones in a spatially explicit manner to investigate the impact of climate change on groundwater resources and to relate flood response of catchments to storm events farquharson et al 2015 various methods have been proposed for quantifying the baseflow component and to separate it from total streamflow reviews are provided in hall 1968 tallaksen 1995 arnold and allen 1999 chapman 1999 smakhtin 2001 brodie and hostetler 2005 eckhardt 2008 gonzales et al 2009 graszkiewicz et al 2011 techniques typically fall into the categories manual graphical automated filtering and tracer based methods stewart 2015 bosch et al 2017 the most widely used methods of separating a stream hydrograph into two components baseflow and quickflow are analytical filtering or smoothing methods lott and stewart 2016 in general such methods do not reflect underlying hydrological processes but aim to generate an objective repeatable and easily automated method to derive baseflow response of a catchment bosch et al 2017 the next challenge is to transfer the knowledge from gauged to ungauged catchments in order to provide baseflow and baseflow index values across landscapes to support management of river catchments such knowledge is not directly available for ungauged catchments and hence for most of the terrestrial land surface fekete and vörösmarty 2007 robust techniques to estimate accurate baseflow and bfi values at ungauged sites are required in order to achieve continuously improved data coverage based on a review of studies zhang et al 2013 conclude that regression models have the advantage of being implemented relatively easily to estimate baseflow with reasonable accuracy at ungauged catchments beck et al 2013 report that attempts to estimate bfi using multivariate linear models gave poor results and hence artificial neural networks were used in their study to estimate bfi globally santhi et al 2008 applied inverse distance weighting to the bfi values determined from gauging sites to produce a bfi grip map of the conterminous united states the goal of the current study is to devise a generally applicable methodology to determine the bfi in ungauged basins and specifically to determine the bfi at national level for every river reach across new zealand the specific objectives are to i determine the bfi for all currently available gauged sites in new zealand and to ii predict the bfi for all ungauged river reaches across new zealand both the long term mean bfi and the seasonal bfi are considered in this study the latter specifically since irrigation demand in some farmland areas is particularly high during summer booker 2018 and water availability varies throughout the year 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area and data in this work data from the currently available 482 gauged catchments across new zealand the same flow time series at daily time step as those previously used by mcmillan et al 2016 to test their national hydrological model were used fig 1 the time series were chosen to cover at least 5 years the catchment area varies from 0 3 to 6600 km2 the catchments ranged between order 1 and order 7 of the strahler classification with the majority of catchments being order 5 new zealand catchments represent a very wide range of hydrological conditions with different topography geology soil type land cover and land use mosley 1981 however the majority of the catchments are rural with only minor urbanised areas the main land uses are dairy and sheep farming and forestry mean daily runoff data were obtained from the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa and various regional councils see booker and woods 2014 for more details of these gauging stations daily temperature and precipitation were available from the new zealand s virtual climate station network tait et al 2006 the digital river network was taken from the river environment classification rec snelder and biggs 2002 and land cover and soils data were retrieved from the land cover database and land resource inventory newsome et al 2000 furthermore a digital elevation model at 30 m resolution was utilised 2 2 baseflow separation baseflow originates from rainfall and or snowmelt which infiltrates into the subsurface and eventually discharges to streams methods for quantifying and predicting baseflow separation from total streamflow are critical to better manage water resources for example decisions regarding water extraction from the groundwater stores may affect baseflow and in turn potentially alter total streamflow with further possible effects on freshwater ecosystems booker et al 2016 arnold et al 1995 the choice of techniques applied to separate baseflow tends to affect the results and since the true baseflow contribution is not known the choice of techniques remains somewhat subjective beck et al 2013 partington et al 2012 indicated that no baseflow separation methods are clearly superior to the others as the performance varies with different soil types antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall events hence the present study did not attempt to investigate superiority of any baseflow separation technique here baseflow was separated from streamflow using the lyne and hollick recursive digital filter method originally used in signal processing lyne and hollick 1979 this method has been adopted for baseflow separation by nathan and mcmahon 1990 is considered easy to automate objective and repeatable nathan and mcmahon 1991 arnold and allen 1999 provides smooth time series eckhardt 2008 and has been applied successfully in a large number of studies see e g arnold et al 2000 santhi et al 2008 ladson et al 2013 who list and discuss applications of the method and zhang et al 2017b zhang et al 2017b assess four baseflow separation methods the united kingdom institute of hydrology ukih method and three digital filtering methods through a comparison with tracer based hydrograph separation and subsequent bfi calculation for five catchments in eastern australia the one parameter methods by lyne hollick nathan and mcmahon 1990 and by chapman maxwell chapman and maxwell 1996 chapman 1999 as well as the two parameter method by eckhardt 2005 the authors report that it was critical to obtain appropriate parameter s before applying the digital filtering methods while the results of the four methods do not differ substantially once the parameter s have been identified zhang et al 2017b recommend the lyne hollick method the basic principle of the method is to separate the high frequency signal surface runoff and the low frequency signal baseflow of the total stream flow record the digital filter equation according to nathan and mcmahon 1990 is 1 q f t α q f t 1 1 α 2 q t q t 1 for q f t 0 0 otherwise where q is the original streamflow volume time qf is the quickflow volume time α is the filter parameter and t is the time step we followed the standard approach to baseflow separation by ladson et al 2013 applying three filter passes the filter parameter α has been determined for each catchment based on the work by henderson et al 2004 and booker and woods 2014 through assessment of the recession behaviour of the available measured hydrograph time series in brief the recession formula put forth by brutsaert and nieber 1977 was scaled by a reference flow 2 dq dt q b t 0 where the scaled flow is defined as 3 q q q 0 and t0 time is defined as 4 t 0 q 0 1 b a the reference flow q0 was determined as the median of the measured flow and a m3 1 b t2 b and b are parameters for each gauged site t0 and b were determined by geometric regression from 5 l o g d q dt b l o g q l o g t 0 details can be found in the references provided following zhang et al 2017b we estimate α for each gauged site as 6 α e x p 1 t 0 the baseflow qb is calculated by 7 q b t q t q f t the baseflow was separated from daily flow series and then the bfi was calculated at a daily time step then the bfi values were averaged over the entire time period the seasonal bfi values were determined by first calculating the bfi for the entire time series then split into seasons and finally the bfi was averaged for each season lastly since summer demands for irrigation are higher than in winter with potential consequences on aquifers streamflow and ecosystems the winter to summer ratio of bfi was calculated as the ratio of the average winter bfi to the average summer bfi 2 3 spatial bfi prediction the regression approach random forests was employed to predict the bfi at ungauged locations by regressing bfi as a function of catchment characteristics spatial patterns in several hydrological indices have previously been successfully predicted from catchment characteristics using random forest regression models these indices include lake water levels flow intermittence low flow characteristics mean flow flow variability seasonality and characteristics of flow duration curves booker and snelder 2012 booker 2013 booker and woods 2014 li et al 2016 snelder et al 2013a longobardi and villani 2008 random forests rf are a machine learning ensemble regression technique that relate a response to a set of predictors whilst incorporating non linear and interacting relationships by repeatedly growing decision trees random forest thereby combine many regression trees into an ensemble to produce more accurate regressions by drawing several bootstrap samples from the original training data and fitting a tree to each sample hastie et al 2009 full details are provided by breiman 2001 cutler et al 2007 and ellis et al 2012 essentially a rf is comprised of many trees each tree is grown by repeatedly selecting a bootstrap sample an independent sample selected with replacement of the training data each split within a tree represents a value of a predictor the combination of predictor and split is derived such that it leads to the smallest total impurity defined as the sum of squared deviations about the group mean splitting occurs repeatedly until a minimum number of observations in the partition is attained at which point the partition becomes a terminal node of the tree trees that do not include a particular data point in their bootstrap sample are labelled the out of bag oob set of trees with respect to that data point predictions that are independent from each data point labelled oob predictions are the averages of all response values from the bootstrap sample that fall in each terminal node for each tree subsequently averaged over all trees that did not include the data point of interest within their training data these oob samples can therefore be used to assess model predictive performance independently from the fitted data and to calculate the importance of each predictor e g booker and snelder 2012 importance is calculated as the increase in mean square prediction error when each predictor is randomly permuted and is based on the oob samples importance represents the contribution to accuracy of independent predictions for each predictor and is equivalent to the increase in error when a term is dropped from a linear model rf predictions of the response resulting from a new set of predictor values representing new locations new environmental conditions or potential future states are calculated as the average of all observed values that fall in each terminal node for each tree averaged over all trees derived this method provided estimates for all reaches that comprise the new zealand river network as the number of trees within an rf increases the generalisation error always converges and it was assumed that use of 500 trees was sufficiently high to ensure convergence thanh noi and kappas 2018 in several previous booker and snelder 2012 booker 2013 booker and woods 2014 snelder et al 2013b studies hydrological indices were predicted from data describing catchment physical properties relating to hydrological regimes available from a variety of national scale sources including a digital river network river environment classification snelder and biggs 2002 30 m digital elevation model and land cover and soils databases land cover database land resource inventory newsome et al 2000 a similar approach was applied here to predict bfi and winter to summer bfi while random forest regression is a purely empirical approach that does not explicitly include any physical processes only variables that could be linked to bfi using a physical basis were applied as predictors table 1 number of high intensity rain days and variability in rainfall were included to represent variability in rainfall at two different time scales catchment elevation was included as a proxy indicator for the influence of climate on the hydrograph shape upstream average slope was added due to its effect on the hydrograph shape and infiltration catchment area affects flow magnitude and timing and was hence included potential evaporation included as a predictor to represent its influence on low flow behaviour and the steepness of recession limbs geological category and average particle size of underlying geology complement the set of variables to represent the timing and nature of sub surface flows the distribution of each predictor variable for gauged sites are shown in fig 2 the shape of these distributions varies between the predictor variables for example particle size of the rocks a variable reflecting flow paths and infiltration capacity has a rather flat distribution with a distinct peak further transformation of predictors was not applied since random forests are invariant to monotonic transformations of the predictors de ath and fabricius 2000 fig 3 provides an overview of the analysis steps applied in this study the available streamflow time series form the basis for which the baseflow is separated from total streamflow using the lyne and hollick recursive digital filter method to then determine the bfi for the entire time period averaged and for the entire time period for each season random forests regression was then applied to predict the long term average bfi and the winter to summer bfi ratio for each reach within the new zealand national river network 2 4 evaluation of performance oob predictions from random forests models were used to assess model performance this cross validation procedure was applied to test spatial predictions as if each site was ungauged this is the same procedure applied by mcmillan et al 2016 and is similar to a leave one out cross validation procedure because it can be used to assess both the robustness and reliability for estimation at ungauged sites castellarin et al 2004 ganora et al 2009 following the approach laid out by moriasi et al 2007 predictive performance of oob predictions was quantified by calculating the coefficient of linear determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 root mean square error gupta et al 1999 and percent bias legates and mccabe 1999 these performance metrics were applied across all 482 observed sites but also applied separately to various groupings of the data to allow assessment of model performance across contrasting hydrological conditions as defined by snelder and biggs 2002 such as topographic setting table 2 climatic or landcover conditions 3 results 3 1 bfi for gauged sites across new zealand the long term average bfi values for 482 gauged sites across new zealand are shown in fig 4 bfi values were generally found to be higher 0 8 0 96 for the centre north regions of the north island of new zealand e g the bay of plenty region and south west thereof and parts of the centre along the main divide the southern alps and centre east regions of the south island e g parts of canterbury 0 7 0 96 the bay of plenty and parts south west thereof are in the volcanic plateau region which may result in comparably low surface flow the eastern coastline of the north island has consistently low values in the 0 2 0 4 range and the same holds for the auckland region and the northernmost part of the north island comparably low values are found in the nelson region of the south island and in parts of the east coast of the south island the seasonal bfi was estimated for all available gauged sites and shown in fig 5 while the spatial patterns for spring september october november summer december january february fall march april may and winter june july august are similar the magnitudes differ the lowest bfi values overall were found to occur during fall it remains challenging to clearly explain what defines a certain bfi value as multiple factors some of which vary greatly throughout the year e g precipitation vegetation evapotranspiration influence the bfi however it can be noted that for all seasons the central volcanic plateau region on the north island has the highest bfi values 3 2 bfi for ungauged sites across new zealand 3 2 1 power of predictors the eight predictors to determine the long term average bfi and the bfi winter to summer ratio for ungauged sites were assessed in terms of their importance fig 6 shows the relative importance of each of the predictors the pattern in importance varied between the two cases of average bfi and the winter to summer ratio of bfi which is expected many predictors were of similar importance for average bfi except catchment elevation which was by far the most important predictor catchment elevation was also the most important predictor for winter to summer ratio of bfi bi variate partial plots are shown in fig 7 to describe patterns between predictors and both long term average bfi and the winter to summer ratio of bfi the bfi was predicted to be greatest in alluvial and volcanic catchments with comparably large elevation and low number of rainfall days greater than 10 mm the predictive behaviour is overall similar for alluvial and volcanic catchments whereas it differs for the other two categories hard and soft sedimentary catchments in both distribution and magnitude for the bfi winter to summer ratio all four cases are similar regarding the general predictive behaviour while the ratio is found highest for the hard sedimentary and volcanic category it peaks for all four at mid range values of rain days greater than 10 mm and elevation 3 2 2 validation the assessment of the performance of oob predictions for long term average bfi and winter to summer ratio of bfi wintertosummer for all sites and sites split by various classifications is summarised in table 3 for the long term bfi the coefficient of determination r2 is overall satisfactory lower values are observed for the categories lakefed mountain warm extremely wet and scrub which represent smaller subsets of the overall number of sites the results are similar for the winter to summer ratio of bfi with the difference that the landcover categories bare and urban do show lower values as well nash sutcliffe efficiency values are in line with the coefficient of determination results the root mean square deviation rmsd is overall 0 08 for both bfi variables the percent bias pbias provides a fourth performance metric categories with poor performance for r2 nse and rmsd also show relatively larger biases in fig 8 the oob validation for all sites is presented visually the overall agreement between out of bag blind cross validation as if each site were ungauged predicted and observed values is satisfactory indicating good ability to distinguish between site patterns across the observed dataset the categories that were identified in table 3 to have lower predictive performance can be seen clearly in fig 9 as they do not follow the 1 1 line as closely as the bulk of the data points this is illustrated in fig 9 for the category topography 3 2 3 long term average bfi and bfi winter to summer ratio the new zealand wide generalised long term average bfi values for all river reaches of the rec v1 of order 2 and greater are shown in fig 10 from this country wide analysis the spatial differentiation in bfi values can clearly be identified the volcanic plateau region where a large part is characterised by very permeable quaternary volcanic deposits clausen and pearson 1995 has the highest bfi values on the north island the lowest bfi values country wide are found in coastal regions of the north island in particular on the east coast where gravel sand mud and sandstone are dominant similar observations can be made for the northernmost tip of the north island the auckland region and for the south island in the nelson region and the gore bay region in canterbury the west and east coast of the south island are separated by the southern alps and clearly the west coast of the south island has lower values throughout when compared to the east coast this was also observed by clausen and pearson 1995 who analysed bfi results by hutchinson 1983 and attribute this to the west coast geology which is dominated by plutonic igneous rocks to the north and metamorphosed rocks to the south plus the main land cover in the region dense rain forest clausen and pearson 1995 the geology in the east coast region differs significantly from the west coast with triassic greywacke argillite and sandstone the vegetation is mainly grass and the terrain rapidly transitions from mountains to lowlands between the southern alps and the ocean these combined may at least in part lead to the observed decreasing overall bfi values between the main divide and the coastal region this was also observed by clausen and pearson 1995 while in some situations bfi values and their spatial distribution may coincide with for example a certain terrain feature it must be noted that in general the influences on the bfi are complex and considering a single aspect may lead to erroneous conclusions this was also noted by ahiablame et al 2013 who state in their work on bfi in indiana usa that the northern heavily drained region tended to have slightly higher bfi values compared to the remainder of indiana indicating that increasing baseflow may be affected by water storage for example created by tile drainage or natural storage or the combination of both considering this direct dependence of baseflow on geology and precipitation would be less likely the generalised winter to summer bfi values also show a distinct pattern fig 11 while the north island has high winter to summer bfi values except for regions along the east coast the southern island has comparably lower winter to summer bfi values throughout whereby the lowest values are found along the southern alps 4 discussion the baseflow index is an important hydrological index for various water resources planning and management tasks for example baseflow reflects the connection to groundwater and it comprises the majority of the total flow volume in rivers with stable flow regimes in the absence of any restrictions to water abstraction locations with higher baseflow would be expected to be more vulnerable to significant reduction in their flow regimes resulting from groundwater abstractions at the same time surface water abstraction from a river with variable flow regimes will result in large reductions relative to natural flows during low flow periods and very small relative reductions at times of high flow similarly flood flows comprise the majority of the total flow volume in rivers with variable flow regimes and therefore the natural flow volume may not be significantly reduced by water abstraction knowledge of baseflow and the baseflow index can hence support water resources planning and management in areas such as water supply stream ecology and pollution risk other scholars have determined bfi values for a number of gauged catchments in new zealand with successive prediction of bfi for ungauged catchments hutchinson 1983 applied an approach developed by the institute of hydrology of the uk institute of hydrology 1980 to predict the bfi for ungauged catchments in new zealand thereby mainly relying on geology as described above we found that the relative magnitude had a similar spatial distribution when compared to the current work jowett and duncan 1990 determined flow variability indices bfi coefficient of variation of flow ratio of mean to median flow mean annual maximum flow divided by median flow mean annual minimum divided by median flow coefficient of variation of annual maximum flows and coefficient of variation of annual minimum flows for 130 flow recording sites for catchments across new zealand and classified these sites into six groups based on flow variability while the main aim of their work was to link flow variability to in stream habitat and biota it provided a rudimentary means to estimate the bfi for sites where no flow record was available simply by establishing baseflow indices for other rivers close to those studied considering that jowett and duncan 1990 assessed a smaller dataset than the current study we find where a comparison is feasible that our predicted patterns in bfi corresponded well to those described by jowett and duncan 1990 the recent comprehensive study by beck et al 2013 2015 resulted in a rich dataset whereby the authors used observed streamflow data from 3394 small to medium sized catchments 10 10 000 km2 around the globe to train neural network ensembles to then estimate 17 streamflow characteristics at 0 125 resolution including four different estimates of bfi based on climate and physiographic characteristics of the catchments while this dataset spans new zealand a comparison with the results obtained in the current study was not attempted as the four different bfi datasets provided by beck et al 2013 2015 are highly correlated but show systematic differences beck et al 2015 and it is hence not clear which dataset one should choose for a comparison lastly another option suggested is to determine bfi in a given secondary ungauged stream based on observed data in a primary catchment according to griffiths and mckerchar 2015 the concurrent base flow gauging technique is a method of good accuracy for estimating low flow statistics or potentially to derive a synthetic continuous flow record for the secondary unmonitored sites it involves the establishment of a well defined linear regression between concurrent flows at a primary site having a continuous long term flow record and a secondary site having just very limited gauging data according to the authors the primary and secondary sites should be located in catchments having similar hydrologic and physiographic characteristics the regression is then used to predict flow statistics at a secondary site given prescribed values at a primary site here long term bfi values and the bfi winter to summer ratio for all river reaches across new zealand have been determined based on the most complete streamflow dataset available to date for new zealand the resulting dataset may be utilised in support of water resources planning and management decisions for example in their study focussing on three geographical regions in new zealand clausen and pearson 1995 pointed out that a baseflow index integrating the influence of various physical and climatic catchment characteristics on hydrographs was useful in regionalising the mean annual maximum severity and the log normal distributions allowing estimation of extreme droughts and droughts in ungauged catchments in other work clausen et al 1999 highlight the importance of the process of denitrification in riparian zones in preventing high agriculture sourced nitrate loads from entering and polluting rivers and they found that denitrification enzyme activity and bfi were identified to be weakly related with higher dea rates in upstream subcatchments of the 114 km2 study catchment in denmark where the mean flow and bfi are low high proportion of quickflow various other studies also highlight the importance of baseflow for transport schilling and zhang 2004 examine a long record of streamflow and nitrate concentration data from the raccoon river watershed in west central iowa usa to find that nitrate nitrogen export contributes to impairment of downstream water quality baseflow contributed approximately two thirds 17 3 kg ha of the mean annual nitrate export 26 1 kg ha study results demonstrate the utility of assessing the baseflow contribution to nitrate loads to identify appropriate control strategies for reducing baseflow delivery of nitrate in the study by zhu et al 2011 on non point nitrogen loss from mixed land use catchment the majority of no3 n about 75 and total n about 65 were exported in baseflow which contributed about 64 of the total flow in an average year and had greater flow weighted mean no3 n concentration 5 6 mg l 1 than storm flow 3 4 mg l 1 the authors conclude that management practices to reduce n loss from this watershed should target periods of baseflow when no3 n and total n concentrations are greater before and after the crop growing season and target areas along the stream where seeps are present perhaps including perennial plant species in localized riparian buffers and introducing cover crops on the agricultural land during the fallow season hence a detailed dataset on the baseflow index such as the one determined in the work presented here can help to address various water resources planning and management issues note that the importance of higher time resolution and seasonal aspects have been stressed by for example schilling and zhang 2004 who identified that baseflow transport was greatest in spring and late fall when baseflow contributed more than 80 of the total export seasonal patterns of the bfi identified the strong link between the baseflow nitrate loads and seasonal crop nitrogen requirements farquharson et al 2015 reported that international studies have shown that that in tropical climates the bfi is heavily influenced by the seasonal climate regime high index values may be observed downstream of glaciers hisdal et al 2004 found that in snow dominated catchments it is useful to calculate bfi from the period without snow that is to calculate annual summer bfi hence next to the long term bfi seasonal bfi can provide additional useful information for water resources planning and management here the focus was placed on the winter to summer ratio of bfi as water abstractions are largest during the summer months in new zealand while precipitation amounts are higher during winter months although the regression approach applied was purely empirical eight predictor variables that could be linked to bfi using a physical basis were applied the same eight predictor variables were used to predict long term average bfi and the winter to summer bfi ratio to simplify the analysis after having trailed various combinations of other available predictor variables with little or no increase in predictive performance procedures designed to optimise the set of independent variables e g murphy et al 2010 genuer et al 2010 were not applied the combination of a digital recursive filter for baseflow separation and random forest regression is a promising tool to predict baseflow for ungauged catchments in particular when an individual filter parameter for each stream is identified either through field studies or as was employed here by analysis of the recession characteristics of the flow time series note that cheng et al 2016 devised a method for objective determination of the recession constant based on the approach put forth by brutsaert and nieber 1977 successfully applied by zhang et al 2017a b to baseflow analysis of catchments across australia 5 summary and conclusions a recursive digital filtering technique to separate baseflow from total streamflow whereby an individual filter parameter for each stream has been estimated from the recession behaviour has been combined with the random forest regression technique to predict the long term baseflow index for every river reach of the new zealand river network furthermore the seasonal bfi and the ratio of winter to summer bfi for all river reaches have been determined distinct spatial patterns of the bfi were identified bfi values are highest in the volcanic plateau region of the north island on the south island the highest values are found along the southern alps the main divide between the east and the west coast the eastern coastal regions of the north island the auckland region the northernmost part of the north island the nelson region and parts of the east coast of the south island exhibit the lowest bfi values these regions are characterised by gravel sand and sandstone the winter to summer bfi ratio also exhibited a distinct spatial pattern future work can potentially utilise such data to assess specific hydrological questions and to support work pertaining to water resources planning and management the results indicate that 53 of streamflow in new zealand is sustained by groundwater and other delayed sources we agree with ahiablame et al 2013 who found a 60 contribution for sites in indiana usa that for such a substantial contribution an improved understanding of pollutant transport in baseflow is required in order to adequately manage of water resources and improve water quality therefore one crucial application of the method presented here is to elucidate water flow and contaminant transfer through catchments this can be accomplished by establishing a relationship of bfi and streamflow contaminant concentrations since groundwater is an important source for both drinking water and irrigation not only in new zealand but several countries worldwide a second water management aspect that can be informed with the current work is the effect of water withdrawal from aquifers on baseflow the implications for streamflow that follow and in turn the consequences for the ecosystem conflict of interest the authors declared
