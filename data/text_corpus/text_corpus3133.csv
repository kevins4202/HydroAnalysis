15665,in this work a mechanistic dynamic model of continuous flow peracetic acid paa disinfection was developed calibrated and validated assuming e coli as indicator microorganism the model was conceived as a 1 dimensional dispersion model integrating paa first order decay and e coli inactivation rate lab scale batch experiments of paa decay and e coli inactivation experiments were performed to calibrate corresponding kinetic models in each sample conventional wastewater quality parameters were monitored a paa pilot reactor was set up to perform both tracer studies for dispersion model calibration and continuous flow disinfection experiments to validate the integration of hydraulics and kinetics models under both stationary and dynamic conditions linear regression models were calibrated to predict hydrodynamic dispersion given the flow rate and paa decay parameters given effluent quality and paa dosage successful validation of the paa disinfection model proved the importance of i considering the disinfection process as a dynamic system and ii integrating real time estimation of process disturbances being the initial e coli concentration and the impact of effluent quality and paa dosage on paa decay kinetics importantly novel inactivation models were proposed as two different modifications of a literature model for thermal inactivation these models are suitable for dynamic simulation of eulerian models and can describe the typical triphasic behavior of inactivation kinetics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection e coli peracetic acid wastewater dispersion model pilot scale validation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chemical disinfection is one of the most widespread solutions for pathogen removal from wastewater guaranteeing high inactivation efficiencies for bacteria viruses and protozoa while requiring simple and cheap facilities and equipment which are easy to be managed white 2010 main drawbacks of most of chemical disinfectants are the formation of toxic disinfection by products dbps and a relevant ecotoxicological impact on natural waters due to both residual disinfectant and dbps inter alia yang et al 2013 du et al 2017 how et al 2017 therefore disinfectant dosage has to be optimized in order to guarantee the required pathogen reduction while minimizing residual concentration of disinfectant and process cost in wastewater treatment this goal is challenged by fluctuations in quality and flow rate of wastewater streams to be disinfected which affect process efficiency this variability is mainly due to the daily variability of raw wastewater quality and flow rate and of the efficiency of upstream treatments the change of wastewater quality impacts on decay kinetics of disinfectants wang et al 2019 dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018a 2018b while flow rate variations cause different hydrodynamics in the disinfection contact tank these dynamic conditions impact the two fundamental operating parameters in determining process efficiency the concentration of disinfectant and contact time design optimization and control of chemical disinfection require then a model of the process which account for the impact of changing wastewater quality and flow rate when estimating pathogen inactivation one of the first systematic approaches to disinfection modeling was the surface water treatment rule swtr and it was conceived for a highly conservative design of disinfectant dosage usepa 2006 the swtr assumes that the dose ct defined as the product of disinfectant concentration and residence time in the contact tank and expressed as mg l 1 min is the primary factor determining disinfection efficiency and reported ct tables for a variety of disinfectants linking ct values to inactivation levels the assumption on the importance of the dose is the basis of most of the following modeling approaches to disinfection but still the swtr is too conservative in the way the dose was estimated the swtr assumes that the retention time at which 10 of the water passes through the contact tank t10 and the residual concentration of disinfectant after the average hydraulic retention time have to be considered to compute the ct value without accounting for specific characteristics of hydraulics and kinetics of the case study this is the consequence of a single objective approach which look for a high safety factor when considering pathogen inactivation while neglecting the environmental and economic impact of unnecessary overdosage the modeling approach introduced by the integrated disinfection design framework iddf ducoste et al 2001 represented a fundamental shift towards a site specific modeling of continuous flow disinfection iddf integrates sub models of contact tank hydraulics disinfectant decay dbps formation and microbial inactivation kinetics which are all calibrated on the case study of interest allowing to optimize dosage while considering the specificity of disinfectant wastewater and reactor characteristics however iddf was primarily developed for drinking water and considers disinfection as a stationary process with constant water quality and flow rate which makes it very approximate for realistic wastewater applications more recently variability of disturbances and model uncertainty were included in wastewater disinfection modeling leading to more accurate and robust predictions of process efficiency a first group of studies proposes stochastic models which characterize the variability of process inputs and parameters as probability distributions inter alia neumann et al 2007 santoro et al 2015 this kind of approaches provide useful tools to deal with disturbances variability and model uncertainty but they do not explicitly explain how time variability of wastewater quality and flow rate impact on the dynamic behavior of the disinfection process in fact variability and uncertainty are described as static probability distributions and propagated onto disinfection efficiency predictions by monte carlo simulations of the disinfection reactor under stationary conditions manoli et al 2019 made a fundamental step forward in predicting the temporal dynamics of chemical disinfection by modeling the process over time as succession of stationary conditions the contact tank was modeled as a tank in series tis model levenspiel 1999 a series of ideal continuously stirred tank reactors at each time step residual peracetic acid paa and e coli concentrations were estimated with the segregated flow model crittenden et al 2012 using the current value of flow rate and paa concentration at the reactor inlet elhalwagy et al 2021 developed a disinfection model based on computational fluid dynamics to describe contact tank hydraulics and adding the description of the impact of solid settling on disinfectant decay and microbial inactivation despite these recent advances wastewater disinfection was rarely modeled as a dynamic process and still a dynamic model of disinfection needs to be validated statistical regression models represent an effective alternative to previously described mechanistic approaches whenever lack of knowledge on specific phenomena affecting disinfection can be compensated by directly capturing input output relationships in data for example regularized linear models inter alia kadoya et al 2020 kadoya et al 2021 and neural networks newhart et al 2021 were used to predict process efficiency and or residual concentration of disinfectant moreover data driven models like neural networks were used to build surrogate models of their mechanistic counterparts wei et al 2020 with much lower computational time unlocking applications in optimization and control this work aims at conceiving calibrating and validating a mechanistic dynamic model of paa disinfection the process was described by a 1 dimensional advection diffusion reaction model integrating paa decay and inactivation kinetics impact of varying wastewater quality and flow rate on kinetic and hydraulic parameters was estimated by means of regression models paa decay and inactivation kinetic models were calibrated in lab scale batch experiments e coli was used as indicator microorganism a statistical regression model was calibrated to predict the impact of changing wastewater quality on paa decay kinetics the 1 dimensional advection diffusion transport model was calibrated over tracer studies carried out on a pilot reactor finally the overall 1 dimensional advection diffusion reaction model integrating kinetic and hydraulic models was validated over pilot scale continuous flow disinfection experiments both in stationary and dynamic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development a mechanistic model of paa disinfection was developed integrating the description of contact tank hydraulics paragraph 2 1 1 kinetics of paa decay paragraph 2 1 2 and kinetics of e coli inactivation by paa paragraph 2 1 3 the paa disinfection model was then calibrated and validated at pilot scale under both stationary flow rate conditions paragraph 2 1 4 and dynamic conditions paragraph 2 1 5 2 1 1 contact tank hydraulics a 1 dimensional advection diffusion reaction model also known as dispersion model levenspiel 1999 was used to describe fate and transport of reactive substances through the contact tank 1 d s d t v d s d x d d 2 s d x 2 d s d t r where s mg l 1 is the concentration of a generic reactive substance x m is the spatial coordinate indicating the distance from the inlet of the contact tank v m min 1 is the flow velocity along x and d m2 min 1 is the dispersion coefficient d s d t r mg l 1 min 1 is the rate of the reaction involving s the model assumes that s is constant over the cross sectional area of the reactor the model does not explicitly describe the flow inversions due to the chicane of the contact tank and considers it as a linear channel the additional mixing and dispersion due to flow inversions is then incorporated in d two models were compared for contact tank hydraulics being i a single dispersion model sdm fig 1 a describing the contact tank as a single linear channel and ii the parallel combination of two dispersion models pdm describing the tank as two parallel linear channels with a final blend of flow rates fig 1b in this second case total flow rate and cross sectional area are split between the two dispersion models according to two parameters Œ± and Œ≤ respectively with Œ± Œ≤ 0 1 equations describing the response of the dispersion model to an impulse of a non reactive substance under open channel boundary conditions were used to calibrate d on tracer studies data crittenden et al 2012 2 e œë v m c p u l s e 1 4 œÄ œë d e 1 Œ∏ 2 4 œë d d 0 01 1 4 œÄ d e 1 Œ∏ 2 4 d d 0 01 3 d d v l 4 Œ∏ t h r t where m is the mass of the injected tracer v

for each flow rate value empirical models of d Œ± and Œ≤ as linear power and exponential functions of flow rate were then calibrated 2 1 2 paa decay paa decay was modeled with the haas and finch model

linear models to predict k and o d in the effluent given monitored conventional wastewater quality parameters as potential predictors see paragraph 2 2 in lasso regression optimal coefficients of a linear model are found by minimizing a penalized residual sum of squares plus a penalty proportional to the sum of the absolute values of coefficients 8 s s e l a s s o i 1 n y i y i 2 Œª j 1 p Œ≤ i where y i are the observations y i are the predicted values n is the size of the sample and Œ≤ j are model parameters lasso has the advantage of shrinking continuously towards zero coefficients of irrelevant predictors during s s e l a s s o minimization thus leading to a sparse model with a reduced number of predictors the value of Œª was tuned by minimizing mean squared error mse within a leave one out cross validation loocv procedure hastie 2009 then the final model was calibrated on the whole dataset by lasso using the optimal value of Œª 2 1 3 e coli inactivation four models were compared for e coli inactivation i dose model dm dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018b ii double exponential model dem santoro et al 2015 iii and iv two modified versions of the geeraerd inactivation model mgm1 and mgm2 geeraerd et al 2000 the dm describes inactivation by paa in batch conditions as 9 l o g n n 0 k d n 1 e h d 10 d t 0 t c d t c 0 o d k 1 e k t where n 0 and n cfu 100 ml are the initial concentration of bacteria and the concentration at time t and k n and h are model parameters d t mg l 1 min is the disinfectant dose at time t i e the integral of paa concentration up to time t this definition of the dose synthesizes the combined variation of paa concentration and contact time while accounting for the progressive loss of paa concentration due to decay dm can effectively describe with only 3 parameters the triphasic behavior of paa inactivation kinetics made of a first lag followed by a sequence of a log linear phase with high inactivation rate and finally by a sharp decrease of inactivation rate phase tailing the dem used in this work is inspired to previously developed literature model which was widely used both in uv disinfection inter alia pennell et al 2008 ahmed et al 2019 and in chemical disinfection inter alia santoro et al 2015 the dem starts from the assumption that the high rate log linear phase of inactivation is mainly due to the rapid inactivation of dispersed free swimming bacteria while the final tailing with slower rate is caused by the shielding effect that protects bacteria which aggregate on suspended solid particles in this work to define dem both in a derivative and in an integral form free swimming and particle associated bacteria are assumed to follow a chick watson inactivation kinetics as described by 11 d n f s d t a n f s p a a 12 d n p a d t b n p a p a a where n f s cfu 100ml is the concentration of free swimming bacteria and n p a cfu 100ml is the concentration of particle associated bacteria relying on the assumption that the total bacteria population can be calculated as the sum of the two above mentioned sub populations the overall dem kinetics in its integral form can be derived as 13 n n f s n p a n 0 f s e a d n 0 p a e b d Œ¥ n 0 e a d 1 Œ¥ n 0 e b d where Œ¥ is the percentage of n f s in the total concentration of initial bacteria n 0 model parameters are a b and Œ¥ as for mgm1 and mgm2 the first one is based on the same assumption as dem on the presence of free swimming and particle associated bacteria but it assumes a different inactivation kinetics for the first group that can describe the initial lag under the hypothesis that the lag is due to the presence of components c protecting bacteria from inactivation geeraerd et al 2000 here it is then assumed that c undergoes a second order inactivation dependent on paa concentration mgm1 is then formulated as 14 d n f s d t Œ∑ n f s p a a 15 Œ∑ Œ∑ m a x 1 c c k c Œ∑ m a x 1 1 x 16 x c k c 17 d x d t Œ∑ m a x p a a x where the michaelis menten based kinetics Œ∑ is introduced in the inactivation rate of bacteria k c units cell 1 stands for the value of c units cell 1 where Œ∑ equals half of its final value which is 1 x can be interpreted as a measure of the physiological state of the population geeraerd et al 2000 the integral form of eq 14 and of the mgm1 kinetics are given respectively by 18 n f s n f s 0 x 0 1 x 0 e Œ∑ m a x d 19 n Œ¥ n 0 x 0 1 x 0 e Œ∑ m a x d 1 Œ¥ n 0 e b d mgm2 was defined as mgm1 except for the decay of x and consequently c which was described as a first order decay not depending on paa concentration 20 d x d t Œ∑ m a x x mgm2 cannot be integrated analytically and was then solved numerically 2 1 4 prediction of residual e coli and paa concentrations under stationary flow rate conditions residual e coli and paa concentration at the outlet of the pilot contact tank during continuous flow disinfection at constant flow rate were predicted with the sfm levenspiel 1999 the sfm works under the assumption that all the fluid elements are segregated namely they do not mix or interact with each other therefore the amount of any reaction that takes place in each fluid element is estimated and then the elements are mixed at the end of the reactor usually every fraction of fluid is approximated by a batch reactor with the same contact time of that fluid fraction retention time identified by the e œë function the prediction of residual bacteria and paa concentrations by sfm can be then formalized as a convolution integral 21 p a a o u t p a a 0 0 p a a b a t c h t e t d t 22

concentration trends respectively in batch conditions defined by models described in paragraphs 2 1 2 and 2 1 3 2 1 5 prediction of residual e coli and paa concentrations under dynamic flow rate conditions residual e coli and paa concentration at the outlet of the pilot contact tank during continuous flow disinfection at variable effluent flow rate and water quality was simulated by numerical solution of the dispersion model in its derivative form fate and transport of bacteria and paa through the contact tank were described as 24 d n f s d t q a d n f s d x d q d 2 n f s d x 2 Œ∑ n f s p

straightforwardly derived for dem or mgm2 by replacing the reaction term in eqs 17 and 18 dispersion parameter d is dependent on flow rate q while paa decay parameter k depends on wastewater quality parameters q at time t q corresponds to the group of water quality parameters which were selected as good predictors of k by lasso regression paragraph 2 1 2 in the case of pdm eqs 24 26 were solved for the two channels and concentrations flowing out the contact tank were computed as the final blend e coli concentration at the inlet of the contact tank was predicted by a linear regression model calibrated according to lasso and loocv paragraph 2 1 2 considering wastewater quality parameters as predictors paragraph 2 2 2 1 6 experimental plan the experimental plan was designed to calibrate kinetic models of paa decay and inactivation of e coli and the hydraulic model of the contact tank and to validate the integration of such models to predict paa and e coli residual concentration in a continuous flow disinfection process both in stationary and dynamic flow rate conditions paa decay and disinfection experiments in batch conditions were carried out in the laboratory on grab samples of the undisinfected effluent collected in peschiera borromeo municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in milan urban area italy between 02 09 2019 and 28 01 2020 during random moments of day and week the wwtp 440 000 pe includes a primary sedimentation stage followed by a suspended biomass nitrification oxidation and phosphorous removal by aluminium chloride the stream quality is then refined by a double stage biofilter biofor suez performing nitrification denitrification and suspended solids filtration each collected sample was characterized by ph conductivity cnd temperature t total suspended solids tss turbidity trb chemical oxygen demand cod ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 total nitrogen tn ammonia nh4 and nitrate no3 tracer experiments were carried out on the pilot contact tank at 5 flow rates 35 60 80 100 130 l min 1 an impulse of 0 1 kg of nacl was pumped at the inlet of the contact tank and conductivity was monitored over time at the outlet paa disinfection experiments in continuous flow conditions were carried out at pilot scale in between 14 11 2019 and 10 12 2021 under both stationary and dynamic flow rate conditions experiments are summarized in table 1 including details about data use in model calibration or validation 2 1 7 pilot plant a pilot scale disinfection plant was set up in the wwtp it is a 2 2 m3 open channel chicane type reactor whose horizontal and vertical sections are reported and detailed in fig 2 the plant inlet is equipped with an online propeller flow meter digiten fl 1608 a motor valve burkert 3285 and a peristaltic dosing pump seko for paa dosage all devices are connected to an arduino uno programmable board for flow rate readings control of valve opening and dosing pump flow rate the contact tank was fed on the undisinfected tertiary effluent of the wwtp by a centrifugal pump dab withdrawing from the inlet of the full scale disinfection contact tank the pilot plant enabled continuous flow disinfection experiments under constant flow rate or arbitrary flow rate patterns and real time wastewater quality variations samples for batch lab scale and continuous flow pilot scale disinfection experiments and tracer studies were collected at inlet p1 and outlet p2 of the contact tank as highlighted in fig 2 2 1 8 lab scale decay and disinfection experiments 1 h paa decay tests on effluent samples were performed in completely mixed batch reactors cmbr mixed by magnetic stirrer at room temperature 20 1 c in each experiment paa commercial solution was added to the effluent to obtain the given paa initial concentration sample aliquots were collected at five contact times 2 5 10 30 and 60 min to measure residual paa concentration decay experiments were carried out on 9 samples collected at an initial paa concentration of 1 2 and 5 mg l 1 for a total of 27 experiments evaluating paa residual concentration in disinfection experiments carried out in the same setup of paa decay tests 7 undisinfected effluent samples were exposed to different combinations of paa concentration 1 to 5 mg l 1 and contact time 1 to 60 min resulting in monotonically increasing disinfectant doses 1 to 270 mg l 1 min e coli concentration was measured in each sample before and after the exposure to each dose level 2 1 9 pilot scale disinfection experiments continuous flow disinfection experiments were performed on the pilot contact tank fed with the real wwtp undisinfected tertiary effluent and thus with variable effluent quality conditions paa was continuously dosed at constant concentration in stationary conditions experiments flow rate was kept constant while paa and e coli concentration was measured at the outlet after 4 times the average hrt at the same time a sample was collected at the inlet where ph cnd t tss trb cod uv254 tn nh4 and no3 were measured stationary flow rate experiments were carried out in 9 combinations of paa dosage 1 5 3 and 4 5 mg l 1 and flow rate 50 70 and 100 l min 1 paa and flow rate values were chosen to be different from the calibration phase but still avoiding extrapolation in dynamic conditions experiments flow rate varied according to fluctuating patterns 40 to 140 l min 1 with hrt ranging between 17 and 55 min while paa concentration was kept constant at 1 mg l 1 1st experiment and 3 mg l 1 2nd experiment paa concentration at the outlet of the contact tank was measured every 10 min e coli were measured both at the inlet every 60 min and at the outlet of the contact tank every 20 min trb ph cnd and uv254 were measured each 10 min at the inlet experiments lasted 5 hours each 2 2 chemical and microbiological analyses paa residual concentration was measured by the dpd method according to dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018b commercial test kits were used for measurement of cod hach lci500 iso 15705 ammonia hach lck303 iso 7150 1 nitrate hach lck339 en38405 d 2 and total nitrogen hach lck238 en iso 11905 1 tss turbidity and uv254 were respectively measured by 0 45 Œºm membrane filtration standard methods section 2540b apha awwa wef 2012 portable turbidimeter velp scientifica and 1 cm optical path laboratory spectrophotometer hach dr6000 ph and conductivity were measured with a multiparameter probe hach hq40d e coli were enumerated by membrane filtration method according to standard methods section 9222 apha awwa wef 2012 using 0 45 Œºm pore size cellulose nitrate membranes whatman and chromogenic agar microinstant chromogenic coliforms agar scharlau as culture medium inoculated plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h e coli and tc were expressed as cfu in 100 ml volume 2 3 data processing models described in paragraphs from 2 1 1 to 2 1 4 were calibrated with the software r version 4 0 1 package nls 0 2 was used for nonlinear regression and package glmnet 4 0 was used for lasso mathworks matlab r2021b was used for simulations described in paragraphs 2 1 4 and 2 1 6 matlab partial differential equation toolbox was used for numerical solution of ordinary differential equations for simulations of disinfection according to the dispersion model eqs 24 to 26 3 results and discussion firstly the three sub models constituting the mechanistic model were calibrated paragraphs 3 1 to 3 3 on data derived from tracer study and batch decay inactivation tests the calibrated models were then used to predict e coli and paa concentration at the outlet of the pilot reactor during continuous flow disinfection paragraphs 3 4 and 3 6 for dynamic simulations considering the time varying flow rate and wastewater quality the concentration of e coli at the inlet of the pilot reactor was estimated in real time 3 1 calibration of the hydraulic model model parameters of sdm and pdm paragraph 2 1 1 were estimated by nonlinear regression using tracer tests data performed at different hrt ranging between 17 and 56 min results of model calibrations are reported in table s2 the pdm fitted experimental data much better adjusted r2 0 861 to 0 961 than the sdm adjusted r2 0 462 to 0 946 suggesting that the flow through the contact tank could be described as two parallel non mixing fluxes with different longitudinal dispersion pdm fit of experimental tracer data is reported in fig 3 a this result is consistent with previous studies on the effectiveness of compartment models in describing hydrodynamics of chemical disinfection reactor which highlighted that most of contact tanks are best described by two tis models gorzalski et al 2018 which can be considered as equivalent of dispersion models levenspiel 1999 pdm parameters suggest that the model is defined by a main low dispersion flux d 1 0 24 0 56 and a secondary high dispersion flux d 1 0 93 10 88 the lower the total flow rate the higher the importance of the low dispersion flux as can be argued by values of parameter Œ± 0 51 0 87 and Œ≤ 0 40 0 89 interestingly dispersion in the high dispersion flux decreases with flow rate while the opposite happens for the other flux the variation of the estimated parameters with flow rate evidenced how velocity in the contact tank impacts on its overall hydrodynamic behavior determining the degree of the shift from the ideal plug flow model furman et al 2005 zheng and mackley 2008 empirical linear models were calibrated to describe the relationships between flow rate and each pdm parameter model equations coefficients of determination and statistical significances are reported in table 2 while models fits are reported in fig 3b e the integration of these equations in the pdm makes it able to account in real time for changes in hydrodynamic behavior of the contact tank due to flow rate fluctuations 3 2 calibration of the paa decay model data from paa decay experiments evidenced high variability of both first order decay rate and oxidative demand a single parametrization of the haas and finch model was not adequate for a sufficiently accurate prediction of residual paa as reported in fig s1 such variability was most likely due to changing quality of the effluent under study as will be supported by results in this paragraph as can be seen looking at summary statistics of monitored chemical and physical parameters reported in table s1 the effluent under study has very high quality with low solids organic and nitrogen where monitored content this is primarily due to tertiary treatments placed for quality refinement in the wwtp layout see par 2 1 6 this is confirmed by average effluent constituents which are close to typical ranges of tertiary effluents after biological treatment for carbon and nitrogen removal and filtration for residual solids removal metcalf et al 2013 additionally the integration of some canals in the sewer network and the frequent discharge of groundwater in the sewer to control water table level which both happen in the milan area imply that raw wastewater streams are usually very diluted haas and finch model was then calibrated on each out of 27 decay experiments k and o d model fits are illustrated in fig 4 and model coefficients and performances are reported in table 3 lasso regression revealed that part of this variability can be explained by two linear models using paa dosage and conventional effluent quality parameters as predictors of k and o d as a result of the loocv procedure 4 variables initial paa dosage trb uv254 tn and no3 were selected as predictors of k as reported in fig 4a where mse reaches its minimum when Œª is such that only 4 predictor coefficients are non zero this result is consistent with recent findings on paa higher paa concentrations imply higher stability of the compound in water and lower decay while concentration of suspended solids and soluble organics which are well correlated to trb and uv254 increase k santoro et al 2015 dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018a 2018b elhalwagy et al 2021 a physical relationship between tn and no3 and paa decay has not been documented and these two parameters probably work here as proxies of the upstream activated sludge treatment operating conditions as for o d only paa dosage was selected as predictor fig 4c despite some limitations as the poor performance in o d prediction both models were integrated in the disinfection model in order to estimate in real time the impact of changing wastewater quality and dosage on paa decay 3 3 calibration of the e coli inactivation model data collected in lab scale batch disinfection experiments reported in fig 5 revealed the typical triphasic trend of bacteria inactivation by paa inter alia rossi et al 2007 antonelli et al 2013 santoro et al 2005 mcfadden et al 2017 dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018b experimental data suggest an initial lag phase with low inactivation rate for doses lower than approximately 10 mg l 1 min inactivation followed a log linear trend with a high inactivation rate between approximately 10 and 50 mg l 1 min then for higher doses there is a tailing phase with a drastic decrease of the inactivation rate dm dem mgm1 and mgm2 were calibrated on collected data and coefficients statistical significance and predictive performance indicators are reported in table 4 r2 adj akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic results suggest that mgm1 is the best performing model in terms of prediction mgm1 was formulated starting from the model presented by geeraerd et al 2000 this model was modified in mgm1 by introducing paa concentration in the inactivation rate equations as described in paragraph 2 1 3 eqs 14 17 which makes mgm1 suitable for inactivation by disinfectants the good fit of the model suggests that this hypothesis originally formulated for thermal inactivation could be extended to chemical disinfection where c could work as an aggregated parameter accounting as an example for the presence of several reactive sites to be oxidized on bacteria cell membranes and of the presence of external polymeric substances eps protecting the cell membrane inter alia kitis 2004 xue et al 2013 mgm1 was conceived to find a triphasic inactivation model which can be used in a eulerian model in dynamic simulations like for the dispersion model used in this work inactivation rates defined so far in the literature which can describe both lag log linear and tailing inactivation phases are explicitly dependent on time or dose examples are the well known hom model gy√ºrek and finch 1998 or the recent inactivation rate developed by elhalwagy et al 2021 this kind of inactivation rates would require a lagrangian approach where the time spent by each simulated bacteria particle in the reactor is known differently a eulerian model needs an inactivation rate which only depends on model state variables like the mgm1 moreover the integral of the mgm1 for batch conditions has an analytical solution eq 19 which depends only on the paa dose being consistent with the assumption on the primary importance of the dose usually made in disinfection modeling and providing a useful simplified representation of the inactivation phenomena mgm2 shares most of the characteristics of mgm1 except for the definition of c decay rate which is a first order not depending on paa concentration this assumption implies that the decay of all the components which protect bacteria cells from inactivation determining a lag depends only on time whatever is the concentration of paa mgm2 can catch a first lag phase with lower inactivation rate but lag is less sharp and the transition to the loglinear phase is smoother than for mgm1 fig 5b this is the main cause of lower predictive performance with respect to mgm1 mgm2 still has the advantage of being suitable for a eulerian model although the analytical solution of its integral in batch boundary conditions is not available the dm proved lower but similar performance to mgm1 but it needs only 3 instead of 4 parameters moreover all dm parameters are statistically significant while parameter x 0 of mgm1 as for mgm2 results as not statistically significant the fundamental drawback of dm is that it was derived directly in its integral form to describe disinfection in batch conditions dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018b and a derivative form of the inactivation rate is not available finally predictive performances of dem were the lowest since it cannot account for the presence of the initial lag due to its limited flexibility in describing the lag phase performance of mgm2 were only slightly higher than dem overall the comparison of those four inactivation models evidenced how different choices dramatically impact predicted inactivation for doses corresponding to lag and log linear phases which in this case study are lower than approximately 50 mg l 1 min differently all models are approximately equal for higher doses these considerations are evident in fig 5b dm as the model with the lowest number of parameters and the highest predictive performance as mgm1 was used to model continuous flow disinfection in stationary conditions according to the sfm approach paragraph 3 4 since dm does not have a derivative form dem mgm1 and mgm2 were used and compared to model continuous flow disinfection in dynamic conditions paragraph 3 6 3 4 prediction of paa and e coli residuals in stationary conditions the use of the sfm to predict paa and e coli concentrations at the outlet of the pilot reactor was validated in experiments under stationary paa dosage and flow rate conditions plots of observed against estimated paa and e coli concentrations are reported in fig 6 two modes of use of the sfm were compared in the first case paa and e coli were estimated considering paa decay as stationary and independent from wastewater quality k and o d calibrated on the pooled data coming from all paa decay batch experiments were used in the second mode paa decay parameters k and o d were estimated from current effluent quality parameters using the regression model described in paragraph 3 2 results evidenced how accounting for the impact of varying wastewater quality improved predictive performance r2 increased from 0 22 to 0 28 for paa concentration and from 0 86 to 0 88 for e coli prediction despite the improvement predictive performance of paa residual is still globally poor while prediction accuracy of e coli remains low in higher concentration cases as can be observed in fig 6b this was probably because wastewater quality was not stationary throughout the pilot disinfection experiments which is not accounted by sfm and suggesting the importance of modeling the disinfection reactor as a dynamic system where fluctuations in wastewater quality have to be considered when predicting disinfectant and bacteria residuals at given time 3 5 prediction of paa and e coli residuals in dynamic conditions the model of paa disinfection was validated on continuous flow experiments in the pilot reactor with variable effluent flow rate and quality paragraph 2 1 5 time trends of flow rate and turbidity as most relevant effluent quality parameter in determining both paa decay and initial e coli concentration are reported in fig 7 a b the disinfection model proved good prediction accuracy both for initial e coli and paa concentration at the outlet of the pilot reactor as reported in fig 7e f paa concentration was well approximated r2 0 84 but some fluctuations were not caught by the model results were compared to predictions of paa residuals when neglecting the impact of effluent quality on paa decay and assuming constant k and o d calibrated on pooled lab experiments as shown in fig 7e f this simplification decreased prediction accuracy of paa residual r2 0 57 most of the worsening is due to predictions in case of higher dosage as expected since paa follows a first order decay rate real time update of paa decay according to effluent quality avoided underestimation of paa residual predictions of e coli residuals using dem mgm1 and mgm2 as inactivation rates were compared and mgm2 resulted the best option in terms of predictive performance r2 0 58 as reported in fig 7c d the model can reproduce e coli and paa dynamics accounting for the impact of fluctuations in flow rate and wastewater quality as can be seen in fig 7c mgm2 is the best option since it better predicts e coli fluctuations both at 1 and 3 mg l 1 as already argued from inactivation models in batch conditions the choice of the inactivation rate model impacted mainly the prediction at low dosage while predictions at higher dosage were approximately equivalent fig 7d at low paa dosage even small variations of contact time or decay rate can significantly affect the inactivation rate which can shift among the lag log linear and tailing phase differently higher dosage moves the inactivation rate in the tailing phase with lower impact of dose variations importantly e coli final concentrations were predicted correctly also thanks to accurate predictions of initial e coli concentration fig 7c d monte carlo simulations propagated model uncertainty onto predictions as reported in fig 7g l providing more robust estimate of disinfection outputs particularly confidence interval comprises most of e coli concentration data differently still some fluctuations in paa concentrations do not fall inside monte carlo confidence intervals 4 conclusions in this work a mechanistic model for continuous flow paa disinfection was developed calibrated and validated the model proved good performances both in stationary and dynamic effluent flow rate and quality the model was conceived from some well established models but it introduces some key innovations to improve wastewater chemical disinfection reactor hydraulics was described as two 1 dimensional dispersion model in parallel with flow rate varying dispersion parameters which estimate in real time how flow rate variations impact contact tank hydrodynamics impact of dosage and varying effluent quality on paa decay kinetics was estimated by a linear regression model which was used to update in real time paa decay parameters several e coli inactivation kinetics models were compared different models lead to significantly different predictions at low paa dosages when the triphasic behavior of the kinetics is impacting two new inactivation kinetic models mgm1 and mgm2 were proposed which were developed from the model developed by geeraerd et al 2000 for thermal inactivation both models can be integrated in eulerian models like dispersion models and can describe the triphasic behavior of inactivation by chemicals like paa the developed disinfection model was used in dynamic numerical simulations and validated on pilot scale experiments successful validations highlighted the importance of modeling the disinfection process as a dynamic system while integrating regression models to real time update model inputs and parameters being initial bacteria concentration disinfectant decay and hydraulics parameters in light of these innovations and advantages the developed disinfection model could be very useful for off line optimization or on line control of chemical disinfection to face the always increasing need of minimization of both environmental impact and cost declaration of competing interest all authors

15665,in this work a mechanistic dynamic model of continuous flow peracetic acid paa disinfection was developed calibrated and validated assuming e coli as indicator microorganism the model was conceived as a 1 dimensional dispersion model integrating paa first order decay and e coli inactivation rate lab scale batch experiments of paa decay and e coli inactivation experiments were performed to calibrate corresponding kinetic models in each sample conventional wastewater quality parameters were monitored a paa pilot reactor was set up to perform both tracer studies for dispersion model calibration and continuous flow disinfection experiments to validate the integration of hydraulics and kinetics models under both stationary and dynamic conditions linear regression models were calibrated to predict hydrodynamic dispersion given the flow rate and paa decay parameters given effluent quality and paa dosage successful validation of the paa disinfection model proved the importance of i considering the disinfection process as a dynamic system and ii integrating real time estimation of process disturbances being the initial e coli concentration and the impact of effluent quality and paa dosage on paa decay kinetics importantly novel inactivation models were proposed as two different modifications of a literature model for thermal inactivation these models are suitable for dynamic simulation of eulerian models and can describe the typical triphasic behavior of inactivation kinetics graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection e coli peracetic acid wastewater dispersion model pilot scale validation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chemical disinfection is one of the most widespread solutions for pathogen removal from wastewater guaranteeing high inactivation efficiencies for bacteria viruses and protozoa while requiring simple and cheap facilities and equipment which are easy to be managed white 2010 main drawbacks of most of chemical disinfectants are the formation of toxic disinfection by products dbps and a relevant ecotoxicological impact on natural waters due to both residual disinfectant and dbps inter alia yang et al 2013 du et al 2017 how et al 2017 therefore disinfectant dosage has to be optimized in order to guarantee the required pathogen reduction while minimizing residual concentration of disinfectant and process cost in wastewater treatment this goal is challenged by fluctuations in quality and flow rate of wastewater streams to be disinfected which affect process efficiency this variability is mainly due to the daily variability of raw wastewater quality and flow rate and of the efficiency of upstream treatments the change of wastewater quality impacts on decay kinetics of disinfectants wang et al 2019 dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018a 2018b while flow rate variations cause different hydrodynamics in the disinfection contact tank these dynamic conditions impact the two fundamental operating parameters in determining process efficiency the concentration of disinfectant and contact time design optimization and control of chemical disinfection require then a model of the process which account for the impact of changing wastewater quality and flow rate when estimating pathogen inactivation one of the first systematic approaches to disinfection modeling was the surface water treatment rule swtr and it was conceived for a highly conservative design of disinfectant dosage usepa 2006 the swtr assumes that the dose ct defined as the product of disinfectant concentration and residence time in the contact tank and expressed as mg l 1 min is the primary factor determining disinfection efficiency and reported ct tables for a variety of disinfectants linking ct values to inactivation levels the assumption on the importance of the dose is the basis of most of the following modeling approaches to disinfection but still the swtr is too conservative in the way the dose was estimated the swtr assumes that the retention time at which 10 of the water passes through the contact tank t10 and the residual concentration of disinfectant after the average hydraulic retention time have to be considered to compute the ct value without accounting for specific characteristics of hydraulics and kinetics of the case study this is the consequence of a single objective approach which look for a high safety factor when considering pathogen inactivation while neglecting the environmental and economic impact of unnecessary overdosage the modeling approach introduced by the integrated disinfection design framework iddf ducoste et al 2001 represented a fundamental shift towards a site specific modeling of continuous flow disinfection iddf integrates sub models of contact tank hydraulics disinfectant decay dbps formation and microbial inactivation kinetics which are all calibrated on the case study of interest allowing to optimize dosage while considering the specificity of disinfectant wastewater and reactor characteristics however iddf was primarily developed for drinking water and considers disinfection as a stationary process with constant water quality and flow rate which makes it very approximate for realistic wastewater applications more recently variability of disturbances and model uncertainty were included in wastewater disinfection modeling leading to more accurate and robust predictions of process efficiency a first group of studies proposes stochastic models which characterize the variability of process inputs and parameters as probability distributions inter alia neumann et al 2007 santoro et al 2015 this kind of approaches provide useful tools to deal with disturbances variability and model uncertainty but they do not explicitly explain how time variability of wastewater quality and flow rate impact on the dynamic behavior of the disinfection process in fact variability and uncertainty are described as static probability distributions and propagated onto disinfection efficiency predictions by monte carlo simulations of the disinfection reactor under stationary conditions manoli et al 2019 made a fundamental step forward in predicting the temporal dynamics of chemical disinfection by modeling the process over time as succession of stationary conditions the contact tank was modeled as a tank in series tis model levenspiel 1999 a series of ideal continuously stirred tank reactors at each time step residual peracetic acid paa and e coli concentrations were estimated with the segregated flow model crittenden et al 2012 using the current value of flow rate and paa concentration at the reactor inlet elhalwagy et al 2021 developed a disinfection model based on computational fluid dynamics to describe contact tank hydraulics and adding the description of the impact of solid settling on disinfectant decay and microbial inactivation despite these recent advances wastewater disinfection was rarely modeled as a dynamic process and still a dynamic model of disinfection needs to be validated statistical regression models represent an effective alternative to previously described mechanistic approaches whenever lack of knowledge on specific phenomena affecting disinfection can be compensated by directly capturing input output relationships in data for example regularized linear models inter alia kadoya et al 2020 kadoya et al 2021 and neural networks newhart et al 2021 were used to predict process efficiency and or residual concentration of disinfectant moreover data driven models like neural networks were used to build surrogate models of their mechanistic counterparts wei et al 2020 with much lower computational time unlocking applications in optimization and control this work aims at conceiving calibrating and validating a mechanistic dynamic model of paa disinfection the process was described by a 1 dimensional advection diffusion reaction model integrating paa decay and inactivation kinetics impact of varying wastewater quality and flow rate on kinetic and hydraulic parameters was estimated by means of regression models paa decay and inactivation kinetic models were calibrated in lab scale batch experiments e coli was used as indicator microorganism a statistical regression model was calibrated to predict the impact of changing wastewater quality on paa decay kinetics the 1 dimensional advection diffusion transport model was calibrated over tracer studies carried out on a pilot reactor finally the overall 1 dimensional advection diffusion reaction model integrating kinetic and hydraulic models was validated over pilot scale continuous flow disinfection experiments both in stationary and dynamic conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 model development a mechanistic model of paa disinfection was developed integrating the description of contact tank hydraulics paragraph 2 1 1 kinetics of paa decay paragraph 2 1 2 and kinetics of e coli inactivation by paa paragraph 2 1 3 the paa disinfection model was then calibrated and validated at pilot scale under both stationary flow rate conditions paragraph 2 1 4 and dynamic conditions paragraph 2 1 5 2 1 1 contact tank hydraulics a 1 dimensional advection diffusion reaction model also known as dispersion model levenspiel 1999 was used to describe fate and transport of reactive substances through the contact tank 1 d s d t v d s d x d d 2 s d x 2 d s d t r where s mg l 1 is the concentration of a generic reactive substance x m is the spatial coordinate indicating the distance from the inlet of the contact tank v m min 1 is the flow velocity along x and d m2 min 1 is the dispersion coefficient d s d t r mg l 1 min 1 is the rate of the reaction involving s the model assumes that s is constant over the cross sectional area of the reactor the model does not explicitly describe the flow inversions due to the chicane of the contact tank and considers it as a linear channel the additional mixing and dispersion due to flow inversions is then incorporated in d two models were compared for contact tank hydraulics being i a single dispersion model sdm fig 1 a describing the contact tank as a single linear channel and ii the parallel combination of two dispersion models pdm describing the tank as two parallel linear channels with a final blend of flow rates fig 1b in this second case total flow rate and cross sectional area are split between the two dispersion models according to two parameters Œ± and Œ≤ respectively with Œ± Œ≤ 0 1 equations describing the response of the dispersion model to an impulse of a non reactive substance under open channel boundary conditions were used to calibrate d

for each flow rate value empirical models of d Œ± and Œ≤ as linear power and exponential functions of flow rate were then calibrated 2 1 2 paa decay paa decay was modeled with the haas and finch model

linear models to predict k and o d in the effluent given monitored conventional wastewater quality parameters as potential predictors see paragraph 2 2 in lasso regression optimal coefficients of a linear model are found by minimizing a penalized residual sum of squares plus a penalty proportional to the sum of the absolute values of coefficients 8 s s e l a s s o i 1 n y i y i 2 Œª j 1 p Œ≤ i where y i are the observations y i are the predicted values n is the size of the sample and Œ≤ j are model parameters lasso has the advantage of shrinking continuously towards zero coefficients of irrelevant predictors during s s e l a s s o minimization thus leading to a sparse model with a reduced number of predictors the value of Œª was tuned by minimizing mean squared error mse within a leave one out cross validation loocv procedure hastie 2009 then the final model was calibrated on the whole dataset by lasso using the optimal value of Œª 2 1 3 e coli inactivation four models were compared for e coli inactivation i dose model dm dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018b ii double exponential model dem santoro et al 2015 iii and iv two modified versions of the geeraerd inactivation model mgm1 and mgm2 geeraerd et al 2000 the dm describes inactivation by paa in batch conditions as 9 l o g n n 0 k d n 1 e h d 10 d t 0 t c d t c 0 o d k 1 e k t where n 0 and n cfu 100 ml are the initial concentration of bacteria and the concentration at time t and k n and h are model parameters d t mg l 1 min is the disinfectant dose at time t i e the integral of paa concentration up to time t this definition of the dose synthesizes the combined variation of paa concentration and contact time while accounting for the progressive loss of paa concentration due to decay dm can effectively describe with only 3 parameters the triphasic behavior of paa inactivation kinetics made of a first lag followed by a sequence of a log linear phase with high inactivation rate and finally by a sharp decrease of inactivation rate phase tailing the dem used in this work is inspired to previously developed literature model which was widely used both in uv disinfection inter alia pennell et al 2008 ahmed et al 2019 and in chemical disinfection inter alia santoro et al 2015 the dem starts from the assumption that the high rate log linear phase of inactivation is mainly due to the rapid inactivation of dispersed free swimming bacteria while the final tailing with slower rate is caused by the shielding effect that protects bacteria which aggregate on suspended solid particles in this work to define dem both in a derivative and in an integral form free swimming and particle associated bacteria are assumed to follow a chick watson inactivation kinetics as described by 11 d n f s d t a n f s p a a 12 d n p a d t b n p a p a a where n f s cfu 100ml is the concentration of free swimming bacteria and n p a cfu 100ml is the concentration of particle associated bacteria relying on the assumption that the total bacteria population can be calculated as the sum of the two above mentioned sub populations the overall dem kinetics in its integral form can be derived as 13 n n f s n p a n 0 f s e a d n 0 p a e b d Œ¥ n 0 e a d 1 Œ¥ n 0 e b d where Œ¥ is the percentage of n f s in the total concentration of initial bacteria n 0 model parameters are a b and Œ¥ as for mgm1 and mgm2 the first one is based on the same assumption as dem on the presence of free swimming and particle associated bacteria but it assumes a different inactivation kinetics for the first group that can describe the initial lag under the hypothesis that the lag is due to the presence of components c protecting bacteria from inactivation geeraerd et al 2000 here it is then assumed that c undergoes a second order inactivation dependent on paa concentration mgm1 is then formulated as 14 d n f s d t Œ∑ n f s p a a 15 Œ∑ Œ∑ m a x 1 c c k c Œ∑ m a x 1 1 x 16 x c k c 17 d x d t Œ∑ m a x p a a x where the michaelis menten based kinetics Œ∑ is introduced in the inactivation rate of bacteria k c units cell 1 stands for the value of c units cell 1 where Œ∑ equals half of its final value which is 1 x can be interpreted as a measure of the physiological state of the population geeraerd et al 2000 the integral form of eq 14 and of the mgm1 kinetics are given respectively by 18 n f s n f s 0 x 0 1 x 0 e Œ∑ m a x d 19 n Œ¥ n 0 x 0 1 x 0 e Œ∑ m a x d 1 Œ¥ n 0 e b d mgm2 was defined as mgm1 except for the decay of x and consequently c which was described as a first order decay not depending on paa concentration 20 d x d t Œ∑ m a x x mgm2 cannot be integrated analytically and was then solved numerically 2 1 4 prediction of residual e coli and paa concentrations under stationary flow rate conditions residual e coli and paa concentration at the outlet of the pilot contact tank during continuous flow disinfection at constant flow rate were predicted with the sfm levenspiel 1999 the sfm works under the assumption that all the fluid elements are segregated namely they do not mix or interact with each other therefore the amount of any reaction that takes place in each fluid element is estimated and then the elements are mixed at the end of the reactor usually every fraction of fluid is approximated by a batch reactor with the same contact time of that fluid fraction retention time identified by the e œë function the prediction of residual bacteria and paa concentrations by sfm can be then formalized as a convolution integral 21 p a a o u t p a a 0 0 p a a b a t c h t e t d t 22

concentration trends respectively in batch conditions defined by models described in paragraphs 2 1 2 and 2 1 3 2 1 5 prediction of residual e coli and paa concentrations under dynamic flow rate conditions residual e coli and paa concentration at the outlet of the pilot contact tank during continuous flow disinfection at variable effluent flow rate and water quality was simulated by numerical solution of the dispersion model in its derivative form fate and transport of bacteria and paa through the contact tank were described as 24 d n f s d t q a d n f s d x d q d 2 n f s d x 2 Œ∑ n f s p

straightforwardly derived for dem or mgm2 by replacing the reaction term in eqs 17 and 18 dispersion parameter d is dependent on flow rate q while paa decay parameter k depends on wastewater quality parameters q at time t q corresponds to the group of water quality parameters which were selected as good predictors of k by lasso regression paragraph 2 1 2 in the case of pdm eqs 24 26 were solved for the two channels and concentrations flowing out the contact tank were computed as the final blend e coli concentration at the inlet of the contact tank was predicted by a linear regression model calibrated according to lasso and loocv paragraph 2 1 2 considering wastewater quality parameters as predictors paragraph 2 2 2 1 6 experimental plan the experimental plan was designed to calibrate kinetic models of paa decay and inactivation of e coli and the hydraulic model of the contact tank and to validate the integration of such models to predict paa and e coli residual concentration in a continuous flow disinfection process both in stationary and dynamic flow rate conditions paa decay and disinfection experiments in batch conditions were carried out in the laboratory on grab samples of the undisinfected effluent collected in peschiera borromeo municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp in milan urban area italy between 02 09 2019 and 28 01 2020 during random moments of day and week the wwtp 440 000 pe includes a primary sedimentation stage followed by a suspended biomass nitrification oxidation and phosphorous removal by aluminium chloride the stream quality is then refined

suspended solids tss turbidity trb chemical oxygen demand cod ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 total nitrogen tn ammonia nh4 and nitrate no3 tracer experiments were carried out on the pilot contact tank at 5 flow rates 35 60 80 100 130 l min 1 an impulse of 0 1 kg of nacl was pumped at the inlet of the contact tank and conductivity was monitored over time at the outlet paa disinfection experiments in continuous flow conditions were carried out at pilot scale in between 14 11 2019 and 10 12 2021 under both stationary and dynamic flow rate conditions experiments are summarized in table 1 including details about data use in model calibration or validation 2 1 7 pilot plant a pilot scale disinfection plant was set up in the wwtp it is a 2 2 m3 open channel chicane type reactor whose horizontal and vertical sections are reported and detailed in fig 2 the plant inlet is equipped with an online propeller flow meter digiten fl 1608 a motor valve burkert 3285 and a peristaltic dosing pump seko for paa dosage all devices are connected to an arduino uno programmable board for flow rate readings control of valve opening and dosing pump flow rate the contact tank was fed on the undisinfected tertiary effluent of the wwtp by a centrifugal pump dab withdrawing from the inlet of the full scale disinfection contact tank the pilot plant enabled continuous flow disinfection experiments under constant flow rate or arbitrary flow rate patterns and real time wastewater quality variations samples for batch lab scale and continuous flow pilot scale disinfection experiments and tracer studies were collected at inlet p1 and outlet p2 of the contact tank as highlighted in fig 2 2 1 8 lab scale decay and disinfection experiments 1 h paa decay tests on effluent samples were performed in completely mixed batch reactors cmbr mixed by magnetic stirrer at room temperature 20 1 c in each experiment paa commercial solution was added to the effluent to obtain the given paa initial concentration sample aliquots were collected at five contact times 2 5 10 30 and 60 min to measure residual paa concentration decay experiments were carried out on 9 samples collected at an initial paa concentration of 1 2 and 5 mg l 1 for a total of 27 experiments evaluating paa residual concentration in disinfection experiments carried out in the same setup of paa decay tests 7 undisinfected effluent samples were exposed to different combinations of paa concentration 1 to 5 mg l 1 and contact time 1 to 60 min resulting in monotonically increasing disinfectant doses 1 to 270 mg l 1 min e coli concentration was measured in each sample before and after the exposure to each dose level 2 1 9 pilot scale disinfection experiments continuous flow disinfection experiments were performed on the pilot contact tank fed with the real wwtp undisinfected tertiary effluent and thus with variable effluent quality conditions paa was continuously dosed at constant concentration in stationary conditions experiments flow rate was kept constant while paa and e coli concentration was measured at the outlet after 4 times the average hrt at the same time a sample was collected at the inlet where ph cnd t tss trb cod uv254 tn nh4 and no3 were measured stationary flow rate experiments were carried out in 9 combinations of paa dosage 1 5 3 and 4 5 mg l 1 and flow rate 50 70 and 100 l min 1 paa and flow rate values were chosen to be different from the calibration phase but still avoiding extrapolation in dynamic conditions experiments flow rate varied according to fluctuating patterns 40 to 140 l min 1 with hrt ranging between 17 and 55 min while paa concentration was kept constant at 1 mg l 1 1st experiment and 3 mg l 1 2nd experiment paa concentration at the outlet of the contact tank was measured every 10 min e coli were measured both at the inlet every 60 min and at the outlet of the contact tank every 20 min trb ph cnd and uv254 were measured each 10 min at the inlet experiments lasted 5 hours each 2 2 chemical and microbiological analyses paa residual concentration was measured by the dpd method according to dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018b commercial test kits were used for measurement of cod hach lci500 iso 15705 ammonia hach lck303 iso 7150 1 nitrate hach lck339 en38405 d 2 and total nitrogen hach lck238 en iso 11905 1 tss turbidity and uv254 were respectively measured by 0 45 Œºm membrane filtration standard methods section 2540b apha awwa wef 2012 portable turbidimeter velp scientifica and 1 cm optical path laboratory spectrophotometer hach dr6000 ph and conductivity were measured with a multiparameter probe hach hq40d e coli were enumerated by membrane filtration method according to standard methods section 9222 apha awwa wef 2012 using 0 45 Œºm pore size cellulose nitrate membranes whatman and chromogenic agar microinstant chromogenic coliforms agar scharlau as culture medium inoculated plates were incubated at 37 c for 24 h e coli and tc were expressed as cfu in 100 ml volume 2 3 data processing models described in paragraphs from 2 1 1 to 2 1 4 were calibrated with the software r version 4 0 1 package nls 0 2 was used for nonlinear regression and package glmnet 4 0 was used for lasso mathworks matlab r2021b was used for simulations described in paragraphs 2 1 4 and 2 1 6 matlab partial differential equation toolbox was used for numerical solution of ordinary differential equations for simulations of disinfection according to the dispersion model eqs 24 to 26 3 results and discussion firstly the three sub models constituting the mechanistic model were calibrated paragraphs 3 1 to 3 3 on data derived from tracer study and batch decay inactivation tests the calibrated models were then used to predict e coli and paa concentration at the outlet of the pilot reactor during continuous flow disinfection paragraphs 3 4 and 3 6 for dynamic simulations considering the time varying flow rate and wastewater quality the concentration of e coli at the inlet of the pilot reactor was estimated in real time 3 1 calibration of the hydraulic model model parameters of sdm and pdm paragraph 2 1 1 were estimated by nonlinear regression using tracer tests data performed at different hrt ranging between 17 and 56 min results of model calibrations are reported in table s2 the pdm fitted experimental data much better adjusted r2 0 861 to 0 961 than the sdm adjusted r2 0 462 to 0 946 suggesting that the flow through the contact tank could be described as two parallel non mixing fluxes with different longitudinal dispersion pdm fit of experimental tracer data is reported in fig 3 a this result is consistent with previous studies on the effectiveness of compartment models in describing hydrodynamics of chemical disinfection reactor which highlighted that most of contact tanks are best described by two tis models gorzalski et al 2018 which can be considered as equivalent of dispersion models levenspiel 1999 pdm parameters suggest that the model is defined by a main low dispersion flux d 1 0 24 0 56 and a secondary high dispersion flux d 1 0 93 10 88 the lower the total flow rate the higher the importance of the low dispersion flux as can be argued by values of parameter Œ± 0 51 0 87 and Œ≤ 0 40 0 89 interestingly dispersion in the high dispersion flux decreases with flow rate while the opposite happens for the other flux the variation of the estimated parameters with flow rate evidenced how velocity in the contact tank impacts on its overall hydrodynamic behavior determining the degree of the shift from the ideal plug flow model furman et al 2005 zheng and mackley 2008 empirical linear models were calibrated to describe the relationships between flow rate and each pdm parameter model equations coefficients of determination and statistical significances are reported in table 2 while models fits are reported in fig 3b e the integration of these equations in the pdm makes it able to account in real time for changes in hydrodynamic behavior of the contact tank due to flow rate fluctuations 3 2 calibration of the paa decay model data from paa decay experiments evidenced high variability of both first order decay rate and oxidative demand a single parametrization of the haas and finch model was not adequate for a sufficiently accurate prediction of residual paa as reported in fig s1 such variability was most likely due to changing quality of the effluent under study as will be supported by results in this paragraph as can be seen looking at summary statistics of monitored chemical and physical parameters reported in table s1 the effluent under study has very high quality with low solids organic and nitrogen where monitored content this is primarily due to tertiary treatments placed for quality refinement in the wwtp layout see par 2 1 6 this is confirmed by average effluent constituents which are close to typical ranges of tertiary effluents after biological treatment for carbon and nitrogen removal and filtration for residual solids removal metcalf et al 2013 additionally the integration of some canals in the sewer network and the frequent discharge of groundwater in the sewer to control water table level which both happen in the milan area imply that raw wastewater streams are usually very diluted haas and finch model was then calibrated on each out of 27 decay experiments k and o d model fits are illustrated in fig 4 and model coefficients and performances are reported in table 3 lasso regression revealed that part of this variability can be explained by two linear models using paa dosage and conventional effluent quality parameters as predictors of k and o d as a result of the loocv procedure 4 variables initial paa dosage trb uv254 tn and no3 were selected as predictors of k as reported in fig 4a where mse reaches its minimum when Œª is such that only 4 predictor coefficients are non zero this result is consistent with recent findings on paa higher paa concentrations imply higher stability of the compound in water and lower decay while concentration of suspended solids and soluble organics which are well correlated to trb and uv254 increase k santoro et al 2015 dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018a 2018b elhalwagy et al 2021 a physical relationship between tn and no3 and paa decay has not been documented and these two parameters probably work here as proxies of the upstream activated sludge treatment operating conditions as for o d only paa dosage was selected as predictor fig 4c despite some limitations as the poor performance in o d prediction both models were integrated in the disinfection model in order to estimate in real time the impact of changing wastewater quality and dosage on paa decay 3 3 calibration of the e coli inactivation model data collected in lab scale batch disinfection experiments reported in fig 5 revealed the typical triphasic trend of bacteria inactivation by paa inter alia rossi et al 2007 antonelli et al 2013 santoro et al 2005 mcfadden et al 2017 dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018b experimental data suggest an initial lag phase with low inactivation rate for doses lower than approximately 10 mg l 1 min inactivation followed a log linear trend with a high inactivation rate between approximately 10 and 50 mg l 1 min then for higher doses there is a tailing phase with a drastic decrease of the inactivation rate dm dem mgm1 and mgm2 were calibrated on collected data and coefficients statistical significance and predictive performance indicators are reported in table 4 r2 adj akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic results suggest that mgm1 is the best performing model in terms of prediction mgm1 was formulated starting from the model presented by geeraerd et al 2000 this model was modified in mgm1 by introducing paa concentration in the inactivation rate equations as described in paragraph 2 1 3 eqs 14 17 which makes mgm1 suitable for inactivation by disinfectants the good fit of the model suggests that this hypothesis originally formulated for thermal inactivation could be extended to chemical disinfection where c could work as an aggregated parameter accounting as an example for the presence of several reactive sites to be oxidized on bacteria cell membranes and of the presence of external polymeric substances eps protecting the cell membrane inter alia kitis 2004 xue et al 2013 mgm1 was conceived to find a triphasic inactivation model which can be used in a eulerian model in dynamic simulations like for the dispersion model used in this work inactivation rates defined so far in the literature which can describe both lag log linear and tailing inactivation phases are explicitly dependent on time or dose examples are the well known hom model gy√ºrek and finch 1998 or the recent inactivation rate developed by elhalwagy et al 2021 this kind of inactivation rates would require a lagrangian approach where the time spent by each simulated bacteria particle in the reactor is known differently a eulerian model needs an inactivation rate which only depends on model state variables like the mgm1 moreover the integral of the mgm1 for batch conditions has an analytical solution eq 19 which depends only on the paa dose being consistent with the assumption on the primary importance of the dose usually made in disinfection modeling and providing a useful simplified representation of the inactivation phenomena mgm2 shares most of the characteristics of mgm1 except for the definition of c decay rate which is a first order not depending on paa concentration this assumption implies that the decay of all the components which protect bacteria cells from inactivation determining a lag depends only on time whatever is the concentration of paa mgm2 can catch a first lag phase with lower inactivation rate but lag is less sharp and the transition to the loglinear phase is smoother than for mgm1 fig 5b this is the main cause of lower predictive performance with respect to mgm1 mgm2 still has the advantage of being suitable for a eulerian model although the analytical solution of its integral in batch boundary conditions is not available the dm proved lower but similar performance to mgm1 but it needs only 3 instead of 4 parameters moreover all dm parameters are statistically significant while parameter x 0 of mgm1 as for mgm2 results as not statistically significant the fundamental drawback of dm is that it was derived directly in its integral form to describe disinfection in batch conditions dom√≠nguez henao et al 2018b and a derivative form of the inactivation rate is not available finally predictive performances of dem were the lowest since it cannot account for the presence of the initial lag due to its limited flexibility in describing the lag phase performance of mgm2 were only slightly higher than dem overall the comparison of those four inactivation models evidenced how different choices dramatically impact predicted inactivation for doses corresponding to lag and log linear phases which in this case study are lower than approximately 50 mg l 1 min differently all models are approximately equal for higher doses these considerations are evident in fig 5b dm as the model with the lowest number of parameters and the highest predictive performance as mgm1 was used to model continuous flow disinfection in stationary conditions according to the sfm approach paragraph 3 4 since dm does not have a derivative form dem mgm1 and mgm2 were used and compared to model continuous flow disinfection in dynamic conditions paragraph 3 6 3 4 prediction of paa and e coli residuals in stationary conditions the use of the sfm to predict paa and e coli concentrations at the outlet of the pilot reactor was validated in experiments under stationary paa dosage and flow rate conditions plots of observed against estimated paa and e coli concentrations are reported in fig 6 two modes of use of the sfm were compared in the first case paa and e coli were estimated considering paa decay as stationary and independent from wastewater quality k and o d calibrated on the pooled data coming from all paa decay batch experiments were used in the second mode paa decay parameters k and o d were estimated from current effluent quality parameters using the regression model described in paragraph 3 2 results evidenced how accounting for the impact of varying wastewater quality improved predictive performance r2 increased from 0 22 to 0 28 for paa concentration and from 0 86 to 0 88 for e coli prediction despite the improvement predictive performance of paa residual is still globally poor while prediction accuracy of e coli remains low in higher concentration cases as can be observed in fig 6b this was probably because wastewater quality was not stationary throughout the pilot disinfection experiments which is not accounted by sfm and suggesting the importance of modeling the disinfection reactor as a dynamic system where fluctuations in wastewater quality have to be considered when predicting disinfectant and bacteria residuals at given time 3 5 prediction of paa and e coli residuals in dynamic conditions the model of paa disinfection was validated on continuous flow experiments in the pilot reactor with variable effluent flow rate and quality paragraph 2 1 5 time trends of flow rate and turbidity as most relevant effluent quality parameter in determining both paa decay and initial e coli concentration are reported in fig 7 a b the disinfection model proved good prediction accuracy both for initial e coli and paa concentration at the outlet of the pilot reactor as reported in fig 7e f paa concentration was well approximated r2 0 84 but some fluctuations were not caught by the model results were compared to predictions of paa residuals when neglecting the impact of effluent quality on paa decay and assuming constant k and o d calibrated on pooled lab experiments as shown in fig 7e f this simplification decreased prediction accuracy of paa residual r2 0 57 most of the worsening is due to predictions in case of higher dosage as expected since paa follows a first order decay rate real time update of paa decay according to effluent quality avoided underestimation of paa residual predictions of e coli residuals using dem mgm1 and mgm2 as inactivation rates were compared and mgm2 resulted the best option in terms of predictive performance r2 0 58 as reported in fig 7c d the model can reproduce e coli and paa dynamics accounting for the impact of fluctuations in flow rate and wastewater quality as can be seen in fig 7c mgm2 is the best option since it better predicts e coli fluctuations both at 1 and 3 mg l 1 as already argued from inactivation models in batch conditions the choice of the inactivation rate model impacted mainly the prediction at low dosage while predictions at higher dosage were approximately equivalent fig 7d at low paa dosage even small variations of contact time or decay rate can significantly affect the inactivation rate which can shift among the lag log linear and tailing phase differently higher dosage moves the inactivation rate in the tailing phase with lower impact of dose variations importantly e coli final concentrations were predicted correctly also thanks to accurate predictions of initial e coli concentration fig 7c d monte carlo simulations propagated model uncertainty onto predictions as reported in fig 7g l providing more robust estimate of disinfection outputs particularly confidence interval comprises most of e coli concentration data differently still some fluctuations in paa concentrations do not fall inside monte carlo confidence intervals 4 conclusions in this work a mechanistic model for continuous flow paa disinfection was developed calibrated and validated the model proved good performances both in stationary and dynamic effluent flow rate and quality the model was conceived from some well established models but it introduces some key innovations to improve wastewater chemical disinfection reactor hydraulics was described as two 1 dimensional dispersion model in parallel with flow rate varying dispersion parameters which estimate in real time how flow rate variations impact contact tank hydrodynamics impact of dosage and varying effluent quality on paa decay kinetics was estimated by a linear regression model which was used to update in real time paa decay parameters several e coli inactivation kinetics models were compared different models lead to significantly different predictions at low paa dosages when the triphasic behavior of the kinetics is impacting two new inactivation kinetic models mgm1 and mgm2 were proposed which were developed from the model developed by geeraerd et al 2000 for thermal inactivation both models can be integrated in eulerian models like dispersion models and can describe the triphasic behavior of inactivation by chemicals like paa the developed disinfection model was used in dynamic numerical simulations and validated on pilot scale experiments successful validations highlighted the importance of modeling the disinfection process as a dynamic system while integrating regression models to real time update model inputs and parameters being initial bacteria concentration disinfectant decay and hydraulics parameters in light of these innovations and advantages the developed disinfection model could be very useful for off line optimization or on line control of chemical disinfection to face the always increasing need of minimization of both environmental impact and cost declaration of competing interest all authors

15666,microbial denitrification is a crucial biological process for the treatment of nitrogen polluted water traditional denitrification process consumes external organic carbon leading to an increase in treatment costs we developed a novel sulfide driven denitrification methane oxidation sdmo system that integrates autotrophic denitrification ad and denitrification anaerobic methane oxidation damo for cost effective denitrification and biogas utilization in situ two sdmo systems were operated for 735 days with nitrate and nitrite serving as electron acceptors to explore the performance of sewage denitrification and characterize metabolic mechanisms results showed sdmo system could reach as high as 100 efficiency of nitrogen removal and biogas desulfurization without an external carbon source when hrt was 10 days and inflow nitrogen concentrations were 50 100 mgn l 1 besides nitrate was a preferable electron acceptor for sdmo system biogas not only enhanced nitrogen removal but also intensified the damo nitrogen removed through damo contribution doubled as original period from 2 9 mgn l d 1 to 6 2 mgn l d 1 and the ratio of nitrate removal through ad to damo was 1 2 1 with nitrate as electron acceptor while nitrogen removed almost all through ad contribution and damo was weaken as before the ratio of nitrate removal through ad to damo was 21 2 1 with nitrite as electron acceptor biogas introduced into sdmo system with nitrate inspired the growth of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis from 0 3 to 19 6 and motivated its potentiality to remove nitrate without anme archaea participation accompanying with gene mfne upregulating 100 times according to the reconstructed genome from binning analysis the dramatically upregulated gene mfne was derived from candidatus methylomirabilis which may represent a novel metabolism pathway for damo bacteria to replace the role of archaea for nitrate reduction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfide driven denitrification methane oxidation autotrophic denitrification biogas utilization in situ biogas desulfurization sewage nitrogen removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sewage nitrogen removal is a global environmental issue especially in china producing more than 50 billion tons of domestic sewage annually li et al 2018 traditional sewage treatments for nitrogen contaminants are nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification processes that consume organic carbon sources van rijn et al 2006 the external carbon sources e g methanol and acetate are needed to be added in traditional sewage treatment process which not only increases operational costs but also is inconsistent with the goal of carbon reduction and neutralization badza et al 2020 in china sewage discharge standards have been improved since the 14th five year plan and now most sewage treatment plants need to develop facilities for advanced nitrogen removal to meet the new standards the cost for treatment would increase further if the sewage treatment process still depended on adding large amounts of organic carbon the discovery of denitrification anaerobic methane oxidation damo is of much interest due to its economical applicability and novel biological mechanisms it provides a new approach for sewage nitrogen removal islas lima et al 2004 raghoebarsing et al 2006 damo utilizes nitrate serving as terminal electron acceptors and ch4 serving as electron donors by damo archaea anme 2d and damo bacteria phylum nc10 cai et al 2021 lim et al 2021 liu et al 2020 2021 sheng qiang et al 2019 xie et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 damo archaea convert nitrate to nitrite via reverse methanogenesis whereas damo bacteria utilize nitrite serving as electron acceptors via an intra aerobic methane oxidation pathway by candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 these reactions are thermodynamically represented as follows caldwell et al 2008 raghoebarsing et al 2006 c h 4 4 no 3 c o 2 4 no 2 2 h 2 o Œ¥ g 0 467 kj mol 1 ch 4 3 c h 4 8 no 2 8 h 3 c o 2 4 n 2 10 h 2 o Œ¥ g 0 928 kj mol 1 ch 4 damo could reduce the cost for denitrification because ch4 is an inexpensive carbonaceous organic source it was widely produced from sludge anaerobic digestion as the main component of biogas ghyselbrecht et al 2019 anaerobic digestion producing biogas has become the main approach for excess sludge reduction and recycling around the world hossain et al 2018 li et al 2018 yet as the main energy gas of biogas ch4 is a significant greenhouse gas that contributes 20 to the global greenhouse effect ettwig et al 2008 wang et al 2020 therefore utilizing ch4 from anaerobic digestion biogas would be economical and environmental friendly however the coexist gas h2s is seen as an undesirable gas that could corrode engines and be harmful to human health baspinar et al 2011 guerrero et al 2016 thus although biogas desulfurization is imperative for ch4 recycling the process needs a chemical agent which further increases costs abatzoglou and boivin 2009 fortuny et al 2008 montebello et al 2012 osorio and torres 2009 autotrophic denitrification ad using sulfides as electron donors for denitrification has been studied for many years beristain cardoso et al 2006 chen et al 2010 reyes avila et al 2004 shao et al 2010 and using ad to remove h2s in biogas and enhance sewage nitrogen removal has been reported in some studies di capua et al 2015 liu et al 2019 vaiopoulou et al 2005 however there are few studies about simultaneously utilizing ch4 and h2s in biogas for denitrification because of the difficulties in microbial domestication and ambiguity in the mechanisms previous studies have shown that ch4 and s2 can serve as co electron donors wang et al 2020 thus a sulfide driven denitrification methane oxidation sdmo system for integrating ad and damo was developed in this study using biogas in situ for enhancing sewage denitrification such a system may not only enhance nitrogen contaminant removal without an external carbon source but also realize biogas utilization and desulfurization in situ without additional costs nitrate and nitrite are common components existing in sewage treatment process galloway et al 2008 two systems feeding with nitrate and nitrite were constructed to investigate the appropriate electron acceptors for this sdmo system the key objectives of this study were 1 to explore the performance of the coupled sdmo system for sewage denitrification and biogas desulfurization without external carbon added 2 to investigate the effect of nitrate and nitrite on the sdmo system and identify the appropriate electron acceptors 3 to reveal the metabolic pathways and microbial mechanisms for nitrogen removal and biogas desulfurization in the sdmo system to achieve these objectives the systems were built in egsb expanded granular sludge bed reactors and ran for 735 days with different operating conditions chemical analysis of the main contaminants and biological analysis at typical stages via illumina sequencing and metagenome added binning analysis was carried out 2 materials and methods 2 1 the sdmo system described based on the egsb reactor setup and operation two continuous flow reactors a and b were equipped with the egsb structure fig s1 and the details of reactor system were described in the supplementary material two reactors continuously ran for 735 days along with different condition transformations table s1 the electron donor for reactor a and b was 99 9 ch4 for stages i iv then converted into simulated biogas 75 ch4 24 7 co2 0 3 h2s for stages v vii to investigate the performance of the two systems with ch4 and h2s serving as co electron donors for stage viii the electron donor was converted into 99 9 ch4 to explore the performance of the coupled system after the effect of biogas then a blank control was proceeded at stage ix by using ar to replace ch4 the conditions of stages x xi xii were the same as ii iii iv respectively to compare the performance of systems with the previous stages the sludge from reactors a and b at the end of stage vii was collected in anaerobic bottles for kinetic batch tests with different feeding gases to demonstrate the phenomenon in reactors which was described in the supplementary material 2 2 chemical analysis water samples of the two reactors were collected from the inflow tank and number 0 sampling outlet every day and purified using 0 22 Œºm filters pes pall usa to detect the concentration of nitrite nitrate and sulfate in water samples the gas inflow was controlled by an electronic flowmeter s49 32 dalian china and the volume of gas outflow was measured with a wet gas flow meter the component of inflow gas and outflow gas were detected every day by gas analyzer t1800 i shenzhen china and gas chromatography gc 7890a agilent usa the ph of inflow and outflow were measured by a ph orp meter phs 25 shanghai china the suspended solids and volatile suspended solids were determined using a muffle furnace following standard methods gilcreas 1966 the details of these chemical analysis were presented in supplementary material 2 3 microorganism analysis 2 3 1 dna extraction and illumina sequencing analysis at the end of each typical stage the sludge samples of two reactors were collected from sampling outlets 2 and 4 fig s1 to analyze the microbial communities sludge samples were frozen using liquid nitrogen and then stored at 80 c until use total genomic dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc usa according to the steps described in the manufacturer s instructions to analyze the microbial community structure in the reactors the total extracted dna was used for high throughput sequencing the hypervariable regions v6 v8 of 16srrna genes were amplified with primers 926f 1392r to obtain the amplicon sequencing lu et al 2015 the amplicons were sequenced via the miseq sequencing technique performed by an illumina miseq sequencer illumina san diego ca usa the sequences of 16srrna genes with a similarity of 97 or more were classified into operational taxonomic units otus and the abundance of otus was calculated at the genus level on the basis of sequencing analysis there was little difference in microorganism community structure between the two sampling outlets as figs s2 and s3 show this was attributed to the uplifting gas making sludge that was homogeneous in the reaction column thus the analysis for the microorganism communities only utilized the result from number 2 outlet sludge samples obtained 16srrna gene sequence data of sludge samples were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive bioproject prjna766825 biosample accession samn21891813 sra srr16304035 2 3 2 metagenome and binning analysis sludge samples of two reactors at stage iv vii viii and xii were collected for metagenome analysis to explore the microbial metabolism pathways with different electron donors the samples from reactor a on day 410 and 657 were collected to proceed to mag metagenomic assembled genome reconstruction and binning analysis metagenomic binning was performed in each sample s contigs the genomic dna of these samples was extracted as mentioned above and the details for analysis process was presented in the supplementary material the metagenome sequences of these samples were uploaded to the genbank sequence database bioproject prjna766825 biosample accession samn21891813 sra srr16938232 and srr16938233 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of sdmo system in the two egsb reactors the two egsb reactors were operated for 735 days including 12 stages with different influent nitrate or nitrite concentrations hydraulic retention times and feeding gases figs 1 and 2 according to the detail performance of two egsb reactors described in supplementary material it was concluded that 14 6 of influent nitrate was reduced via damo at stage ii in reactor a the total nitrate removal rate at this stage was 5 0 mgn l d 1 and the damo 2 9 mgn l d 1 in stage vii other operational parameters were the same as stage ii the h2s introduced in stage vii led to 7 6 mgn l d 1 nitrate that was removed completely according to eqs 1 3 the actual nitrate removal rate was 13 8 mgn l d 1 indicating that about 6 2 mgn l d 1 nitrate was removed with ch4 the ratio of nitrate removal through ad and damo was 1 2 1 at stage vii details of calculation was described in supplementary material nitrate removal through ch4 contribution at this stage doubled to stage ii this demonstrated that biogas could enhance nitrate removal efficiency and nitrate removal rate of the sdmo system while accelerating the damo in reactor a in reactor b it was calculated that more than 27 7 nitrite was removed via damo at stage ii at that stage nitrite removal rate was 10 3 mgn l d 1 and over 5 5 mgn l d 1 nitrite was removed through ch4 contribution when feeding biogas h2s serving as electron donor led to 12 7 mgn l d 1 nitrite consumed according to 2 the consumed nitrite was lower than 12 7 mgn l d 1 at stages v and vi which indicated that sulfur could be reserved in the reactor and served as electron donor again at the beginning of stage vii only 0 6 mgn l d 1 nitrite was removed through ch4 contribution at stage vii the ratio of nitrite removal through ad and damo was 21 2 1 at stage vii details of calculation was described in supplementary material nitrate removal through ch4 contribution at this stage was one tenth of stage ii although reactor b could achieve a higher nitrite removal efficiency and nitrite removal rate than reactor a for the original stages i iv the nitrogen removal and damo could not proceed well in reactor b after biogas was introduced v xii as the nitrogen removal rate in different systems shown in table 1 nitrogen removal could be enhanced in this study than traditional damo system in sbr sequencing batch reactor and nitrogen removal through damo contribution could also be enhanced slightly in egsb a reactor daims et al 2015 haroon et al 2013 hu et al 2011 raghoebarsing et al 2006 meanwhile mbfr membrane biofilm reactor would greatly develop the removal rate leading from high mass transfer of methane and could be utilized in this system to develop nitrogen removal rate further

comparison of sdmo systems with different electron acceptors compared with reactors a and b table 2 the entire system proceeded differently especially after biogas was introduced after the operation of stage i a part of sludge washed out from the reactor and the sludge concentration became almost stable in both reactors with 17 g l 1 mlss 6 g l 1 mlvss in egsb a and 23 g l 1 mlss 9 g l 1 mlvss in egsb b the effect of mlvss variations on nitrogen removal rate in each reactor could be ignored before biogas introduction stages ii iv nitrogen removal efficiency and removal rate in reactor b ii 51 3 10 3 mgn l d 1 iii 55 6 5 6 mgn l d 1 iv 97 3 4 9 mgn l d 1 were all higher than those in reactor a ii 24 9 5 0 mgn l d 1 iii 39 8 4 0 mgn l d 1 iv 76 7 3 8 mgn l d 1 when feeding with biogas stages v vii the nitrogen removal efficiency was enhanced to as high as 100 in reactors a and b the ratio of nitrate removal through ad and damo was 1 2 1 in reactor a and 21 2 1 in reactor b however nitrogen removed via damo was intensified in reactor a 2 times as before and weakened in reactor b one tenth as before after ch4 served as electrons donors again x xii the performance of reactor a recovered gradually but the nitrogen removal efficiency in reactor b decreased once more to conclude nitrate was the proper electron acceptor for the sdmo system and in that case biogas addition would not only enhance the total nitrogen removal efficiency but also intensify damo proceeding in the sdmo system moreover the same variation law was demonstrated in the batch tests whereas biogas introducing to sdmo system led to more nitrogen removal due to damo contribution in group a2 fig s4 detailed performance of batch tests was supplied in the supplementary material 3 3 microbial community structure in sdmo system to investigate the microbial community in both reactors at different stages 16s rrna gene sequencing was conducted the details of microbial diversity and microbial community structure on phylum level for two reactors were described in supplementary material different from previous studies raghoebarsing et al 2006 that anme archaea mediate damo phylum nc10 was the dominant bacteria in reactor a after biogas was introduced as for reactor b the abundance of nc10 only increased to 1 5 after biogas was introduced even though nc10 is well known for reducing nitrite under feeding with ch4 ettwig et al 2009 welte et al 2016 3 3 1 relative proportions of genera before biogas introduction stages i iv the relative proportions of genera in the two sdmo reactors under different stages are given in fig 3 the dominant genus for both reactors was ignavibacterium a proportion of 17 6 in reactor a and 13 4 in reactor b ignavibacterium was always found in the damo system it is regarded as nitrite reducing bacteria chai et al 2020 ding et al 2017 yu et al 2017 responsible for functional genus about nitrogen removal at the original stages in reactors a and b other methylotrophic bacteria like methyloversatilis methylomonas and methylotenera were also found in the two reactors methylomonas in reactor b accounted for 2 50 which was similar to reactor a and methylotenera could reach 4 09 in reactor b which was higher than that in reactor a 1 24 methyloversatilis only existed in reactor a with an abundance of 5 9 they were the main methylotrophic denitrification microorganisms responsible for nitrogen removal in both reactors at the original stages in previous stages the major functional genera were ignavibacterium and some methylotrophic bacteria for both reactors however the reported damo archaea and bacteria candidatus methanoperedens or candidatus methylomirabilis were not found in this stage although the nitrogen compounds could be removed with ch4 serving as the only electron donors 3 3 2 relative proportions of genera when biogas was the feeding gas stages v vii after biogas was introduced in reactor a the dominant genus converted to armatimonadetes gp5 with an abundance of 55 5 and gradually replaced ignavibacterium genus armatimonadetes gp5 has been found in specific anammox systems with low ammonium levels mi et al 2017 nitrite generated much faster than before through ad and lead to the dramatic growth of armatimonadetes gp5 stages v and vi additionally damo bacteria candidate division nc10 unclassified and ad bacteria thiobacillus appeared with abundances of 3 5 and 3 3 respectively at stage vii ad bacteria thiobacillus increased slightly to 4 7 while damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis increased dramatically from 0 3 to 19 6 the community structure from metagenomics analysis also showed the dramatic growth of damo bacteria especially candidatus methylomirabilis fig 4 the biogas introducing in reactor a made the co growth of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis and ad bacteria thiobacillus candidatus methylomirabilis is reported to use nitrite produced from damo archaea anme 2d for denitrification in damo ettwig et al 2010 2008 2009 he et al 2016 damo bacteria used nitrite produced from ad bacteria here leading to no anme archaea growth in addition damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis which is reported to have long generation times ettwig et al 2010 raghoebarsing et al 2006 could grow fast in this sdmo system due to the faster growth and higher nitrate reduction rate of ad bacteria than damo archaea genus armatimonadetes gp5 decreased sharply at this stage perhaps attributed to the dramatic growth of candidatus methylomirabilis which suppressed the growth of armatimonadetes gp5 when biogas was introduced in reactor b genus thiobacillus increased sharply to 23 6 and was stable at 40 9 thiobacillus was thought to be the ad bacteria that could use sulfide as electron donor and use nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptors beristain cardoso et al 2006 koenig and liu 2001 pokorna and zabranska 2015 shao et al 2010 zhang and lampe 1999 this could increase dramatically after biogas containing h2s is introduced at entire stages of reactor b with nitrite as electron donor damo bacteria genus candidatus methylomirabilis was not found and candidate division nc10 unclassified was the only genus of phylum nc10 even though genus candidatus methylomirabilis is reported to use nitrite serving as the electron acceptor for denitrification easier ettwig et al 2010 2008 2009 he et al 2016 because ad bacteria competed with damo bacteria for nitrite as the only electron acceptors in reactor b 3 3 3 relative proportions of genera after biogas introduction stages viii xii after ch4 served as electron donor again in reactor a damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis increased to 27 8 and candidate division nc10 unclassified were almost stable the community structure from metagenomics analysis showed the same pattern in that candidatus methylomirabilis grew after biogas was introduced fig 4 this implied that the introduced biogas could clear obstacles for candidatus methylomirabilis growth and the growth of candidatus methylomirabilis was dramatical genus thiobacillus dominated the system with an abundance of 40 9 from stage vi to stage viii even when the feeding gas was changed to ch4 again at stage viii then it decreased to 16 3 during the last three stages x xii operation without feeding biogas damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis were reported to prioritize nitrite and work with damo archaea anme for nitrate removal haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 however genus candidatus methylomirabilis governed reactor a after biogas was introduced even though electron acceptors were nitrate based during all stages whereas the abundance of candidatus methylomirabilis was low in reactor b with nitrite as the electron acceptor in reactor a the damo and ad bacteria could cooperate to reduce nitrate after biogas added whereas ad bacteria could reduce nitrate with a part of nitrite accumulation and damo bacteria could grow with the accumulated nitrite for electron acceptors besides the sulfide driven in reactor a made gene mfne up regulate in candidatus methylomirabilis and motivated a potential pathway for nitrate reduction discussed in section 3 4 so candidatus methylomirabilis could also increase after biogas was removed while in reactor b with nitrite serving as electron acceptors the damo and ad bacteria competed for nitrite as electron acceptors and damo bacteria could not be superior to ad bacteria after added biogas thus the damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis increased in reactor a but did not appear in reactor b after added biogas that is why nitrogen contaminants removed via ch4 contribution increased in reactor a whereas the performance of reactor b was corrupted after biogas was introduced biogas introduction changed the microorganism community structure and shifted the dominant bacteria of sdmo systems ad bacteria grew in the two reactors and accelerated the growth of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis when the electron acceptor was nitrate but suppressed its growth when nitrite served as electron acceptor previous study showed that the h2s have no effect on nitrate reduction but inhibit nitrite reduction pan et al 2013 in this study damo via candidatus methylomirabilis developed after biogas was temporarily introduced it may attribute to that the h2s in biogas for ad could not only supply nitrite for the growth of damo bacteria but also inhibit the competition of other microorganisms such as armatimonadetes gp5 3 4 metagenome and binning analysis for the metabolism of no3 s2 and ch4 to reveal the functional gene variation and metabolic mechanisms in the sdmo system the sludge samples from two reactors at stages iv vii viii and xii were collected for metagenomics analysis from the nmds and pcoa analyses fig s6 the two systems were similar at original stages i iv and differed when feeding with biogas stage vii the divergence was even more obvious in the later periods stages viii and xii the key metabolic pathways in terms of no3 s2 and ch4 correlation in the systems are given in fig 5 correspondingly fig s7 shows the abundance of functional genes involved in no3 s2 and ch4 metabolism in each sample from the perspective of metagenomics 3 4 1 the metagenomics analysis for the metabolism of no3 and s2 the denitrification pathways with the variation of key genes are shown in figs 5 n and s7b the nitrate pathway converting nitrate to nitrite via genes napab and narghi were upregulated about 2 times in reactor a and 1 5 times in reactor b because of the denitrification that developed in both systems after biogas was introduced the process of transforming nitrite to nitric oxide and then into nitrous oxide via genes nirs and norbc was also upregulated in two reactors after stage vii by contrast gene nosz converting nitrous oxide to nitrogen gas was downregulated around 40 in reactor a and upregulated 50 in reactor b which is attributed to the inhibition of h2s for n2o reduction pan et al 2013 after biogas was introduced in the two reactors genes for dissimilatory nitrite reduction were found in the two systems although the effluent ammonia concentration of the two reactors was only 0 4 mg l 1 functional genes for sulfide oxidizing to sulfate sat aprab and dsrab were upregulated around 2 times in both reactors gene fccb which converts sulfide to sulfur was upregulated 2 4 times in reactor a and 5 6 times in reactor b which is consistent with the finding in section 3 1 that sulfur was retained in reactors and served as electron donor again when influent loading rate increased figs 5 s s7c genes for conversion between polysulfides hydb and sqr were also upregulated more in reactor b than reactor a genes coding for sulfide metabolism would be upregulated more in the sdmo system when the electron acceptor was nitrite it was consistent with that ad bacteria increased more in reactor b with nitrite as electron acceptor although thiosulfate was not detected in the operation periods the genes coding for converting thiosulfate to sulfide phsa psra and sulfate soxabcdxyz existed in the two reactors 3 4 2 the metagenomics analysis for the metabolism of ch4 pmoa the character gene for ch4 oxidation in candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera is known for encoding particular methane monooxygenase enzyme to oxidize ch4 to methanol chen et al 2014 deutzmann and schink 2011 wang et al 2012 zhu et al 2012 and was 1 4 times higher in reactor b than reactor a at stage iv it was upregulated about 5 times after reactor a was influenced by biogas whereas still downregulated by about 50 in reactor b at stages viii and xii figs 5 ch4 s7a the soluble methane monooxygenase enzyme 1 14 13 25 which also leads to the pathway converting ch4 to methanol was 2 3 times higher in reactor b than reactor a before biogas was introduced stage iv and downregulated over 90 in the two reactors after it was introduced stages vii viii and xii gene pmoa and enzyme 1 14 13 25 were functional factor for damo and they were all higher in reactor b at original four stages but increased in reactor a and higher than reactor b at stages after biogas introducing the variation of them explains why nitrogen removal via damo was higher in reactor b at original stages ii iv but decreased at later stages leading to lower performance of reactor b after biogas introduction stages vii xii gene mcra which is the key gene for the reverse methanogenic process in anme archaea hallam et al 2003 was undetected in both reactors regardless of whether nitrate or nitrite served as an electron acceptor this agrees with the results of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing in that the abundance of archaea was much lower than bacteria this is different from a previous study that showed microorganism communities are dominated by anme archaea and nc10 bacteria when electron acceptors are nitrate raghoebarsing et al 2006 instead mfne which is the key gene for methanofuran mfr biosynthesis was upregulated around 100 times as stage vii in reactor a after biogas was introduced stages viii and xii it was speculated that the absence of anme archaea was due to the motivated potential function of gene mfne in nitrate based sdmo system besides the increase in the gene abundance of mfne was similar to the variation of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis it is inferred that gene mfne was a particular functional gene belonging to candidatus methylomirabilis in the sdmo system to verify this hypothesis the binning analysis for sludge samples from reactor a was carried out 3 4 3 binning analysis to infer a new pathway for ch4 metabolism a 410d and a 657d were two samples used for binning analysis after biogas was introduced at stages vii and xii to explore if gene mfne was related to candidatus methylomirabilis a total of 58 mags with completeness 90 and contamination 5 were identified from these two samples fig s8 then the genome in these mags was explored in detail and two bins of them a 410d bin 82 and a 657d bin 140 which discussed mainly were shown in fig s9 the third and fourth circles from outside indicate kegg assigned genes in color codes it showed the gene mfne existed in these two bins and according to kegg annotation for all mags gene mfne only came from these two bins table s3 meanwhile the nr annotation showed both of these mags were damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis whereas a 410d bin 82 was candidatus methylomirabilis lanthanidiphila and a 657d bin 140 was candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera according to the kegg assigned genes in the third and fourth circles of genome drafts the metabolism pathway for ch4 and no3 in candidatus methylomirabilis of sdmo system was shown in fig 6 the same as previous study ettwig et al 2010 candidatus methylomirabilis owned all genes for aerobic methane oxidation ch4 was oxidized to methanol by oxygen produced from nitric oxide in situ and then converting to formaldehyde under the control of gene mdh the gene fdha encoding glutathione independent formaldehyde dehydrogenase for directly oxidizing formaldehyde to formate was missed in the genome and the oxidation of formaldehyde proceeded by the h4mpt dependent pathway under the control of genes fae mtdb mch ftr fmd and fwd chistoserdova et al 1998 vorholt 2002 finally the formate was oxidized to co2 under the control of genes fdog fdhf and fdwa gene mfne encoding 5 aminomethyl 3 furanmethanol phosphate kinase was a key gene responsible for the biosynthesis of mfr which was a major cofactor in the h4mpt dependent pathway for formaldehyde oxidation and assumed to be an analogue from methanogenic archaea cai et al 2021 chistoserdova et al 1998 jones et al 1985 vorholt 2002 in the genome of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis the other mfr biosynthesis genes mfnd and mfnf did not increase as much as mfne thus the sharply up regulating gene mfne must have other function in sdmo system on the other hand damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis is reported to utilize nitrite readily and work with anme archaea to reduce nitrate with a slow growth rate cai et al 2015 deng et al 2009 haroon et al 2013 hu et al 2011 raghoebarsing et al 2006 welte et al 2016 although it has the potential to reduce nitrate alone due to its comprehensive genome ettwig et al 2010 he et al 2016 almost all studies have found it grows with anme archaea and plays an important role in nitrite reduction while candidatus methylomirabilis could grow alone without anme participation with nitrate as electron acceptor in sdmo system in damo archaea ch4 was oxidized to co2 via reserve methanogenesis where the cofactor mfr was the major enzyme haroon et al 2013 and in this sdmo system the damo bacteria could also reduce nitrate alone accompany with sharply increasing of mfr biosynthesis gene mfne the upregulating gene mfne in candidatus methylomirabilis may replace the role of damo archaea to make it reduce nitrate in this system besides comparing with stage vii under biogas as feeding gas the abundance of gene mfne increased 100 times at stage viii and xii after removing biogas and feeding with ch4 again it may attribute to that the h2s in biogas could serve as electron donors for nitrate reduction and supply nitrite for damo bacteria at stage vii after biogas was removed from the reactor at stage viii and xii damo bacteria must reduce nitrate alone without neither damo archaea nor ad bacteria participation leading to the dramatically upregulating of gene mfne it was speculated that gene mfne inspired the potentiality of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis to replace the role of anme archaea for nitrate reduction and implied a pontential pathway in sdmo system however what was the real and specific function of gene mfne in damo bacteria warrant study further 3 5 the proposed metabolic network in the sdmo system and its application potential utilizing h2s in biogas to enhance sewage nitrogen removal has been reported many times deng et al 2009 montebello et al 2012 vaiopoulou et al 2005 however utilizing ch4 and h2s from biogas at the same time has been rarely reported in this study a sdmo system for utilizing ch4 and h2s in biogas together was built biogas temporarily induced in the sdmo system with nitrate serving as electron acceptors leading to the co growth of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis and ad bacteria thiobacillus biogas introduction motivated the potentiality in candidatus methylomirabilis to reduce nitrate alone accompanying with the methanofuran biosynthesis gene mfne dramatically upregulating which implied a pontential pathway in sdmo system however how biogas motivates the potentiality in candidatus methylomirabilis and what was the specific function of the gene mfne needs to be studied further which would provide a new perspective in the field according to metabolic pathways and functional genes in the two systems the schematic diagram of metabolic pathways of assimilation and dissimilation for ch4 no3 and s2 in the sdmo system is shown in fig 7 in the sdmo system nitrate metabolism accepted the electrons from ch4 and s2 metabolism to reduce nitrate and nitrite via the denitrification process denitrification proceeded through the special pathway where nitric oxide is converted to nitrogen and oxygen in candidatus methylomirabilis ettwig et al 2010 the intracellular generated oxygen converts oxide ch4 to methanol and opens the ch4 metabolism pathway as fig 7 shows ch4 metabolism supplies electrons for traditional denitrification and produces acetyl coa for the tca cycle to supply energy for microorganism growth then acetyl coa could form l serine through the serine pathway and participate in sulfide metabolism which would also supply electrons for denitrification and render the sulfide oxidized to sulfate as the terminal product moreover denitrification could be realized without carbon sources replaced with ch4 and h2s from biogas the process therefore has high engineering application potential and minimizes costs because biogas is utilized in situ however the biogas flow rate and nitrogen removal rate were too low in this system as for mbfr would greatly developed the removal rate allegue et al 2018 guo et al 2013 kampman et al 2014 siegrist et al 2008 a membrane biofilm reactor would be used for operation of sdmo system to increase the nitrogen removal rate in further study besides the operation parameters would be optimized through improving the biogas flow rate and shortening the hrt to develop the processing load although the processing load should be developed further the unique phenomenon discovered in the system provided a new perspective for sulfide cycling and denitrification methane oxidation this approach has the potential to significantly improve sewage nitrogen removal efficiency 4 conclusions the novelty and innovative findings of our work provide a theoretical basis and technical directions for economic problems of traditional sewage treatment a sdmo system for simultaneous sewage denitrification without an external carbon source and biogas desulfurization in situ was built and operated for 735 days it could reach high efficiency of nitrogen removal and biogas desulfurization as high as 100 nitrate proved to be an appropriate electron acceptor for the sdmo system and biogas not only enhanced nitrogen removal but also intensified damo when biogas was introduced in the sdmo system feeding with nitrate nitrogen removed through damo doubled and the ratio of nitrogen removal through ad to damo was 1 2 1 moreover biogas introduced in the nitrate based sdmo system could motivate the potentiality of candidatus methylomirabilis to reduce nitrate without anme participation and clear obstacles for candidatus methylomirabilis growth in that case a pontential metabolism pathway controlling by the mfr biosynthesis gene mfne may be provided this research describes mechanisms for the theoretical innovations of damo and ad the results and findings of this work will provide new perspectives for promoting the denitrification treatment of domestic sewage and the recognition of the utility of utilizing

15666,microbial denitrification is a crucial biological process for the treatment of nitrogen polluted water traditional denitrification process consumes external organic carbon leading to an increase in treatment costs we developed a novel sulfide driven denitrification methane oxidation sdmo system that integrates autotrophic denitrification ad and denitrification anaerobic methane oxidation damo for cost effective denitrification and biogas utilization in situ two sdmo systems were operated for 735 days with nitrate and nitrite serving as electron acceptors to explore the performance of sewage denitrification and characterize metabolic mechanisms results showed sdmo system could reach as high as 100 efficiency of nitrogen removal and biogas desulfurization without an external carbon source when hrt was 10 days and inflow nitrogen concentrations were 50 100 mgn l 1 besides nitrate was a preferable electron acceptor for sdmo system biogas not only enhanced nitrogen removal but also intensified the damo nitrogen removed through damo contribution doubled as original period from 2 9 mgn l d 1 to 6 2 mgn l d 1 and the ratio of nitrate removal through ad to damo was 1 2 1 with nitrate as electron acceptor while nitrogen removed almost all through ad contribution and damo was weaken as before the ratio of nitrate removal through ad to damo was 21 2 1 with nitrite as electron acceptor biogas introduced into sdmo system with nitrate inspired the growth of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis from 0 3 to 19 6 and motivated its potentiality to remove nitrate without anme archaea participation accompanying with gene mfne upregulating 100 times according to the reconstructed genome from binning analysis the dramatically upregulated gene mfne was derived from candidatus methylomirabilis which may represent a novel metabolism pathway for damo bacteria to replace the role of archaea for nitrate reduction graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfide driven denitrification methane oxidation autotrophic denitrification biogas utilization in situ biogas desulfurization sewage nitrogen removal data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sewage nitrogen removal is a global environmental issue especially in china producing more than 50 billion tons of domestic sewage annually li et al 2018 traditional sewage treatments for nitrogen contaminants are nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification processes that consume organic carbon sources van rijn et al 2006 the external carbon sources e g methanol and acetate are needed to be added in traditional sewage treatment process which not only increases operational costs but also is inconsistent with the goal of carbon reduction and neutralization badza et al 2020 in china sewage discharge standards have been improved since the 14th five year plan and now most sewage treatment plants need to develop facilities for advanced nitrogen removal to meet the new standards the cost for treatment would increase further if the sewage treatment process still depended on adding large amounts of organic carbon the discovery of denitrification anaerobic methane oxidation damo is of much interest due to its economical applicability and novel biological mechanisms it provides a new approach for sewage nitrogen removal islas lima et al 2004 raghoebarsing et al 2006 damo utilizes nitrate serving as terminal electron acceptors and ch4 serving as electron donors by damo archaea anme 2d and damo bacteria phylum nc10 cai et al 2021 lim et al 2021 liu et al 2020 2021 sheng qiang et al 2019 xie et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 damo archaea convert nitrate to nitrite via reverse methanogenesis whereas damo bacteria utilize nitrite serving as electron acceptors via an intra aerobic methane oxidation pathway by candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 these reactions are thermodynamically represented as follows caldwell et al 2008 raghoebarsing et al 2006 c h 4 4 no 3 c o 2 4 no 2 2 h 2 o Œ¥ g 0 467 kj mol 1 ch 4 3 c h 4 8 no 2 8 h 3 c o 2 4 n 2 10 h 2 o Œ¥ g 0 928 kj mol 1 ch 4 damo could reduce the cost for denitrification because ch4 is an inexpensive carbonaceous organic source it was widely produced from sludge anaerobic digestion as the main component of biogas ghyselbrecht et al 2019 anaerobic digestion producing biogas has become the main approach for excess sludge reduction and recycling around the world hossain et al 2018 li et al 2018 yet as the main energy gas of biogas ch4 is a significant greenhouse gas that contributes 20 to the global greenhouse effect ettwig et al 2008 wang et al 2020 therefore utilizing ch4 from anaerobic digestion biogas would be economical and environmental friendly however the coexist gas h2s is seen as an undesirable gas that could corrode engines and be harmful to human health baspinar et al 2011 guerrero et al 2016 thus although biogas desulfurization is imperative for ch4 recycling the process needs a chemical agent which further increases costs abatzoglou and boivin 2009 fortuny et al 2008 montebello et al 2012 osorio and torres 2009 autotrophic denitrification ad using sulfides as electron donors for denitrification has been studied for many years beristain cardoso et al 2006 chen et al 2010 reyes avila et al 2004 shao et al 2010 and using ad to remove h2s in biogas and enhance sewage nitrogen removal has been reported in some studies di capua et al 2015 liu et al 2019 vaiopoulou et al 2005 however there are few studies about simultaneously utilizing ch4 and h2s in biogas for denitrification because of the difficulties in microbial domestication and ambiguity in the mechanisms previous studies have shown that ch4 and s2 can serve as co electron donors wang et al 2020 thus a sulfide driven denitrification methane oxidation sdmo system for integrating ad and damo was developed in this study using biogas in situ for enhancing sewage denitrification such a system may not only enhance nitrogen contaminant removal without an external carbon source but also realize biogas utilization and desulfurization in situ without additional costs nitrate and nitrite are common components existing in sewage treatment process galloway et al 2008 two systems feeding with nitrate and nitrite were constructed to investigate the appropriate electron acceptors for this sdmo system the key objectives of this study were 1 to explore the performance of the coupled sdmo system for sewage denitrification and biogas desulfurization without external carbon added 2 to investigate the effect of nitrate and nitrite on the sdmo system and identify the appropriate electron acceptors 3 to reveal the metabolic pathways and microbial mechanisms for nitrogen removal and biogas desulfurization in the sdmo system to achieve these objectives the systems were built in egsb expanded granular sludge bed reactors and ran for 735 days with different operating conditions chemical analysis of the main contaminants and biological analysis at typical stages via illumina sequencing and metagenome added binning analysis was carried out 2 materials and methods 2 1 the sdmo system described based on the egsb reactor setup and operation two continuous flow reactors a and b were equipped with the egsb structure fig s1 and the details of reactor system were described in the supplementary material two reactors continuously ran for 735 days along with different condition transformations table s1 the electron donor for reactor a and b was 99 9 ch4 for stages i iv then converted into simulated biogas 75 ch4 24 7 co2 0 3 h2s for stages v vii to investigate the performance of the two systems with ch4 and h2s serving as co electron donors for stage viii the electron donor was converted into 99 9 ch4 to explore the performance of the coupled system after the effect of biogas then a blank control was proceeded at stage ix by using ar to replace ch4 the conditions of stages x xi xii were the same as ii iii iv respectively to compare the performance of systems with the previous stages the sludge from reactors a and b at the end of stage vii was collected in anaerobic bottles for kinetic batch tests with different feeding gases to demonstrate the phenomenon in reactors which was described in the supplementary material 2 2 chemical analysis water samples of the two reactors were collected from the inflow tank and number 0 sampling outlet every day and purified using 0 22 Œºm filters pes pall usa to detect the concentration of nitrite nitrate and sulfate in water samples the gas inflow was controlled by an electronic flowmeter s49 32 dalian china and the volume of gas outflow was measured with a wet gas flow meter the component of inflow gas and outflow gas were detected every day by gas analyzer t1800 i shenzhen china and gas chromatography gc 7890a agilent usa the ph of inflow and outflow were measured by a ph orp meter phs 25 shanghai china the suspended solids and volatile suspended solids were determined using a muffle furnace following standard methods gilcreas 1966 the details of these chemical analysis were presented in supplementary material 2 3 microorganism analysis 2 3 1 dna extraction and illumina sequencing analysis at the end of each typical stage the sludge samples of two reactors were collected from sampling outlets 2 and 4 fig s1 to analyze the microbial communities sludge samples were frozen using liquid nitrogen and then stored at 80 c until use total genomic dna was extracted using the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories inc usa according to the steps described in the manufacturer s instructions to analyze the microbial community structure in the reactors the total extracted dna was used for high throughput sequencing the hypervariable regions v6 v8 of 16srrna genes were amplified with primers 926f 1392r to obtain the amplicon sequencing lu et al 2015 the amplicons were sequenced via the miseq sequencing technique performed by an illumina miseq sequencer illumina san diego ca usa the sequences of 16srrna genes with a similarity of 97 or more were classified into operational taxonomic units otus and the abundance of otus was calculated at the genus level on the basis of sequencing analysis there was little difference in microorganism community structure between the two sampling outlets as figs s2 and s3 show this was attributed to the uplifting gas making sludge that was homogeneous in the reaction column thus the analysis for the microorganism communities only utilized the result from number 2 outlet sludge samples obtained 16srrna gene sequence data of sludge samples were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive bioproject prjna766825 biosample accession samn21891813 sra srr16304035 2 3 2 metagenome and binning analysis sludge samples of two reactors at stage iv vii viii and xii were collected for metagenome analysis to explore the microbial metabolism pathways with different electron donors the samples from reactor a on day 410 and 657 were collected to proceed to mag metagenomic assembled genome reconstruction and binning analysis metagenomic binning was performed in each sample s contigs the genomic dna of these samples was extracted as mentioned above and the details for analysis process was presented in the supplementary material the metagenome sequences of these samples were uploaded to the genbank sequence database bioproject prjna766825 biosample accession samn21891813 sra srr16938232 and srr16938233 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of sdmo system in the two egsb reactors the two egsb reactors were operated for 735 days including 12 stages with different influent nitrate or nitrite concentrations hydraulic retention times and feeding gases figs 1 and 2 according to the detail performance of two egsb reactors described in supplementary material it was concluded that 14 6 of influent nitrate was reduced via damo at stage ii in reactor a the total nitrate removal rate at this stage was 5 0 mgn l d 1 and the damo 2 9 mgn l d 1 in stage vii other operational parameters were the same as stage ii the h2s introduced in stage vii led to 7 6 mgn l d 1 nitrate that was removed completely according to eqs 1 3 the actual nitrate removal rate was 13 8 mgn l d 1 indicating that about 6 2 mgn l d 1 nitrate was removed with ch4 the ratio of nitrate removal through ad and damo was 1 2 1 at stage vii details of calculation was described in supplementary material nitrate removal through ch4 contribution at this stage doubled to stage ii this demonstrated that biogas could enhance nitrate removal efficiency and nitrate removal rate of the sdmo system while accelerating the damo in reactor a in reactor b it was calculated that more than 27 7 nitrite was removed via damo at stage ii at that stage nitrite removal rate was 10 3 mgn l d 1 and over 5 5 mgn l d 1 nitrite was removed through ch4 contribution when feeding biogas h2s serving as electron donor led to 12 7 mgn l d 1 nitrite consumed according to 2 the consumed nitrite was lower than 12 7 mgn l d 1 at stages v and vi which indicated that sulfur could be reserved in the reactor and served as electron donor again at the beginning of stage vii only 0 6 mgn l d 1 nitrite was removed through ch4 contribution at stage vii the ratio of nitrite removal through ad and damo was 21 2 1 at stage vii details of calculation was described in supplementary material nitrate removal through ch4 contribution at this stage was one tenth of stage ii although reactor b could achieve a higher nitrite removal efficiency and nitrite removal rate than reactor a for the original stages i iv the nitrogen removal and damo could not proceed well in reactor b after biogas was introduced v xii as the nitrogen removal rate in different systems shown in table 1 nitrogen removal could be enhanced in this study than traditional damo system in sbr sequencing batch reactor and nitrogen removal through damo contribution could also be enhanced slightly in egsb a reactor daims et al 2015 haroon et al 2013 hu et al 2011 raghoebarsing et al 2006 meanwhile mbfr membrane biofilm reactor would greatly develop the removal rate leading from high mass transfer of methane and could be utilized in this system to develop nitrogen removal rate further more allegue et al 2018 guo et al 2013 kampman et al 2014 siegrist et al 2008 1 s 2 4 no 3 so 4 2 4 no 2 2 3 s 2 8 no 2 8 h 3 so 4 2 4 n 2 4 h 2 o 3 5 s 2 8 no 3 8 h 5 so 4 2 4 n 2 4 h 2 o 3 2 comparison of sdmo systems with different electron acceptors compared with reactors a and b table 2 the entire system proceeded differently especially after biogas was introduced after the operation of stage i a part of sludge washed out from the reactor and the sludge concentration became almost stable in both reactors with 17 g l 1 mlss 6 g l 1 mlvss in egsb a and 23 g l 1 mlss 9 g l 1 mlvss in egsb b the effect of mlvss variations on nitrogen removal rate in each reactor could be ignored before biogas introduction stages ii iv nitrogen removal efficiency and removal rate in reactor b ii 51 3 10 3 mgn l d 1 iii 55 6 5 6 mgn l d 1 iv 97 3 4 9 mgn l d 1 were all higher than those in reactor a ii 24 9 5 0 mgn l d 1 iii 39 8 4 0 mgn l d 1 iv 76 7 3 8 mgn l d 1 when feeding with biogas stages v vii the nitrogen removal efficiency was enhanced to as high as 100 in reactors a and b the ratio of nitrate removal through ad and damo was 1 2 1 in reactor a and 21 2 1 in reactor b however nitrogen removed via damo was intensified in reactor a 2 times as before and weakened in reactor b one tenth as before after ch4 served as electrons donors again x xii the performance of reactor a recovered gradually but the nitrogen removal efficiency in reactor b decreased once more to conclude nitrate was the proper electron acceptor for the sdmo system and in that case biogas addition would not only enhance the total nitrogen removal efficiency but also intensify damo proceeding in the sdmo system moreover the same variation law was demonstrated in the batch tests whereas biogas introducing to sdmo system led to more nitrogen removal due to damo contribution in group a2 fig s4 detailed performance of batch tests was supplied in the supplementary material 3 3 microbial community structure in sdmo system to investigate the microbial community in both reactors at different stages 16s rrna gene sequencing was conducted the details of microbial diversity and microbial community structure on phylum level for two reactors were described in supplementary material different from previous studies raghoebarsing et al 2006 that anme archaea mediate damo phylum nc10 was the dominant bacteria in reactor a after biogas was introduced as for reactor b the abundance of nc10 only increased to 1 5 after biogas was introduced even though nc10 is well known for reducing nitrite under feeding with ch4 ettwig et al 2009 welte et al 2016 3 3 1 relative proportions of genera before biogas introduction stages i iv the relative proportions of genera in the two sdmo reactors under different stages are given in fig 3 the dominant genus for both reactors was ignavibacterium a proportion of 17 6 in reactor a and 13 4 in reactor b ignavibacterium was always found in the damo system it is regarded as nitrite reducing bacteria chai et al 2020 ding et al 2017 yu et al 2017 responsible for functional genus about nitrogen removal at the original stages in reactors a and b other methylotrophic bacteria like methyloversatilis methylomonas and methylotenera were also found in the two reactors methylomonas in reactor b accounted for 2 50 which was similar to reactor a and methylotenera could reach 4 09 in reactor b which was higher than that in reactor a 1 24 methyloversatilis only existed in reactor a with an abundance of 5 9 they were the main methylotrophic denitrification microorganisms responsible for nitrogen removal in both reactors at the original stages in previous stages the major functional genera were ignavibacterium and some methylotrophic bacteria for both reactors however the reported damo archaea and bacteria candidatus methanoperedens or candidatus methylomirabilis were not found in this stage although the nitrogen compounds could be removed with ch4 serving as the only electron donors 3 3 2 relative proportions of genera when biogas was the feeding gas stages v vii after biogas was introduced in reactor a the dominant genus converted to armatimonadetes gp5 with an abundance of 55 5 and gradually replaced ignavibacterium genus armatimonadetes gp5 has been found in specific anammox systems with low ammonium levels mi et al 2017 nitrite generated much faster than before through ad and lead to the dramatic growth of armatimonadetes gp5 stages v and vi additionally damo bacteria candidate division nc10 unclassified and ad bacteria thiobacillus appeared with abundances of 3 5 and 3 3 respectively at stage vii ad bacteria thiobacillus increased slightly to 4 7 while damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis increased dramatically from 0 3 to 19 6 the community structure from metagenomics analysis also showed the dramatic growth of damo bacteria especially candidatus methylomirabilis fig 4 the biogas introducing in reactor a made the co growth of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis and ad bacteria thiobacillus candidatus methylomirabilis is reported to use nitrite produced from damo archaea anme 2d for denitrification in damo ettwig et al 2010 2008 2009 he et al 2016 damo bacteria used nitrite produced from ad bacteria here leading to no anme archaea growth in addition damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis which is reported to have long generation times ettwig et al 2010 raghoebarsing et al 2006 could grow fast in this sdmo system due to the faster growth and higher nitrate reduction rate of ad bacteria than damo archaea genus armatimonadetes gp5 decreased sharply at this stage perhaps attributed to the dramatic growth of candidatus methylomirabilis which suppressed the growth of armatimonadetes gp5 when biogas was introduced in reactor b genus thiobacillus increased sharply to 23 6 and was stable at 40 9 thiobacillus was thought to be the ad bacteria that could use sulfide as electron donor and use nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptors beristain cardoso et al 2006 koenig and liu 2001 pokorna and zabranska 2015 shao et al 2010 zhang and lampe 1999 this could increase dramatically after biogas containing h2s is introduced at entire stages of reactor b with nitrite as electron donor damo bacteria genus candidatus methylomirabilis was not found and candidate division nc10 unclassified was the only genus of phylum nc10 even though genus candidatus methylomirabilis is reported to use nitrite serving as the electron acceptor for denitrification easier ettwig et al 2010 2008 2009 he et al 2016 because ad bacteria competed with damo bacteria for nitrite as the only electron acceptors in reactor b 3 3 3 relative proportions of genera after biogas introduction stages viii xii after ch4 served as electron donor again in reactor a damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis increased to 27 8 and candidate division nc10 unclassified were almost stable the community structure from metagenomics analysis showed the same pattern in that candidatus methylomirabilis grew after biogas was introduced fig 4 this implied that the introduced biogas could clear obstacles for candidatus methylomirabilis growth and the growth of candidatus methylomirabilis was dramatical genus thiobacillus dominated the system with an abundance of 40 9 from stage vi to stage viii even when the feeding gas was changed to ch4 again at stage viii then it decreased to 16 3 during the last three stages x xii operation without feeding biogas damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis were reported to prioritize nitrite and work with damo archaea anme for nitrate removal haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 however genus candidatus methylomirabilis governed reactor a after biogas was introduced even though electron acceptors were nitrate based during all stages whereas the abundance of candidatus methylomirabilis was low in reactor b with nitrite as the electron acceptor in reactor a the damo and ad bacteria could cooperate to reduce nitrate after biogas added whereas ad bacteria could reduce nitrate with a part of nitrite accumulation and damo bacteria could grow with the accumulated nitrite for electron acceptors besides the sulfide driven in reactor a made gene mfne up regulate in candidatus methylomirabilis and motivated a potential pathway for nitrate reduction discussed in section 3 4 so candidatus methylomirabilis could also increase after biogas was removed while in reactor b with nitrite serving as electron acceptors the damo and ad bacteria competed for nitrite as electron acceptors and damo bacteria could not be superior to ad bacteria after added biogas thus the damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis increased in reactor a but did not appear in reactor b after added biogas that is why nitrogen contaminants removed via ch4 contribution increased in reactor a whereas the performance of reactor b was corrupted after biogas was introduced biogas introduction changed the microorganism community structure and shifted the dominant bacteria of sdmo systems ad bacteria grew in the two reactors and accelerated the growth of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis when the electron acceptor was nitrate but suppressed its growth when nitrite served as electron acceptor previous study showed that the h2s have no effect on nitrate reduction but inhibit nitrite reduction pan et al 2013 in this study damo via candidatus methylomirabilis developed after biogas was temporarily introduced it may attribute to that the h2s in biogas for ad could not only supply nitrite for the growth of damo bacteria but also inhibit the competition of other microorganisms such as armatimonadetes gp5 3 4 metagenome and binning analysis for the metabolism of no3 s2 and ch4 to reveal the functional gene variation and metabolic mechanisms in the sdmo system the sludge samples from two reactors at stages iv vii viii and xii were collected for metagenomics analysis from the nmds and pcoa analyses fig s6 the two systems were similar at original stages i iv and differed when feeding with biogas stage vii the divergence was even more obvious in the later periods stages viii and xii the key metabolic pathways in terms of no3 s2 and ch4 correlation in the systems are given in fig 5 correspondingly fig s7 shows the abundance of functional genes involved in no3 s2 and ch4 metabolism in each sample from the perspective of metagenomics 3 4 1 the metagenomics analysis for the metabolism of no3 and s2 the denitrification pathways with the variation of key genes are shown in figs 5 n and s7b the nitrate pathway converting nitrate to nitrite via genes napab and narghi were upregulated about 2 times in reactor a and 1 5 times in reactor b because of the denitrification that developed in both systems after biogas was introduced the process of transforming nitrite to nitric oxide and then into nitrous oxide via genes nirs and norbc was also upregulated in two reactors after stage vii by contrast gene nosz converting nitrous oxide to nitrogen gas was downregulated around 40 in reactor a and upregulated 50 in reactor b which is attributed to the inhibition of h2s for n2o reduction pan et al 2013 after biogas was introduced in the two reactors genes for dissimilatory nitrite reduction were found in the two systems although the effluent ammonia concentration of the two reactors was only 0 4 mg l 1 functional genes for sulfide oxidizing to sulfate sat aprab and dsrab were upregulated around 2 times in both reactors gene fccb which converts sulfide to sulfur was upregulated 2 4 times in reactor a and 5 6 times in reactor b which is consistent with the finding in section 3 1 that sulfur was retained in reactors and served as electron donor again when influent loading rate increased figs 5 s s7c genes for conversion between polysulfides hydb and sqr were also upregulated more in reactor b than reactor a genes coding for sulfide metabolism would be upregulated more in the sdmo system when the electron acceptor was nitrite it was consistent with that ad bacteria increased more in reactor b with nitrite as electron acceptor although thiosulfate was not detected in the operation periods the genes coding for converting thiosulfate to sulfide phsa psra and sulfate soxabcdxyz existed in the two reactors 3 4 2 the metagenomics analysis for the metabolism of ch4 pmoa the character gene for ch4 oxidation in candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera is known for encoding particular methane monooxygenase enzyme to oxidize ch4 to methanol chen et al 2014 deutzmann and schink 2011 wang et al 2012 zhu et al 2012 and was 1 4 times higher in reactor b than reactor a at stage iv it was upregulated about 5 times after reactor a was influenced by biogas whereas still downregulated by about 50 in reactor b at stages viii and xii figs 5 ch4 s7a the soluble methane monooxygenase enzyme 1 14 13 25 which also leads to the pathway converting ch4 to methanol was 2 3 times higher in reactor b than reactor a before biogas was introduced stage iv and downregulated over 90 in the two reactors after it was introduced stages vii viii and xii gene pmoa and enzyme 1 14 13 25 were functional factor for damo and they were all higher in reactor b at original four stages but increased in reactor a and higher than reactor b at stages after biogas introducing the variation of them explains why nitrogen removal via damo was higher in reactor b at original stages ii iv but decreased at later stages leading to lower performance of reactor b after biogas introduction stages vii xii gene mcra which is the key gene for the reverse methanogenic process in anme archaea hallam et al 2003 was undetected in both reactors regardless of whether nitrate or nitrite served as an electron acceptor this agrees with the results of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing in that the abundance of archaea was much lower than bacteria this is different from a previous study that showed microorganism communities are dominated by anme archaea and nc10 bacteria when electron acceptors are nitrate raghoebarsing et al 2006 instead mfne which is the key gene for methanofuran mfr biosynthesis was upregulated around 100 times as stage vii in reactor a after biogas was introduced stages viii and xii it was speculated that the absence of anme archaea was due to the motivated potential function of gene mfne in nitrate based sdmo system besides the increase in the gene abundance of mfne was similar to the variation of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis it is inferred that gene mfne was a particular functional gene belonging to candidatus methylomirabilis in the sdmo system to verify this hypothesis the binning analysis for sludge samples from reactor a was carried out 3 4 3 binning analysis to infer a new pathway for ch4 metabolism a 410d and a 657d were two samples used for binning analysis after biogas was introduced at stages vii and xii to explore if gene mfne was related to candidatus methylomirabilis a total of 58 mags with completeness 90 and contamination 5 were identified from these two samples fig s8 then the genome in these mags was explored in detail and two bins of them a 410d bin 82 and a 657d bin 140 which discussed mainly were shown in fig s9 the third and fourth circles from outside indicate kegg assigned genes in color codes it showed the gene mfne existed in these two bins and according to kegg annotation for all mags gene mfne only came from these two bins table s3 meanwhile the nr annotation showed both of these mags were damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis whereas a 410d bin 82 was candidatus methylomirabilis lanthanidiphila and a 657d bin 140 was candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera according to the kegg assigned genes in the third and fourth circles of genome drafts the metabolism pathway for ch4 and no3 in candidatus methylomirabilis of sdmo system was shown in fig 6 the same as previous study ettwig et al 2010 candidatus methylomirabilis owned all genes for aerobic methane oxidation ch4 was oxidized to methanol by oxygen produced from nitric oxide in situ and then converting to formaldehyde under the control of gene mdh the gene fdha encoding glutathione independent formaldehyde dehydrogenase for directly oxidizing formaldehyde to formate was missed in the genome and the oxidation of formaldehyde proceeded by the h4mpt dependent pathway under the control of genes fae mtdb mch ftr fmd and fwd chistoserdova et al 1998 vorholt 2002 finally the formate was oxidized to co2 under the control of genes fdog fdhf and fdwa gene mfne encoding 5 aminomethyl 3 furanmethanol phosphate kinase was a key gene responsible for the biosynthesis of mfr which was a major cofactor in the h4mpt dependent pathway for formaldehyde oxidation and assumed to be an analogue from methanogenic archaea cai et al 2021 chistoserdova et al 1998 jones et al 1985 vorholt 2002 in the genome of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis the other mfr biosynthesis genes mfnd and mfnf did not increase as much as mfne thus the sharply up regulating gene mfne must have other function in sdmo system on the other hand damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis is reported to utilize nitrite readily and work with anme archaea to reduce nitrate with a slow growth rate cai et al 2015 deng et al 2009 haroon et al 2013 hu et al 2011 raghoebarsing et al 2006 welte et al 2016 although it has the potential to reduce nitrate alone due to its comprehensive genome ettwig et al 2010 he et al 2016 almost all studies have found it grows with anme archaea and plays an important role in nitrite reduction while candidatus methylomirabilis could grow alone without anme participation with nitrate as electron acceptor in sdmo system in damo archaea ch4 was oxidized to co2 via reserve methanogenesis where the cofactor mfr was the major enzyme haroon et al 2013 and in this sdmo system the damo bacteria could also reduce nitrate alone accompany with sharply increasing of mfr biosynthesis gene mfne the upregulating gene mfne in candidatus methylomirabilis may replace the role of damo archaea to make it reduce nitrate in this system besides comparing with stage vii under biogas as feeding gas the abundance of gene mfne increased 100 times at stage viii and xii after removing biogas and feeding with ch4 again it may attribute to that the h2s in biogas could serve as electron donors for nitrate reduction and supply nitrite for damo bacteria at stage vii after biogas was removed from the reactor at stage viii and xii damo bacteria must reduce nitrate alone without neither damo archaea nor ad bacteria participation leading to the dramatically upregulating of gene mfne it was speculated that gene mfne inspired the potentiality of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis to replace the role of anme archaea for nitrate reduction and implied a pontential pathway in sdmo system however what was the real and specific function of gene mfne in damo bacteria warrant study further 3 5 the proposed metabolic network in the sdmo system and its application potential utilizing h2s in biogas to enhance sewage nitrogen removal has been reported many times deng et al 2009 montebello et al 2012 vaiopoulou et al 2005 however utilizing ch4 and h2s from biogas at the same time has been rarely reported in this study a sdmo system for utilizing ch4 and h2s in biogas together was built biogas temporarily induced in the sdmo system with nitrate serving as electron acceptors leading to the co growth of damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis and ad bacteria thiobacillus biogas introduction motivated the potentiality in candidatus methylomirabilis to reduce nitrate alone accompanying with the methanofuran biosynthesis gene mfne dramatically upregulating which implied a pontential pathway in sdmo system however how biogas motivates the potentiality in candidatus methylomirabilis and what was the specific function of the gene mfne needs to be studied further which would provide a new perspective in the field according to metabolic pathways and functional genes in the two systems the schematic diagram of metabolic pathways of assimilation and dissimilation for ch4 no3 and s2 in the sdmo system is shown in fig 7 in the sdmo system nitrate metabolism accepted the electrons from ch4 and s2 metabolism to reduce nitrate and nitrite via the denitrification process denitrification proceeded through the special pathway where nitric oxide is converted to nitrogen and oxygen in candidatus methylomirabilis ettwig et al 2010 the intracellular generated oxygen converts oxide ch4 to methanol and opens the ch4 metabolism pathway as fig 7 shows ch4 metabolism supplies electrons for traditional denitrification and produces acetyl coa for the tca cycle to supply energy for microorganism growth then acetyl coa could form l serine through the serine pathway and participate in sulfide metabolism which would also supply electrons for denitrification and render the sulfide oxidized to sulfate as the terminal product moreover denitrification could be realized without carbon sources replaced with ch4 and h2s from biogas the process therefore has high engineering application potential and minimizes costs because biogas is utilized in situ however the biogas flow rate and nitrogen removal rate were too low in this system as for mbfr would greatly developed the removal rate allegue et al 2018 guo et al 2013 kampman et al 2014 siegrist et al 2008 a membrane biofilm reactor would be used for operation of sdmo system to increase the nitrogen removal rate in further study besides the operation parameters would be optimized through improving the biogas flow rate and shortening the hrt to develop the processing load although the processing load should be developed further the unique phenomenon discovered in the system provided a new perspective for sulfide cycling and denitrification methane oxidation this approach has the potential to significantly improve sewage nitrogen removal efficiency 4 conclusions the novelty and innovative findings of our work provide a theoretical basis and technical directions for economic problems of traditional sewage treatment a sdmo system for simultaneous sewage denitrification without an external carbon source and biogas desulfurization in situ was built and operated for 735 days it could reach high efficiency of nitrogen removal and biogas desulfurization as high as 100 nitrate proved to be an appropriate electron acceptor for the sdmo system and biogas not only enhanced nitrogen removal but also intensified damo when biogas was introduced in the sdmo system feeding with nitrate nitrogen removed through damo doubled and the ratio of nitrogen removal through ad to damo was 1 2 1 moreover biogas introduced in the nitrate based sdmo system could motivate the potentiality of candidatus methylomirabilis to reduce nitrate without anme participation and clear obstacles for candidatus methylomirabilis growth in that case a pontential metabolism pathway controlling by the mfr biosynthesis gene mfne may be provided this research describes mechanisms for the theoretical innovations of damo and ad the results and findings of this work will provide new perspectives for promoting the denitrification treatment of domestic sewage and the recognition of the utility of utilizing

15667,chlorine dioxide clo2 is used as an oxidant or disinfectant in waste water treatment whereas sulfite is a prevalent reducing agent to quench the excess clo2 this study demonstrated that seven micropollutants with structural diversity could be rapidly degraded in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite under environmentally relevant conditions in synthetic and real drinking water for example carbamazepine which is recalcitrant to standalone clo2 or sulfite was degraded by 55 80 in 10 s in the clo2 sulfite process at 30 ¬µm clo2 and 30 ¬µm sulfite concentrations within a ph range of 6 0 11 0 results from experiments and a kinetic model supported that chlorine monoxide clo and sulfate radicals so4 were generated in the clo2 sulfite process while hydroxyl radical generation was insignificant apart from radicals dichlorine trioxide cl2o3 was generated and largely contributed to micropollutant degradation supported by experimental results using stopped flow spectrometry and quantum chemical calculations the impacts of ph sulfite dosage and water matrix components chloride bicarbonate and natural organic matter on micropollutant abatement in the clo2 sulfite process were evaluated and discussed when treating the real potable water the concentrations of organic five regulated disinfection byproducts and inorganic byproducts chlorite and chlorate formed in the clo2

reaction between clo2 and sulfite has been studied since the 1950s and a complex reaction pathway involving the generation of reactive intermediates has been proposed horv√°th and nagyp√°l 2006 pan et al 2016 suzuki and gordon 1978 at the initial step clo2 can accept one electron from sulfite to generate chlorite clo2 and sulfite radicals so3 eq 1 it can also transfer one oxygen atom to sulfite and form sulfate so4 2 and chlorine monoxide clo as the products eq 2 pan et al 2016 the subsequent chain reactions eqs 3 6 result in the depletion of radicals so3 and clo and generate sulfate so4 2 and chloride cl ions as the final products guo et al 2017 horv√°th and nagyp√°l 2006 pan et al 2016 suzuki and gordon 1978 1 cl o 2 so 3 2 clo 2 so 3 k 1 00 10 6 m 1 s 1 2 cl o 2 so 3 2 cl o so 4 2 k 4 00

diffusion controlled rate k 2 5 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1996 and forms sulfate radicals so4 eqs 7 and 8 so4 can further react with h2o or oh and form hydroxyl radicals ho at alkaline ph eq 9 fang and shang 2012 neta et al 1988 both so4 and ho are highly reactive toward many organic compounds and have been reported to be the dominant species contributing to the degradation of micropollutants in many advanced oxidation processes aops jin et al 2012 luo et al 2017 lutze et al 2015a zhang et al 2018 nonetheless the generation of so4 and ho in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite under real

of radicals so4 and ho in the limited reports cl2o3 contributed significantly to the degradation of trithionate csek≈ë and horv√°th 2012 and pentathionate xu et al 2014 in the reactions between clo2 and the two compounds with second order rate constants of 2 107 m 1s 1 and 105 m 1s 1 respectively the chain reactions between clo2 and sulfite eqs 1 11 suggest that cl2o3 may be generated at a substantial concentration in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite via eqs 2 and 11 however experimental and theoretical e g by computational chemistry evidence to support the formation of cl2o2 cl2o3 is required even if these species are generated whether their contributions to micropollutant degradation are significant or not compared to the radicals so4 and ho also remains to be explored certain water matrix components such as chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and natural organic matter nom are known as radical scavengers in most of the reported aops yin and shang 2020 the scavenging capability of these water matrix components also differs with radical species for example so4 has been reported to be more selective and less easily scavenged by nom compared to ho chen et al 2020 lutze et al 2015a it is essential to evaluate the effects of common water matrix components toward reactive species so4 ho cl2o2 and cl2o3 that are potentially generated in the clo2 sulfite process to assess the applicability of this novel process in treating the micropollutants in real water settings clo2 and chlorate clo3 can be formed from the reaction between clo2 and nom gan et al 2020 hupperich et al 2020 which is a major concern of clo2 when applied as a disinfectant in drinking water gan et al 2020 sveceviƒçius et al 2005 clo2 and clo3 are likely formed in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite as well as indicated by eqs 1 and 3 but the yields of the two byproducts from the clo2 sulfite reaction remain unknown particularly whether the concentrations of the formed clo2 and clo3 exceed the who guideline 0 7 mg l each needs to be explored in addition the extent of organic disinfection byproduct formation e g trihalomethanes by the clo2 sulfite process also remains to be answered this study was thus designed to fill the aforementioned knowledge gaps the specific objectives are 1 to verify whether micropollutants can be rapidly degraded in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite under environmentally relevant conditions 2 to identify and differentiate the reactive species responsible for the micropollutant degradation 3 to evaluate the effects of ph sulfite dosage cl hco3 and nom on treatment efficiency of the clo2 sulfite process and assess the applicability of this process in treating real potable water and 4 to evaluate the formation of organic and inorganic byproducts in this process seven micropollutants were selected as target micropollutants due to their relatively high occurrence in surface water the molecular structures of these compounds and their reported environmental concentrations were displayed in table s1 identification and differentiation of the reactive species were conducted by experimental investigation together with quantum chemical

were taken at predetermined intervals and quenched by ascorbic acid 45 ¬µm at 1 5 times the molar concentration of the clo2 applied before measuring the residual concentrations of micropollutants additional experiments were notably conducted and the results confirmed that ascorbic acid was unable to activate clo2 to generate reactive species and had no impact on the micropollutant concentrations a stopped flow apparatus hi tech scientific was used to examine whether cl2o3 was formed during the reaction between clo2 and sulfite the initial concentrations of clo2 and sulfite in the stopped flow experiments were both 800 ¬µm under ph 9 0 conditions buffered with 10 mm borate buffer the absorbance of the solution during the reaction was monitored at 360 nm for clo2 rouge et al

respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 rapid degradation of micropollutants in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite experiments were first conducted to investigate whether micropollutants can be degraded in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite under environmentally relevant conditions fig 1 a shows the degradation of 2 ¬µm of carbamazepine cbz by 30 ¬µm of clo2 in the absence and presence of 30 ¬µm of sulfite at ph 9 0 the effect of ph was discussed in section 3 4 1 standalone clo2 and sulfite barely degraded the cbz within the tested 300 s the insignificant degradation of cbz by clo2 conformed to the low reactivity of cbz toward clo2 k 0 1 m 1s 1 lee and von gunten 2010 surprisingly around 80 of cbz was degraded during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite in a short period 10 s and the residual concentration of cbz remained unchanged this is because the reaction between clo2 and sulfite is fast k 1 0 106 m 1s 1 and 4 0 105 m 1s 1 as shown in scheme 1 which is supported by the literature pan et al 2016 in addition the generation and consumption of the reactive species in the clo2 sulfite reaction occurred within 2 s fig s3a the effective degradation of cbz within 10 s indicated a fast reaction between clo2 and sulfite which was further confirmed by the disappearance of electron paramagnetic resonance signals of ho and so4 within 5 s in fig 2 b additional points 2 s and 5 s were analyzed and showed that the clo2 sulfite reaction had completed within 2 s fig s7 this result can be explained by the rapid generation and consumption of reactive species within 2 s by the model prediction fig s8 experiments also demonstrated a decrease in the toc by 15 when 80 of cbz degraded within 10 s during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite the value was comparable to that reported by wang et al 2022 in which around 25 toc removal was observed after 80 of atrazine atz was degraded by the co exposure to clo2 and bisulfite in addition to cbz six other micropollutants including atz n n diethyl 3 toluamide deet ibuprofen ibp caffeine caf sulfamethoxazole smx and ciprofloxacin cfx were rapidly degraded in the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite with a degradation percentage ranging from 10 to 63 in 10 s fig 1b the above results supported the previous hypothesis that reactive species might be generated in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite and contributed to the rapid degradation of the tested micropollutants the identification and quasi quantification of the reactive species are discussed in the next section 3 2 roles of clo so4 and ho in the degradation of micropollutants as demonstrated in eqs 1 9 the reaction between clo2 and sulfite can generate ho so4 and clo contributing to the rapid degradation of micropollutants to verify the involvement of those reactive species nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob were selected as probe compounds due to their high reactivity and selectivity toward some of the radicals see the second order rate constants in table s3 lou et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 nb reacts rapidly toward ho k 3 9 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 but slowly toward so4 k 106 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 and clo watts and linden 2007 it was used as a probe compound for only ho ba is reactive toward both ho k 5 9 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 and so4 k 1 2 109 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 but not clo k 3 0 106 m 1s 1 alfassi et al 1988 used with nb as a probe compound for so4 dmob is reactive toward ho k 7 0 109 m 1s 1 o neill et al 1975 so4 k 3 2 109 m 1s 1 determined in this work and details can be found in text s3 and clo k 2 1 109 m 1s 1 alfassi et al 1988 used with nb and ba as a probe for clo the degradation efficiency of nb ba and dmob by clo2 in the absence or presence of sulfite is shown in fig 2 notably supplementary experiments showed that all three probe compounds were recalcitrant to sulfite as shown in fig 2a nb was not degraded by standalone clo2 and was slightly degraded 5 during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite suggesting that an insignificant amount of ho was generated ba was not degraded by standalone clo2 but degraded by 30 during the clo2 sulfite reaction given the minor role of ho the degradation of ba under clo2 sulfite conditions was attributed to so4 dmob was also poorly degraded by standalone clo2 5 but presented further degradation during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite 14 the enhancement could be attributed to the contributions of clo or so4 since both radicals are reactive toward dmob although dmob reacts with clo as well as ho and so4 it was probably outcompeted by clo2 because 1 the concentration of clo2 was 15 times higher than that of dmob 30 ¬µm vs 2 ¬µm and 2 the reactivity of dmob toward clo2 7 9 109 m 1s 1 was 3 times higher than that of clo 2 1 109 m 1s 1 alfassi et al 1988 guo et al 2017 moreover dmob was anticipated to be unreactive toward cl2o3 which was formed from the clo2 clo reaction the above facts support the relatively low degradation efficiency of dmob in the clo2 sulfite system experiments using epr spectroscopy were carried out using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as a trapping agent to verify the generation of ho and so4 in the clo2 sulfite process noted that hyperfine splitting constants are not available for dmpo ocl from clo liu et al 2017 as shown in fig 2b no peaks were observed for the blank experiments with ultrapure water the reaction of clo2 and sulfite resulted in a dmpo ho adduct as a 1 2 2 1 quartet and a dmpo so4 adduct liu et al 2017 this result might be due to the rapid nucleophilic substitution of so4 with h2o oh generating ho eq 9 as also observed by wang et al 2022 in a clo2 bisulfite system however the signals were rather weak compared to the cases in other well known aops e g uv persulfate process liu et al 2017 the results suggest that so4 might be generated in the clo2 sulfite process at low concentrations and provide limited pollutant degradation another observation was that the signals for both ho and so4 decreased rapidly from 1 to 5 s of reaction confirming that the reaction between clo2 and sulfite was superfast additional experiments were conducted to further verify the importance of so4 in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite the degradation of ba was investigated during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite in the oxygen free water produced by purging nitrogen gas into deionized water for 30 min compared to the case without nitrogen purging the degradation of ba in the low oxygen water was only partially suppressed with the degradation efficiency decreasing from 30 to 17 fig 2c the degradation of ba should be completely inhibited if ba was degraded only by so4 during the clo2 sulfite process in the absence of dissolved oxygen noting that ba is unreactive toward clo because the dissolved oxygen has been reported to be the limiting reactant for so4 generation in sulfite related chain reactions e g eqs 7 and 8 dong et al 2019 gao et al 2019 sun et al 2018a sun et al 2018b in other words the partial inhibitory effect of dissolved oxygen on ba degradation indicated that other reactive species than so4 might also contribute to ba degradation in the study by wang et al 2022 the degradation of atz 1 Œºm by the clo2 bisulfite system was reduced by only 25 even in the presence of 100 fold excess of ba 100 Œºm as a scavenger for both ho and so4 this result was consistent with our observations and suggests that other reactive species contribute to the micropollutant degradation in the system the kinetic model also suggested that besides clo and so4 cl2o3 seemed to be another main reactive species present in the clo2 sulfite process 3 3 formation of cl2o3 in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite we hypothesized that short lived reactive chlorine oxides such as cl2o2 eq 10 and cl2o3 eq 11 are possibly generated and contribute to the rapid degradation of micropollutants in the clo2 sulfite process to verify this hypothesis dft calculations were conducted as shown in fig s2 both eqs 10 and 11 could proceed via chemisorption with a formation energy of 0 6759 ev for cl2o3 and 0 5978 ev for cl2o2 respectively table s4 the results suggested that both cl2o3 and cl2o2 could readily be formed without an energy barrier and cl2o3 was expected to be more stable than cl2o2 since its formation energy was lower charge distributions by hirshfeld population analysis showed that the charges of the cl2o3 molecule were less evenly distributed than that in the cl2o2 molecule and the chlorine atoms in the cl2o3 molecule possessed positive charges fig 3 a suggesting that cl2o3 has a stronger electron accepting ability than cl2o2 the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of cl2o3 and cl2o2 were calculated and are shown in fig 3b the homo lumo was evenly allocated in the cl2o2 molecule in line with its uniform charge distribution as observed in fig 3a in contrast in the cl2o3 molecule the cl o group dominated the homo and the lumo was shared within the structure indicating a strong migration of electrons within the cl2o3 molecule the above results demonstrate that cl2o3 is more reactive than cl2o2 and contributes to the rapid degradation of micropollutants during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite dft calculations also showed that the acylamino moiety olefinic double bond and benzene rings of the cbz were electron rich sites susceptible to the electrophilic attack fig s4 among them the carbonyl and secondary amine groups in the acylamino moiety of the cbz molecule were the most reactive sites toward cl2o3 where primary adduct products were formed via chemisorption between the reactants without energy barriers fig s4 the results indicated a potentially fast reaction between cl2o3 and cbz in addition the kinetic model predicted a cbz degradation of approximately 60 while a degradation of around 80 was achieved experimentally fig s7 the underestimated model predicted degradation of cbz could be explained by the lack of a rate constant between cl2o3 and cbz the formation of cl2o3 during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite was also supported by measuring the absorbance of the reacting solution containing clo2 and sulfite at ph 9 0 using stopped flow spectrophotometry clo2 and cl2o3 have absorption peaks at 360 nm and 267 nm respectively burkholder et al 1993 harwood et al 1995 rouge et al 2018 as shown in fig s3a the absorbance at 360 nm decreased rapidly within 6 ms suggesting the rapid consumption of clo2 and a superfast reaction between clo2 and sulfite interestingly the absorbance at 267 nm remained unchanged within the initial 2 ms and then gradually decreased from 2 ms to 10 ms fig s3b the lag phase was likely due to the strong formation of cl2o3 within the first 2 ms which compensated for the consumption of cl2o3 and resulted in a short period steady state of cl2o3 the formation of cl2o3 became weaker as the reactant e g clo2 concentration decreased and the consumption of cl2o3 became dominant decreasing cl2o3 concentrations from 2 10 ms fig s3b the above experimental results with the dft calculation and radical scavenging test results discussed in section 3 2 support that cl2o3 might be generated in the clo2 sulfite process and contribute significantly to the micropollutant degradation the generation of reactive oxygen species ros in the clo2 sulfite system is summarized by scheme 1 clo was generated by the reaction of clo2 with sulfite via oxygen transfer pathway eq 2 and it further reacted with clo2 generating cl2o3 meanwhile so4 originating from so3 generated via electron transfer pathway between clo2 and sulfite eq 1 was also produced the collective contribution from ros i e clo so4 and cl2o3 led to the degradation of micropollutants in the clo2 sulfite process 3 4 effects of water matrix components on micropollutant abatement 3 4 1 ph the effect of ph ph 6 0 11 0 on the degradation of cbz in the clo2 sulfite process was investigated rapid degradation of cbz was observed over the tested ph range as shown in fig 4 a the removal efficiency of cbz was around 53 at ph 6 0 and increased to 60 and 80 as the ph increased to 7 0 and 9 0 respectively because clo2 itself is rather stable and non sensitive between the ph range of 6 0 9 0 peng et al 2022 the observed ph dependence on cbz degradation was likely attributed to the ph dependent distribution of aqueous sulfite species gan et al 2020 at ph 9 the main species are so3 2 while as the solution ph decreases sulfite shifts from so3 2 to hso3 species chen et al 2021 besides previous studies showed that the generation of clo2 from clo2 reaction with sulfite increased with increasing ph likely due to the prevalence of one electron transfer pathways at higher ph conditions eq 1 zhao et al 2021 further increasing the ph to 10 and 11 decreased the efficiency of cbz to approximately 69 and 64 respectively this result might be explained by the disproportionation of clo2 to produce clo2 and clo3 at a higher ph ph 10 the results suggested that the clo2 sulfite process is relatively more suitable for degrading the micropollutants in slightly alkaline waters than acidic ones kinetic model results suggested that the concentration of ho clo and so4 were respectively 20 9 and 21 higher at ph 9 than that at ph 8 which was likely responsible for the increase of degradation efficiency at ph 9 than ph 8 considering the fast reaction between ho clo and so4 toward cbz i e 8 80 109 m 1 s 1 1 97 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 92 109 m 1 s 1 respectively dong et al 2019 guo et al 2017 however the concentration of cl2o3 slightly changed in both phs suggesting cl2o3 is less ph dependent 3 4 2 sulfite dosage the impact of sulfite dosage 6 150 ¬µm on the degradation of cbz 2 ¬µm by clo2 30 ¬µm is shown in fig 4b the degradation efficiency of cbz remarkably increased from 35 to 80 with an increase in sulfite concentration from 6 to 30 ¬µm further increasing the sulfite dosage from 30 to 60 ¬µm barely changed the degradation efficiency however the degradation efficiency decreased to 40 as sulfite concentration further increased to 150 ¬µm the overdosing of sulfite inhibited the cbz degradation mainly because sulfite served as a reactive species generator and a scavenger zhao et al 2021 the results suggested that the optimal sulfite dosage was 30 ¬µm at a molar ratio to the dosed clo2 of 1 1 notably no higher dosage of clo2 was investigated in this study with due consideration of the regulated limitations on the clo2 and clo3 formed from clo2 the details were discussed in section 3 5 kinetic model simulated concentrations of the reactive species generated in the clo2 sulfite process at different sulfite dosages are presented in fig s9a and s9c in the supporting information in di water the model predicted concentrations of radicals ho cl cl2 and so4 at a sulfite dosage of 60 ¬µm were higher than those at a sulfite dosage of 30 ¬µm except for clo that was higher at 30 ¬µm however the concentrations of cl2o2 and cl2o3 were respectively 4 and 8 times lower at 60 ¬µm than 30 ¬µm this result corroborates the experimental results suggesting that cl2o2 and cl2o3 contribute significantly to the degradation of cbz the collective contributions of those reactive species led to the higher degradation efficiency at a molar ratio to the dosed clo2 of 1 1 3 4 3 effects from water matrix components impacts of constituents of water matrices including chloride cl 0 10 mm bicarbonate hco3 0 10 mm and natural organic matter nom 0 10 mgc l on the degradation of cbz 2 ¬µm in the clo2 sulfite process were examined cl as shown in fig 5 a the presence of cl decreased the degradation efficiency of cbz and the inhibitory effect was stronger at higher cl concentrations the degradation efficiency of cbz decreased from 80 to 37 with increasing the cl concentration from 0 to 10 mm cl is a well known radical scavenger and is oxidized by reactive species e g clo and so4 to less reactive cl2 in aop peng et al 2022 the model results fig s10 showed that cl at 0 5 mm decreased the concentrations of so4 clo and ho and the decrease was more significant at higher cl concentrations the concentrations of cl2o3 could not be accurately predicted due to the lack of kinetic data meanwhile the concentrations of cl and cl2 gradually increased with increasing cl concentration cl reacts with ho generating cloh k 4 30 109 m 1 s 1 which can be converted to cl 2 10 1010 m 1 s 1 and cl2 1 00 104 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2020 lutze et al 2015b sun et al 2022 although the model predicted concentrations of cl and cl2 increased their concentrations were 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than o so4 clo and ho in addition the second order reaction rate constant of cl2 towards cbz k 4 30 107 m 1 s 1 is 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of clo ho and so4 k 4 30 109 m 1 s 1 8 80 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 92 109 m 1 s 1 respectively dong et al 2019 guo et al 2017 lei et al 2019 which could explain the general decrease in the cbz degradation efficiency moreover cl might also scavenge cl2o3 generated which cannot be quantified due to the lack of rate constant hco3 hco3 was also found to inhibit the cbz degradation efficiency from 80 to 52 with its concentration increasing from 0 to 10 mm a less significant inhibitory effect of hco3 than cl was observed likely due to its lower scavenging rate on so4 2 80 106 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2016 than those of cl 2 00 108 m 1 s 1 huie and neta 1987 the model also showed a negative effect of hco3 on the generation of so4 clo and ho fig s11 in line with the lower removal efficiency of cbz at higher hco3 concentrations the inhibition effects of hco3 on the model predicted concentrations of clo and so4 was milder compared to those of cl fig s10 corroborating the less significant inhibitory effect on cbz degradation of hco3 than cl experimentally observed fig 5a nom cbz degradation was also inhibited by the presence of nom the degradation efficiency decreased from 80 to 39 with increasing the nom concentration from 0 to 10 mg c l nom is also a known scavenger to clo 4 50 104 mg l 1 1s 1 guo et al 2017 and so4 6 38 36 8 106 mc 1s 1 lei et al 2022 the scavenge of reactive species and even clo2 by nom gan et al 2020 might result in the decreased removal efficiency of cbz model results showed that the presence of nom has slightly impacted on the concentrations of clo and so4 fig s12 despite that degradation of cbz was obviously decreased at higher nom concentration this result might be due to the direct scavenging of cl2o3 by nom which however was not included in the kinetic model due to lack of kinetic data real tap water experiments were also carried out to evaluate the degradation of cbz in a real tap water sample the water quality of the tap water is presented in table s5 as shown in fig 5b the cbz degradation was decreased from 80 to 56 in the real tap water treated by the clo2 sulfite process which was mainly due to the radical scavenging by chloride and nom in water nonetheless the 56 degradation in 10 s was still promising for rapid degradation of micropollutants in real water treatment practice the model predicted concentrations of ho clo so4 and cl2o3 were reduced by approximately 33 52 3 and 51 respectively in the presence of cl hco3 and nom fig s9b and s9d cl2o3 is mainly formed from the reaction of clo with clo2 therefore the reduced concentration of clo may also reduce the concentration of cl2o3 the second order rate constants of cl hco3 and nom toward cl2o3 remain unknown in the literature thus the decrease of cl2o3 concentration 51 in the presence of cl hco3 and nom could be underestimated 3 5 formation of organic and inorganic byproducts in treating real water the formation of inorganic and organic byproducts in the clo2 sulfite process was investigated fig 6 a presents the concentrations of clo2 and clo3 formed at an initial clo2 dosage of 30 ¬µm in the presence and absence of sulfite deducting the concentrations of clo2 clo3 and cl previously measured in the clo2 stock solution in the deionized water the clo2 sulfite process formed 0 33 mg l and 0 19 mg l of clo2 and clo3 respectively in real tap water the concentrations of formed clo2 and clo3 in the clo2 sulfite process increased by 12 1 0 37 mg l and 26 3 0 24 mg l respectively nonetheless both concentrations were lower than the guideline values proposed by who 0 7 mg l for clo2 or clo3 who 2017 compared to standalone clo2 oxidation the clo2 sulfite process increased the formation of clo2 and clo3 by two and three times respectively fig 6a the increased generation of clo2 in the clo2 sulfite process was attributed to i the one electron transfer pathway between clo2 and sulfite and ii from the reaction of so3 and clo2 eqs 1 4 on the other hand the increased formation of clo3 in the clo2 sulfite process was attributed to i the oxidation of clo2 by the generated reactive species ii the oxidation of clo2 by the in situ formed free chlorine and iii the reaction of clo2 with clo eq 3 pan et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 fig 6b presents the molar yield molar concentration of a product divided by the molar concentration of the consumed clo2 of the products from the reaction between clo2 and sulfite in the deionized water and real tap water compared to the deionized water the molar yields of clo2 and clo3 were increased by 19 1 and 25 2 respectively in the real tap water the higher yields of clo2 and clo3 in the real water sample were hypothesized to be due to the reactions of clo2 with nom via a generally one electron transfer pathway yielding clo2 and subsequently clo3 zhao et al 2021 in addition cl and free chlorine were also formed in the clo2 sulfite process fig 6b a satisfactory mass balance was achieved in terms of cl in both water samples the formation of chloro organic byproducts and corresponding calculated toxicity on a weight basis in the clo2 sulfite process were determined and compared with those by only clo2 oxidation as shown in fig 7 a the clo2 sulfite process slightly increased the formation of chloro organic dbps by 4 1 23 5 compared to standalone clo2 oxidation of which the highest increase was derived from dcp from 0 55 ¬µg l to 0 68 ¬µg l the concentration of tcm accounted for the highest concentration among the tested chloro organic dbps both in the presence 4 28 0 45 ¬µg l and absence of sulfite nevertheless the concentrations of tcm ch and dcan were over two orders of magnitude lower than the guideline values proposed for drinking water by the who 200 10 and 20 ¬µg l respectively the formation of selected chloro organic dbps in the clo2 sulfite process likely resulted from the reactions of clo free chlorine or cl2o3 with nom it is well known that the chlorine substitution reaction of chlorine deborde and von gunten 2008 and clo li et al 2021 kong et al 2016 with nom moieties e g phenolates anilines and alkoxy hydroxyl aromatic compounds could lead to the formation of chloro organic dbps however less information on cl2o3 reactivity is available at present cl2o3 may also contribute to the formation of chloro dbps given the reactive nature of its end cl o bond as shown in fig 3 the total toxicity weighted dbp concentration in the clo2 sulfite process was only 5 5 higher than that by standalone clo2 oxidation fig 7b with dcan contributing predominantly to the overall toxicity the results suggested that the formation of the selected chloro organic dbps in the clo2 sulfite process would unlikely represent a concern 4 conclusions and environmental implications this study demonstrated that micropollutants were rapidly degraded during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite and disclosed that the unexpected degradation was attributed to the generation of reactive species e g clo and cl2o3 the findings provided a novel process by combining clo2 and sulfite for superfast degradation of micropollutants in water and wastewater the process yielded highly reactive species for rapid destruction of a wide spectrum of micropollutants and formed low concentrations of clo2 clo3 and chloro organic byproducts below drinking water standards the nom sources and characteristics may affect radical speciation and byproduct formation in the clo2 sulfite process which requires more investigation the process was suitable for micropollutant abatement in slightly alkaline water with a relatively low concentration of chloride and nom the process might be used for other environmental remediation or industrial purposes e g decolorization disinfection and deodorization moreover this study highlighted the overlooked impacts of using sulfite to quench the water containing clo2 in laboratory studies e g disinfection and disinfection byproduct relevant studies and in real water treatment practice besides sulfite we found that thiosulfate another commonly used quencher to clo2 in laboratory studies could also activate clo2 and generate reactive species fig s5 alternative

15667,chlorine dioxide clo2 is used as an oxidant or disinfectant in waste water treatment whereas sulfite is a prevalent reducing agent to quench the excess clo2 this study demonstrated that seven micropollutants with structural diversity could be rapidly degraded in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite under environmentally relevant conditions in synthetic and real drinking water for example carbamazepine which is recalcitrant to standalone clo2 or sulfite was degraded by 55 80 in 10 s in the clo2 sulfite process at 30 ¬µm clo2 and 30 ¬µm sulfite concentrations within a ph range of 6 0 11 0 results from experiments and a kinetic model supported that chlorine monoxide clo and sulfate radicals so4 were generated in the clo2 sulfite process while hydroxyl radical generation was insignificant apart from radicals dichlorine trioxide cl2o3 was generated and largely contributed to micropollutant degradation supported by experimental results using stopped flow spectrometry and quantum chemical calculations the impacts of ph sulfite dosage and water matrix components chloride bicarbonate and natural organic matter on micropollutant abatement in the clo2 sulfite process were evaluated and discussed when treating the real potable water the concentrations of organic five regulated disinfection byproducts and inorganic byproducts chlorite and chlorate formed in the clo2

of radicals so4 and ho in the limited reports cl2o3 contributed significantly to the degradation of trithionate csek≈ë and horv√°th 2012 and pentathionate xu et al 2014 in the reactions between clo2 and the two compounds with second order rate constants of 2 107 m 1s 1 and 105 m 1s 1 respectively the chain reactions between clo2 and sulfite eqs 1 11 suggest that cl2o3 may be generated at a substantial concentration in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite via eqs 2 and 11 however experimental and theoretical e g by computational chemistry evidence to support the formation of cl2o2 cl2o3 is required even if these species are generated whether their contributions to micropollutant degradation are significant or not compared to the radicals so4 and ho also remains to be explored certain water matrix components such as chloride cl bicarbonate hco3 and natural organic matter nom are known as radical scavengers in most of the reported aops yin and shang 2020 the scavenging capability of these water matrix components also differs with radical species for example so4 has been reported to be more selective and less easily scavenged by nom compared to ho chen et al 2020 lutze et al 2015a it is essential to evaluate the effects of common water matrix components toward reactive species so4 ho cl2o2 and cl2o3 that are potentially generated in the clo2 sulfite process to assess the applicability of this novel process in treating the micropollutants in real water settings clo2 and chlorate clo3 can be formed from the reaction between clo2 and nom gan et al 2020 hupperich et al 2020 which is a major concern of clo2 when applied as a disinfectant in drinking water gan et al 2020 sveceviƒçius et al 2005 clo2 and clo3 are likely formed in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite as well as indicated by eqs 1 and 3 but the yields of the two byproducts from the clo2 sulfite reaction remain unknown particularly whether the concentrations of the formed clo2 and clo3 exceed the who guideline 0 7 mg l each needs to be explored in addition the extent of organic disinfection byproduct formation e g trihalomethanes by the clo2 sulfite process also remains to be answered this study was thus designed to fill the aforementioned knowledge gaps the specific objectives are 1 to verify whether micropollutants can be rapidly degraded in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite under environmentally relevant conditions 2 to identify and differentiate the reactive species responsible for the micropollutant degradation 3 to evaluate the effects of ph sulfite dosage cl hco3 and nom on treatment efficiency of the clo2 sulfite process and assess the applicability of this process in treating real potable water and 4 to evaluate the formation of organic and inorganic byproducts in this process seven micropollutants were selected as target micropollutants due to their relatively high occurrence in surface water the molecular structures of these compounds and their reported environmental concentrations were displayed in table s1 identification and differentiation of the reactive species were conducted by experimental investigation together with quantum chemical

were taken at predetermined intervals and quenched by ascorbic acid 45 ¬µm at 1 5 times the molar concentration of the clo2 applied before measuring the residual concentrations of micropollutants additional experiments were notably conducted and the results confirmed that ascorbic acid was unable to activate clo2 to generate reactive species and had no impact on the micropollutant concentrations a stopped flow apparatus hi tech scientific was used to examine whether cl2o3 was formed during the reaction between clo2 and sulfite the initial concentrations of clo2 and sulfite in the stopped flow experiments were both 800 ¬µm under ph 9 0 conditions buffered with 10 mm borate buffer the absorbance of the solution during the reaction was monitored at 360 nm for clo2 rouge et al

respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 rapid degradation of micropollutants in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite experiments were first conducted to investigate whether micropollutants can be degraded in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite under environmentally relevant conditions fig 1 a shows the degradation of 2 ¬µm of carbamazepine cbz by 30 ¬µm of clo2 in the absence and presence of 30 ¬µm of sulfite at ph 9 0 the effect of ph was discussed in section 3 4 1 standalone clo2 and sulfite barely degraded the cbz within the tested 300 s the insignificant degradation of cbz by clo2 conformed to the low reactivity of cbz toward clo2 k 0 1 m 1s 1 lee and von gunten 2010 surprisingly around 80 of cbz was degraded during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite in a short period 10 s and the residual concentration of cbz remained unchanged this is because the reaction between clo2 and sulfite is fast k 1 0 106 m 1s 1 and 4 0 105 m 1s 1 as shown in scheme 1 which is supported by the literature pan et al 2016 in addition the generation and consumption of the reactive species in the clo2 sulfite reaction occurred within 2 s fig s3a the effective degradation of cbz within 10 s indicated a fast reaction between clo2 and sulfite which was further confirmed by the disappearance of electron paramagnetic resonance signals of ho and so4 within 5 s in fig 2 b additional points 2 s and 5 s were analyzed and showed that the clo2 sulfite reaction had completed within 2 s fig s7 this result can be explained by the rapid generation and consumption of reactive species within 2 s by the model prediction fig s8 experiments also demonstrated a decrease in the toc by 15 when 80 of cbz degraded within 10 s during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite the value was comparable to that reported by wang et al 2022 in which around 25 toc removal was observed after 80 of atrazine atz was degraded by the co exposure to clo2 and bisulfite in addition to cbz six other micropollutants including atz n n diethyl 3 toluamide deet ibuprofen ibp caffeine caf sulfamethoxazole smx and ciprofloxacin cfx were rapidly degraded in the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite with a degradation percentage ranging from 10 to 63 in 10 s fig 1b the above results supported the previous hypothesis that reactive species might be generated in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite and contributed to the rapid degradation of the tested micropollutants the identification and quasi quantification of the reactive species are discussed in the next section 3 2 roles of clo so4 and ho in the degradation of micropollutants as demonstrated in eqs 1 9 the reaction between clo2 and sulfite can generate ho so4 and clo contributing to the rapid degradation of micropollutants to verify the involvement of those reactive species nitrobenzene nb benzoic acid ba and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob were selected as probe compounds due to their high reactivity and selectivity toward some of the radicals see the second order rate constants in table s3 lou et al 2021 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2021 nb reacts rapidly toward ho k 3 9 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 but slowly toward so4 k 106 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 and clo watts and linden 2007 it was used as a probe compound for only ho ba is reactive toward both ho k 5 9 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 and so4 k 1 2 109 m 1s 1 neta et al 1988 but not clo k 3 0 106 m 1s 1 alfassi et al 1988 used with nb as a probe compound for so4 dmob is reactive toward ho k 7 0 109 m 1s 1 o neill et al 1975 so4 k 3 2 109 m 1s 1 determined in this work and details can be found in text s3 and clo k 2 1 109 m 1s 1 alfassi et al 1988 used with nb and ba as a probe for clo the degradation efficiency of nb ba and dmob by clo2 in the absence or presence of sulfite is shown in fig 2 notably supplementary experiments showed that all three probe compounds were recalcitrant to sulfite as shown in fig 2a nb was not degraded by standalone clo2 and was slightly degraded 5 during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite suggesting that an insignificant amount of ho was generated ba was not degraded by standalone clo2 but degraded by 30 during the clo2 sulfite reaction given the minor role of ho the degradation of ba under clo2 sulfite conditions was attributed to so4 dmob was also poorly degraded by standalone clo2 5 but presented further degradation during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite 14 the enhancement could be attributed to the contributions of clo or so4 since both radicals are reactive toward dmob although dmob reacts with clo as well as ho and so4 it was probably outcompeted by clo2 because 1 the concentration of clo2 was 15 times higher than that of dmob 30 ¬µm vs 2 ¬µm and 2 the reactivity of dmob toward clo2 7 9 109 m 1s 1 was 3 times higher than that of clo 2 1 109 m 1s 1 alfassi et al 1988 guo et al 2017 moreover dmob was anticipated to be unreactive toward cl2o3 which was formed from the clo2 clo reaction the above facts support the relatively low degradation efficiency of dmob in the clo2 sulfite system experiments using epr spectroscopy were carried out using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as a trapping agent to verify the generation of ho and so4 in the clo2 sulfite process noted that hyperfine splitting constants are not available for dmpo ocl from clo liu et al 2017 as shown in fig 2b no peaks were observed for the blank experiments with ultrapure water the reaction of clo2 and sulfite resulted in a dmpo ho adduct as a 1 2 2 1 quartet and a dmpo so4 adduct liu et al 2017 this result might be due to the rapid nucleophilic substitution of so4 with h2o oh generating ho eq 9 as also observed by wang et al 2022 in a clo2 bisulfite system however the signals were rather weak compared to the cases in other well known aops e g uv persulfate process liu et al 2017 the results suggest that so4 might be generated in the clo2 sulfite process at low concentrations and provide limited pollutant degradation another observation was that the signals for both ho and so4 decreased rapidly from 1 to 5 s of reaction confirming that the reaction between clo2 and sulfite was superfast additional experiments were conducted to further verify the importance of so4 in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite the degradation of ba was investigated during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite in the oxygen free water produced by purging nitrogen gas into deionized water for 30 min compared to the case without nitrogen purging the degradation of ba in the low oxygen water was only partially suppressed with the degradation efficiency decreasing from 30 to 17 fig 2c the degradation of ba should be completely inhibited if ba was degraded only by so4 during the clo2 sulfite process in the absence of dissolved oxygen noting that ba is unreactive toward clo because the dissolved oxygen has been reported to be the limiting reactant for so4 generation in sulfite related chain reactions e g eqs 7 and 8 dong et al 2019 gao et al 2019 sun et al 2018a sun et al 2018b in other words the partial inhibitory effect of dissolved oxygen on ba degradation indicated that other reactive species than so4 might also contribute to ba degradation in the study by wang et al 2022 the degradation of atz 1 Œºm by the clo2 bisulfite system was reduced by only 25 even in the presence of 100 fold excess of ba 100 Œºm as a scavenger for both ho and so4 this result was consistent with our observations and suggests that other reactive species contribute to the micropollutant degradation in the system the kinetic model also suggested that besides clo and so4 cl2o3 seemed to be another main reactive species present in the clo2 sulfite process 3 3 formation of cl2o3 in the reaction between clo2 and sulfite we hypothesized that short lived reactive chlorine oxides such as cl2o2 eq 10 and cl2o3 eq 11 are possibly generated and contribute to the rapid degradation of micropollutants in the clo2 sulfite process to verify this hypothesis dft calculations were conducted as shown in fig s2 both eqs 10 and 11 could proceed via chemisorption with a formation energy of 0 6759 ev for cl2o3 and 0 5978 ev for cl2o2 respectively table s4 the results suggested that both cl2o3 and cl2o2 could readily be formed without an energy barrier and cl2o3 was expected to be more stable than cl2o2 since its formation energy was lower charge distributions by hirshfeld population analysis showed that the charges of the cl2o3 molecule were less evenly distributed than that in the cl2o2 molecule and the chlorine atoms in the cl2o3 molecule possessed positive charges fig 3 a suggesting that cl2o3 has a stronger electron accepting ability than cl2o2 the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of cl2o3 and cl2o2 were calculated and are shown in fig 3b the homo lumo was evenly allocated in the cl2o2 molecule in line with its uniform charge distribution as observed in fig 3a in contrast in the cl2o3 molecule the cl o group dominated the homo and the lumo was shared within the structure indicating a strong migration of electrons within the cl2o3 molecule the above results demonstrate that cl2o3 is more reactive than cl2o2 and contributes to the rapid degradation of micropollutants during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite dft calculations also showed that the acylamino moiety olefinic double bond and benzene rings of the cbz were electron rich sites susceptible to the electrophilic attack fig s4 among them the carbonyl and secondary amine groups in the acylamino moiety of the cbz molecule were the most reactive sites toward cl2o3 where primary adduct products were formed via chemisorption between the reactants without energy barriers fig s4 the results indicated a potentially fast reaction between cl2o3 and cbz in addition the kinetic model predicted a cbz degradation of approximately 60 while a degradation of around 80 was achieved experimentally fig s7 the underestimated model predicted degradation of cbz could be explained by the lack of a rate constant between cl2o3 and cbz the formation of cl2o3 during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite was also supported by measuring the absorbance of the reacting solution containing clo2 and sulfite at ph 9 0 using stopped flow spectrophotometry clo2 and cl2o3 have absorption peaks at 360 nm and 267 nm respectively burkholder et al 1993 harwood et al 1995 rouge et al 2018 as shown in fig s3a the absorbance at 360 nm decreased rapidly within 6 ms suggesting the rapid consumption of clo2 and a superfast reaction between clo2 and sulfite interestingly the absorbance at 267 nm remained unchanged within the initial 2 ms and then gradually decreased from 2 ms to 10 ms fig s3b the lag phase was likely due to the strong formation of cl2o3 within the first 2 ms which compensated for the consumption of cl2o3 and resulted in a short period steady state of cl2o3 the formation of cl2o3 became weaker as the reactant e g clo2 concentration decreased and the consumption of cl2o3 became dominant decreasing cl2o3 concentrations from 2 10 ms fig s3b the above experimental results with the dft calculation and radical scavenging test results discussed in section 3 2 support that cl2o3 might be generated in the clo2 sulfite process and contribute significantly to the micropollutant degradation the generation of reactive oxygen species ros in the clo2 sulfite system is summarized by scheme 1 clo was generated by the reaction of clo2 with sulfite via oxygen transfer pathway eq 2 and it further reacted with clo2 generating cl2o3 meanwhile so4 originating from so3 generated via electron transfer pathway between clo2 and sulfite eq 1 was also produced the collective contribution from ros i e clo so4 and cl2o3 led to the degradation of micropollutants in the clo2 sulfite process 3 4 effects of water matrix components on micropollutant abatement 3 4 1 ph the effect of ph ph 6 0 11 0 on the degradation of cbz in the clo2 sulfite process was investigated rapid degradation of cbz was observed over the tested ph range as shown in fig 4 a the removal efficiency of cbz was around 53 at ph 6 0 and increased to 60 and 80 as the ph increased to 7 0 and 9 0 respectively because clo2 itself is rather stable and non sensitive between the ph range of 6 0 9 0 peng et al 2022 the observed ph dependence on cbz degradation was likely attributed to the ph dependent distribution of aqueous sulfite species gan et al 2020 at ph 9 the main species are so3 2 while as the solution ph decreases sulfite shifts from so3 2 to hso3 species chen et al 2021 besides previous studies showed that the generation of clo2 from clo2 reaction with sulfite increased with increasing ph likely due to the prevalence of one electron transfer pathways at higher ph conditions eq 1 zhao et al 2021 further increasing the ph to 10 and 11 decreased the efficiency of cbz to approximately 69 and 64 respectively this result might be explained by the disproportionation of clo2 to produce clo2 and clo3 at a higher ph ph 10 the results suggested that the clo2 sulfite process is relatively more suitable for degrading the micropollutants in slightly alkaline waters than acidic ones kinetic model results suggested that the concentration of ho clo and so4 were respectively 20 9 and 21 higher at ph 9 than that at ph 8 which was likely responsible for the increase of degradation efficiency at ph 9 than ph 8 considering the fast reaction between ho clo and so4 toward cbz i e 8 80 109 m 1 s 1 1 97 108 m 1 s 1 and 1 92 109 m 1 s 1 respectively dong et al 2019 guo et al 2017 however the concentration of cl2o3 slightly changed in both phs suggesting cl2o3 is less ph dependent 3 4 2 sulfite dosage the impact of sulfite dosage 6 150 ¬µm on the degradation of cbz 2 ¬µm by clo2 30 ¬µm is shown in fig 4b the degradation efficiency of cbz remarkably increased from 35 to 80 with an increase in sulfite concentration from 6 to 30 ¬µm further increasing the sulfite dosage from 30 to 60 ¬µm barely changed the degradation efficiency however the degradation efficiency decreased to 40 as sulfite concentration further increased to 150 ¬µm the overdosing of sulfite inhibited the cbz degradation mainly because sulfite served as a reactive species generator and a scavenger zhao et al 2021 the results suggested that the optimal sulfite dosage was 30 ¬µm at a molar ratio to the dosed clo2 of 1 1 notably no higher dosage of clo2 was investigated in this study with due consideration of the regulated limitations on the clo2 and clo3 formed from clo2 the details were discussed in section 3 5 kinetic model simulated concentrations of the reactive species generated in the clo2 sulfite process at different sulfite dosages are presented in fig s9a and s9c in the supporting information in di water the model predicted concentrations of radicals ho cl cl2 and so4 at a sulfite dosage of 60 ¬µm were higher than those at a sulfite dosage of 30 ¬µm except for clo that was higher at 30 ¬µm however the concentrations of cl2o2 and cl2o3 were respectively 4 and 8 times lower at 60 ¬µm than 30 ¬µm this result corroborates the experimental results suggesting that cl2o2 and cl2o3 contribute significantly to the degradation of cbz the collective contributions of those reactive species led to the higher degradation efficiency at a molar ratio to the dosed clo2 of 1 1 3 4 3 effects from water matrix components impacts of constituents of water matrices including chloride cl 0 10 mm bicarbonate hco3 0 10 mm and natural organic matter nom 0 10 mgc l on the degradation of cbz 2 ¬µm in the clo2 sulfite process were examined cl as shown in fig 5 a the presence of cl decreased the degradation efficiency of cbz and the inhibitory effect was stronger at higher cl concentrations the degradation efficiency of cbz decreased from 80 to 37 with increasing the cl concentration from 0 to 10 mm cl is a well known radical scavenger and is oxidized by reactive species e g clo and so4 to less reactive cl2 in aop peng et al 2022 the model results fig s10 showed that cl at 0 5 mm decreased the concentrations of so4 clo and ho and the decrease was more significant at higher cl concentrations the concentrations of cl2o3 could not be accurately predicted due to the lack of kinetic data meanwhile the concentrations of cl and cl2 gradually increased with increasing cl concentration cl reacts with ho generating cloh k 4 30 109 m 1 s 1 which can be converted to cl 2 10 1010 m 1 s 1 and cl2 1 00 104 m 1 s 1 lee et al 2020 lutze et al 2015b sun et al 2022 although the model predicted concentrations of cl and cl2 increased their concentrations were 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than o so4 clo and ho in addition the second order reaction rate constant of cl2 towards cbz k 4 30 107 m 1 s 1 is 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of clo ho and so4 k 4 30 109 m 1 s 1 8 80 109 m 1 s 1 and 1 92 109 m 1 s 1 respectively dong et al 2019 guo et al 2017 lei et al 2019 which could explain the general decrease in the cbz degradation efficiency moreover cl might also scavenge cl2o3 generated which cannot be quantified due to the lack of rate constant hco3 hco3 was also found to inhibit the cbz degradation efficiency from 80 to 52 with its concentration increasing from 0 to 10 mm a less significant inhibitory effect of hco3 than cl was observed likely due to its lower scavenging rate on so4 2 80 106 m 1 s 1 yang et al 2016 than those of cl 2 00 108 m 1 s 1 huie and neta 1987 the model also showed a negative effect of hco3 on the generation of so4 clo and ho fig s11 in line with the lower removal efficiency of cbz at higher hco3 concentrations the inhibition effects of hco3 on the model predicted concentrations of clo and so4 was milder compared to those of cl fig s10 corroborating the less significant inhibitory effect on cbz degradation of hco3 than cl experimentally observed fig 5a nom cbz degradation was also inhibited by the presence of nom the degradation efficiency decreased from 80 to 39 with increasing the nom concentration from 0 to 10 mg c l nom is also a known scavenger to clo 4 50 104 mg l 1 1s 1 guo et al 2017 and so4 6 38 36 8 106 mc 1s 1 lei et al 2022 the scavenge of reactive species and even clo2 by nom gan et al 2020 might result in the decreased removal efficiency of cbz model results showed that the presence of nom has slightly impacted on the concentrations of clo and so4 fig s12 despite that degradation of cbz was obviously decreased at higher nom concentration this result might be due to the direct scavenging of cl2o3 by nom which however was not included in the kinetic model due to lack of kinetic data real tap water experiments were also carried out to evaluate the degradation of cbz in a real tap water sample the water quality of the tap water is presented in table s5 as shown in fig 5b the cbz degradation was decreased from 80 to 56 in the real tap water treated by the clo2 sulfite process which was mainly due to the radical scavenging by chloride and nom in water nonetheless the 56 degradation in 10 s was still promising for rapid degradation of micropollutants in real water treatment practice the model predicted concentrations of ho clo so4 and cl2o3 were reduced by approximately 33 52 3 and 51 respectively in the presence of cl hco3 and nom fig s9b and s9d cl2o3 is mainly formed from the reaction of clo with clo2 therefore the reduced concentration of clo may also reduce the concentration of cl2o3 the second order rate constants of cl hco3 and nom toward cl2o3 remain unknown in the literature thus the decrease of cl2o3 concentration 51 in the presence of cl hco3 and nom could be underestimated 3 5 formation of organic and inorganic byproducts in treating real water the formation of inorganic and organic byproducts in the clo2 sulfite process was investigated fig 6 a presents the concentrations of clo2 and clo3 formed at an initial clo2 dosage of 30 ¬µm in the presence and absence of sulfite deducting the concentrations of clo2 clo3 and cl previously measured in the clo2 stock solution in the deionized water the clo2 sulfite process formed 0 33 mg l and 0 19 mg l of clo2 and clo3 respectively in real tap water the concentrations of formed clo2 and clo3 in the clo2 sulfite process increased by 12 1 0 37 mg l and 26 3 0 24 mg l respectively nonetheless both concentrations were lower than the guideline values proposed by who 0 7 mg l for clo2 or clo3 who 2017 compared to standalone clo2 oxidation the clo2 sulfite process increased the formation of clo2 and clo3 by two and three times respectively fig 6a the increased generation of clo2 in the clo2 sulfite process was attributed to i the one electron transfer pathway between clo2 and sulfite and ii from the reaction of so3 and clo2 eqs 1 4 on the other hand the increased formation of clo3 in the clo2 sulfite process was attributed to i the oxidation of clo2 by the generated reactive species ii the oxidation of clo2 by the in situ formed free chlorine and iii the reaction of clo2 with clo eq 3 pan et al 2016 zhao et al 2021 fig 6b presents the molar yield molar concentration of a product divided by the molar concentration of the consumed clo2 of the products from the reaction between clo2 and sulfite in the deionized water and real tap water compared to the deionized water the molar yields of clo2 and clo3 were increased by 19 1 and 25 2 respectively in the real tap water the higher yields of clo2 and clo3 in the real water sample were hypothesized to be due to the reactions of clo2 with nom via a generally one electron transfer pathway yielding clo2 and subsequently clo3 zhao et al 2021 in addition cl and free chlorine were also formed in the clo2 sulfite process fig 6b a satisfactory mass balance was achieved in terms of cl in both water samples the formation of chloro organic byproducts and corresponding calculated toxicity on a weight basis in the clo2 sulfite process were determined and compared with those by only clo2 oxidation as shown in fig 7 a the clo2 sulfite process slightly increased the formation of chloro organic dbps by 4 1 23 5 compared to standalone clo2 oxidation of which the highest increase was derived from dcp from 0 55 ¬µg l to 0 68 ¬µg l the concentration of tcm accounted for the highest concentration among the tested chloro organic dbps both in the presence 4 28 0 45 ¬µg l and absence of sulfite nevertheless the concentrations of tcm ch and dcan were over two orders of magnitude lower than the guideline values proposed for drinking water by the who 200 10 and 20 ¬µg l respectively the formation of selected chloro organic dbps in the clo2 sulfite process likely resulted from the reactions of clo free chlorine or cl2o3 with nom it is well known that the chlorine substitution reaction of chlorine deborde and von gunten 2008 and clo li et al 2021 kong et al 2016 with nom moieties e g phenolates anilines and alkoxy hydroxyl aromatic compounds could lead to the formation of chloro organic dbps however less information on cl2o3 reactivity is available at present cl2o3 may also contribute to the formation of chloro dbps given the reactive nature of its end cl o bond as shown in fig 3 the total toxicity weighted dbp concentration in the clo2 sulfite process was only 5 5 higher than that by standalone clo2 oxidation fig 7b with dcan contributing predominantly to the overall toxicity the results suggested that the formation of the selected chloro organic dbps in the clo2 sulfite process would unlikely represent a concern 4 conclusions and environmental implications this study demonstrated that micropollutants were rapidly degraded during the co exposure to clo2 and sulfite and disclosed that the unexpected degradation was attributed to the generation of reactive species e g clo and cl2o3 the findings provided a novel process by combining clo2 and sulfite for superfast degradation of micropollutants in water and wastewater the process yielded highly reactive species for rapid destruction of a wide spectrum of micropollutants and formed low concentrations of clo2 clo3 and chloro organic byproducts below drinking water standards the nom sources and characteristics may affect radical speciation and byproduct formation in the clo2 sulfite process which requires more investigation the process was suitable for micropollutant abatement in slightly alkaline water with a relatively low concentration of chloride and nom the process might be used for other environmental remediation or industrial purposes e g decolorization disinfection and deodorization moreover this study highlighted the overlooked impacts of using sulfite to quench the water containing clo2 in laboratory studies e g disinfection and disinfection byproduct relevant studies and in real water treatment practice besides sulfite we found that thiosulfate another commonly used quencher to clo2 in laboratory studies could also activate clo2 and generate reactive species fig s5 alternative quenchers e g ascorbic acid to sulfite thiosulfate should be used for quenching clo2 involved chemical reactions in laboratory studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

h composite samples of untreated wastewater were collected from 10 different sampling locations in arizona within the wastewater collection system for seven consecutive days per month beginning january 2019 and october 2020 details on the average flow data and average population served before and after the pandemic are presented in tables s2 and s3 due to confidentiality agreements with municipalities the exact location of the facilities is not revealed here in march 2020 the samples were collected for only five days for locations 6 and 7 due to the lockdown and lack of access to the treatment plant composite samples 2 l were collected in acid washed bottles transferred to high density polyethylene sample bottles placed on ice in coolers and transported to the biodesign center for environmental health engineering after collection the samples were immediately processed and the resultant organic extracts were stored at 20 c until further analysis 2 3 sample processing and analysis wastewater samples were analyzed following the published method described by gushgari et al 2019 with some modifications in brief all the raw wastewater samples were spiked with a mixture of deuterated compounds at a concentration of 5 ng ml except 13c12 tcs spiked at a concentration of 12 5 ng ml hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb solid phase extraction spe cartridges 6 cc 150 mg 30 Œºm

the u s environmental protection agency s usepa 2016 revised protocol as previously established supowit et al 2016 no analyte specific peaks were detected in the blank samples during the analysis mdls ranged between 8 and 17 ng l table s4 precision was calculated using previously published methods driver et al 2020 using relative percentage differences rpd rpd duplicates were within 30 for all analytes s i s 1 1 all the analytes were quantified using the isotopic dilution method where analyte responses native peak area were proportioned to the responses of corresponding isotope labeled standards each analyte was monitored with two mrm transitions except for triclosan table s5 two different ions were used for the quantification abundant and identification second most abundant of the mrm transitions the retention time of analytes in the wastewater matrix was within 0 2 min of the retention time of the standard compound under the same conditions the quantifier to qualifier ion ratio of analytes in target samples was set to be within 30 of the ion ratio of analytes in standards 2 5 calculations 2 5 1 estimation of mass loadings and per capita mass consumption the mass

and 10 wifi connection data was used for estimation during the pandemic all the electronic devices connected to the wifi in locations 8 9 and 10 were captured with the help of the educational institution involved in the study after all the signals were collected multiple devices used by the same person were deleted to avoid duplicate users only wifi signals were considered if the internet usage lasted longer than 30 min and less than 16 h to remove pass through users and stationary computers printers or other devices all the data were deidentified data were aggregated by building and those buildings assigned to a specific sewershed the total number of people was determined from 7 am the sampling began to 6 59 am the next day this information was later coupled with available housing data from the housing units we let wifi data drive the measurements and supplemented it with housing contract data 2 6 statistical analysis all the statistical tests were performed in the r software v 4 1 1 the normality of the datasets was determined using the shapiro wilk test for normality statistical differences were first determined by the kruskal wallis rank sum test which ranks the data and tests for differences in the distributions of each chemical between sampling months when the kruskal wallis rank sum test was found to be significant p 0 05 the dunn post hoc test for multiple comparisons was performed to determine significant differences of a chemical compound between the months p 0 05 in addition a non parametric mann whitney u test with bonferroni correction was applied for the pre pandemic and pandemic data sets for each chemical compound to determine the statistical significance p 0 05 in the mass loadings of the chemicals during the pandemic 3 results and discussion all the antimicrobials were identified in at least one of the 10 arizonian communities for the sampling period between january 2019 and october 2020 the concentration of the analytes was multiplied with the flow of the wastewater and normalized with the population of the community per 1000 people fig 1 3 1 loadings of total parabens in the wastewater the total paraben mass loading pbs 999 102 mg day per 1000 people fig 1 was 60 and 9 times higher than the population normalized tcc and tcs mass loading respectively there was a sharp increment in the consumption of the parabens from december 2019 by 47 which was the month of the first detection of the covid 19 outbreak in wuhan huang et al 2020 the sampling week for december 2019 was from 3rd to 9th hence this could be expected as not a result of the consumer behavior due to the covid 19 pandemic the increment in the pbs was due to the rise in the mass loading of the mepb consumption fig 2 and prpb mepb generally is considered one of the highly used parabens standalone or with the other mixtures of parabens prpb as an active ingredient in various ppcps de carvalho penha et al 2021 increases in paraben use in general may be interpreted as a sign of substitution of the banned substances tcs and tcc from u s personal care products in addition an uptick of paraben based antimicrobial products may also be caused in part as a reaction to the influenza season maricopa county in arizona public health 2022 stated that there was a 6 rise in influenza cases during the monitoring campaign the total paraben consumption kept increasing and was found to surge 49 in the month of july 2020 compared to june 2020 this may be related to a large wave of covid 19 infections and related deaths recorded in arizona in the first and second week of july 2020 covid 19 data azdhs 2021 therefore the sampling that occurred in the third week of december 2019 may have been influenced by the increased influenza cases in the communities and a resultant public response of more frequent cdc 2021 against influenza even though the first case of sars cov 2 in arizona was detected in january 2020 there were reports of a possible respiratory outbreak in china and other countries potentially triggering more frequent use of personal hygiene consumer products in january and february of 2020 the mass loadings of parabens increased about 30 from july 2020 to october 2020 and the total increment in the consumption of parabens from start of the sampling campaign to the end was 72 fig 1 the breakdown of all the change in the mass loadings is presented in fig 2 3 2 loadings of tcc and tcs in arizonian wastewater there was a notable decrease in tcc and tcs mass loadings over the sampling period a continuous decrement of tcc since the start of the sampling campaign and the greatest drop 52 was found in february 2019 however there was statistically significant p 0 05 rise in the consumption of tcc in july 2020 which also happened to be during the first wave of covid 19 cases in arizona this was the only increase in the 22 months of tcc monitoring and hence no conclusion could be drawn from this rise nevertheless the mass loadings of tcs stayed relatively consistent from the sampling period until september 2019 218 37 mg day per 1000 people there was a visible decline 35 in september 2019 followed by statistically significant p 0 05 reduction 85 at the end of the sampling campaign 37 6 mg day per 1000 people fig 1 tcc and tcs both showed a statistically significant decrement in the mass loadings per 1000 people p 0 05 over the sampling period a similar decrement in tcc and tcs has been reported by in the midwestern wastewater facilities in the united states brose et al 2019 this decline in tcc and tcs was found from 2012 to 2018 as of 2017 tcs and tcc have been banned from otc products in the u s however these compounds are still found in other consumer products like phone cases bottles and toys as active antimicrobial ingredients the decrement in the loadings of tcc and tcs thus shows that even a partial ban of tcc and tcs from some 2000 u s otc personal care products was impactful enough to reduce the overall mass of these two antimicrobials consumed and discharged into wastewater the inflection point of mass use detectable in wastewater is influenced by both the ban itself and the time required to use up the chemical inventory that was already sold leading up to the ban 3 3 loadings of individual parabens in arizonian wastewater population normalized mass loads of mepb were higher 750 69 mg day per 1000 people compared to tcc 16 3 mg day per 1000 people and tcs 117 114 mg day per 1000 people fig 2 the mass loading of the mepb was found to be higher in september 2020 1783 201 mg day per 1000 people and it was 73 higher than the start of the sampling campaign jan 2019 and showed statistically significant increment p 0 05 this result is in consensus with recent studies across brazil china india and japan becerra herrera et al 2020 blanco et al 2009 gonz√°lez mari√±o et al 2011 karthikraj et al 2017 li et al 2015 in wastewater as well as other water bodies bolujoko et al 2022 derisso et al 2020 feng et al 2019 the mass loading of the mepb in wastewater was 52 higher in july 2020 1239 49 mg day per 1000 people than in june 598 58 mg day per 1000 people of 2020 similarly in july 55 higher mass loading of prpb was assessed using wastewater 173 18 mg day per 1000 people than in june 78 8 mg day per 1000 people this shift in the paraben consumption in july was statistically significant p 0 05 for both mepb and prpb these two parabens are the most abundant parabens in raw wastewater as mentioned in the literature blanco et al 2009 bratkowska et al 2011 canosa et al 2006 gonz√°lez mari√±o et al 2009 lee et al 2005 pedrouzo et al 2009 both parabens mepb and prpb are generally used as stabilizing and active ingredients in personal care products and pharmaceutical products like therapeutic ointments pain relief gels and antifungal shampoos haman et al 2015 and are the most used parabens demonstrated by wastewater data fig 2 however bupb was found with decreasing mass loadings fig 2 in the month of december 2019 march 2020 and april 2020 but this change was not statistically significant p 0 05 even though the stability of parabens is moderately low in wastewater mepb and prpb are comparatively detected in higher abundance than bupb haman et al 2015 the detection frequency of bupb was comparatively lower in those months than mepb and prpb the bioconcentration for bupb is higher madsen 2001 and could easily be lost due to in sewer biofilms justifying concentrations detected below mdls in those months 3 4 loadings of antimicrobials during pandemic and pre pandemic in arizonian wastewater an increasing trend in the total mass loading of these antimicrobials in wastewater was found explaining the consumer shift in the use of antimicrobials the total mass loading of these antimicrobials at the end of the sampling campaign is approximately 55 higher than that of the start of the campaign fig 2 this could be the direct result of the pandemic and the use of personal care products with higher parabens in them was the consequence of consumer behavior this has been explained by the profile of individual antimicrobial fig 3 the increment of the mass loading of mepb etpb and prpb during the pandemic compared to the pre pandemic data was statistically significant p 0 05 the mass loading of the mepb during the pandemic was higher 1211 55 mg day per 1000 people among all the antimicrobials and it increased by 55 compared to the mepb pre pandemic mass loading 547 13 mg day per 1000 people mepb is the most common paraben used in soaps conditioners body washes and cleaning consumer products van der schyff et al 2022 the onset of pandemic likely increased the frequency of using such products containing higher mepb as reflected in wastewater in arizonian communities however there was no significant change in the mass loadings of bupb before 20 5 mg day per 1000 people and during the pandemic 11 1 mg day per 1000 people the mass loadings of tcc and tcs decreased during the pandemic and were found to be statistically significant p 0 05 as explained in section 3 2 3 5 differences in mass loadings of antimicrobials in different communities this study was conducted in 10 different communities in arizona and the overall mass loadings of each location have been presented in fig 4 locations 1 and 5 contain flow from hospital areas whereas locations 2 3 and 7 have flowed from residential areas locations 4 5 and 7 have a high percentage of commercial properties than residential location 8 9 and 10 represent the campus locations of a public university the population of campus locations 8 9 and 10 during the pandemic was estimated using the anonymized studied unique user wi fi connections as previously adopted for the small community population change during the pandemic wright et al 2022 the mass loadings of parabens increased during the pandemic for etpb in all ten communities in contrast the mass loading profile of mepb and prpb increased during the pandemic in 8 communities except for locations 9 and 10 the mass loading of bupb also did not increase during the pandemic in 9 and 10 fig 5 during the pandemic the resulting contributing population in this region was relatively lower and consequently the mass loading of antimicrobial per 1000 population was found to be decreasing this is due to the dynamic population de facto population taken into consideration using the wi fi signal for the pandemic however the population estimation for other locations was based on the static registered population de jure population these two populations can significantly affect the mass loading of the antimicrobial and is one of the limitations of wastewater based epidemiology wbe baz lomba et al 2019 the mass loadings of tcc were lower during the pandemic than that of the pre pandemic period except for community 6 in contrast the mass loadings of tcs were consistently more down during the pandemic than during prepandemic time across all the communities 4 study limitations increased antimicrobial consumption during the pandemic were notable as demonstrated in this study via wastewater monitoring however the robustness of the consumption estimates may have been diminished by multiple factors including a in sewer losses through degradation b sorption of antimicrobials to sewer biofilms and c imprecisions in population estimates that can propagate into mass loading estimates out of all the studied antimicrobial agents tcs and tcc are the most stable dhillon et al 2015 halden and paull 2005 in contrast parabens are not very stable yet can be detected routinely in municipal wastewater gonz√°lez mari√±o et al 2011 the stability of individual parabens differs and is a function of ph redox conditions temperature and the local microbiome of the sewerage system therefore any losses in wastewater derived estimates should be systematic and were not expected to majorly affect the overall trends in the data the extent of sorption depends on several parameters including hydrophobicity of compounds ph and physicochemical properties of wastewater suspended solids and organic carbon content and biofilm properties all studied parabens triclosan and triclocarban are mainly uncharged at ph 7 kumar et al 2022 and may sorb to sewer biofilms and suspended solids due to hydrophobic interactions population estimates constitute a higher degree of uncertainty in the wbe calculation of per capita mass loadings castiglioni et al 2013 however there are no universally agreed upon methods to estimate population density in this work five out of ten communities included residential populations with little movement two communities contained both residential and commercial populations 40 and three of the communities had a highly dynamic population impacted by the schedule of a large educational enterprise wifi data was used for the latter three communities to better account for dynamic population changes 5 conclusions the results of this study indicate higher consumption of antimicrobials during the pandemic than during the pre pandemic period the overall consumption profile of antimicrobials increased by 53 since the start of the sampling period and observed the shift of tcc and tcs use towards parabens this study also reports the first u s monitoring of antimicrobials during the pandemic this increase in antimicrobial use should be viewed as an alarming sign of recognizing antimicrobial gene resistance this study also showed that the fda ban on tcc and tcs may have been in effect for the otc products but these chemicals are still prevalent in other consumer goods in addition this study provides valuable information for future toxicological and risk assessment studies targeting these compounds and understanding the possibility of other resistant microorganisms or genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance in

h composite samples of untreated wastewater were collected from 10 different sampling locations in arizona within the wastewater collection system for seven consecutive days per month beginning january 2019 and october 2020 details on the average flow data and average population served before and after the pandemic are presented in tables s2 and s3 due to confidentiality agreements with municipalities the exact location of the facilities is not revealed here in march 2020 the samples were collected for only five days for locations 6 and 7 due to the lockdown and lack of access to the treatment plant composite samples 2 l were collected in acid washed bottles transferred to high density polyethylene sample bottles placed on ice in coolers and transported to the biodesign center for environmental health engineering after collection the samples were immediately processed and the resultant organic extracts were stored at 20 c until further analysis 2 3 sample processing and analysis wastewater samples were analyzed following the published method described by gushgari et al 2019 with some modifications in brief all the raw wastewater samples were spiked with a mixture of deuterated compounds at a concentration of 5 ng ml except 13c12 tcs spiked at a concentration of 12 5 ng ml hydrophilic lipophilic balance hlb solid phase extraction spe cartridges 6 cc 150 mg 30 Œºm

and 10 wifi connection data was used for estimation during the pandemic all the electronic devices connected to the wifi in locations 8 9 and 10 were captured with the help of the educational institution involved in the study after all the signals were collected multiple devices used by the same person were deleted to avoid duplicate users only wifi signals were considered if the internet usage lasted longer than 30 min and less than 16 h to remove pass through users and stationary computers printers or other devices all the data were deidentified data were aggregated by building and those buildings assigned to a specific sewershed the total number of people was determined from 7 am the sampling began to 6 59 am the next day this information was later coupled with available housing data from the housing units we let wifi data drive the measurements and supplemented it with housing contract data 2 6 statistical analysis all the statistical tests were performed in the r software v 4 1 1 the normality of the datasets was determined using the shapiro wilk test for normality statistical differences were first determined by the kruskal wallis rank sum test which ranks the data and tests for differences in the distributions of each chemical between sampling months when the kruskal wallis rank sum test was found to be significant p 0 05 the dunn post hoc test for multiple comparisons was performed to determine significant differences of a chemical compound between the months p 0 05 in addition a non parametric mann whitney u test with bonferroni correction was applied for the pre pandemic and pandemic data sets for each chemical compound to determine the statistical significance p 0 05 in the mass loadings of the chemicals during the pandemic 3 results and discussion all the antimicrobials were identified in at least one of the 10 arizonian communities for the sampling period between january 2019 and october 2020 the concentration of the analytes was multiplied with the flow of the wastewater and normalized with the population of the community per 1000 people fig 1 3 1 loadings of total parabens in the wastewater the total paraben mass loading pbs 999 102 mg day per 1000 people fig 1 was 60 and 9 times higher than the population normalized tcc and tcs mass loading respectively there was a sharp increment in the consumption of the parabens from december 2019 by 47 which was the month of the first detection of the covid 19 outbreak in wuhan huang et al 2020 the sampling week for december 2019 was from 3rd to 9th hence this could be expected as not a result of the consumer behavior due to the covid 19 pandemic the increment in the pbs was due to the rise in the mass loading of the mepb consumption fig 2 and prpb mepb generally is considered one of the highly used parabens standalone or with the other mixtures of parabens prpb as an active ingredient in various ppcps de carvalho penha et al 2021 increases in paraben use in general may be interpreted as a sign of substitution of the banned substances tcs and tcc from u s personal care products in addition an uptick of paraben based antimicrobial products may also be caused in part as a reaction to the influenza season maricopa county in arizona public health 2022 stated that there was a 6 rise in influenza cases during the monitoring campaign the total paraben consumption kept increasing and was found to surge 49 in the month of july 2020 compared to june 2020 this may be related to a large wave of covid 19 infections and related deaths recorded in arizona in the first and second week of july 2020 covid 19 data azdhs 2021 therefore the sampling that occurred in the third week of december 2019 may have been influenced by the increased influenza cases in the communities and a resultant public response of more frequent cdc 2021 against influenza even though the first case of sars cov 2 in arizona was detected in january 2020 there were reports of a possible respiratory outbreak in china and other countries potentially triggering more frequent use of personal hygiene consumer products in january and february of 2020 the mass loadings of parabens increased about 30 from july 2020 to october 2020 and the total increment in the consumption of parabens from start of the sampling campaign to the end was 72 fig 1 the breakdown of all the change in the mass loadings is presented in fig 2 3 2 loadings of tcc and tcs in arizonian wastewater there was a notable decrease in tcc and tcs mass loadings over the sampling period a continuous decrement of tcc since the start of the sampling campaign and the greatest drop 52 was found in february 2019 however there was statistically significant p 0 05 rise in the consumption of tcc in july 2020 which also happened to be during the first wave of covid 19 cases in arizona this was the only increase in the 22 months of tcc monitoring and hence no conclusion could be drawn from this rise nevertheless the mass loadings of tcs stayed relatively consistent from the sampling period until september 2019 218 37 mg day per 1000 people there was a visible decline 35 in september 2019 followed by statistically significant p 0 05 reduction 85 at the end of the sampling campaign 37 6 mg day per 1000 people fig 1 tcc and tcs both showed a statistically significant decrement in the mass loadings per 1000 people p 0 05 over the sampling period a similar decrement in tcc and tcs has been reported by in the midwestern wastewater facilities in the united states brose et al 2019 this decline in tcc and tcs was found from 2012 to 2018 as of 2017 tcs and tcc have been banned from otc products in the u s however these compounds are still found in other consumer products like phone cases bottles and toys as active antimicrobial ingredients the decrement in the loadings of tcc and tcs thus shows that even a partial ban of tcc and tcs from some 2000 u s otc personal care products was impactful enough to reduce the overall mass of these two antimicrobials consumed and discharged into wastewater the inflection point of mass use detectable in wastewater is influenced by both the ban itself and the time required to use up the chemical inventory that was already sold leading up to the ban 3 3 loadings of individual parabens in arizonian wastewater population normalized mass loads of mepb were higher 750 69 mg day per 1000 people compared to tcc 16 3 mg day per 1000 people and tcs 117 114 mg day per 1000 people fig 2 the mass loading of the mepb was found to be higher in september 2020 1783 201 mg day per 1000 people and it was 73 higher than the start of the sampling campaign jan 2019 and showed statistically significant increment p 0 05 this result is in consensus with recent studies across brazil china india and japan becerra herrera et al 2020 blanco et al 2009 gonz√°lez mari√±o et al 2011 karthikraj et al 2017 li et al 2015 in wastewater as well as other water bodies bolujoko et al 2022 derisso et al 2020 feng et al 2019 the mass loading of the mepb in wastewater was 52 higher in july 2020 1239 49 mg day per 1000 people than in june 598 58 mg day per 1000 people of 2020 similarly in july 55 higher mass loading of prpb was assessed using wastewater 173 18 mg day per 1000 people than in june 78 8 mg day per 1000 people this shift in the paraben consumption in july was statistically significant p 0 05 for both mepb and prpb these two parabens are the most abundant parabens in raw wastewater as mentioned in the literature blanco et al 2009 bratkowska et al 2011 canosa et al 2006 gonz√°lez mari√±o et al 2009 lee et al 2005 pedrouzo et al 2009 both parabens mepb and prpb are generally used as stabilizing and active ingredients in personal care products and pharmaceutical products like therapeutic ointments pain relief gels and antifungal shampoos haman et al 2015 and are the most used parabens demonstrated by wastewater data fig 2 however bupb was found with decreasing mass loadings fig 2 in the month of december 2019 march 2020 and april 2020 but this change was not statistically significant p 0 05 even though the stability of parabens is moderately low in wastewater mepb and prpb are comparatively detected in higher abundance than bupb haman et al 2015 the detection frequency of bupb was comparatively lower in those months than mepb and prpb the bioconcentration for bupb is higher madsen 2001 and could easily be lost due to in sewer biofilms justifying concentrations detected below mdls in those months 3 4 loadings of antimicrobials during pandemic and pre pandemic in arizonian wastewater an increasing trend in the total mass loading of these antimicrobials in wastewater was found explaining the consumer shift in the use of antimicrobials the total mass loading of these antimicrobials at the end of the sampling campaign is approximately 55 higher than that of the start of the campaign fig 2 this could be the direct result of the pandemic and the use of personal care products with higher parabens in them was the consequence of consumer behavior this has been explained by the profile of individual antimicrobial fig 3 the increment of the mass loading of mepb etpb and prpb during the pandemic compared to the pre pandemic data was statistically significant p 0 05 the mass loading of the mepb during the pandemic was higher 1211 55 mg day per 1000 people among all the antimicrobials and it increased by 55 compared to the mepb pre pandemic mass loading 547 13 mg day per 1000 people mepb is the most common paraben used in soaps conditioners body washes and cleaning consumer products van der schyff et al 2022 the onset of pandemic likely increased the frequency of using such products containing higher mepb as reflected in wastewater in arizonian communities however there was no significant change in the mass loadings of bupb before 20 5 mg day per 1000 people and during the pandemic 11 1 mg day per 1000 people the mass loadings of tcc and tcs decreased during the pandemic and were found to be statistically significant p 0 05 as explained in section 3 2 3 5 differences in mass loadings of antimicrobials in different communities this study was conducted in 10 different communities in arizona and the overall mass loadings of each location have been presented in fig 4 locations 1 and 5 contain flow from hospital areas whereas locations 2 3 and 7 have flowed from residential areas locations 4 5 and 7 have a high percentage of commercial properties than residential location 8 9 and 10 represent the campus locations of a public university the population of campus locations 8 9 and 10 during the pandemic was estimated using the anonymized studied unique user wi fi connections as previously adopted for the small community population change during the pandemic wright et al 2022 the mass loadings of parabens increased during the pandemic for etpb in all ten communities in contrast the mass loading profile of mepb and prpb increased during the pandemic in 8 communities except for locations 9 and 10 the mass loading of bupb also did not increase during the pandemic in 9 and 10 fig 5 during the pandemic the resulting contributing population in this region was relatively lower and consequently the mass loading of antimicrobial per 1000 population was found to be decreasing this is due to the dynamic population de facto population taken into consideration using the wi fi signal for the pandemic however the population estimation for other locations was based on the static registered population de jure population these two populations can significantly affect the mass loading of the antimicrobial and is one of the limitations of wastewater based epidemiology wbe baz lomba et al 2019 the mass loadings of tcc were lower during the pandemic than that of the pre pandemic period except for community 6 in contrast the mass loadings of tcs were consistently more down during the pandemic than during prepandemic time across all the communities 4 study limitations increased antimicrobial consumption during the pandemic were notable as demonstrated in this study via wastewater monitoring however the robustness of the consumption estimates may have been diminished by multiple factors including a in sewer losses through degradation b sorption of antimicrobials to sewer biofilms and c imprecisions in population estimates that can propagate into mass loading estimates out of all the studied antimicrobial agents tcs and tcc are the most stable dhillon et al 2015 halden and paull 2005 in contrast parabens are not very stable yet can be detected routinely in municipal wastewater gonz√°lez mari√±o et al 2011 the stability of individual parabens differs and is a function of ph redox conditions temperature and the local microbiome of the sewerage system therefore any losses in wastewater derived estimates should be systematic and were not expected to majorly affect the overall trends in the data the extent of sorption depends on several parameters including hydrophobicity of compounds ph and physicochemical properties of wastewater suspended solids and organic carbon content and biofilm properties all studied parabens triclosan and triclocarban are mainly uncharged at ph 7 kumar et al 2022 and may sorb to sewer biofilms and suspended solids due to hydrophobic interactions population estimates constitute a higher degree of uncertainty in the wbe calculation of per capita mass loadings castiglioni et al 2013 however there are no universally agreed upon methods to estimate population density in this work five out of ten communities included residential populations with little movement two communities contained both residential and commercial populations 40 and three of the communities had a highly dynamic population impacted by the schedule of a large educational enterprise wifi data was used for the latter three communities to better account for dynamic population changes 5 conclusions the results of this study indicate higher consumption of antimicrobials during the pandemic than during the pre pandemic period the overall consumption profile of antimicrobials increased by 53 since the start of the sampling period and observed the shift of tcc and tcs use towards parabens this study also reports the first u s monitoring of antimicrobials during the pandemic this increase in antimicrobial use should be viewed as an alarming sign of recognizing antimicrobial gene resistance this study also showed that the fda ban on tcc and tcs may have been in effect for the otc products but these chemicals are still prevalent in other consumer goods in addition this study provides valuable information for future toxicological and risk assessment studies targeting these compounds and understanding the possibility of other resistant microorganisms or genetic determinants of antimicrobial resistance in wastewater the data generated here may provide information to environmental engineers biologists economists and public health officials to understand the antimicrobial gene resistance public behavior

15669,shallow eutrophic lakes contribute disproportional to the emissions of co2 and ch4 from inland waters the processes that contribute to these fluxes their environmental controls and anthropogenic influences however are poorly constrained here we studied the spatial variability and seasonal dynamics of co2 and ch4 fluxes across the sediment water interface and their relationships to porewater nutrient concentrations in lake ulansuhai a shallow eutrophic lake located in a semi arid region in northern china the mean concentrations of co2 and ch4 in porewater were 877 8 31 0 ¬µmol l 1 and 689 2 45 0 ¬µmol l 1 which were more than 50 and 20 times higher than those in the water column respectively the sediment was always a source of both gases for the water column porewater co2 and ch4 concentrations and diffusive fluxes across the sediment water interface showed significant temporal and spatial variations with mean diffusive fluxes of 887 3 124 7 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 and 607 1 68 0 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 for co2 and ch4 respectively the temporal and spatial variations of co2 and ch4 concentrations in porewater were associated with corresponding variations in dissolved organic carbon and dissolved nitrogen species temperature and dissolved organic carbon in surface porewater were the most important drivers of temporal variations in diffusive fluxes whereas dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen were the main drivers of their spatial variations diffusive fluxes generally increased with increasing dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen in the porewater from the inflow to the outflow region of the lake the estimated fluxes of both gases at the sediment water interface were one order of magnitude lower than the emissions at the water surface which were measured in a companion study this indicates that diffusive fluxes across the sediment water interface were not the main pathway for co2 and ch4 emissions to the atmosphere to improve the mechanistic understanding and predictability of greenhouse gas emissions from shallow lakes future studies should aim to close the apparent gap in the co2 and ch4 budget by combining improved flux measurement techniques with process based modeling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication lake ulansuhai sediment water interface greenhouse gases diffusive fluxes data availability the authors do

nearly 80 of the current radiative forcing myhre et al 2014 in relation to their relatively small areal extent inland waters contribute disproportionately to co2 and ch4 emissions downing 2010 rosentreter et al 2021 yet current estimates of co2 and ch4 emissions from aquatic ecosystems are not well constrained due to reasons that include the limited number of observations and uncertainties of field measurement davidson et al 2015b holgerson and raymond 2016 rosentreter et al 2021 quantification of greenhouse gas emissions from various aquatic ecosystems and improved understanding of their environmental drivers are key to improving the accuracy of current co2 and ch4 budgets and their response to climate change and human activities lakes are a vital component of the inland water system regarding carbon cycling and climate regulation because they store transport and transform large quantities of carbon tranvik et al 2009b shallow lakes cover the largest surface area globally downing et al 2006 verpoorter et al 2014 and are hot spots of co2 and ch4 emissions it has been demonstrated that sediments in shallow water are particularly important because the ch4 produced is much more likely to reach the atmosphere than ch4 produced in deeper profundal sediments bastviken et al 2008 shallow lakes are more vulnerable to eutrophication due to high nutrient input anderson et al 2014 sinha et al 2017 and poor self cleaning capacity havens et al 2001 sun et al 2021 eutrophication plays a critical role in regulating lake co2 and ch4 emissions davidson et al 2015a sun et al 2021 lake sediments are the primary site for biogeochemical transformation and can act as a sink or a source of nutrients for the overlying water therefore sediments influence the availability of nutrients in lakes huang et al 2017 both co2 and ch4 can be produced in lake sediments during the microbial degradation of organic carbon by microorganisms schimel and gulledge 1998 wang et al 2017 and is affected by the quantity and quality of organic matter om eutrophication results in higher om deposition rates hayes et al 2017 which can cause an increase in carbon burial rates heathcote and downing

substrate quantity and quality affect the methanogenesis rate in lake sediments west et al 2015 shallow lakes are inherently heterogeneous over spatiotemporal scales due to changes in topographic features and environmental conditions resulting in large uncertainties in assessments of their co2 and ch4 budgets and emissions although being an important component of basin scale carbon budgets spatial and temporal variations of co2 and ch4 concentrations in sediment porewater and fluxes at the sediment water interface have rarely been studied moreover the linkages between spatio temporal variability of organic carbon and nutrient availability and sediment water fluxes have not been studied in shallow eutrophic lakes knowledge about the variability and dynamics of diffusive co2 and ch4 fluxes at the sediment water interface of eutrophic lakes and their main environmental drivers provides important insights into the lake carbon dynamics and improves the accuracy of carbon and greenhouse gas budgets here we test the hypothesis that porewater co2 and ch4 concentrations and sediment waters fluxes in shallow eutrophic lakes are characterized by large spatial and seasonal variability in response to temperature and nutrient availability using field measurements in an arid eutrophic and shallow lake we evaluated the spatial and seasonal variations of co2 and ch4 porewater concentrations and diffusive fluxes across the sediment water interface and identified the main influencing factors of their within lake variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area

china liu et al 2017 it is a typical oxbow lake with a surface area of 293 km2 and a water volume of 2 5 3 108 m3 fig 1 lake ulansuhai is the main receiving water body for local agricultural wastewater domestic sewage and industrial wastewater resulting in severe eutrophication the trophic level in the water column of lake ulansuhai is characterized by large spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics sun et al 2021 the sampling sites were selected to cover the primary lake areas site s1 is located in the northern part of the lake adjacent to the main water inlet whereas sites s2 s4 are located in the upstream and middle stream regions of the lake sites s5 and s6 are close to each other but the trophic level at site s5 was found to be higher than that at site s6 site s7 is located near an aquafarm and the outlet of the lake the highest trophic state occurred at s1 and the lowest occurred at s2 among seven sites sun et al 2021 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 co2 and ch4

sediment cores were collected from the sampling sites using a gravity sediment corer tube length 60 cm and inner diameter 9 cm in total 28 cores were collected from the 7 sampling areas to minimize systematic sampling bias various sites in each sampling area were sampled on each sampling day the cores were cut to a length of 35 cm sealed at the top and bottom with silicone plugs and stored and transported vertically for analysis in the laboratory from the four cores collected at each point three cores were used as replicates to determine the dissolved gas concentration and physicochemical variables in pore water the fourth core was used for the determination of sediment porosity in triplicates porosity œÜ was calculated based on the water content of the sediment which was determined by weight loss after drying at 105 c for 24 h zhang et al 2013 in the laboratory the sediment porewater was extracted from 5 10 15 20 25 30 cm depth below the sediment water interface the porewater was

approach causes minimal cross sampling of different sediment layers alberto et al 2000 bodmer et al 2020 20 ml of the extracted porewater was removed using a syringe with a three way valve and replaced by a headspace filled with air the samples were shaken vigorously for 1 min to equilibrate porewater and headspace gases before measuring the partial pressures of co2 and ch4 in the headspace

doc were lowest in january and slightly higher during the remaining sampling campaigns in addition dtn was also lowest in january but showed more pronounced seasonal variations with about twofold higher concentrations in july the majority of dtn was in the form of nh4 which however was less variable in comparison to no3 and no2 there was no significant difference in dtp concentrations measured in different months in addition to seasonal variations the porewater chemical variables showed some systematic differences among the seven sampling sites fig s4 table s1 and s2 most pronounced sixfold higher dtp concentrations in deeper sediments were observed near the main inflow s1 porewater doc concentrations were highest in the midstream area s4 s6 where dtn was lowest the highest and lowest

156 6 ¬µmol l 1 were higher than those observed at other sites and about threefold higher than the lowest concentrations which were observed at s1 462 7 46 0 ¬µmol l 1 from site s2 to s5 porewater co2 concentration gradually increased although not all sites were significantly different from others fig 4c and table s7 in all measurements the porewater co2 concentrations gradually increased with increasing depth below the swi with significantly different concentrations at all sampling depths dissolved ch4 concentrations in the water column varied temporarily over one order of magnitude with the highest concentration in july 17 8 3 0 ¬µmol l 1 and the lowest in april 1 8 0 4 ¬µmol l 1 fig 4b in april and in october when the concentrations were low dissolved ch4 concentrations were similar at all depth while the concentrations increased towards the water surface in july and had a near bottom maximum in january fig 4b the seasonally averaged ch4 water column concentration was highest at site s3 and lowest at s1 but there were no significant differences among the other sampling sites s4 to s7 fig 4d porewater ch4 concentrations were approximately 15 times higher than in the water

generally increased with increasing depth below the swi with significant differences between sampling depths p 0 01 fig s5b and table s7 the porewater ch4 concentrations also showed significant temporal and spatial variations among the four months and seven sites p 0 01 as well as at different sampling depths fig 4b and d and fig s5b the results of the anova are presented in table s6 and s7 temporally the porewater ch4 concentrations showed strong seasonal variations among the four sampling months p 0 01 with the lowest value in january 76 4 10 6 ¬µmol l 1 and the highest value in july 1222 9 53 2 ¬µmol l 1 spatially the mean porewater ch4 concentrations was highest near the aquafarm site s7 952 9 79 9 ¬µmol l 1 and lowest at site s4 371 3 38 8¬µmol l 1 from sites s3 to s7 the ch4 concentrations increased gradually from the inflow to the outflow region of the lake the spatial variations in porewater ch4 concentrations differed from those in the water column fig 4d the highest concentrations in water column were observed at s3 13 3 2 5 ¬µmol l 1 where the porewater concentrations was lowest 371 3 35 6 ¬µmol l 1 whereas the opposite was observed at s2 it is worth noting that the ch4 concentration in the water column was very small near the main inflow site s1 3 4 fluxes of co2 and ch4 across sediment water interface co2 fluxes across swi in lake ulansuhai varied from 1 7

variations p 0 01 table s8 and s9 temporally the co2 fluxes were largest in july 2241 5 300 3 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 and lowest in january 1 7 0 6 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 spatially the co2 fluxes at s6 1516 4 423 9 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 were significantly higher than those at s1 s3 s4 and s7 but similar to s2 and s5 the lowest mean flux was estimated near the inflow at s1 362 1 110 2 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 but was not significantly different from mean fluxes estimated at s3 and near the outlet at s7 table s8 and s9 the diffusive ch4 fluxes across the swi ranged from 2 4 to 2271 7 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 with a mean value of 607 1 68 0 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 for the whole sampling period fig 5b and 5d the ch4 fluxes showed distinct temporal variations p 0 01 table s8 and s9 with the lowest flux in january 43 0 10 0 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 and the highest flux in july 1337 0 124 2 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 in addition the ch4 fluxes also showed significant spatial differences with the lowest at site s3 306 5 80 1 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 and an about threefold higher flux at s7 920 9 167 4 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 3 5 effects of environmental variables on porewater concentrations and diffusive fluxes dissolved co2 and ch4 concentrations in porewater were positively correlated to each other and with doc dtn nh4 and no2 concentrations p 0 05 and negatively correlated with ph p 0 05 table 1 dtp was negatively correlated with co2 concentrations p 0 05 but not correlated with ch4 concentrations p 0 05 the principal component analysis pca showed that the variations in porewater co2 and ch4 concentrations were primarily related to variations in doc no2 and dtn fig 6 a the dissolved gas concentrations in porewater were positively correlated with the diffusive fluxes p 0 05 table 2 moreover the diffusive fluxes of co2 and ch4 were positively correlated with each other and increased with increasing concentrations of doc dtn nh4 no2 and sediment temperature p 0 05 table 2 fig 6b additionally the ch4 flux was higher from sediments with higher porosity to explore the main controlling factors of the estimated fluxes a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was used the results showed that the surface sediment temperature doc nh4 and no2 were the main influencing factors for the co2 fluxes p 0 001 whereas the ch4 fluxes were mainly influenced by sediment surface temperature and doc p 0 001 table 3 4 discussion 4 1 temporal and spatial variability of co2 and ch4 concentrations in lakes especially in shallow lakes the system metabolism mainly occurs in sediments bergstr√∂m et al 2010 heterotrophic sediment respiration is the primary source of co2 production gudasz et al 2010 macintyre et al 2018 tranvik et al 2009a in this study measurements in a large shallow and eutrophic lake revealed large seasonal variations of porewater co2 concentrations fig 4a table s6 with the mean porewater co2 concentrations in july being 80 times higher than in january the porewater co2 concentrations followed a similar temporal dynamic as the concentrations of doc dtn and no2 in the sediment porewater fig 2 and table 1 the seasonal variations of doc dtn and no2 concentrations explained the majority of the seasonal variations in porewater co2 concentrations across all study sites fig 6a excess organic carbon doc and nitrogen input potentially provides additional substrate for heterotrophic activity kristensen et al 2008 which causes an increase of the co2 concentration in porewater and emission from the sediment to the water the observed positive effect of no2 on co2 concentration may be explained by the production of co2 during nitrification and denitrification in the sediment hamersley and howes 2003 we also found significant spatial variations in porewater co2 concentrations with twofold higher concentration near the lakeshore s6 compared to the lowest concentration near the inflow s1 fig 4c the similarity to spatial patterns in nutrient concentration in porewater and their positive relations with co2 concentrations table 1 and fig 6a indicate that high nutrient concentrations doc dtn and no2 are a crucial determinant for high porewater co2 concentration porewater ch4 concentrations also showed significant temporal and spatial variations in lake ulansuhai fig 4b and d table s6 temporally the porewater ch4 concentrations showed strong seasonal variations with 15 times higher concentration in summer than in winter higher ch4 production rates at higher temperature yvon durocher et al 2014 and increased organic carbon availability from autochthonous production fig 2 are likely promoting the higher ch4 concentration in summer spatially we observed persistent gradients with increasing ch4 concentrations from inlet to the outlet relatively higher ch4 concentrations were found near the lake outlet and the aquafarm s7 which coincides with higher dissolved nitrogen concentration at this site it is interesting to note that this longitudinal gradient is opposing the gradients typically found in deeper lakes and reservoirs were allochthones organic matter preferably settles near the inflow leading to higher emissions from these areas linkhorst et al 2021 indeed previous studies in lake ulansuhai have reported increasing total organic carbon and nutrient content in the sediments from the inflow towards the outflow fu et al 2013 guo et al 2014 that results mainly from autochthonous production xie et al 2015 the spatial pattern observed in lake ulansuhai and the results of the correlation analyses suggest that the spatio temporal variation of porewater ch4 concentration are mainly driven by different nutrient concentrations moreover the pca results further indicated that the spatio temporal variations of ch4 concentrations were primarily controlled by the same environmental variables that control porewater co2 concentrations doc dtn and no2 fig 6a excess nutrients can enhance ch4 production leading to the increase of the ch4 concentrations in porewater sepulveda jauregui et al 2018 which were positively correlated with porewater doc dtn and no2 table 1 the organic matter content is an important factor facilitating methanogenesis in sediments reshmi et al 2014 previous studies have shown that the porewater ch4 concentration is positively influenced by the amount of organic matter especially its dissolved fraction berberich et al 2020 the mean doc concentrations in the porewater of lake ulansuhai was 16 5 0 2 mg l 1 which can provide sufficient substrate for ch4 production and in turn increases ch4 concentrations in addition the significant positive effect of dtn on ch4 concentration is consistent with previous studies isidorova et al 2019 total nitrogen concentration in sediment can differ and depend on the organic matter source with n rich autochthonous organic matter being more biodegradable and produces more ch4 grasset et al 2018 meyers 2003 west et al 2012 in this study no2 concentration was an important driver of variations in ch4 concentrations no2 is usually considered to be a microbial inhibitor tugtas and pavlostathis 2007 and it can promote the oxidation of ch4 at certain concentrations nie et al 2020 however the results of this study contradict this one possible explanation for this result is that nitrite can enhance the acidogenic phase resulting in large amounts of low molecular weight organic matter i e acetate which can be directly utilized by methanogens resulting in a high methane production rate lu et al 2020 in addition to quantity also the quality of organic carbon present in lakes is a key factor controlling ch4 production under anoxic conditions the extent to which aquatic vegetation as a source of organic matter leads to the emission of greenhouse gases or gets buried in the sediment varies considerably between different vegetation types grasset et al 2018 there are large differences in aquatic plants among the different zones of lake ulansuhai which may be an additional reason for the spatial variations of ch4 concentrations we found that porewater ph had a negative effect on the co2 and ch4 concentrations table 1 the accumulation of co2 in sediment porewater can alter the carbonate geochemistry resulting in decrease of ph taylor et al 2015 ch4 is primarily produced by methanogens which are sensitive to the porewater ph chang and yang 2003 in lake ulansuhai the ph in surface sediment ranged from 8 0 to 9 4 which may be out of the optimal range for methanogenic archea and partially inhibit their activity chang and yang 2003 schrier uijl et al 2011 yang et al 2019c furthermore we found positive correlations between co2 and ch4 concentrations table 2 this suggests acetoclastic ch4 production where co2 is produced in equal molar amounts as ch4 interestingly the ratio of ch4 to co2 fluxes at the swi in lake ulansuhai are close to unity fs wco2 fs wch4 108 13 suggesting that a large share of the sediment c emissions is in the form of ch4 and that acetoclastic methanogenesis could be the main process for the production of both gases ch4 to co2 flux ratios smaller than unity indicate contributions of additional aerobic and anaerobic production pathways of co2 production also anaerobic oxidation of ch4 can contribute to the production of co2 ettwig et al 2008 denitrification dependent anaerobic methane oxidation can be a major pathway for anaerobic oxidation of ch4 in freshwater sediments raghoebarsing et al 2006 the occurrence of this oxidation pathway in lake ulansuhai is suggested by the positive correlation of co2 concentrations with porewater no2 table 1 4 2 drivers of co2 and ch4 diffusive fluxes in lake ulansuhai the sediment was a source of co2 and ch4 to the water column the mean diffusive fluxes of co2 887 3 124 7 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 and ch4 607 1 68 0 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 across the swi add up to annual co2 and ch4 diffusion emissions of 3 89 and 2 66 g c m 2 y 1 respectively compared to measurements of surface fluxes reported in our previous study sun et al 2021 which was performed with the same spatial and temporal resolution the diffusive fluxes across the sediment water interface account for only 1 40th and 1 10th of the co2 and ch4 fluxes emitted at to the atmosphere respectively this mismatch indicates that the diffusive fluxes across swi may not be the main source of co2 and ch4 emitted at the water air interface several studies have found that diffusive fluxes at the swi are not the main pathway for atmospheric emission with production in the water column and ebullition being the main additional sources of co2 and ch4 respectively abe et al 2005 gruca rokosz et al 2011 in lake ulansuhai ebullition has been found to be a minor emission pathway accounting for only 1 of the water air ch4 fluxes with a mean value 0 15 mmol m 2 d 1 sun et al 2021 alternatively lateral advection of dissolved co2 and ch4 from zones of enhanced sediment production such as the vegetated areas or riparian zones can account for the mismatch between the fluxes across the sediment and air water interfaces mcginnis et al 2016 sand jensen et al 2019 our results were consistent with previous studies in which significant temporal and spatial variations of diffusive fluxes of co2 and ch4 at the sediment water interface were found in ponds and lakes langenegger et al 2019 yang et al 2019a temporally the diffusive fluxes of co2 and ch4 were of three and two orders of magnitude higher in july compared to january respectively the results of stepwise multiple linear regression analysis and pca between the diffusive fluxes sediment properties and nutrient concentrations showed that the surface sediment temperature and concentrations of doc nh4 and no2 in porewater were the main controlling factors for variations in co2 fluxes whereas the variations of ch4 fluxes were mostly related to variations in sediment temperature and doc table 3 and fig 6b higher temperature stimulates carbon mineralization rates and the production of co2 gudasz et al 2010 resulting in higher co2 porewater concentrations and higher fluxes from the sediments to the overlying water xiong et al 2017 yang et al 2019a table 2 fig 6b similarly rates of methanogenesis increase with increasing temperature grasset et al 2018 sepulveda jauregui et al 2018 which contributes to the seasonal variations of the diffusive fluxes also in lake ulansuhai the co2 and ch4 fluxes were both influenced by doc tables 2 and 3 fig 6b which demonstrates that excess carbon availability in the sediment promotes higher co2 and ch4 fluxes and supports findings from previous studies sobek et al 2012 xiong et al 2017 yang et al 2019b the spatial variations of the co2 and ch4 fluxes were relatively small in comparison to the temporal variations similar spatial variations were observed in the co2 and ch4 fluxes and in porewater concentrations which indicates that spatial variations in local co2 and ch4 production rates were the main cause for the observed differences in sediment water fluxes the spatial variations in production rates were related to variations in dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations in the porewater of surface sediment which besides temperature were the main controlling factors for co2 and ch4 fluxes table 3 and fig 6b the trophic status of the water and the sediment has been previously reported as an important factor regulating ch4 emissions at the basin scale beaulieu et al 2019 schrier uijl et al 2011 sepulveda jauregui et al 2018 our results demonstrate that spatial variations in the availability of organic carbon and nitrogen in the sediment porewater can results in large variability of co2 and ch4 fluxes within individual aquatic ecosystems 4 3 limitation and future research the large spatial and temporal variability of dissolved gas concentrations and fluxes at the swi observed in our measurements demonstrate that robust basin scale estimates of carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in lake ulansuhai would require more sampling sites and higher frequency sampling while such measurements became feasible for resolving the spatial variations in surface water concentrations and diffusive emissions at the air water interface liu et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 no appropriate method exists for mapping porewater concentrations and sediment water fluxes moreover our results rely on indirect estimates of the fluxes from measured porewater concentration profiles for the calculation of sediment water fluxes we assumed steady state diffusive transport in porewater and neglected the effects of gas production and consumption moreover the concentration at the swi had to be approximated by the concentration measured in the overlying water thereby neglecting the influence of the concentration boundary layer above the swi the existence of a water side concentration boundary layer would cause a lower concentration at the swi and lower fluxes our flux estimates can therefore be considered as upper bounds the flux estimates can be improved by direct measurements under in situ conditions such measurements could be obtained by applying the aquatic eddy correlation technique donis et al 2015 which however requires fast response sensors for concentration measurements and has been nearly exclusively used for measuring oxygen fluxes at the swi in lakes and rivers a variant of the eddy correlation technique that would allow flux estimates at the swi for a larger group of compounds including nutrients and dissolved co2 and ch4 concentrations has been proposed recently lemaire et al 2017 but not yet successfully implemented in aquatic research besides in situ measurements flux estimates can be improved by estimating production rates in different sediment layers in ex situ incubations in future studies these rates can be used to extent the diffusive transport model equation 2 to include reactions sabrekov et al 2017 tang et al 2010 and eventually become integrated in larger scale models that can additionally assist in upscaling the findings to the basin scale 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the diffusive fluxes of co2 and ch4 across the swi in relation to nutrient concentrations in the shallow eutrophic lake ulansuhai at different seasons the study explored the dynamics of co2 and ch4 in a hypereutrophic lake sediment demonstrating large spatial and temporal variations in concentrations and diffusive fluxes of both greenhouse gases in the porewater and at the swi the sediment was a source of co2 and ch4 to the water column yet the diffusive fluxes of co2 and ch4 at the swi were one order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding fluxes at the water air interface showing that the diffusive fluxes were not the major emission pathway of co2 and ch4 to atmosphere seasonal variations in surface sediment temperature were an important driver of temporal changes in co2 and ch4 fluxes at the swi in addition we found that higher organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations in the sediment porewater were associated with higher co2 and ch4 concentrations and promoted higher co2 and ch4 fluxes to the water column in contrast to deeper lakes and reservoirs the concentration of organic carbon and nutrients in sediment porewater and the diffusive fluxes of co2 and ch4 at the sediment water interface increased from the inflow to the outflow region of lake ulansuhai our results show that the trophic status is an important driver of co2 and ch4 fluxes from sediments and their spatial variations within heterogeneous aquatic ecosystems we suggest that efforts to reduce excess nutrient input to inland waters should be accelerated to reduce the climatic impact of

15669,shallow eutrophic lakes contribute disproportional to the emissions of co2 and ch4 from inland waters the processes that contribute to these fluxes their environmental controls and anthropogenic influences however are poorly constrained here we studied the spatial variability and seasonal dynamics of co2 and ch4 fluxes across the sediment water interface and their relationships to porewater

m 2 d 1 for co2 and ch4 respectively the temporal and spatial variations of co2 and ch4 concentrations in porewater were associated with corresponding variations in dissolved organic carbon and dissolved nitrogen species temperature and dissolved organic carbon in surface porewater were the most important drivers of temporal variations in diffusive fluxes whereas dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen were the main drivers of their spatial variations diffusive fluxes generally increased with increasing dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen in the porewater from the inflow to the outflow region of the lake the estimated fluxes of both gases at the sediment water interface were one order of magnitude lower than the emissions at the water surface which were measured in a companion study this indicates that diffusive fluxes across the sediment water interface were not the main pathway for co2 and ch4 emissions to the atmosphere to improve the mechanistic understanding and predictability of greenhouse gas emissions from shallow lakes future studies should aim to close the apparent gap in the co2 and ch4 budget by combining improved flux measurement techniques with

not have permission to share data 1 introduction carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 are the two most important greenhouse gases with the increase in their atmospheric concentrations accounting for nearly 80 of the current radiative forcing myhre et al 2014 in relation to their relatively small areal extent inland waters contribute disproportionately to co2 and ch4 emissions downing 2010 rosentreter et al 2021 yet current estimates of co2 and ch4 emissions from aquatic ecosystems are not well constrained due to reasons that include the limited number of observations and uncertainties of field measurement davidson et al 2015b holgerson and raymond 2016 rosentreter et al 2021 quantification of greenhouse gas emissions from various aquatic ecosystems and improved understanding of their environmental drivers are key to improving the accuracy of current co2 and ch4 budgets and their response to climate change and human activities lakes are a vital component of the inland water system regarding carbon cycling and climate regulation because they store transport and transform large quantities of carbon tranvik et al 2009b shallow lakes cover the largest surface area globally downing et al 2006 verpoorter et al 2014 and are hot spots of co2 and ch4 emissions it has been demonstrated that sediments in shallow water are particularly important because the ch4 produced is much more likely to reach the atmosphere than ch4 produced in deeper profundal sediments bastviken et al 2008 shallow lakes are more vulnerable to eutrophication due to high nutrient input anderson et al 2014 sinha et al 2017 and poor self cleaning capacity havens et al 2001 sun et al 2021 eutrophication plays a critical role in regulating lake co2 and ch4 emissions davidson et al 2015a sun et al 2021 lake sediments are the primary site for biogeochemical transformation and can act as a sink or a source of nutrients for the overlying water therefore sediments influence the availability of nutrients in lakes huang et al 2017 both co2 and ch4 can be produced in lake sediments during the microbial degradation of organic carbon by microorganisms schimel and gulledge 1998 wang et al 2017 and is affected by the quantity and quality of organic matter om eutrophication results in higher om deposition rates hayes et al 2017 which can cause an increase in carbon burial rates heathcote and downing 2012 knoll et al 2014 or serve as a substrate supporting microbial activity with the potential to increase co2 and ch4 production berberich et al 2020 sediment temperature extent of anoxia ph and substrate quantity and quality affect the methanogenesis rate in lake sediments west et al 2015 shallow lakes are inherently heterogeneous over spatiotemporal scales due to changes in topographic features and environmental conditions resulting in large uncertainties in assessments of their co2 and ch4 budgets and emissions although being an important component of basin scale carbon budgets spatial and temporal variations of co2 and ch4 concentrations in sediment porewater and fluxes at the sediment water interface have rarely been studied moreover the linkages between spatio temporal variability of organic carbon and nutrient availability and sediment water fluxes have not been studied in shallow eutrophic lakes knowledge about the variability and dynamics of diffusive co2 and ch4 fluxes at the sediment water interface of eutrophic lakes and their main environmental drivers provides important insights into the lake carbon dynamics and improves the accuracy of carbon and greenhouse gas budgets here we test the hypothesis that porewater co2 and ch4 concentrations and sediment waters fluxes in shallow eutrophic lakes are characterized by large spatial and seasonal variability in response to temperature and nutrient availability using field measurements in an arid eutrophic and shallow lake we evaluated the spatial and seasonal variations of co2 and ch4 porewater concentrations and diffusive fluxes across the sediment water interface and identified the main influencing factors of their within lake variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area

sediment cores were collected from the sampling sites using a gravity sediment corer tube length 60 cm and inner diameter 9 cm in total 28 cores were collected from the 7 sampling areas to minimize systematic sampling bias various sites in each sampling area were sampled on each sampling day the cores were cut to a length of 35 cm sealed at the top and bottom with silicone plugs and stored and transported vertically for analysis in the laboratory from the four cores collected at each point three cores were used as replicates to determine the dissolved gas concentration and physicochemical variables in pore water the fourth core was used for the determination of sediment porosity in triplicates porosity œÜ was calculated based on the water content of the sediment which was determined by

approach causes minimal cross sampling of different sediment layers alberto et al 2000 bodmer et al 2020 20 ml of the extracted porewater was removed using a syringe with a three way valve and replaced by a headspace filled with air the samples were shaken vigorously for 1 min to equilibrate porewater and headspace gases before measuring the partial pressures of co2 and ch4 in the headspace

assumption of steady state diffusive transport in porewater and is neglecting the effects of gas production and consumption as well as the possible effect of the water side concentration boundary layer lorke et al 2003 2 3 data analysis all statistical analyses were performed using spss for windows version 18 0 spss inc chicago usa three way analyses of variance anova were conducted to analyse the influence of sampling month sampling site and depth on the concentrations of nutrients and dissolved co2 and ch4 in porewater two way anova were conducted to analyse the influences of sampling

at all depth while the concentrations increased towards the water surface in july and had a near bottom maximum in january fig 4b the seasonally averaged ch4 water column concentration was highest at site s3 and lowest at s1 but there were no significant differences among the other sampling sites s4 to s7 fig 4d porewater ch4 concentrations were approximately 15 times higher than in the water

generally increased with increasing depth below the swi with significant differences between sampling depths p 0 01 fig s5b and table s7 the porewater ch4 concentrations also showed significant temporal and spatial variations among the four months and seven sites p 0 01 as well as at different sampling depths fig 4b and d and fig s5b the results of the anova are presented in table s6 and s7 temporally the porewater ch4 concentrations showed strong seasonal variations among the four sampling months p 0 01 with the lowest value in january 76 4 10 6 ¬µmol l 1 and the highest value in july 1222 9 53 2 ¬µmol l 1 spatially the mean porewater ch4 concentrations was highest near the aquafarm site s7 952 9 79 9 ¬µmol l 1 and lowest at site s4 371 3 38 8¬µmol l 1 from sites s3 to s7 the ch4 concentrations increased gradually from the inflow to the outflow region of the lake the spatial variations in porewater ch4 concentrations differed from those in the water column fig 4d the highest concentrations in water column were observed at s3 13 3 2 5 ¬µmol l 1 where the porewater concentrations was lowest 371 3 35 6 ¬µmol l 1 whereas the opposite was observed at s2 it is worth noting that the ch4 concentration in the water column was very small near the main inflow site s1 3 4 fluxes of co2 and ch4 across sediment water interface co2 fluxes across swi in lake ulansuhai varied from 1 7

¬µmol m 2 d 1 were significantly higher than those at s1 s3 s4 and s7 but similar to s2 and s5 the lowest mean flux was estimated near the inflow at s1 362 1 110 2 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 but was not significantly different from mean fluxes estimated at s3 and near the outlet at s7 table s8 and s9 the diffusive ch4 fluxes across the swi ranged from 2 4 to 2271 7 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 with a mean value of 607 1 68 0 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 for the whole sampling period fig 5b and 5d the ch4 fluxes showed distinct temporal variations p 0 01 table s8 and s9 with the lowest flux in january 43 0 10 0 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 and the highest flux in july 1337 0 124 2 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 in addition the ch4 fluxes also showed significant spatial differences with the lowest at site s3 306 5 80 1 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 and an about threefold higher flux at s7 920 9 167 4 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 3 5 effects of environmental variables on porewater concentrations and diffusive fluxes dissolved co2 and ch4 concentrations in porewater were positively correlated to each other and with doc dtn nh4 and no2 concentrations p 0 05 and negatively correlated with ph p 0 05 table 1 dtp was negatively correlated with co2 concentrations p 0 05 but not correlated with ch4 concentrations p 0 05 the principal component analysis pca showed that the variations in porewater co2 and ch4 concentrations were primarily related to variations in doc no2 and dtn fig 6 a the dissolved gas concentrations in porewater were positively correlated with the diffusive fluxes p 0 05 table 2 moreover the diffusive fluxes of co2 and ch4 were positively correlated with each other and increased with increasing concentrations of doc dtn nh4 no2 and sediment temperature p 0 05 table 2 fig 6b additionally the ch4 flux was higher from sediments with higher porosity to explore the main controlling factors of the estimated fluxes a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was used the results showed that the surface sediment temperature doc nh4 and no2 were the main influencing factors for the co2 fluxes p 0 001 whereas the ch4 fluxes were mainly influenced by sediment surface temperature and doc p 0 001 table 3 4 discussion 4 1 temporal and spatial variability of co2 and ch4 concentrations in lakes especially in shallow lakes the system metabolism mainly occurs in sediments bergstr√∂m et al 2010 heterotrophic sediment respiration is the primary source of co2 production gudasz et al 2010 macintyre et al 2018 tranvik et al 2009a in this study measurements in a large shallow and eutrophic lake revealed large seasonal variations of porewater co2 concentrations fig 4a table s6 with the mean porewater co2 concentrations in july being 80 times higher than in january the porewater co2 concentrations followed a similar temporal dynamic as the concentrations of doc dtn and no2 in the sediment porewater fig 2 and table 1 the seasonal variations of doc dtn and no2 concentrations explained the majority of the seasonal variations in porewater co2 concentrations across all study sites fig 6a excess organic carbon doc and nitrogen input potentially provides additional substrate for heterotrophic activity kristensen et al 2008 which causes an increase of the co2 concentration in porewater and emission from the sediment to the water the observed positive effect of no2 on co2 concentration may be explained by the production of co2 during nitrification and denitrification in the sediment hamersley and howes 2003 we also found significant spatial variations in porewater co2 concentrations with twofold higher concentration near the lakeshore s6 compared to the lowest concentration near the inflow s1 fig 4c the similarity to spatial patterns in nutrient concentration in porewater and their positive relations with co2 concentrations table 1 and fig 6a indicate that high nutrient concentrations doc dtn and no2 are a crucial determinant for high porewater co2 concentration porewater ch4 concentrations also showed significant temporal and spatial variations in lake ulansuhai fig 4b and d table s6 temporally the porewater ch4 concentrations showed strong seasonal variations with 15 times higher concentration in summer than in winter higher ch4 production rates at higher temperature yvon durocher et al 2014 and increased organic carbon availability from autochthonous production fig 2 are likely promoting the higher ch4 concentration in summer spatially we observed persistent gradients with increasing ch4 concentrations from inlet to the outlet relatively higher ch4 concentrations were found near the lake outlet and the aquafarm s7 which coincides with higher dissolved nitrogen concentration at this site it is interesting to note that this longitudinal gradient is opposing the gradients typically found in deeper lakes and reservoirs were allochthones organic matter preferably settles near the inflow leading to higher emissions from these areas linkhorst et al 2021 indeed previous studies in lake ulansuhai have reported increasing total organic carbon and nutrient content in the sediments from the inflow towards the outflow fu et al 2013 guo et al 2014 that results mainly from autochthonous production xie et al 2015 the spatial pattern observed in lake ulansuhai and the results of the correlation analyses suggest that the spatio temporal variation of porewater ch4 concentration are mainly driven by different nutrient concentrations moreover the pca results further indicated that the spatio temporal variations of ch4 concentrations were primarily controlled by the same environmental variables that control porewater co2 concentrations doc dtn and no2 fig 6a excess nutrients can enhance ch4 production leading to the increase of the ch4 concentrations in porewater sepulveda jauregui et al 2018 which were positively correlated with porewater doc dtn and no2 table 1 the organic matter content is an important factor facilitating methanogenesis in sediments reshmi et al 2014 previous studies have shown that the porewater ch4 concentration is positively influenced by the amount of organic matter especially its dissolved fraction berberich et al 2020 the mean doc concentrations in the porewater of lake ulansuhai was 16 5 0 2 mg l 1 which can provide sufficient substrate for ch4 production and in turn increases ch4 concentrations in addition the significant positive effect of dtn on ch4 concentration is consistent with previous studies isidorova et al 2019 total nitrogen concentration in sediment can differ and depend on the organic matter source with n rich autochthonous organic matter being more biodegradable and produces more ch4 grasset et al 2018 meyers 2003 west et al 2012 in this study no2 concentration was an important driver of variations in ch4 concentrations no2 is usually considered to be a microbial inhibitor tugtas and pavlostathis 2007 and it can promote the oxidation of ch4 at certain concentrations nie et al 2020 however the results of this study contradict this one possible explanation for this result is that nitrite can enhance the acidogenic phase resulting in large amounts of low molecular weight organic matter i e acetate which can be directly utilized by methanogens resulting in a high methane production rate lu et al 2020 in addition to quantity also the quality of organic carbon present in lakes is a key factor controlling ch4 production under anoxic conditions the extent to which aquatic vegetation as a source of organic matter leads to the emission of greenhouse gases or gets buried in the sediment varies considerably between different vegetation types grasset et al 2018 there are large differences in aquatic plants among the different zones of lake ulansuhai which may be an additional reason for the spatial variations of ch4 concentrations we found that porewater ph had a negative effect on the co2 and ch4 concentrations table 1 the accumulation of co2 in sediment porewater can alter the carbonate geochemistry resulting in decrease of ph taylor et al 2015 ch4 is primarily produced by methanogens which are sensitive to the porewater ph chang and yang 2003 in lake ulansuhai the ph in surface sediment ranged from 8 0 to 9 4 which may be out of the optimal range for methanogenic archea and partially inhibit their activity chang and yang 2003 schrier uijl et al 2011 yang et al 2019c furthermore we found positive correlations between co2 and ch4 concentrations table 2 this suggests acetoclastic ch4 production where co2 is produced in equal molar amounts as ch4 interestingly the ratio of ch4 to co2 fluxes at the swi in lake ulansuhai are close to unity fs wco2 fs wch4 108 13 suggesting that a large share of the sediment c emissions is in the form of ch4 and that acetoclastic methanogenesis could be the main process for the production of both gases ch4 to co2 flux ratios smaller than unity indicate contributions of additional aerobic and anaerobic production pathways of co2 production also anaerobic oxidation of ch4 can contribute to the production of co2 ettwig et al 2008 denitrification dependent anaerobic methane oxidation can be a major pathway for anaerobic oxidation of ch4 in freshwater sediments raghoebarsing et al 2006 the occurrence of this oxidation pathway in lake ulansuhai is suggested by the positive correlation of co2 concentrations with porewater no2 table 1 4 2 drivers of co2 and ch4 diffusive fluxes in lake ulansuhai the sediment was a source of co2 and ch4 to the water column the mean diffusive fluxes of co2 887 3 124 7 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 and ch4 607 1 68 0 ¬µmol m 2 d 1 across the swi add up to annual co2 and ch4 diffusion emissions of 3 89 and 2 66 g c m 2 y 1 respectively compared to measurements of surface fluxes reported in our previous study sun et al 2021 which was performed with the same spatial and temporal resolution the diffusive fluxes across the sediment water interface account for only 1 40th and 1 10th of the co2 and ch4 fluxes emitted at to the atmosphere respectively this mismatch indicates that the diffusive fluxes across swi may not be the main source of co2 and ch4 emitted at the water air interface several studies have found that diffusive fluxes at the swi are not the main pathway for atmospheric emission with production in the water column and ebullition being the main additional sources of co2 and ch4 respectively abe et al 2005 gruca rokosz et al 2011 in lake ulansuhai ebullition has been found to be a minor emission pathway accounting for only 1 of the water air ch4 fluxes with a mean value 0 15 mmol m 2 d 1 sun et al 2021 alternatively lateral advection of dissolved co2 and ch4 from zones of enhanced sediment production such as the vegetated areas or riparian zones can account for the mismatch between the fluxes across the sediment and air water interfaces mcginnis et al 2016 sand jensen et al 2019 our results were consistent with previous studies in which significant temporal and spatial variations of diffusive fluxes of co2 and ch4 at the sediment water interface were found in ponds and lakes langenegger et al 2019 yang et al 2019a temporally the diffusive fluxes of co2 and ch4 were of three and two orders of magnitude higher in july compared to january respectively the results of stepwise multiple linear regression analysis and pca between the diffusive fluxes sediment properties and nutrient concentrations showed that the surface sediment temperature and concentrations of doc nh4 and no2 in porewater were the main controlling factors for variations in co2 fluxes whereas the variations of ch4 fluxes were mostly related to variations in sediment temperature and doc table 3 and fig 6b higher temperature stimulates carbon mineralization rates and the production of co2 gudasz et al 2010 resulting in higher co2 porewater concentrations and higher fluxes from the sediments to the overlying water xiong et al 2017 yang et al 2019a table 2 fig 6b similarly rates of methanogenesis increase with increasing temperature grasset et al 2018 sepulveda jauregui et al 2018 which contributes to the seasonal variations of the diffusive fluxes also in lake ulansuhai the co2 and ch4 fluxes were both influenced by doc tables 2 and 3 fig 6b which demonstrates that excess carbon availability in the sediment promotes higher co2 and ch4 fluxes and supports findings from previous studies sobek et al 2012 xiong et al 2017 yang et al 2019b the spatial variations of the co2 and ch4 fluxes were relatively small in comparison to the temporal variations similar spatial variations were observed in the co2 and ch4 fluxes and in porewater concentrations which indicates that spatial variations in local co2 and ch4 production rates were the main cause for the observed differences in sediment water fluxes the spatial variations in production rates were related to variations in dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations in the porewater of surface sediment which besides temperature were the main controlling factors for co2 and ch4 fluxes table 3 and fig 6b the trophic status of the water and the sediment has been previously reported as an important factor regulating ch4 emissions at the basin scale beaulieu et al 2019 schrier uijl et al 2011 sepulveda jauregui et al 2018 our results demonstrate that spatial variations in the availability of organic carbon and nitrogen in the sediment porewater can results in large variability of co2 and ch4 fluxes within individual aquatic ecosystems 4 3 limitation and future research the large spatial and temporal variability of dissolved gas concentrations and fluxes at the swi observed in our measurements demonstrate that robust basin scale estimates of carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in lake ulansuhai would require more sampling sites and higher frequency sampling while such measurements became feasible for resolving the spatial variations in surface water concentrations and diffusive emissions at the air water interface liu et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 no appropriate method exists for mapping porewater concentrations and sediment water fluxes moreover our results rely on indirect estimates of the fluxes from measured porewater concentration profiles for the calculation of sediment water fluxes we assumed steady state diffusive transport in porewater and neglected the effects of gas production and consumption moreover the concentration at the swi had to be approximated by the concentration measured in the overlying water thereby neglecting the influence of the concentration boundary layer above the swi the existence of a water side concentration boundary layer would cause a lower concentration at the swi and lower fluxes our flux estimates can therefore be considered as upper bounds the flux estimates can be improved by direct measurements under in situ conditions such measurements could be obtained by applying the aquatic eddy correlation technique donis et al 2015 which however requires fast response sensors for concentration measurements and has been nearly exclusively used for measuring oxygen fluxes at the swi in lakes and rivers a variant of the eddy correlation technique that would allow flux estimates at the swi for a larger group of compounds including nutrients and dissolved co2 and ch4 concentrations has been proposed recently lemaire et al 2017 but not yet successfully implemented in aquatic research besides in situ measurements flux estimates can be improved by estimating production rates in different sediment layers in ex situ incubations in future studies these rates can be used to extent the diffusive transport model equation 2 to include reactions sabrekov et al 2017 tang et al 2010 and eventually become integrated in larger scale models that can additionally assist in upscaling the findings to the basin scale 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the diffusive fluxes of co2 and ch4 across the swi in relation to nutrient concentrations in the shallow eutrophic lake ulansuhai at different seasons the study explored the dynamics of co2 and ch4 in a hypereutrophic lake sediment demonstrating large spatial and temporal variations in concentrations and diffusive fluxes of both greenhouse gases in the porewater and at the swi the sediment was a source of co2 and ch4 to the water column yet the diffusive fluxes of co2 and ch4 at the swi were one order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding fluxes at the water air interface showing that the diffusive fluxes were not the major emission pathway of co2 and ch4 to atmosphere seasonal variations in surface sediment temperature were an important driver of temporal changes in co2 and ch4 fluxes at the swi in addition we found that higher organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations in the sediment porewater were associated with higher co2 and ch4 concentrations and promoted higher co2 and ch4 fluxes to the water column in contrast to deeper lakes and reservoirs the concentration of organic carbon and nutrients in sediment porewater and the diffusive fluxes of co2 and ch4 at the sediment water interface increased from the inflow to the outflow region of lake ulansuhai our results show that the trophic status is an important driver of co2 and ch4 fluxes from sediments and their spatial variations within heterogeneous aquatic ecosystems we suggest that efforts to reduce excess nutrient input to inland waters should be accelerated to reduce the climatic impact of
