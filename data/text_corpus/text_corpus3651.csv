18255,bioelectrochemical systems bes can provide an energy efficient way to recover nutrients from wastewaters however the electron donors available in wastewater are often not sufficient to recover the total amount of nutrients this work investigates hydrogen h2 as an additional substrate for bioanodes this hydrogen can be produced in the fermentation of complex organic waste or could be recycled from the cathode understanding how to influence the competition of electroactive microorganisms eam with methanogens for h2 gas from different sources is key to successful application of h2 as additional electron donor in bioelectrochemical nutrient recovery ethanol etoh was used as model compound for complex wastewaters since it is fermented into both acetate and h2 etoh was efficiently converted into electricity e by a syntrophic biofilm total recovered charge from 1 mm etoh was 20 higher than for the same amount of acetate this means that h2 from etoh fermentation was converted by eam into electricity low etoh concentrations 1 mm led to higher conversion efficiencies into electricity than higher concentrations 5 and 10 mm thermodynamic calculations show this correlates with a higher energy gain for electrogens compared to methanogens at low h2 concentrations cumulatively adding 1 mm etoh without medium exchange 14 times in 14 days resulted in stable conversion of h2 to e 67 77 e rather than methane with h2 gas as electron donor 68 2 h2 was converted into e with no carbon source added and still 53 5 to e when 50 mm bicarbonate was provided these results show that under the provided conditions electrogens can outcompete methanogens for h2 as additional electron donor in mecs for nutrient recovery graphical abstract image 1 keywords bioanode hydrogen oxidation fermentation bioelectrochemical system 1 introduction bioelectrochemical systems bes are generally seen as new technologies for wastewater treatment pant et al 2012 as well as nutrient kelly and he 2014 and energy recovery logan et al 2006 bess as a separation technology for nitrogen and phosphorous seem feasible applications rodríguez arredondo et al 2015 lei et al 2019 one challenge for bess in general is the efficient conversion of substrate to electricity this is particularly the case for nutrient recovery where sufficient electrons from the substrate are needed to transport all ammonium from anode to cathode kuntke et al 2018 hydrogen h2 could be a prospective additional electron donor for bioanode this hydrogen could come from hydrogen recycling as has recently been demonstrated for electrochemical ammonium recovery kuntke et al 2017 for hydrogen recycling to be an effective solution for bioanodes it is important that hydrogen can be used as an electron donor for current generation h2 has been investigated as electron donor for direct oxidation into electricity by electroactive microorganisms eams rodenas et al 2017 ntagia et al 2016 the authors concluded that h2 can directly be oxidized by bacteria to produce electricity however the reported current density for h2 1 a m2 was much lower than for acetate ac oxidation 7 a m2 rodenas et al 2017 the authors reasoned that the low solubility of h2 resulted in mass transfer limitations which led to a higher overpotential for h2 oxidation compared to typical overpotentials observed during ac oxidation ntagia et al 2016 indeed the maximum solubility of h2 at atmospheric pressure is less than 1 mm whereas 10 mm ac were used in these experiments in h2 mass transfer limited situations the presence of hco3 can increase the current production by planktonic acetogenesis and subsequent ac oxidation as hypothesized by rodenas et al 2017 hco3 and co3 2 are present in most wastewaters in concentrations from 1 to 5 mm striegl and michmerhuizen 1998 ntagia et al 2016 precultured their bioanode on ac prior to using h2 as sole substrate decreasing the likelihood that h2 oxidizing microorganisms would be enriched in the electroactive biofilm h2 can be used as additional electron donor in the bioanode by recycling it from the cathode but it is also a typical by product in anaerobic fermentation of the wide variety of complex organics typically present in wastewaters valdez vazquez et al 2005 for example the intermediate fermentation product ethanol etoh can be fermented to produce ac and h2 fig 1 a one mol of fermented etoh gives 8 mol of electrons for ac and 2 mol h2 the latter of which contains 4 mol of electrons this hydrogen can be used as electron donor for several competing processes in bioanodes fig 1 c bioelectrogenesis d acetogenesis e methanogenesis since it is of key importance to convert etoh completely into electrical current to be able to recover all nutrients both fermenters and electrogens are needed to convert both acetate and hydrogen into electricity fig 1b this conversion could benefit from close spatial syntrophic association of the involved microorganisms stams and plugge 2009 h2 can be directly oxidized bioelectrogenically by eams to electrons fig 1c or be used by hydrogenotrophic acetogens to reduce co2 to form acetate fig 1d in the case of acetogenesis the formed ac can be oxidized by eams to produce electrical current furthermore hydrogenotrophic methanogens can use h2 as electron donor for co2 reduction to methane ch4 fig 1e and acetoclastic methanogens may convert ac into ch4 fig 1f finally both h2 and ac can also be consumed by sulfate or nitrate reducers acting as electron sink and therefore reducing the bioelectricity production from the wastewater not shown in addition to these complex interactions and competitions reactor conditions temperature ph pressure and reactant concentrations also influence the competition for h2 on a thermodynamic level one major challenge in the oxidation of hydrogen at the bio anode is the presence of methanogens hydrogenotrophic methanogens scavenge h2 in mixed fermentation cultures preventing direct bioelectrogenic h2 oxidation for this reason ethanol has been investigated for bioelectrogensis of in situ produced h2 during fermentation parameswaran et al 2009 in their study only 10 of h2 equal to 3 of total available electrons was used for bioelectrogenesis in a mixed fermentative culture in batch experiments while 26 were converted into ch4 parameswaran et al 2009 in the presence of 2 bromoethane sulfonate 2 bres a methanogenesis inhibitor all of the electrons from h2 were used for bioelectrogenesis except for those electrons converted to biomass or soluble microbial products approximately 16 of total available electrons therefore direct h2 oxidation contributed between 3 and 27 to the coulombic efficiency ce with 33 as theoretical maximum from etoh fermentation ces ranged from 60 in absence of 2 bres to 84 in presence of 50 mm 2 bres this equals about 10 of electrons from h2 being used for bioelectrogenesis in absence of 2 bres and 90 in presence of 2 bres this is in accordance to the model proposed by parameswaran et al 2009 under these conditions methanogens outcompeted eams for h2 conversion this model includes coulombic losses due to biomass and soluble microbial products formation which lowers the maximum obtainable ce to 85 5 however their microbial community enrichment strategy of growing new biofilm with a sample of old biofilm as inoculum did not support the formation of a syntrophic biofilm thereby an advantage of planktonic over biofilm microorganisms for etoh conversion was created growing the biofilm over several pre culturing cycles might select for eams but also benefits fast over slow growing microorganisms this could therefore hinder the formation of spatially closely associated syntrophies with eams and help h2 scavenging suspended microorganisms proliferate furthermore parameswaran et al 2009 used 25 mm ethanol which is quite high given that it is usually an intermediate fermentation product in mixed cultures pipyn and verstraete 1981 finally their chosen low anode surface area to anolyte volume ratio favored non eams therefore the question is whether h2 can effectively be converted into bioelectricity this will be investigated with special regards to under which conditions eams can outcompete hydrogenotrophic methanogens for h2 consumption in mixed cultures here conditions under which a h2 scavenging biofilm develops and can be steered from methanogenesis towards bioelectrogenesis were studied thermodynamical considerations are shown for all these competing processes at different conditions and the experimental bioconversion of gaseous h2 and h2 from etoh fermentation furthermore it is presented how to possibly steer a syntrophic biofilm to efficiently convert h2 as gas and h2 from etoh into electricity 2 materials and methods 2 1 bes design the experiments were performed in h type cells each h type cell consisted of two 325 ml cylindrical glass compartments laboratory glass specialists b v the netherlands each compartment had a short tubular opening on its lower side to connect both compartments with a flange connection a bipolar membrane ralex membrane mega czech republic was clamped in between both flange connectors and sealed off with rubber o rings opposite to the flange opening in each compartment were three smaller vertically aligned flange openings which were sealed off with a rubber stoppers and metal caps these were used to insert a luggin capillary laboratory glass specialists b v the netherlands of the 3 m ag agcl reference electrode qm711 qis the netherlands together with the 3 way liquid sampling port servoprax germany the connecting wire of the bioanode as well as the 3 way gas sampling port servoprax germany from bottom to top respectively the top of each compartment had a gl45 opening that was closed with a rubber stopper and a screwing lids with a rubber inlay the anode consisted of a 4 cm 10 cm carbon felt sgl carbon germany of approximately 0 3 cm thickness the cathode was made of a 4 cm 10 cm pt coated ti mesh 0 5 mg cm2 dexmet ct usa both electrodes were bent on their longest edge to form half circles with an opening towards the bpm both anode and cathode compartments were stirred with a stirring bar at 200 rpm anolytes were chosen according to table 1 and respective catholytes for each experiment were the same medium as the anolyte but without the respective electron donor 2 2 media all media were based on a modified recipe for synthetic bes medium with etoh ac and h2 in concentrations as indicated in table 1 molenaar et al 2018 one liter of medium contained 0 74 g kcl 0 584 g nacl 0 68 g kh2po4 7 84 g k2hpo4 0 28 g nh4cl 0 1 g cacl2 2h2o 0 01 g mgso4 7h2o 1 ml of vitamin nevin et al 2011 and 1 ml mineral solution zehnder et al 1980 media with methanogenesis inhibitor additionally contained 50 mm of sodium 2 bromoethanesulfonate as described in zinder and koch 1984 2 3 inoculum the inoculum consisted of a mixture of biomass samples from an anaerobic digester treating black water cunha et al 2018 bioelectrochemical systems using human urine zamora et al 2017 and artificial wastewater as feed molenaar et al 2018 as well as syntrophic propionate oxidizer cultures mollaei et al 2017 2 4 experimental strategy bioelectrochemical systems were first inoculated with 1 v v of inoculum mixture to 10 mm ethanol in synthetic medium suited for bioelectrochemical systems as described in the media section and precultured until achieving reproducible electrical current production at 0 3 v vs 3 m ag agcl all potentials in this work are reported versus ag agcl reference electrodes 205 mv vs nhe preculturing was performed until similar current over time profiles for at least two previous consecutive batches were observed and data reported here was collected thereafter similar to the approach described by parameswaran et al 2009 preculturing was accomplished by replacing the medium each time after exponential development of electrical current was observed yet as major difference in the preculturing approach the electrode with grown biofilm was retained at each replacement during replacement anode and cathode compartments were gently rinsed with deionized water to dilute remaining suspended microorganisms that were less likely than biofilm microorganisms to partake in current generation this medium replacement was omitted for experiments of carbonate addition with gaseous h2 as electron donor before the start of each batch anode potentials were controlled at 0 3 v vs 3 m ag agcl by a potentiostat ivium n stat ivium technologies the netherlands and both compartment headspaces purged with n2 for 30 min for experiments with gaseous h2 a gas volume equivalent to the charge of 5 mm etoh in 0 15 l medium was added as h2 gas volume with a syringe charge from conversion to electricity was only calculated until less than 10 of maximum electrical current was observed this ensured that little to no h2 of diffusion from cathode to anode was taken into account for the charge balance anode potentials and substrate concentrations were chosen to gradually select for hydrogenotrophic eams rather than methanogens as described in table 1 from top to bottom 2 5 sampling and analysis sampling and analysis were conducted as described in supplemental information 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermodynamic considerations for acetate and h2 in methanogenesis electrogenesis and acetogenesis several reactions are involved in the electron flow from ethanol to the final electron acceptors which can be either the anode or ch4 described as pathways b f in fig 1 acetoclastic electrogenesis ac 4 h2o 2 hco3 9 h 8 e b hydrogenotrophic electrogenesis h2 2 h 2 e c hydrogenotrophic acetogenesis 4 h2 2 co2 ac h 2 h2o d hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 4 h2 co2 ch4 2 h2o e acetoclastic methanogenesis ac h2o ch4 hco3 f the gibbs free energy change at certain reaction conditions dg r was calculated for each of these reaction equations as described in supporting information a1 this is the maximum theoretical energy available for the microorganisms catalyzing the reactions under specific conditions commonly found in our experiments calculations were based on conditions of ph 7 and 25 c as well as concentrations of bicarbonate of 3 3 mm in equilibrium with 0 01 atm co2 1 mm acetate ac and 13 μm dissolved ch4 in equilibrium with 0 01 atm ch4 the dg r for reactions that use an anode as electron acceptor depends on the applied anode potential microorganisms can gain energy from a reaction whenever the anode potential is higher than the equilibrium potential of the reaction under specific conditions furthermore reactions involving protons either directly or in form of protonation dependent bicarbonate give dg r values relative to the ph at a high h2 partial pressure of 0 1 atm and ph 7 an anode potential more positive than 0 5 v vs 3 m ag agcl allows acetoclastic electrogens and hydrogenotrophic electrogens to gain energy from catalyzing their respective reactions fig 2 a at anode potentials higher than 0 35 v electrogens gain more energy from ac oxidation than any hydrogenotrophic microorganisms acetogens electrogens or methanogens could gain from h2 oxidation however hydrogenotrophic electrogens only gain more energy than methanogens at potentials above 0 15 v acetoclastic methanogenesis yielded even lower dg r than h2 consuming methanogensis and was therefore considered negligible increasing the ph for hydrogenotrophic reactions allows to generate more energy for electrogenic h2 conversion fig 2 b however the increased energy gain for electrogens at high h2 partial pressure is still lower than for methanogens a lower h2 partial pressure of 10 5 atm results in less energy gained for all hydrogenotrophic microorganisms fig 2 c so much so that acetogens can no longer sustain themselves in accordance with lever 2012 electrogens need a higher anode potential of 0 35 v to gain energy from h2 oxidation but also gain more energy than methanogens at potentials above 0 2 v increasing the ph at low h2 partial pressure enables electrogens to gain more energy than methanogens at anode potentials above 0 3 v or ph higher than 8 fig 2 d higher substrate concentrations increase the energy gained from any energy yielding reaction therefore both acetoclasts and hydrogenotrophs profit from a close spatial association with fermenters since fermentative ac and h2 are produced in locally high concentrations however high h2 concentrations give an advantage to methanogens compared to electrogens in terms of energy gained per reaction therefore lower h2 concentrations allow electrogens to generate comparable energy from h2 conversion as methanogens yet hydrogenotrophs cannot gain enough energy to sustain themselves from indefinitely low h2 concentrations i e acetogens at 10 5 atm h2 partial pressure lever 2012 proposes different ecological niches as an explanation for why hydrogenotrophic acetogens still do co exist in deep sea sediments together with methanogens this is justified on the grounds that acetogens are specialized in fast turnover with low energy gain and methanogens in slower turnover with high energy gain a similar ecological niche could hypothetically be occupied by hydrogenotrophic eams as indicated by the low energy gain of direct h2 oxidation that would make metabolic maintenance impossible without fast turnover the anode potential for the experiments was therefore chosen to be 0 3 v to allow minimal energy gain from direct h2 oxidation even at h2 partial pressures below detection limit 10 5 atm fig 2 c 3 2 ethanol fermentation in bioanodes indicates fermentative hydrogen can be used for electricity production these thermodynamical considerations were taken into account to study the possibility of designing and steering a syntrophic biofilm to efficiently convert h2 from etoh fermentation into electricity etoh is a common intermediate of complex waste fermentation it is a good model source of fermentative h2 since it is directly fermented into h2 and ac both h2 and ac can then directly be converted into electrical current as indicated above it is paramount to control the ph and to keep h2 concentrations in the headspace low to achieve high conversion efficiencies to electricity here ph control was achieved using a buffer solution of 50 mm pbs at ph 7 8 acid buffer capacity of 45 mm in a first set of experiments different biofilms were developed in presence or absence of 2 bres through succeeding batch incubations with medium containing 10 mm etoh and replacing the medium periodically when less than 10 of maximum current was observed electron balances were established once similar maximum current density and charge conversion to electrical current was observed for at least three succeeding batches fig 3 experimental duplicates are displayed separately in fig 3 since standard deviations would otherwise not be visible in the figure but the duplicates will be described as averages in the following all reactors showed similar maximum current densities of 5 8 a m 2 for 10 mm etoh fig 3 a maximum current densities in presence of 2 bres are generally lower and substrate conversion is 50 100 slower than in absence of 2 bres the delayed conversion in presence of 2 bres may be caused by the inhibition of methanogenesis and therefore possible lack of sufficient h2 scavengers which would delay the etoh fermentation due to thermodynamic inhibition by h2 all reactors showed similar final substrate conversion to electricity with 69 6 in absence and 67 5 in presence of 2 bres fig 3 b only 0 2 of etoh was still detectable in solution and less than 0 2 of total charge was detected as gaseous h2 no ch4 was observed for experiments with 2 bres while only 2 5 1 of total charge was converted into ch4 in absence of 2 bres the 25 35 unknown fraction of total charge was composed of about 20 of soluble cod less than 5 of suspended biomass and the rest undefined microbial products the ph dropped from 7 8 to 6 6 5 for experiments using 10 mm etoh which may limit bioelectrogenesis from direct h2 oxidation fig 2 d and therefore lead to fermentation inhibition by h2 accumulation therefore lower concentrations of 5 mm fig 3 c and 1 mm etoh fig 3 d were used in a second and third set of experiments both with and without 2 bres decreasing the substrate concentration to 5 mm neither led to a higher conversion efficiency to electrical charge nor changed the conversion to ch4 fig 3 c gaseous h2 concentrations were still observed at the limit of detection and the ph stayed between 6 5 in presence and 7 in absence of 2 bres lowering the etoh concentration further to 1 mm led to a ph staying above 7 0 and higher conversion to electrical charge with 87 2 in absence and 85 4 in presence of 2 bres compared to higher substrate concentrations fig 3 d in the experiment without inhibitor methanogenesis was slightly reduced compared to the higher etoh concentrations at 0 7 0 5 conversion to ch4 while etoh could still be detected at the limit of detection at the end of the experiment but h2 could not this shows not only that methanogens do not necessarily consume most h2 from etoh fermentation but also that eams can use this h2 in a biofilm to produce electrical current all experiments show at least 63 etoh conversion to electrical current which was higher than the 60 observed by parameswaran et al 2009 in absence of 2 bres however the complete conversion of 84 etoh into electricity with 16 electrons going into biomass reported by parameswaran et al in presence of 2 bres is achieved here for 1 mm etoh at 87 in absence of 2 bres this is likely due to the medium replacement strategy applied here that would allow a syntrophic microbial biofilm community to stay partially intact while planktonic microorganisms are removed with the spent medium this could result in a biofilm that predominantly has the anode as electron acceptor and would therefore require interspecies electron transfer from fermenters to electrogens this would predominantly produce electricity and lower local h2 concentrations for fermentation to commence stams and plugge 2009 higher conversion of substrate to electricity for lower substrate loadings has also been reported by sleutels et al 2016 3 3 consecutive addition of etoh shows eams can outcompete methanogens after high conversion to electricity was observed for 1 mm etoh further additions of 1 mm etoh were carried out without replacing the medium fig 4 but in absence of 2 bres for all experiments this allowed methanogens to grow in the medium with less competitive advantage of the eam biofilm and without being constrained by their slow growth washout or 2 bres furthermore methanogenic activity was confirmed after 14 days of polarizing the anode at 0 3 v by applying an open circuit for 3 days etoh conversion to electricity was only recorded until the cut off at 5 of maximum current which results in a conservative estimate of how much current is generated from substrate conversion this is done to prevent side reactions that generate current such as h2 diffusion from cathode to anode and to add noticeable electrical charge to the electron balance this cut off may be part of the reason why conversion efficiencies dropped as low as 45 after the first 3 5 days as not even all ac from etoh fermentation was converted into electricity furthermore frequent addition of substrate might have led to a surplus in available substrate and thereby higher biomass yield as observed for higher etoh concentrations in fig 3 however most etoh injections led to conversion efficiencies above 66 even after two weeks without medium replacement this means that the biofilm maintained conversion of fermentative h2 into electricity even after methanogens were no longer removed by medium replacement and able compete for the available substrates this is contrary to conclusions of parameswaran et al 2009 where an increase in fermentative h2 after two weeks led to more than 15 of etoh charge conversion into ch4 methanogenesis for experiments without methanogenesis inhibitor 2 bres increased quickly to around 2 of substrate conversion after 2 days and only slowly increased over the following two weeks to 4 once the anode potential was no longer controlled and left at open circuit etoh additions resulted in increasing parts of substrate conversion to methane of up to 8 of supplied substrate in absence of 2 bres experiments with biofilms formed previously with methanogenesis inhibitor did not produce ch4 while the anode was polarized even though no 2 bres was present in this experiment yet one replicate showed up to 4 substrate conversion to methane when left at open circuit indicating that methanogens were still present and active in this replicate the general presence of methanogenesis and its increasing ratio of substrate conversion at open circuit proves that the electrogenic biofilm did outcompete methanogens for all available substrates etoh ac h2 at closed circuit 3 4 more current produced from etoh than ac shows fermentative h2 is oxidized in order to show that the converted charge came from h2 conversion and not exclusively from acetate ac an experiment was conducted where first 1 mm etoh was added and then 1 mm ac was added afterwards in presence and absence of 2 bres fig 5 ac conversion resulted in double the maximum current density than etoh conversion fig 5 a as for etoh conversion ac conversion to electricity in presence of 2 bres is slightly slower than in absence of 2 bres converted charge to electrical current was slightly higher from etoh with 2 bres 130 2 c than without 2 bres 122 0 5 c while it did not differ significantly for ac conversion 101 8 c with 2 bres versus 104 1 c without 2 bres fig 5 b in general etoh conversion yielded 20 more charge than ac conversion in absence of 2 bres and 30 more in its presence calculating the total charge as electricity generated divided by the initially added charge as substrate gave a conversion efficiency of 88 2 for ac and 73 1 for etoh indicated in fig 5 b this shows that approximately 20 30 additional charge was produced from etoh as substrate compared to ac as sole fermentation product and indicates the use of fermentative h2 for electricity generation thereby slowly released low concentrations of h2 at a relatively high ph of 7 8 could move methanogens from their ecological niche of slow metabolism high energy gain to a low energy gain niche this may allow electrogens with a faster metabolism than that of methanogens to kinetically outcompete methanogens for h2 as substrate lever 2012 conversion of only 88 ac furthermore indicates that 10 15 were likely converted into biomass and secondary metabolites as predicted by parameswaran et al 2009 for a mixed microbial community of fermenters and eams 3 5 addition of dissolved gaseous hydrogen shows that efficient direct production of current is possible the conversion of an electron equivalence of 5 mm etoh as gaseous h2 to electricity was tested over 7 days in absence and presence of 2 bres as well as under carbon source limiting conditions fig 6 a and with addition of 50 mm bicarbonate hco3 fig 6 b without additional carbon source the ratio of h2 conversion to electricity was similar to etoh conversion with 68 2 in absence and 76 12 in presence of methanogenesis inhibitor fig 6 a 17 2 of electrons from h2 conversion ended in ch4 as electron sink in absence of 2 bres this was around one order of magnitude more than observed for etoh conversion yet it is only one quarter as much as h2 conversion to electricity only 3 1 in absence and 6 1 in presence of 2 bres are stored in planktonic biomass and soluble microbial products these should mainly come from detached biofilm since the only carbon source available was the biofilm i e less than 0 2 co2 in headspace at all times data not shown 12 6 of electrons in initially added gaseous h2 in absence and 14 11 in presence of 2 bres remain in the anode unconverted which closes the electron balances for all experiments under carbon limiting conditions with 96 101 of total available electrons being accounted for this remaining h2 even after 7 days stands in difference to the more than 98 of substrate converted in 1 d for etoh conversion experiments likely due to the low solubility of h2 in water less than 0 8 mm atm 1 sander 2015 and diffusion of h2 from cathode to anode in presence of 50 mm hco3 h2 conversion to electricity differs strongly between experiments with and without added methanogenesis inhibitor fig 6 b in both cases more than 98 of initially added h2 is converted absence of 2 bres led to 69 11 conversion into ch4 which is a four fold increase compared to carbon source limiting conditions this confirms that carbon availability was limiting methanogenesis in the previous experiments furthermore higher abundance of methanogens could have contributed to that as well since only the gases and not the medium were replaced between experiments when comparing experiments with and without methanogenesis inhibitor separately the carbonate concentration had only a marginal effect on the h2 conversion to electricity in absence of 2 bres and under carbonate limiting conditions 68 2 were converted to e fig 6a compared to 53 5 when carbonate was added fig 6b in absence of inhibitor the conversion of h2 to electricity 53 5 and ch4 69 11 remained comparable this indicates competitive equality under these conditions for h2 conversion between the developed electrogenic biofilm and methanogens the resulting total electron balance in absence of 2 bres of around 120 further implies that h2 diffusion from cathode to anode took place an increased conversion to electrical charge of 91 in presence of 2 bres and additional carbon source compared to 76 12 under carbon limiting conditions suggests the presence of homoacetogens these could convert the present hco3 into acetate which could generate additional electricity rodenas et al 2017 however no volatile fatty acids were detected at any time of any experiments with gaseous h2 which means that acetate produced by homoactogens would have needed to be oxidized as fast as they had been produced 4 conclusion this work confirms that h2 both from fermentation and in gaseous form could be an electron donor in bes comparison with other work in the literature further indicates that in order to achieve high h2 conversion to electricity a specialized biofilm needs to be developed first furthermore a low substrate concentration and constant removal of planktonic biomass here by operation in fed batch mode can create a sufficiently high advantage of electrogens over methanogens furthermore low h2 concentrations at high ph increase the advantage of electrogens over methanogens to gain more energy from h2 conversion combining these two principles specialized biofilm and low h2 concentration in bes could potentially make h2 feasible as an additional electron donor this h2 could for example be recycled from the cathode in a similar principle as in a hydrogen recycling electrochemical system

18255,bioelectrochemical systems bes can provide an energy efficient way to recover nutrients from wastewaters however the electron donors available in wastewater are often not sufficient to recover

converted into electricity e by a syntrophic biofilm total recovered charge from 1 mm etoh was 20 higher than for the same amount of acetate this means that h2 from etoh fermentation was converted by eam into electricity low etoh concentrations 1 mm led to higher conversion efficiencies into electricity than higher concentrations 5 and 10 mm thermodynamic calculations show this correlates with a higher energy gain for electrogens compared to methanogens at low h2 concentrations cumulatively adding 1 mm etoh without medium exchange 14 times in 14 days resulted in stable conversion of h2 to e 67 77 e rather than methane with h2 gas as electron donor 68 2 h2 was converted into e with no carbon source added and still 53 5 to e when 50 mm bicarbonate was provided these results show that under

in general is the efficient conversion of substrate to electricity this is particularly the case for nutrient recovery where sufficient electrons from the substrate are needed to transport all

demonstrated for electrochemical ammonium recovery kuntke et al 2017 for hydrogen recycling to be an effective solution for bioanodes it is important that hydrogen can be used as an electron donor for current generation h2 has been investigated as electron donor for direct oxidation into electricity by electroactive microorganisms eams rodenas et al 2017 ntagia et al 2016 the authors concluded that h2 can directly be oxidized by bacteria to produce electricity however the reported current density for h2 1 a m2 was much lower than for acetate ac oxidation 7 a m2 rodenas et al 2017 the authors reasoned that the low solubility of h2 resulted in mass transfer limitations which led to a higher overpotential for h2 oxidation compared to typical overpotentials observed during ac oxidation ntagia et al 2016 indeed the maximum solubility of h2 at atmospheric pressure is less than 1 mm whereas 10 mm ac were used in these experiments in h2 mass transfer limited situations the presence of hco3 can increase the current production by planktonic acetogenesis and subsequent ac oxidation as hypothesized by rodenas et al 2017 hco3 and co3 2 are present in most wastewaters in concentrations from 1 to 5 mm striegl and michmerhuizen 1998 ntagia et al 2016 precultured their bioanode on ac prior to using h2 as sole substrate decreasing the likelihood that h2 oxidizing microorganisms would be enriched in the electroactive biofilm h2 can be used as additional electron donor in the bioanode by recycling it from the cathode but it is also a typical by product in anaerobic fermentation of the wide variety of complex organics typically present in wastewaters valdez vazquez et al 2005 for example the intermediate fermentation product ethanol etoh can be fermented to produce ac and h2 fig 1 a one mol of fermented etoh gives 8 mol of electrons for ac and 2 mol h2 the latter of which contains 4 mol of electrons this hydrogen can be used as electron donor for several competing processes in bioanodes fig 1 c bioelectrogenesis d acetogenesis e methanogenesis since it is of key importance to convert etoh completely into electrical current to be able to recover all nutrients both fermenters and electrogens are needed to convert both acetate and hydrogen into electricity fig 1b this conversion could benefit from close spatial syntrophic association of the involved microorganisms stams and plugge 2009 h2 can be directly oxidized bioelectrogenically by eams to electrons fig 1c or be used by hydrogenotrophic acetogens to reduce co2 to form acetate fig 1d in the case of acetogenesis the formed ac can be oxidized by eams to produce electrical current furthermore hydrogenotrophic methanogens can use h2 as electron donor for co2 reduction to methane ch4 fig 1e and acetoclastic methanogens may convert ac into ch4 fig 1f finally both h2 and ac can also be consumed by sulfate or nitrate reducers acting as electron sink and therefore reducing the bioelectricity production from the wastewater not shown in addition to these complex interactions and competitions reactor conditions temperature ph pressure and reactant concentrations also influence the competition for h2 on a thermodynamic level one major challenge in the oxidation of hydrogen at the bio anode is the presence of methanogens hydrogenotrophic methanogens scavenge h2 in mixed fermentation cultures preventing direct bioelectrogenic h2 oxidation for this reason ethanol has been investigated for bioelectrogensis of in situ produced h2 during fermentation parameswaran et al 2009 in their study only 10 of h2 equal to 3 of total available electrons was used for bioelectrogenesis in a mixed fermentative culture in batch experiments while 26 were converted into ch4 parameswaran et al 2009 in the presence of 2 bromoethane sulfonate 2 bres a methanogenesis inhibitor all of the electrons from h2 were used for bioelectrogenesis except for those electrons converted to biomass or soluble microbial products approximately 16 of total available electrons therefore direct h2 oxidation contributed between 3 and 27 to the coulombic efficiency ce with 33 as theoretical maximum from etoh fermentation ces ranged from 60 in absence of 2 bres to 84 in presence of 50 mm 2 bres this equals about 10 of electrons from h2 being used for bioelectrogenesis in absence of 2 bres and 90 in presence of 2 bres this is in accordance to the model proposed by parameswaran et al 2009 under these conditions methanogens outcompeted eams for h2 conversion this model includes coulombic losses due to biomass and soluble microbial products formation which lowers the maximum obtainable ce to 85 5 however their microbial community enrichment strategy of growing new biofilm with a sample of old biofilm as inoculum did not support the formation of a syntrophic biofilm thereby an advantage of planktonic over biofilm microorganisms for etoh conversion was created growing the biofilm over several pre culturing cycles might select for eams but also benefits fast over slow growing microorganisms this could therefore hinder the formation of spatially closely associated syntrophies with eams and help h2 scavenging suspended microorganisms proliferate furthermore parameswaran et al 2009 used 25 mm ethanol which is quite high given that it is usually an intermediate fermentation product in mixed cultures pipyn and verstraete 1981 finally their chosen low anode surface area to anolyte volume ratio favored non eams therefore the question is whether h2 can effectively be converted into bioelectricity this will be investigated with special regards to under which conditions eams can outcompete hydrogenotrophic methanogens for h2 consumption in mixed cultures here conditions under which a h2 scavenging biofilm develops and can be steered from methanogenesis towards bioelectrogenesis were studied thermodynamical considerations are shown for all these competing processes at different conditions and the experimental bioconversion of gaseous h2 and h2 from etoh fermentation furthermore it is presented how to possibly steer a syntrophic biofilm to efficiently convert h2 as gas and h2 from etoh into electricity 2 materials and methods 2 1 bes design the experiments were performed in h type cells each h type cell consisted of two 325 ml cylindrical glass compartments laboratory glass specialists b v the netherlands each compartment had a short tubular opening on its lower side to connect both compartments with a flange connection a bipolar membrane ralex membrane mega czech republic was clamped in between both flange connectors and sealed off with rubber o rings opposite to the flange opening in each compartment were three smaller vertically aligned flange openings which were sealed off with a rubber stoppers and metal caps these were used to insert a luggin capillary laboratory glass specialists b v the netherlands of the 3 m ag agcl reference electrode qm711 qis the netherlands together with the 3 way liquid sampling port servoprax germany the connecting wire of the bioanode as well as the 3 way gas sampling port servoprax germany from bottom to top respectively the top of each compartment had a gl45 opening that was closed with a rubber stopper and a screwing lids with a rubber inlay the anode consisted of a 4 cm 10 cm carbon felt sgl carbon germany of approximately 0 3 cm thickness the cathode was made of a 4 cm 10 cm pt coated ti mesh 0 5 mg cm2 dexmet ct usa both electrodes were bent on their longest edge to form half circles with an opening towards the bpm both anode and cathode compartments were stirred with a stirring bar at 200 rpm anolytes were chosen according to table 1 and respective catholytes for each experiment were the same medium as the anolyte but without the respective electron donor 2 2 media all media were based on a modified recipe for synthetic bes medium with etoh ac and h2 in concentrations as indicated in table 1 molenaar et al 2018 one liter of medium contained 0 74 g kcl 0 584 g nacl 0 68 g kh2po4 7 84 g k2hpo4 0 28 g nh4cl 0 1 g cacl2 2h2o 0 01 g mgso4 7h2o 1 ml of vitamin nevin et al 2011 and 1 ml mineral solution zehnder et al 1980 media with methanogenesis inhibitor additionally contained 50 mm of sodium 2 bromoethanesulfonate as described in zinder and koch 1984 2 3 inoculum the inoculum consisted of a mixture of biomass samples from an anaerobic digester treating black water cunha et al 2018 bioelectrochemical systems using human urine zamora et al 2017 and artificial wastewater as feed molenaar et al 2018 as well as syntrophic propionate oxidizer cultures mollaei et al 2017 2 4 experimental strategy bioelectrochemical systems were first inoculated with 1 v v of inoculum mixture to 10 mm ethanol in synthetic medium suited for bioelectrochemical systems as described in the media section and precultured until achieving reproducible electrical current production at 0 3 v vs 3 m ag agcl all potentials in this work are reported versus ag agcl reference electrodes 205 mv vs nhe preculturing was performed until similar current over time profiles for at least two previous consecutive batches were observed and data reported here was collected thereafter similar to the approach described by parameswaran et al 2009 preculturing was accomplished by replacing the medium each time after exponential development of electrical current was observed yet as major difference in the preculturing approach the electrode with grown biofilm was retained at each replacement during replacement anode and cathode compartments were gently rinsed with deionized water to dilute remaining suspended microorganisms that were less likely than biofilm microorganisms to partake in current generation this medium replacement was omitted for experiments of carbonate addition with gaseous h2 as electron donor before the start of each batch anode potentials were controlled at 0 3 v vs 3 m ag agcl by a potentiostat ivium n stat ivium technologies the netherlands and both compartment headspaces purged with n2 for 30 min for experiments with gaseous h2 a gas volume equivalent to the charge of 5 mm etoh in 0 15 l medium was added as h2 gas volume with a syringe charge from conversion to electricity was only calculated until less than 10 of maximum electrical current was observed this ensured that little to no h2 of diffusion from cathode to anode was taken into account for the charge balance anode potentials and substrate concentrations were chosen to gradually select for hydrogenotrophic eams rather than methanogens as described in table 1 from top to bottom 2 5 sampling and analysis sampling and analysis were conducted as described in supplemental information 3 results and discussion 3 1 thermodynamic considerations for acetate and h2 in methanogenesis electrogenesis and acetogenesis several reactions are involved in the electron flow from ethanol to the final electron acceptors which can be either the anode or ch4 described as pathways b f in fig 1 acetoclastic electrogenesis ac 4 h2o 2 hco3 9 h 8 e b hydrogenotrophic electrogenesis h2 2 h 2 e c hydrogenotrophic acetogenesis 4 h2 2 co2 ac h 2 h2o d hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis 4 h2 co2 ch4 2 h2o e acetoclastic methanogenesis ac h2o ch4 hco3 f the gibbs free energy change at certain reaction conditions dg r was calculated for each of these reaction equations as described in supporting information a1 this is the maximum theoretical energy available for the microorganisms catalyzing the reactions under specific conditions commonly found in our experiments calculations were based on conditions of ph 7 and 25 c as well as concentrations of bicarbonate of 3 3 mm in equilibrium with 0 01 atm co2 1 mm acetate ac and 13 μm dissolved ch4 in equilibrium with 0 01 atm ch4 the dg r for reactions that use an anode as electron acceptor depends on the applied anode potential microorganisms can gain energy from a reaction whenever the anode potential is higher than the equilibrium potential of the reaction under specific conditions furthermore reactions involving protons either directly or in form of protonation dependent bicarbonate give dg r values relative to the ph at a high h2 partial pressure of 0 1 atm and ph 7 an anode potential more positive than 0 5 v vs 3 m ag agcl allows acetoclastic electrogens and hydrogenotrophic electrogens to gain energy from catalyzing their respective reactions fig 2 a at anode potentials higher than 0 35 v electrogens gain more energy from ac oxidation than any hydrogenotrophic microorganisms acetogens electrogens or methanogens could gain from h2 oxidation however hydrogenotrophic electrogens only gain more energy than methanogens at potentials above 0 15 v acetoclastic methanogenesis yielded even lower dg r than h2 consuming methanogensis and was therefore considered negligible increasing the ph for hydrogenotrophic reactions allows to generate more energy for electrogenic h2 conversion fig 2 b however the increased energy gain for electrogens at high h2 partial pressure is still lower than for methanogens a lower h2 partial pressure of 10 5 atm results in less energy gained for all hydrogenotrophic microorganisms fig 2 c so much so that acetogens can no longer sustain themselves in accordance with lever 2012 electrogens need a higher anode potential of 0 35 v to gain energy from h2 oxidation but also gain more energy than methanogens at potentials above 0 2 v increasing the ph at low h2 partial pressure enables electrogens to gain more energy than methanogens at anode potentials above 0 3 v or ph higher than 8 fig 2 d higher substrate concentrations increase the energy gained from any energy yielding reaction therefore both acetoclasts and hydrogenotrophs profit from a close spatial association with fermenters since fermentative ac and h2 are produced in locally high concentrations however high h2 concentrations give an advantage to methanogens compared to electrogens in terms of energy gained per reaction therefore lower h2 concentrations allow electrogens to generate comparable energy from h2 conversion as methanogens yet hydrogenotrophs cannot gain enough energy to sustain themselves from indefinitely low h2 concentrations i e acetogens at 10 5 atm h2 partial pressure lever 2012 proposes different ecological niches as an explanation for why hydrogenotrophic acetogens still do co exist in deep sea sediments together with methanogens this is justified on the grounds that acetogens are specialized in fast turnover with low energy gain and methanogens in slower turnover with high energy gain a similar ecological niche could hypothetically be occupied by hydrogenotrophic eams as indicated by the low energy gain of direct h2 oxidation that would make metabolic maintenance impossible without fast turnover the anode potential for the experiments was therefore chosen to be 0 3 v to allow minimal energy gain from direct h2 oxidation even at h2 partial pressures below detection limit 10 5 atm fig 2 c 3 2 ethanol fermentation in bioanodes indicates fermentative hydrogen can be used for electricity production these thermodynamical considerations were taken into account to study the possibility of designing and steering a syntrophic biofilm to efficiently convert h2 from etoh fermentation into electricity etoh is a common intermediate of complex waste fermentation it is a good model source of fermentative h2 since it is directly fermented into h2 and ac both h2 and ac can then directly be converted into electrical current as indicated above it is paramount to control the ph and to keep h2 concentrations in the headspace low to achieve high conversion efficiencies to electricity here ph control was achieved using a buffer solution of 50 mm pbs at ph 7 8 acid buffer capacity of 45 mm in a first set of experiments different biofilms were developed in presence or absence of 2 bres through succeeding batch incubations with medium containing 10 mm etoh and replacing the medium periodically when less than 10 of maximum current was observed electron balances were established once similar maximum current density and charge conversion to electrical current was observed for at least three succeeding batches fig 3 experimental duplicates are displayed separately in fig 3 since standard deviations would otherwise not be visible in the figure but the duplicates will be described as averages in the following all reactors showed similar maximum current densities of 5 8 a m 2 for 10 mm etoh fig 3 a maximum current densities in presence of 2 bres are generally lower and substrate conversion is 50 100 slower than in absence of 2 bres the delayed conversion in presence of 2 bres may be caused by the inhibition of methanogenesis and therefore possible lack of sufficient h2 scavengers which would delay the etoh fermentation due to thermodynamic inhibition by h2 all reactors showed similar final substrate conversion to electricity with 69 6 in absence and 67 5 in presence of 2 bres fig 3 b only 0 2 of etoh was still detectable in solution and less than 0 2 of total charge was detected as gaseous h2 no ch4 was observed for experiments with 2 bres while only 2 5 1 of total charge was converted into ch4 in absence of 2 bres the 25 35 unknown fraction of total charge was composed of about 20 of soluble cod less than 5 of suspended biomass and the rest undefined microbial products the ph dropped from 7 8 to 6 6 5 for experiments using 10 mm etoh which may limit bioelectrogenesis from direct h2 oxidation fig 2 d and therefore lead to fermentation inhibition by h2 accumulation therefore lower concentrations of 5 mm fig 3 c and 1 mm etoh fig 3 d were used in a second and third set of experiments both with and without 2 bres decreasing the substrate concentration to 5 mm neither led to a higher conversion efficiency to electrical charge nor changed the conversion to ch4 fig 3 c gaseous h2 concentrations were still observed at the limit of detection and the ph stayed between 6 5 in presence and 7 in absence of 2 bres lowering the etoh concentration further to 1 mm led to a ph staying above 7 0 and higher conversion to electrical charge with 87 2 in absence and 85 4 in presence of 2 bres compared to higher substrate concentrations fig 3 d in the experiment without inhibitor methanogenesis was slightly reduced compared to the higher etoh concentrations at 0 7 0 5 conversion to ch4 while etoh could still be detected at the limit of detection at the end of the experiment but h2 could not this shows not only that methanogens do not necessarily consume most h2 from etoh fermentation but also that eams can use this h2 in a biofilm to produce electrical current all experiments show at least 63 etoh conversion to electrical current which was higher than the 60 observed by parameswaran et al 2009 in absence of 2 bres however the complete conversion of 84 etoh into electricity with 16 electrons going into biomass reported by parameswaran et al in presence of 2 bres is achieved here for 1 mm etoh at 87 in absence of 2 bres this is likely due to the medium replacement strategy applied here that would allow a syntrophic microbial biofilm community to stay partially intact while planktonic microorganisms are removed with the spent medium this could result in a biofilm that predominantly has the anode as electron acceptor and would therefore require interspecies electron transfer from fermenters to electrogens this would predominantly produce electricity and lower local h2 concentrations for fermentation to commence stams and plugge 2009 higher conversion of substrate to electricity for lower substrate loadings has also been reported by sleutels et al 2016 3 3 consecutive addition of etoh shows eams can outcompete methanogens after high conversion to electricity was observed for 1 mm etoh further additions of 1 mm etoh were carried out without replacing the medium fig 4 but in absence of 2 bres for all experiments this allowed methanogens to grow in the medium with less competitive advantage of the eam biofilm and without being constrained by their slow growth washout or 2 bres furthermore methanogenic activity was confirmed after 14 days of polarizing the anode at 0 3 v by applying an open circuit for 3 days etoh conversion to electricity was only recorded until the cut off at 5 of maximum current which results in a conservative estimate of how much current is generated from substrate conversion this is done to prevent side reactions that generate current such as h2 diffusion from cathode to anode and to add noticeable electrical charge to the electron balance this cut off may be part of the reason why conversion efficiencies dropped as low as 45 after the first 3 5 days as not even all ac from etoh fermentation was converted into electricity furthermore frequent addition of substrate might have led to a surplus in available substrate and thereby higher biomass yield as observed for higher etoh concentrations in fig 3 however most etoh injections led to conversion efficiencies above 66 even after two weeks without medium replacement this means that the biofilm maintained conversion of fermentative h2 into electricity even after methanogens were no longer removed by medium replacement and able compete for the available substrates this is contrary to conclusions of parameswaran et al 2009 where an increase in fermentative h2 after two weeks led to more than 15 of etoh charge conversion into ch4 methanogenesis for experiments without methanogenesis inhibitor 2 bres increased quickly to around 2 of substrate conversion after 2 days and only slowly increased over the following two weeks to 4 once the anode potential was no longer controlled and left at open circuit etoh additions resulted in increasing parts of substrate conversion to methane of up to 8 of supplied substrate in absence of 2 bres experiments with biofilms formed previously with methanogenesis inhibitor did not produce ch4 while the anode was polarized even though no 2 bres was present in this experiment yet one replicate showed up to 4 substrate conversion to methane when left at open circuit indicating that methanogens were still present and active in this replicate the general presence of methanogenesis and its increasing ratio of substrate conversion at open circuit proves that the electrogenic biofilm did outcompete methanogens for all available substrates etoh ac h2 at closed circuit 3 4 more current produced from etoh than ac shows fermentative h2 is oxidized in order to show that the converted charge came from h2 conversion and not exclusively from acetate ac an experiment was conducted where first 1 mm etoh was added and then 1 mm ac was added afterwards in presence and absence of 2 bres fig 5 ac conversion resulted in double the maximum current density than etoh conversion fig 5 a as for etoh conversion ac conversion to electricity in presence of 2 bres is slightly slower than in absence of 2 bres converted charge to electrical current was slightly higher from etoh with 2 bres 130 2 c than without 2 bres 122 0 5 c while it did not differ significantly for ac conversion 101 8 c with 2 bres versus 104 1 c without 2 bres fig 5 b in general etoh conversion yielded 20 more charge than ac conversion in absence of 2 bres and 30 more in its presence calculating the total charge as electricity generated divided by the initially added charge as substrate gave a conversion efficiency of 88 2 for ac and 73 1 for etoh indicated in fig 5 b this shows that approximately 20 30 additional charge was produced from etoh as substrate compared to ac as sole fermentation product and indicates the use of fermentative h2 for electricity generation thereby slowly released low concentrations of h2 at a relatively high ph of 7 8 could move methanogens from their ecological niche of slow metabolism high energy gain to a low energy gain niche this may allow electrogens with a faster metabolism than that of methanogens to kinetically outcompete methanogens for h2 as substrate lever 2012 conversion of only 88 ac furthermore indicates that 10 15 were likely converted into biomass and secondary metabolites as predicted by parameswaran et al 2009 for a mixed microbial community of fermenters and eams 3 5 addition of dissolved gaseous hydrogen shows that efficient direct production of current is possible the conversion of an electron equivalence of 5 mm etoh as gaseous h2 to electricity was tested over 7 days in absence and presence of 2 bres as well as under carbon source limiting conditions fig 6 a and with addition of 50 mm bicarbonate hco3 fig 6 b without additional carbon source the ratio of h2 conversion to electricity was similar to etoh conversion with 68 2 in absence and 76 12 in presence of methanogenesis inhibitor fig 6 a 17 2 of electrons from h2 conversion ended in ch4 as electron sink in absence of 2 bres this was around one order of magnitude more than observed for etoh conversion yet it is only one quarter as much as h2 conversion to electricity only 3 1 in absence and 6 1 in presence of 2 bres are stored in planktonic biomass and soluble microbial products these should mainly come from detached biofilm since the only carbon source available was the biofilm i e less than 0 2 co2 in headspace at all times data not shown 12 6 of electrons in initially added gaseous h2 in absence and 14 11 in presence of 2 bres remain in the anode unconverted which closes the electron balances for all experiments under carbon limiting conditions with 96 101 of total available electrons being accounted for this remaining h2 even after 7 days stands in difference to the more than 98 of substrate converted in 1 d for etoh conversion experiments likely due to the low solubility of h2 in water less than 0 8 mm atm 1 sander 2015 and diffusion of h2 from cathode to anode in presence of 50 mm hco3 h2 conversion to electricity differs strongly between experiments with and without added methanogenesis inhibitor fig 6 b in both cases more than 98 of initially added h2 is converted absence of 2 bres led to 69 11 conversion into ch4 which is a four fold increase compared to carbon source limiting conditions this confirms that carbon availability was limiting methanogenesis in the previous experiments furthermore higher abundance of methanogens could have contributed to that as well since only the gases and not the medium were replaced between experiments when comparing experiments with and without methanogenesis inhibitor separately the carbonate concentration had only a marginal effect on the h2 conversion to electricity in absence of 2 bres and under carbonate limiting conditions 68 2 were converted to e fig 6a compared to 53 5 when carbonate was added fig 6b in absence of inhibitor the conversion of h2 to electricity 53 5 and ch4 69 11 remained comparable this indicates competitive equality under these conditions for h2 conversion between the developed electrogenic biofilm and methanogens the resulting total electron balance in absence of 2 bres of around 120 further implies that h2 diffusion from cathode to anode took place an increased conversion to electrical charge of 91 in presence of 2 bres and additional carbon source compared to 76 12 under carbon limiting conditions suggests the presence of homoacetogens these could convert the present hco3 into acetate which could generate additional electricity rodenas et al 2017 however no volatile fatty acids were detected at any time of any experiments with gaseous h2 which means that acetate produced by homoactogens would have needed to be oxidized as fast as they had been produced 4 conclusion this work confirms that h2 both from fermentation and in gaseous form could be an electron donor in bes comparison with other work in the literature further indicates that in order to achieve high h2 conversion to electricity a specialized biofilm needs to be developed first furthermore a low substrate concentration and constant removal of planktonic biomass here by operation in fed batch mode can create a sufficiently high advantage of electrogens over methanogens furthermore low h2 concentrations at high ph increase the advantage of electrogens over methanogens to gain more energy from h2 conversion combining these two principles specialized biofilm and low h2 concentration in bes could potentially make h2 feasible as an additional electron donor this h2 could for example be recycled from the cathode in a similar principle as in a hydrogen recycling electrochemical system

18256,recreational water epidemiology studies are rare in settings with minimal wastewater treatment where risk may be highest and in tropical settings where warmer temperature influences the ecology of fecal indicator bacteria commonly used to monitor recreational waters one exception is a 1999 study conducted in são paulo brazil we compared the risk and exposure characteristics of these data with those conducted in the united kingdom uk in the early 1990s that are the basis of the world health organization s who guidelines on recreational water risks we then developed adjusted risk difference models excess gastrointestinal illness per swimming event for children 10 years of age and non children 10 years of age across five brazil beaches we used these models along with beach water quality data from 2004 to 2015 to assess spatial and temporal trends in water quality and human risk risk models indicate that children in brazil have as much as two times the risk of gastrointestinal illness than non children in brazil 11 8 of the weekly water samples from 2004 to 2015 exceeded 158 enterococci cfu 100 ml the highest level of fecal streptococci concentration

world sewage is poorly treated prior to being discharged into receiving waterbodies oceans and beaches are often the recipient of this contamination particularly within the tropics where a high proportion of countries lack wastewater treatment it is well documented that recreational activities in sewage contaminated beaches represent an important exposure pathway mehnert and stewien 1993 payment and locas 2011 linked to increased gastrointestinal and upper respiratory infections dufour 1984 kay et al 1994 wade et al 2008 2003 most of these studies however have been conducted in temperate climates where wastewater treatment is common despite the large numbers of local residents and tourists at risk in tropical beaches where wastewater treatment is less common an exception is a study conducted in 1999 at são paulo beaches in brazil where improperly treated sewage has been and continues to be discharged to waters commonly used for recreational activities analysis of these data indicated an association between increased fecal indicator bacteria and increased cases of gastrointestinal illnesses which support previous findings colford et al 2012 lamparelli et al 2015 turbow et al 2003 wade et al 2008 2003 we build upon these analyses at the same tropical setting to evaluate world health organization who guidelines currently used to support water quality regulations throughout the world current who guidelines were derived from a randomized control trial of swimmers and non swimmers comparing the risk of exposure to beach water kay et al 1994 due to the limited data available on recreational water risk in lmic specifically in the tropics many countries generally rely on the who guidelines although this practice is commonly accepted there are many questions with regard to the generalizability of these studies to tropical settings for example researchers have argued that traditional bacterial indicators used in regulatory activity and specifically in the who guidelines are inappropriate for warmer waters in the tropics byappanahalli et al 2012 fujioka et al 1985 additionally the types of pathogens present in the water depend on both climate tropical vs temperate settings as well as the degree to which wastewater is treated these differences suggest that the etiology of risks and the risk levels vary by geographic setting socioeconomic status climate sewage treatment infrastructure and background disease rates girardi et al 2019 levine et al 1993 and highlight the fact that regulations and guidelines should consider relying more on site or region specific data and analysis in this manuscript we examine the recreational water risks in lmic tropical settings using locally specific epidemiological data from são paulo brazil beaches lamparelli et al 2015 to build concentration response models and compare them to models used by the who we then apply these locally derived models to water quality data collected over 10 years to examine recreational water risks during the same period and to examine the regulatory implications of this site or region specific approach 2 methods 2 1 study location this study is based on data collected from five urban beaches in the state of são paulo brazil enseada beach 1 pitangueiras beach 2 astúrias beach 3 aparecida beach 4 and ocian beach 5 fig 1 these beaches located within 4 municipalities continue to be influenced by untreated sewage cetesb environmental company of the state of são paulo 2018 lamparelli et al 2015 2 2 epidemiological data human health outcomes following beach visitations were obtained through a prospective cohort study conducted by cetesb environmental company of são paulo state as previously described lamparelli et al 2015 briefly a beach survey was used to interview 23 238 participants about their activities at the beach i e whether or not they swam submerged their head swallowed water etc seven to ten days later follow up phone interviews were conducted with 16 637 72 of the participants to determine if any developed health symptoms the health outcome of interest in this study was defined as vomiting diarrhea defined as 3 or more loose stools in a 24 h period or stomach ache with nausea this set of symptoms is referred to as an ngi illness neear gastrointestinal illness as it is similar to the illness definition used in usepa sponsored studies wade et al 2008 cumulative incidence per 1000 individuals was estimated for stratified age groups 10 years and 10 years at each beach as were odds ratios or of health outcomes ngi related to beach water exposure 2 3 water quality data fecal contamination at beach sites was determined by measurements of the fecal indicator bacteria enterococci consistent with the who and usepa recommendations and the kay et al 1994 studies conducted in the uk for the purposes of this study fecal streptococci and enterococci were considered equal world health organization 2003 during the brazil epidemiological study january 9th to february 6th 1999 grab samples were collected once daily at each of the five urban beaches and processed for enterococci on me and eia agar as previously described lamparelli et al 2015 levin et al 1975 magenta colonies on me and eia agar were assumed positive for enterococci all results were reported as colony forming units cfu per 100 ml lamparelli et al 2015 in addition to the water quality data collected during the epidemiological study weekly enterococci concentrations from routine beach water quality monitoring at the five study beaches were obtained for the time period between january 2004 and december 2015 the enterococci enumeration method for this later period differed from those performed during the epidemiological study because the cetesb labs began using mei agar in the early 2000s briefly beach water was filtered through a membrane filter placed on mei agar and incubated at 41 c for 24 h united states environmental protection agency 2009 serial dilutions were performed on all samples to obtain a countable plate containing 20 60 enterococci colonies 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 risk difference models we developed two risk difference models to compare the risk of ngi illness across measured enterococci levels swimmers were assigned the concentration values for the day they swam one model used all subjects where non swimmers were assigned as the reference group and the other model used only swimmers only those that reported entering the water and was developed with a continuous variable of enterococci exposure these models were calculated for each age group 10 and 10 across all beaches and both assumed gastrointestinal illness was directly related to enterococci concentrations we then estimated the probability of an ngi illness as a function of enterococci water quality using a logistic regression model adjusted models were developed using model based standardization greenland 2004 which adjusted estimates of probabilities conditional on the following covariates contact with sand ate food prepared on the beach contact with untreated water in the previous week and contact with pool water in previous week this risk difference model based on enterococci exposure was defined as the concentration response function and used in the subsequent risk assessments 2 4 2 model comparison we conducted a comparative analysis between the kay et al 1994 model based on a study in the uk and the model developed here based on the brazil study in order to compare illness risks between the current study and the kay et al 1994 study risks were standardized to a 7 day follow up period the overall and strata specific gastrointestinal illness rates from kay et al 1994 were multiplied by 0

the water and the number of individuals reporting illness were used to determine illness rates per 1000 these rates were determined using water quality categories defined by kay et al 1994 e g 0 1 19

the remainder of the analysis we present age groups stratified by and 10 years of age which better corresponds to much of the current literature 2 4 3 risk assessment based on the risk difference models derived from the epidemiological study described above we calculated weekly risk from swimming at the são paulo brazil beaches using enterococci concentrations measured once weekly at each of the five study beaches between 2004 and 2015 the best fit curve to the risk difference models was a four parameter nonlinear logistic dose response equation e g hill equation equation 1 the fitted value parameters for the dose response curve are described in table s1 for each age category we present the weekly risk for one beach in the main body of this manuscript and the remaining beaches in

measurements from the 1999 epidemiological study in evaluating the appropriateness of using a concentration response function to estimate risk climate setting e g tropics vs temperate and wastewater treatment techniques must be considered the site specific nature of our analysis addresses both of these issues a remaining assumption of our approach is that the functional relationship between the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria in this case enterococcus and illness was unchanged between 1999 when the concentration response function was developed and 2015 3 results enterococci concentrations across all study beaches during the 1999 brazilian epidemiological study ranged from 1 0 to 700 cfu 100 ml geometric mean 29 7 cfu 100 ml epidemiologic data are provided elsewhere describing an overview of the study population crude disease rates and adjusted risk models lamparelli et al 2015 in brief swimmers had approximately 36 or 1 36 95 ci 1 05 1 58 higher odds of becoming ill measured as self reported ngi than non swimmers accounting for other exposures such as contact with sand contact with untreated water in the previous week and beach location the baseline risk of ngi among non swimmers was 58 per 1000 among swimmers beach 5 exhibited the highest ngi risks at 200 cases per 1000 for children swimmers were also higher than non swimmers 230 per 1000 compared to 130 per 1000 ngi risks for swimmers at each beach are detailed in table s2 3 1 concentration response from risk difference models the adjusted risk difference model for swimmers fig 2 illustrates that ngi risks for children 10 years old are appreciably higher than for non children 10 years old at higher concentrations children are at twice the risk of non children to have ngi the adjusted models showed an attenuated risk compared to the crude estimates suggesting that there were other pathways of transmission e g consuming food on the beach that were correlated with swimming unadjusted model results not shown when including non swimmers in the analysis risk differences were further attenuated by approximately 50 suggesting that the non swimmers represented a different population with higher baseline risks therefore we chose to use swimmers exposed to low enterococci levels as a reference group rather than relying on non swimmers since non swimmers may represent a group with a different baseline risk the reference group in these analyses were estimated risks among swimmers exposed to 0 5 cfu 100 ml 3 2 comparative analysis to compare the brazil data with those published by kay et al 1994 in the uk water quality was categorized into 20 unit categories of enterococci per 100 ml table 1 we use an age category of less than and greater than 18 years to provide a point of comparison with the kay data risks associated with the 18 years were similar to those risks associated with 10 years a cut off used in the brazil epidemiology study the baseline rates of gastrointestinal illness measured by the unexposed adult category were higher in brazil 44 2 cases per 1000 than in the uk 33 3 cases per 1000 although small sample sizes within each exposure category resulted in uncertain estimates one main distinction between the two studies is that the brazil data had a steeper rise in risk from the 60 80 concentration bin to the 80 bin in contrast the uk data exhibits a more gradual rise from the 40 60 concentration bin to 80 bin another difference between the studies was the range of concentrations found in the water in the uk study the range was from 0 to 158 fecal streptococci cfu 100 ml and for the brazil study the range was from 1 to 700 enterococci cfu 100 ml when we examined higher concentration bins for the brazil data 80 100 and 100 200 we did not observe higher levels of risk 3 3 risk assessment we applied the brazil concentration response risk difference model to the enterococci concentrations measured at the study beaches weekly between 2004 and 2015 n 3120 fig 3 our risk difference models predict an average 41 6 excess cases of ngi per 1000 swimmers across all beaches and age groups during this period stratified by children and non children the median predicted risks were 53 and 26 excess cases of ngi per 1000 respectively fig s1 across all swimmers and dates the risk based on a single exposure ranged from 12 5 to 130 4 excess cases per 1000 swimmers based on exposure the risk in children ranged from a median of 40 cases per 1000 when exposed to 20 cfu 100 ml to a median of 120 cases per 1000 when exposed to 158 cfu 100 ml fig 4 children exhibited approximately twice the risk of that seen in non children on average weekly enterococci levels were 85 5 cfu 100 ml however weekly water quality was highly variable ranging from 1 6 to 2084 0 cfu 100 ml fig s2 for example 1 9 of the samples during the 10 years were above 700 cfu 100 ml the highest concentration observed during the 1999 brazil epidemiological study and 11 8 of the samples were above 158 cfu 100 ml the highest concentration observed during the 1994 uk study this represents 368 high exposure events across the 10 years which would require extrapolation if the uk concentration response function was used during these high risk events the mean enterococci concentration was 351 cfu 100 ml equating to a median risk difference of 53 and 96 cases per 1000 in non children and children respectively in comparison during the same period when enterococci concentrations were below 158 cfu 100 ml mean 28 4 33 9 cfu 100 ml the median risk difference for non children and children was 24 and 50 cases per 1000 respectively 30 of these 368 high risk events occurred in the summer season december february 18 occurred in january and 69 of these events occurred in beaches 4 and 5 fig 3 and fig s3 illustrate the overall elevated risks of ngi from swimming at the study beaches largely driven by these weekly high risk events temporal analysis of beach water quality identified no statistically unique year or season across the five beaches p 0 05 in general the lowest enterococci concentrations arithmetic means were measured in the winter season june july and august and the highest concentrations were measured in the summer season december january and february albeit these seasonal differences were not statistically significant beach 4 was the exception to these patterns where average enterococci concentrations were lowest in the summer season and highest in the spring and fall seasons p 0 05 overall enterococci concentration means were statistically higher at beaches 4 and 5 compared to the other beaches p 0 01 table 2 4 discussion as highlighted by the events leading up to the rio olympics eisenberg et al 2016 water contaminated with poorly treated sewage is common worldwide and puts local residents and tourist at risk in many regions and tropical beaches are no exception these events also highlight how little we know about the exposure pathways and risks associated with these contamination events here we utilized a unique data set from beaches in são paulo brazil to highlight a number of issues first the concentration response model we created using epidemiological data from são paulo brazil beaches allows for site or region specific risk assessments in tropical settings second peak contamination levels in brazil were higher than those reported in studies from the uk as well as in other high income countries that have wastewater treatment plants in particular in são paulo beaches between 2004 and 2015 11 8 of the weekly samples exhibited these higher risk conditions third children are at greater risk from swimming at these study beaches and should be targeted in future studies more epidemiological and water quality studies in tropical settings where wastewater treatment is minimal are necessary to develop relevant regulations site or region specific concentration response models benefit from not only using site specific exposure and outcome data but also by collecting data on potential confounding variables such as contact with sand eating food prepared on the beach contact with untreated water in the previous week and contact with pool water in the previous week reporting adjusted risks reduces bias more closely align with risk estimates from randomized control trials and therefore more closely aligns with the actual risks associated with swimming at beaches we observed lower risk differences between swimmers and unexposed populations for each age classification in the adjusted models compared to the unadjusted models this positive confounding suggests that the unadjusted estimates includes risks associated with other exposure pathways the fact that children are at higher risk is not surprising and has been shown in prior beach studies in temperate waters wade et al 2008 the current study found children were at greater risk compared to non children at all water quality conditions but especially when enterococci exceeded 158 cfu 100 ml it has been demonstrated that children are more likely to spend more time in water and swallow more water per minute of exposure compared to adults deflorio barker et al 2018 dufour et al 2017 these results emphasize the importance of targeting children in future epidemiological and risk assessment studies as regulations and guidelines are meant to protect the more vulnerable groups within a population further work is needed to better understand the reason why children are more at risk it may be that children have higher exposure levels e g ingesting more water or they are more susceptible to infection and disease for a given exposure compared to older individuals the high levels of fecal contamination measured at these são paulo beaches during the 1999 epidemiology study and the subsequent surveillance data reported since 2005 suggests chronic recreational water quality contamination the main pollution sources at the study beaches were previously identified as storm water runoff partially treated sewage and uncontrolled wastewater discharges lamparelli et al 2015 additionally 2 of all samples collected at são paulo beaches between 2004 and 2015 n 3120 were above 700 cfu 100 ml these high levels of fecal indicator bacteria measurements suggest poorly treated sewage or contaminated urban runoff noble et al 2003 and was recently highlighted as a risk to swimmers at brazil beaches cox 2016 the data we present here on enterococci concentrations at são paulo beaches far exceed those reported in the uk epidemiological studies examining 10 years of surveillance data from these beaches indicated that concentrations exceeded the maximum reported concentrations from the uk data 12 of the time furthermore the baseline illness rates reported during the 1999 study was higher than those reported in the uk study many recreational water risk assessments convert fecal indicator bacteria to expected pathogen concentrations and then calculate risk on those pathogens rodrigues et al 2016 schoen and ashbolt 2010 soller et al 2014 the current study assumed enterococci related directly to ngi which we know do not cause disease i e they are surrogate indicators the concentration response function derived in the current study was empirically based and any conversion to a set of pathogens introduces multiple assumptions that was decided to be less accurate than the applied approach the combination of using more relevant baseline illness and specific water quality surveillance data to estimate the concentration response function argues for the need to develop more site and regional specific risk assessments as with many recreational beach studies this project was limited by the granularity of the data and uncertainties of the environmental conditions microbial quality of water was measured once per day at each beach during the epidemiological study and assumed representative of all swimmer exposures for that date however it is well established that microbial concentrations in coastal waters change rapidly for many reasons boehm 2007 bush et al 2014 verhougstraete and rose 2014 whitman et al 2004 the highly variable nature of bacteria in water and their settling and resuspension rates were not included in the applied models which leads to exposure misclassification bias future risk models should incorporate measures of these environmental variables on various temporal scales 5 conclusion social and environmental conditions are strong determinants of pathogen dynamics in the environment in tropical settings around the world water temperatures are higher than in temperate climates these same settings have a higher density of low income communities the result is very different microbial ecologies in the tropics compared to temperate high income settings regionally specific guidelines are therefore critical to better serve these distinct settings we highlight this issue by illustrating that the who recreational water quality guideline based largely on the results from the kay et al 1994 epidemiological study performed at uk beaches is not appropriate as a basis for guideline development in tropical settings where there is minimal wastewater treatment twenty years ago a comprehensive review of recreational water epidemiological studies showed the low occurrence of research in low middle income countries prüss üstün 1998 and the gap remains we must strive to perform additional epidemiological studies at

18256,recreational water epidemiology studies are rare in settings with minimal wastewater treatment where risk may be highest and in tropical settings where warmer temperature influences the ecology of fecal indicator bacteria commonly used to monitor recreational waters one exception is a 1999 study conducted in são paulo brazil we compared the risk and exposure characteristics of these data with those conducted in the united kingdom uk in the early 1990s that are the basis of the world health organization s who guidelines on recreational water risks we then developed adjusted risk difference models excess gastrointestinal illness per swimming event for children 10 years of age and non children 10 years of age across five brazil beaches we used these models along with beach water quality data from 2004 to 2015 to assess spatial and temporal trends in water quality and human risk risk models indicate that children in brazil have as much as two times the risk of gastrointestinal illness than non children in brazil 11 8 of the weekly water samples from 2004 to 2015 exceeded 158 enterococci cfu 100 ml the highest level of fecal streptococci concentration measured in the uk study risks associated with these elevated levels equated to median neear gastrointestinal illness ngi risks of 53 and 96 excess cases per 1000 swimmers in non children and children respectively two of the five beaches appear to drive the overall elevated ngi risks seen during this study distinct enteric pathogen profiles that exist in tropical settings as well as in settings

world sewage is poorly treated prior to being discharged into receiving waterbodies oceans and beaches are often the recipient of this contamination particularly within the tropics where a high proportion of countries lack wastewater treatment it is well documented that recreational activities in sewage contaminated beaches represent an important exposure pathway mehnert and stewien 1993 payment and locas 2011 linked to increased gastrointestinal and upper respiratory infections dufour 1984 kay et al 1994 wade et al 2008 2003 most of these studies however have been conducted in temperate climates where wastewater treatment is common despite the large numbers of local residents and tourists at risk in tropical beaches where wastewater treatment is less common an exception is a study conducted in 1999 at são paulo beaches in brazil where improperly treated sewage has been and continues to be discharged to waters commonly used for recreational activities analysis of these data indicated an association between increased fecal indicator bacteria and increased cases of gastrointestinal illnesses which support previous findings colford et al 2012 lamparelli et al 2015 turbow et al 2003 wade et al 2008 2003 we build upon these analyses at the same tropical setting to evaluate world health organization who guidelines currently used to support water quality regulations throughout the world current who guidelines were derived from a randomized control trial of swimmers and non swimmers comparing the risk of exposure to beach water kay et al 1994 due to the limited data available on recreational water risk in lmic specifically in the tropics many countries generally rely on the who guidelines although this practice is commonly accepted there are many questions with regard to the generalizability of these studies to tropical settings for example researchers have argued that traditional bacterial indicators used in regulatory activity and specifically in the who guidelines are inappropriate for warmer waters in the tropics byappanahalli et al 2012 fujioka et al 1985 additionally the types of pathogens present in the water depend on both climate tropical vs temperate settings as well as the degree to which wastewater is treated these differences suggest that the etiology of risks and the risk levels vary by geographic setting socioeconomic status climate sewage treatment infrastructure and background disease rates girardi et al 2019 levine et al 1993 and highlight the fact that regulations and guidelines should consider relying more on site or region specific data and analysis in this manuscript we examine the recreational water risks in lmic tropical settings using locally specific epidemiological data from são paulo brazil beaches lamparelli et al 2015 to build concentration response models and compare them to models used by the who we then apply these locally derived models to water quality data collected over 10 years to examine recreational water risks during the same period and to examine the regulatory implications of this site or region specific approach 2 methods 2 1 study location this study is based on data collected from five urban beaches in the state of são paulo brazil enseada beach 1 pitangueiras beach 2 astúrias beach 3 aparecida beach 4 and ocian beach 5 fig 1 these beaches located within 4 municipalities continue to be influenced by untreated sewage cetesb environmental company of the state of são paulo 2018 lamparelli et al 2015 2 2 epidemiological data human health outcomes following beach visitations were obtained through a prospective cohort study conducted by cetesb environmental company of são paulo state as previously described lamparelli et al 2015 briefly a beach survey was used to interview 23 238 participants about their activities at the beach i e whether or not they swam submerged their head swallowed water etc seven to ten days later follow up phone interviews were conducted with 16 637 72 of the participants to determine if any developed health symptoms the health outcome of interest in this study was defined as vomiting diarrhea defined as 3 or more loose stools in a 24 h period or stomach ache with nausea this set of symptoms is referred to as an ngi illness neear gastrointestinal illness as it is similar to the illness definition used in usepa sponsored studies wade et al 2008 cumulative incidence per 1000 individuals was estimated for stratified age groups 10 years and 10 years at each beach as were odds ratios or of health outcomes ngi related to beach water exposure 2 3 water quality data fecal contamination at beach sites was determined by measurements of the fecal indicator bacteria enterococci consistent with the who and usepa recommendations and the kay et al 1994 studies conducted in the uk for the purposes of this study fecal streptococci and enterococci were considered equal world health organization 2003 during the brazil epidemiological study january 9th to february 6th 1999 grab samples were collected once daily at each of the five urban beaches and processed for enterococci on me and eia agar as previously described lamparelli et al 2015 levin et al 1975 magenta colonies on me and eia agar were assumed positive for enterococci all results were reported as colony forming units cfu per 100 ml lamparelli et al 2015 in addition to the water quality data collected during the epidemiological study weekly enterococci concentrations from routine beach water quality monitoring at the five study beaches were obtained for the time period between january 2004 and december 2015 the enterococci enumeration method for this later period differed from those performed during the epidemiological study because the cetesb labs began using mei agar in the early 2000s briefly beach water was filtered through a membrane filter placed on mei agar and incubated at 41 c for 24 h united states environmental protection agency 2009 serial dilutions were performed on all samples to obtain a countable plate containing 20 60 enterococci colonies 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 risk difference models we developed two risk difference models to compare the risk of ngi illness across measured enterococci levels swimmers were assigned the concentration values for the day they swam one model used all subjects where non swimmers were assigned as the reference group and the other model used only swimmers only those that reported entering the water and was developed with a continuous variable of enterococci exposure these models were calculated for each age group 10 and 10 across all beaches and both assumed gastrointestinal illness was directly related to enterococci concentrations we then estimated the probability of an ngi illness as a function of enterococci water quality using a logistic regression model adjusted models were developed using model based standardization greenland 2004 which adjusted estimates of probabilities conditional on the following covariates contact with sand ate food prepared on the beach contact with untreated water in the previous week and contact with pool water in previous week this risk difference model based on enterococci exposure was defined as the concentration response function and used in the subsequent risk assessments 2 4 2 model comparison we conducted a comparative analysis between the kay et al 1994 model based on a study in the uk and the model developed here based on the brazil study in order to compare illness risks between the current study and the kay et al 1994 study risks were standardized to a 7 day follow up period the overall and strata specific gastrointestinal illness rates from kay et al 1994 were multiplied by 0 343 as the manuscript states 34 3 of gastroenteritis cases developed within 7 days of the study day the remaining 65 7 had onset dates up to 21 days the number of people exposed defined as entering the water and the number of individuals reporting illness were used to determine illness rates per 1000 these rates were determined using water quality categories defined by kay et al 1994 e g 0 1 19 20 39 40 59 60 79 80 organisms 100 ml for this model comparison the brazil data was stratified by age groups defined as and 18 years of age to allow for direct comparison with the kay et al data for the remainder of the analysis we present age groups stratified by and 10 years of age which better corresponds to much of the current literature 2 4 3 risk assessment based on the risk difference models derived from the epidemiological study described above we calculated weekly risk from swimming at the são paulo brazil beaches using enterococci concentrations measured once weekly at each of the five study beaches between 2004 and 2015 the best fit curve to the risk difference models was a four parameter nonlinear logistic dose response equation e g hill equation equation 1 the fitted value parameters for the dose response curve are described in table s1 for each age category we present the weekly risk for one beach in the main body of this manuscript and the remaining beaches in the supplemental materials 1 y α θ x η k η x η where y equals the response given a specific dose x is the independent variable α is the minimum response when enterococci concentrations 0 cfu 100 ml θ is maximum response expected η is the hill coefficient and κ ingested dose of enterococci the strength of our concentration response function is that it is site specific and based on enterococci measurements from the 1999 epidemiological study in evaluating the appropriateness of using a concentration response function to estimate risk climate setting e g tropics vs temperate and wastewater treatment techniques must be considered the site specific nature of our analysis addresses both of these issues a remaining assumption of our approach is that the functional relationship between the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria in this case enterococcus and illness was unchanged between 1999 when the concentration response function was developed and 2015 3 results enterococci concentrations across all study beaches during the 1999 brazilian epidemiological study ranged from 1 0 to 700 cfu 100 ml geometric mean 29 7 cfu 100 ml epidemiologic data are provided elsewhere

did not observe higher levels of risk 3 3 risk assessment we applied the brazil concentration response risk difference model to the enterococci concentrations measured at the study beaches weekly between 2004 and 2015 n 3120 fig 3 our risk difference models predict an average 41 6 excess cases of ngi per 1000 swimmers across all beaches and age groups during this period stratified by children

study and 11 8 of the samples were above 158 cfu 100 ml the highest concentration observed during the 1994 uk study this represents 368 high exposure events across the 10 years which would require extrapolation if the uk concentration response function was used during these high risk events the mean enterococci concentration was 351 cfu 100 ml equating to a median risk difference of 53 and 96 cases per 1000 in non children and children respectively in comparison during the same period when enterococci concentrations were below 158 cfu 100 ml mean 28 4 33 9 cfu 100 ml the median risk difference for non children and children was 24 and 50 cases per 1000 respectively 30 of these 368 high risk events occurred in the summer season december february 18 occurred in january and 69 of

that children have higher exposure levels e g ingesting more water or they are more susceptible to infection and disease for a given exposure compared to older individuals the high levels of fecal contamination measured at these são paulo beaches during the 1999 epidemiology study and the subsequent surveillance data reported since 2005 suggests chronic recreational water quality contamination the main pollution sources at the study beaches were previously identified as storm water runoff partially treated sewage and uncontrolled wastewater discharges lamparelli et al 2015 additionally 2 of all samples collected at são paulo beaches between 2004 and 2015 n 3120 were above 700 cfu 100 ml these high levels of fecal indicator bacteria measurements suggest poorly treated sewage or contaminated urban runoff noble et al 2003 and was recently highlighted as a risk to swimmers at brazil beaches cox 2016 the data we present here on enterococci concentrations at são paulo beaches far exceed those reported in the uk epidemiological studies examining 10 years of surveillance data from these beaches indicated that concentrations exceeded the maximum reported concentrations from the uk data 12 of the time furthermore the baseline illness rates reported during the 1999 study was higher than those reported in the uk study many recreational water risk assessments convert fecal indicator bacteria to expected pathogen concentrations and then calculate risk on those pathogens rodrigues et al 2016 schoen and ashbolt 2010 soller et al 2014 the current study assumed enterococci related directly to ngi which we know do not cause disease i e they are surrogate indicators the concentration response function derived in the current study was empirically based and any conversion to a set of pathogens introduces multiple assumptions that was decided to be less accurate than the applied approach the combination of using more relevant baseline illness and specific water quality surveillance data to estimate the concentration response function argues for the need to develop more site and regional specific risk assessments as with many recreational beach studies this project was limited by the granularity of the data and uncertainties of the environmental conditions microbial quality of water was measured once per day at each beach during the epidemiological study and assumed representative of all swimmer exposures for that date however it is well established that microbial concentrations in coastal waters change rapidly for many reasons boehm 2007 bush et al 2014 verhougstraete and rose 2014 whitman et al 2004 the highly variable nature of bacteria in water and their settling and resuspension rates were not included in the applied models which leads to exposure misclassification bias future risk models should incorporate measures of these environmental variables on various temporal scales 5 conclusion social and environmental conditions are strong determinants of pathogen dynamics in the environment in tropical settings around the world water temperatures are higher than in temperate climates these same settings have a higher density of low income communities the result is very different microbial ecologies in the tropics compared to temperate high income settings regionally specific guidelines are therefore critical to better serve these distinct settings we highlight this issue by illustrating that the who recreational water quality guideline based largely on the results from the kay et al 1994 epidemiological study performed at uk beaches is not appropriate as a basis for guideline development in tropical settings where there is minimal wastewater treatment twenty years ago a comprehensive review of recreational water epidemiological studies showed the low occurrence of research in low middle income countries prüss üstün 1998 and the gap remains we must strive to perform additional epidemiological studies at

18257,the formation of carcinogenic n nitrosamines from reactions between solvent amines and flue gas nox is an important concern for the application of amine based processes to capture co2 post combustion using an advanced test rig with interconnected absorber and desorber units we evaluated the importance for n nitrosamine formation of the desorber relative to the absorber and any synergism between the two units variations in desorber temperature and in flue gas composition indicated that n nitrosamine formation from fresh monoethanolamine mea occurred predominantly in the absorber n nitrosamine formation was driven by high no2 and o2 flue gas concentrations although no also contributed in contrast n nitrosamine formation from piperazine pz was driven by reactions with nitrite in the heated desorber and accelerated concurrent with nitrite accumulation a complementary experiment simulating aged mea solvent high nitrite 1 5 sarcosine as a proxy of secondary amine degradation products suggested the desorber becomes an order of magnitude more important than the absorber for n nitrosamine formation for fresh mea solvent increasing the desorber temperature from 110 c to 130 c promoted thermal decomposition of n nitrosamines reducing n nitrosamine accumulation rates two fold compared to the test rig the prevailing practice of using separate absorber columns and autoclave like treatments to mimic desorber units predicted the direction but underestimated the magnitude of n nitrosamine formation because n nitrosamine accumulation rates are the net result of competing formation and thermal decomposition processes use of continuously cycling test rigs may be necessary to understand the impacts of different operating conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords

units into the co2 capture process exhaust gas dai et al 2012 dong et al 2019 glover et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 our previous results using a laboratory scale absorber unit indicated that n2o3 formed by the reaction of no with no2 is the dominant nitrosating agent within the absorber equation 2 dai and mitch 2014 n2o3 can either nitrosate amines or hydrolyze to produce nitrite equation 3 laboratory scale experiments using autoclave like systems to mimic the high temperature pressure and ph conditions of desorber units 110 150 c 2 bar ph 10 have indicated that these conditions can promote nitrosation of amines by nitrite goldman et al 2013 chandan et al 2013 fine et al 2014a potentially by n2o3 formed via the reverse of equation 3 or catalysis by formaldehyde keefer and roller 1973 challis and kyrtopoulos 1976 casado et al 1984 zhou et al 2018 carbamates sun et al 2011 goldman et al 2013 fine et al 2014a or on oco2 yu et al 2017a b shi et al 2017 laboratory scale absorber

amine categories only secondary n nitrosamines are stable mirvish 1975 stable n nitrosamine formation from primary and tertiary amines requires initial formation of secondary amines as byproducts of oxidative degradation strazisar et al 2003 gouedard et al 2012 trace level dissolved cu can significantly promote n nitrosamine formation from primary amines that are prone to such oxidative

fine et al 2014a wang and mitch 2015 voice et al 2015 saeed et al 2018 on separate absorber columns and autoclave like mimics for desorber units results from the difficulty of constructing flow through desorber units due to their high temperature and pressure conditions however there are several reasons to suspect that the interplay between absorber and desorber units not captured by such laboratory scale systems may be important first it is unclear whether the high temperature and pressure conditions within desorber units promote amine degradation leading to amine based precursors that are easier to nitrosate within absorber units second nitrite produced in the absorber column can be consumed in the desorber columns via nitrosation of amines if this nitrosation results from reactions with n2o3 formed via nitrite the reverse of equation 3 n nitrosamine formation would be expected to be second order in nitrite mirvish 1975 however other research has indicated that nitrite associated n nitrosamine formation can be first order in nitrite when associated with formaldehyde keefer and roller 1973 another oxidative degradation product of amines such as mea chi and rochelle 2002 dai et al 2012 gouedard et al 2012 ge et al 2014 when laboratory scale evaluations autoclave samples retrieved after several passes through isolated absorber columns the nitrite accumulation likely is significantly faster than in pilot scale facilities encompassing inter connected absorber desorber systems where nitrite is consumed during each pass through the desorber units if n nitrosamine formation in the desorber is second order in nitrite the accumulation of nitrite in laboratory scale systems would have the effect of overemphasizing the importance of n nitrosamine formation within desorber units relative to that in absorber units finally the high temperature conditions in desorber units may mitigate n nitrosamine accumulation rates in solvents by promoting n nitrosamine decomposition voice et al 2015 tall and zeman 1985 fine et al 2014b an effect not captured in laboratory scale systems employing only absorber columns while pilot scale systems could fill this gap there are few of these units and they often are devoted to long term tests without systematic variation of operational parameters several laboratory scale experimental platforms mimicking absorber desorber cycling including the integrated solvent degradation apparatus isda and the mini plant have been employed to evaluate net n nitrosopiperazine formation from piperazine pz solvents spiked with nitrite voice et al 2015 saeed et al 2018 ali mazari et al 2019 when the desorber mimic within these systems was operated at 120 c high to near quantitative yields of n nitrosopiperazine from nitrite reactions were coupled with its first order decay half life 1 5 days in separate batch reactor studies of n nitrosopiperazine decomposition as a function of temperature the half life of n nitrosopiperazine decomposition dropped to 7 h at 150 c fine et al 2014b however these experiments did not apply nox to an absorber mimic to capture the interplay between these two units additional studies haugen et al 2012 einbu et al 2013 vevelstad et al 2017 used one of the five advanced test rigs designed by sintef norway incorporating inter connected continuously cycling absorber and desorber columns developed as part of the amine technology qualification program tqp amine under the co2 capture mongstad project ccm in norway de koeijer et al 2011 hamborg et al 2014 these studies using 5 m 30 by weight mea solvent were performed as a continuous 14 week campaign that was divided into four test conditions baseline desorber temperature at 120 c 12 o2 and 5 ppmv nox high o2 18 high desorber temperature 140 c and high nox 50 ppmv the overall degradation rate of mea did not vary significantly throughout the campaign n nitroso 2 hydroxylethyl glycine constituted 50 of the total n nitrosamines with most of the remainder uncharacterized increasing the desorber temperature from 120 c to 140 c reduced the level of total n nitrosamines by 50 indicating thermal degradation of n nitrosamines after 14 weeks of operation increasing nox concentrations did not increase total n nitrosamine concentrations suggesting that this concentration may reach steady state over long timescales the goal of this study was to further evaluate the importance of inter connected absorber and desorber units for n nitrosamine formation using another one of the five advanced test rigs developed under the ccm program our study focused on mea as the benchmark primary amine solvent in the industry with limited comparison to piperazine pz as an example secondary amine of interest as a solvent component bishnoi and rochelle 2000 rather than varying conditions with one solvent over prolonged periods we chose to use fresh solvent for each experiment to better control the composition of the solvent and thereby isolate the importance of reaction conditions from complications associated with solvent evolution however an experiment was conducted with a synthetic aged mea solvent consisting of fresh mea spiked with nitrite and a model secondary amine to mimic the effects of secondary amines expected to accumulate within mea over prolonged solvent usage the first objective was to assess the effect of flue gas conditions on n nitrosamine accumulation rates in fresh mea solvent and whether higher temperatures in desorber units could mitigate these n nitrosamine accumulation rates the second objective was to compare the relative importance of the absorber and desorber units for n nitrosamine formation with fresh mea and pz solvents and with a synthetic aged mea solvent the third objective was to evaluate the extent to which n nitrosamine formation differed between experiments conducted with conventional laboratory scale systems i e separate absorber column treatment followed by autoclave like treatment to mimic desorber column treatment and treatment conducted within the test rig incorporating continuous treatment by interconnected absorber and desorber columns 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals deionized water was used for all the experimental procedures including preparation of solvent solutions rinsing the test rig and processing of liquid samples solvent solutions included 5 m 30 by weight mea sigma aldrich 99 with 0 5 water and 10 mg kg fe and 1 m pz sigma aldrich reagentplus 99 with 1 water while the mea concentration was relevant to industrial operations reynolds et al 2012 de koeijer et al 2011 a lower pz concentration than that recommended by other authors goldman et al 2013 nielsen et al 2013 cousins et al 2015 was used due to concerns about the low solubility of pz at room temperature freeman et al 2010 resulting in clogging of the test rig haugen et al 2012 high purity solvents were used rather than industrial solvents to maximize control over the solvent composition the technical grade mea solvents used in industry may contain readily nitrosatable secondary amine impurities and secondary amines are expected to accumulate as products of oxidative degradation of mea strazisar et al 2003 fostås et al 2011 gouedard et al 2012 vevelstad et al 2013 an additional experiment employed a synthetic aged mea solvent consisting of 5 m mea spiked with 3 mm nitrite and 75 mm sarcosine sigma aldrich 98 a model secondary amine the nitrite concentration approximates the level observed in a previous pilot test involving a mea solvent strazisar et al 2003 the sarcosine concentration approximates the level of the secondary amine n 2 hydroxyethyl glycine measured as the major secondary amine degradation product to have accumulated in 5 m mea solvent over 14 weeks of operation in a previous pilot test einbu et al 2013 praxair 99 9 n2 co2 and o2 and no 2500 ppmv diluted in n2 and no2 2500 ppmv diluted in n2 and sodium nitrite sigma aldrich acs reagent 97 were used as received 2 2 co2 capture test rig the test rig is a semi automated unit 1 4 m long 0 7 m wide 2 m high controlled by a computer using a labview national instrument tx interface via numerous temperature pressure flow and liquid level sensors photograph shown in figure s1 the total volume of amine solvent used in a typical experiment was approximately 5 l salient features of this complex unit are summarized in fig 1 briefly parts of the rig in contact with gases or liquids are constructed primarily of 316 grade stainless steel with minor use of teflon and glass the rig contains absorber and desorber columns 5 1 cm diameter 1 54 m high each filled to a depth of 30 cm and each operated in a countercurrent fashion with amine solvent flowing down and gases flowing up identical cushion columns were connected to the absorber and desorber columns by gravity flow a peristaltic pump recirculates the amine solvent through the absorber unit at 10 l h via a heated water bath to maintain the solvent at 45 c the synthetic flue gas was concocted by mixing n2 o2 co2 no2 and no using mass flow controllers heat tracing and a blower downstream of the gas mixing point pre heated the fresh and recirculated gases to 45 c another peristaltic pump at the bottom of the absorber column delivered the absorber solvent to the top of the desorber unit at 3 5 l h the desorber temperature was controlled by adjusting the duty of an electrical heater at its bottom the desorber pressure was automatically regulated at 2 5 bar by a pressure release valve at the top of the desorber column lean solvent was returned to the top of the absorber column by this column pressure by adjusting the flowrate of the peristaltic pump conveying rich solvent from the absorber to the desorber together with a valve controlling the flow of lean solvent back to the absorber column approximately equal volumes of solvent could be maintained in each column note that the pressure regulator at the top of the desorber unit prevented the release of most of the co2 liberated from the solvent in the desorber as this co2 and the lean solvent flowed back to the absorber unit it passed through a heat exchanger where heat was transferred to the rich solvent being pumped from the bottom of the absorber to the top of the desorber unit the cooling of the lean solvent contributed to the re absorption of co2 into the lean solvent the overall gas flowrate applied to the absorber column was 3500 l h a 260 1 v v gas to liquid ratio approaching those employed in practice fig 1 however only 0 37 l min 22 l h of this flow represented fresh flue gas the remainder was recirculated gas 159 recycle ratio the gas recycling was employed to reduce gas consumption during pilot experiments which would otherwise consume dozens of compressed gas cylinders the recirculating system achieved co2 loadings relevant to lean and rich mea and pz solvents see below no2 is prone to absorption into the liquid solvents fine and rochelle 2014 and no can be oxidized by o2 to no2 particularly on the wetted surfaces within the absorber finlayson pitts et al 2003 therefore the nox composition in the combined fresh influent and recirculated gases contacting the absorber may differ from that in the fresh influent gas it is challenging to calculate or measure the actual no and no2 concentrations in the absorber and to evaluate their removal during each passage through the absorber however we expect significant depletion of no2 by absorption into the solvent while the no concentration should be less affected approximating the level applied in the fresh influent gas dai et al 2012 these expectations were consistent with our results in experiments 1 7 that nitrite accumulation rates were much more sensitive to the input of no2 than no regardless we could safely expect that the nox concentrations should be proportional to their dose rates from the stock gas cylinders so that the variations of the no and no2 dose rates could provide insights into the effects of varying their concentrations nonetheless the experimental plan encompassed high no2 concentrations in the fresh influent gas to approximate the no2 concentrations expected in the absorber influent if all of the no2 were absorbed during each pass through the absorber see below 2 3 test rig operation the experiments were designed to compare the rates of n nitrosamine accumulation under different flue gas composition and temperature conditions the experimental duration was selected to be 4 days as it enabled the accumulation of n nitrosamines at measurable concentrations and allowed systematic variation of experimental conditions over reasonable timescales without significant modifications to the solvent composition expected from solvent degradation over prolonged use test rig experiments commenced with only n2 and co2 in the flue gas for 12 24 h during which the temperature pressure and flowrates were closely monitored to ensure that they approached steady state throughout the experiments the rich and lean co2 loadings stabilized at 0 5 and 0 2 mol co2 mol mea respectively and at 0 98 and 0 71 mol co2 mol pz respectively the experimental time and monitoring of n nitrosamine and nitrite accumulation commenced upon the addition of o2 no and no2 to the influent synthetic flue gas liquid samples were collected from the rich amine flowing from the absorber and from the lean amine flowing from the desorber fig 1 the first 10 ml of each sample was discarded evaporation of the liquid over time was compensated by adding freshly prepared amine solvent twice per day and the total evaporative loss of the solvent volume during a typical 4 day experiment was 15 in a few experiments the desorber was initially maintained at the same 45 c temperature as the absorber but was then heated to 110 c partway through the experiment the temperature ramp and stabilization occurred within 30 min thorough rinsing and cleaning at least three times using deionized water were performed after each experiment 2 4 experimental conditions table 1 provides the concentrations of constituents tested in the influent flue gases some experiments were performed with the desorber temperature at the same 45 c temperature as the absorber to isolate the extent of n nitrosamine formation attributable to the absorber unit only desorber temperatures of 110 c and 130 c were evaluated as baseline and high temperature conditions although higher temperatures have been considered for some solvents e g 150 c for pz fine et al 2014 vevelstad et al 2013 2014 130 c was the upper limit for the test rig and could only be reached for a limited number of mea experiments before the seals burst experiments were conducted with o2 co2 ratios of 3 12 o2 and 4 co2 relevant to natural gas and 0 18 2 4 o2 and 13 5 co2 relevant to coal combustion table s1 versteeg et al 1996 nox concentrations varied across two orders of magnitude while the no concentration is expected to exceed that of no2 in authentic flue gases dai et al 2012 experiments with equal or higher no2 concentrations were conducted to indicate the importance of no2 moreover as mentioned previously significant absorption of no2 into the solvent is expected experiments involving high no2 concentrations e g experiments 6 7 14 and 15 in table 1 provide a conservative estimate of the potential importance of no2 absorption into the solvent for example the experiment involving simulated aged mea solvent applied 320 ppmv no2 and 18 ppmv no experiments 14 and 15 if all of the no2 were absorbed during each pass through the absorber unit the no2 concentration in the combined fresh influent and recirculated gas reaching the absorber would be 2 ppmv high no2 influent gas concentration experiments were limited due to the high cost associated with concentrated no2 gas cylinders to evaluate the extent to which prolonged autoclaving of absorber samples as a mimic of desorber treatment could predict the n nitrosamine formation occurring in the test rig where there is continuous cycling between the absorber and desorber units selected rich amine samples collected from the effluent of the absorber unit were immediately heated to 110 c in an autoclave for 3 h after the thermal treatment the sample vials were cooled immediately in a water bath total n nitrosamine concentrations were measured before and after the autoclave treatment 2 5 analyses nitrite was analyzed with the n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride colorimetric method clesceri et al 1998 co2 loadings of solvent amines were measured with a barium titration method weiland and trass 1969 because an array of poorly characterized n nitrosamines may form from the degradation products of primary amines einbu et al 2013 gouedard et al 2012 a total n nitrosamine tono analysis was used as the primary analytical method dai et al 2012 briefly after pretreatment with sulfamic acid to remove nitrite a sample was injected into a heated reaction chamber containing an acidic tri iodide solution which causes cleavage of the n no bond in n nitrosamines the liberated no is purged from the reaction chamber by n2 into a chemiluminescence detector ecophysics cld 88sp the total n nitrosamine concentration is quantified based upon the moles of no liberated using n nitrosodimethylamine ndma to develop a standard curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline conditions using fresh 5 m mea solvent duplicate experiments were conducted under the baseline conditions reflecting typical influent flue gas relevant to a natural gas fired power plant with nox reduction technologies absorber column at 45 c desorber column at 110 c 18 ppmv no 2 ppmv no2 and a o2 co2 ratio of 3 experiments 1a and 1b in table 1 nox free control experiments verified that the rig did not shed any nitrosamines or nitrite indicating that the rinsing protocol using di water between experiments was effective the accumulation rates of both nitrite and total n nitrosamines were linear over 4 d fig 2 a linear regression yielded nitrite 0 90 and 0 94 μm h and total n nitrosamine 0 055 and 0 059 μm h formation rates that were highly repeatable between the experimental duplicates table 1 the results of additional replicate experiments are provided in the supporting information table s2 there was no significant difference between the nitrite and total n nitrosamine concentrations fig 2a measured in the lean solvent sample port a in fig 1 or the rich solvent sample port b this similarity is reasonable because the time to complete a cycle through the absorber and desorber treatment units was 1 4 h compared with the 4 d timescale of each experiment this cycle time was short such that changes in concentrations during passage through a treatment unit would be minor relative to the cumulative concentrations 3 2 effect of desorber temperature on n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea based solvent while n nitrosamine formation in the absorber is driven by nox reactions with amines nitrite reactions with amines under high temperature conditions drive n nitrosamine formation in the desorber dai et al 2012 goldman et al 2013 dai and mitch 2014 yu et al 2017a b chen et al 2018 to isolate the contribution of the absorber to n nitrosamine formation within this continuously cycling pilot system the desorber temperature was set to 45 c the same temperature as the absorber effectively negating its contribution experiment 2 in table 1 and fig 2b compared to the baseline condition desorber at 110 c experiment 1 the nitrite accumulation rate was 50 higher indicating that the heated desorber was a sink for nitrite however the n nitrosamine accumulation rates were similar suggesting that nox reactions with amines in the absorber unit drives n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea one possible explanation for the consumption of nitrite within the heated desorber unit without a complementary increase in n nitrosamine accumulation is that nitrosation of mea occurs followed by rapid decay of the unstable primary n nitrosamines mirvish 1975 while this nitrosation would serve to promote mea degradation and nitrosatable secondary amines occur as degradation products of mea strazisar et al 2003 gouedard et al 2012 vevelstad et al 2014 einbu et al 2015 higher concentrations of secondary amine degradation products may be needed to observe significant formation of stable secondary n nitrosamines within the desorber experiments testing this hypothesis with either simulated aged mea solvent or the secondary amine pz are described below a complementary experiment started with the desorber at 45 c for the first 48 h and then the desorber was held at 110 c for the remainder of the experiment fig 3 a the n nitrosamine accumulation rate remained constant but the nitrite accumulation rate decreased when the desorber temperature increased consistent with experiments 1 and 2 fig 2a and b although there were previous bench scale experimental results using separate absorber column and autoclaving treatments that indicated that n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea was more significant in the absorber than in the desorber dai and mitch 2013 wang and mitch 2015 the current results verified this using experiments with interconnected absorber and desorber units when the desorber temperature was set at 130 c experiment 3 in table 1 fig 2c n nitrosamine accumulation rates from fresh mea solvent decreased two fold but there was no difference in nitrite accumulation rates this decrease concurs with a previous experiment conducted using another model of the same pilot rig where n nitrosamine accumulation from a mea based solvent decreased as the desorber temperature increased from 120 to 140 c einbu et al 2013 however in that study the two temperatures were investigated in sequence on the same solvent as part of a 14 week campaign with substantial mea degradation prior to the temperature increase which renders it difficult to isolate the effect of desorber temperature as indicated from experiments 1 and 2 n nitrosamine formation from nitrite mea reactions in the desorber was relatively unimportant for fresh mea solvent autoclave like experiments have demonstrated that thermal decomposition of n nitrosamines can be a possible sink for n nitrosamines at desorber relevant temperatures fowler and tobin 1954 tall and zeman 1985 fine et al 2014b the kinetics of n nitrosamine thermal decomposition were proposed to be first order with rate constants depending on n nitrosamine structure and temperature chandan et al 2013 fine et al 2014a voice et al 2015 the n nitrosamines formed from mea are a complex array of mostly unidentified molecules strazisar et al 2003 gouedard et al 2012 einbu et al 2013 vevelstad et al 2014 however fine et al 2014b reported that n nitroso 2 hydroxyethyl glycine and n nitrosodiethanolamine two representative n nitrosamines derived from mea could undergo thermal decomposition at temperatures above 120 c concurring with our results and those of a previous study einbu et al 2013 3 3 effects of nox composition and o2 co2 ratio for the fresh mea based solvent we had previously evaluated the effect of flue gas composition on n nitrosamine formation from morpholine a secondary amine similar in structure to piperazine dai and mitch 2014 while further validating the effects of desorber temperature we sought to characterize the effects of flue gas composition on n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea as a model primary amine similar to experiments 1 and 3 but at much higher nox concentrations 125 ppmv no and 125 ppmv no2 n nitrosamine accumulation rates dropped two fold with little difference in nitrite accumulation rates when the desorber temperature increased from 110 c to 130 c experiments 6 and 7 in table 1 based upon four different nox concentrations in the synthetic flue gas at a desorber temperature of 110 c experiments 1 4 6 the accumulation of n nitrosamines and nitrite from fresh mea solvent appeared to be simultaneously controlled by both no and no2 by comparing experiments 1 and 4 and experiments 5 and 6 sets which had the same total nox concentration the flue gas with the higher fraction of no2 consistently produced more n nitrosamines as well as nitrite those observations are consistent with our bench scale absorber only experiments conducted using morpholine a secondary amine that can directly form a stable n nitrosamine and by holding one nox species constant while varying the other dai and mitch 2014 in that previous study the n nitrosamine formation rates were linearly dependent on the individual no and no2 concentrations but much more sensitive to no2 than no dai and mitch 2014 the first order dependence of n nitrosamine formation with respect to both no and no2 served as the basis to infer that n2o3 formed by the reaction between no and no2 was the dominant nitrosating agent note that in experiment 4 which included 20 ppmv no but no no2 the nitrite accumulation rate 0 71 μm h was 77 of the value 0 92 μm h on average observed in the presence of both no and no2 experiment 1 these results suggest that no can be a significant source of nitrite accumulation presumably via no oxidation to no2 no2 absorption into the solvent and subsequent reactions involving hydrolysis of a n2o3 intermediate equation 3 previous molecular modeling and experimental validations also confirmed that no2 is not necessary for nitrosamine formation in co2 capture systems with the potential for direct nitrosation of amines by no shi et al 2017 supap et al 2017 experiment 5 had no and no2 concentrations that were both 12 5 fold higher than those in experiment 1 appling the rate law obtained from morpholine dai and mitch 2014 to mea in the present test rig experiments we would expect the n nitrosamine accumulation rate to be 156 fold higher in experiment 5 than experiment 1 however the n nitrosamine accumulation rate was only 8 fold higher consistent with a previous study using the same type of rig where increasing both no and no2 by a factor 10 only promoted n nitrosamine accumulation from mea by just less than 10 fold instead of 100 fold haugen et al 2012 einbu et al 2013 however in the previous study the nox concentration was changed as part of a 14 week campaign on the same solvent making it difficult to isolate the effects of nox from the accumulation of mea degradation products these results suggest a clear difference regarding the effect of nox on n nitrosamine accumulation from primary and secondary amines it is important to note that n nitrosamine formation from primary amines requires initial formation of secondary amine precursors for n nitrosamines by oxidative degradation of the primary amines fostås et al 2011 vevelstad et al 2013 thus while n2o3 likely remains the primary nitrosating agent in the absorber oxidative degradation of the primary amine may be rate limiting although a dependence on both no and no2 remain further studies that screen different combinations of no and no2 concentrations over wider ranges would be needed to better resolve the numerical relationship between n nitrosamine formation rates and nox composition for primary amines such as mea we evaluated o2 co2 ratios of 3 12 o2 and 4 co2 and 0 18 2 4 o2 and 13 5 co2 relevant to natural gas and coal combustion flue gases respectively the effect of desorber temperature on n nitrosamine and nitrite accumulation rates for experiments 8 10 and 11 conducted at the lower o2 co2 ratio were generally consistent with their counterparts at the higher o2 co2 ratio experiments 1 3 increasing the desorber temperature from 45 c to 110 c decreased the nitrite accumulation rate but did not affect the n nitrosamine accumulation rate validating the importance of the absorber unit for n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea increasing the desorber temperature to 130 c did not affect the nitrite accumulation but decreased the n nitrosamine accumulation rate by more than two fold suggesting the importance of thermal decomposition of n nitrosamines while the trends with respect to desorber temperature were the same for different o2 co2 ratios the lower ratio relevant to coal combustion consistently led to slower n nitrosamine accumulation than the natural gas counterpart comparing experiments 1 and 8 5 and 9 2 and 10 and 3 and 11 in table 1 the o2 co2 ratio was less important for nitrite accumulation rates although the accumulation rate decreased two fold for the lower o2 co2 ratio at the higher nox conditions experiments 5 and 9 although both experimental and computational evidence suggest that co2 could inhibit nitrosation in the absorber when carbamate formation protects the amine group versteeg et al 1996 kirsch et al 2000 the increase in flue gas co2 concentration from 4 0 natural gas to 13 5 coal did not affect the steady state co2 loadings for mea in the rig experiments higher co2 concentrations could also reduce n nitrosamine formation by increasing bicarbonate scavenging of n2o3 caulfield et al 1996 sun et al 2011 but n nitrosamine formation rates from morpholine within an absorber column were observed to be insensitive to this range of co2 concentrations dai and mitch 2014 these factors suggest that the lower n nitrosamine accumulation rate was attributable to the lower o2 concentration oxygen could promote nitrosation by transforming no to no2 possibly forming more nitrosating agents n2o3 goldstein and czapski 1996 kirsch et al 2000 and or enhance mea oxidative degradation possibly forming more nitrosatable precursors vevelstad et al 2013 fine et al 2014a indeed previous research demonstrated that the n nitrosamine formation rate depends on o2 concentration for fresh mea wang and mitch 2015 but not for morpholine dai and mitch 2014 the present results from the rig experiments were consistent with the interpretation that o2 promotes n nitrosamine formation from mea by accelerating amine degradation 3 4 importance of absorber vs desorber units for n nitrosamine formation from fresh piperazine using a 1 m pz solvent the desorber temperature was set at either 45 c or 110 c experiments 12 and 13 to isolate the importance of the absorber compared with fresh mea the n nitrosamine accumulation rates for pz were slightly higher when the desorber was set to 45 c considering that the mea concentration 5 m was five fold higher than the pz concentration 1 m these results concur with previous results indicating the significantly higher n nitrosamine formation potential for secondary amines under absorber conditions dai and mitch 2013 chandan et al 2013 wang and mitch 2015 n nitrosamine accumulation rates increased significantly at the higher desorber temperature more than 5 fold higher than for 5 m mea and there was a noticeable acceleration over time possibly due to the net accumulation of nitrite fig 2d while there was little change in nitrite accumulation rates for different desorber temperatures this rate was higher than for 5 m mea the higher nitrite accumulation rate may be associated with the lower pz concentration reducing the probability of pz reaction with nox in the absorber in favor of nitrite formation by hydrolysis of n2o3 these results were further validated with an experiment in which the desorber was set to 45 c for 48 h and then increased to 110 c for the remainder of the experiment fig 3b while the nitrite accumulation rate did not change the n nitrosamine accumulation rate increased rapidly and accelerated over time these results suggest that the desorber served as the primary source of n nitrosamine formation for pz attempts to operate the desorber at 130 c with 1 m pz failed due to the inability of the column seals to operate with this solvent under these conditions however previous research using autoclave like conditions indicated that n nitrosopiperazine undergoes thermal degradation at 120 c half life 1 5 days and degrades faster at higher temperatures half life 7 h at 150 c fine et al 2014b voice et al 2015 unlike mea n nitrosamine formation in the desorber is important for pz suggesting that higher desorber temperatures may increase n nitrosamine formation further research is needed at desorber temperatures of 120 150 c to characterize the balance between enhanced n nitrosopiperazine formation from nitrite and n nitrosopiperazine thermal degradation as a function of temperature 3 5 simulated aged mea solvent the contrast between the importance of the absorber unit for n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea fig 3a a primary amine and the desorber unit for n nitrosamine formation from fresh piperazine fig 3b a secondary amine suggested that the relative importance of the units may change as mea solvent accumulates secondary amine degradation products over time a synthetic aged mea solvent was concocted using 5 m mea spiked with 3 mm nitrite and 75 mm sarcosine 1 5 of the total amines as a model secondary amine these nitrite strazisar et al 2003 and secondary amine einbu et al 2013 concentrations approximate levels observed in previous long term pilot tests involving mea solvent oxidative degradation of mea produces a complex mixture of amine products saeed et al 2018 previous research demonstrated that nitrosamine formation from sarcosine was within a factor of five of that observed for other secondary amines e g diethanolamine and piperazine under both absorber and desorber relevant conditions dai and mitch 2013 to mimic nox conditions relevant to practice the influent flue gas contained 18 ppmv no and 320 ppmv no2 experiments 14 and 15 in table 1 after merging with the recirculated gas the elevated no2 concentration would yield 2 ppmv no2 if all of the no2 absorbed into the solvent with each passage through the absorber unit as discussed previously no is poorly soluble the desorber temperature was increased from 45 c to 110 c halfway through the experiment fig 4 with the high initial nitrite concentration the rate of increase in nitrite concentration was too small over the course of the experiment to be significant by linear regression and did not appear to change drastically with the change in desorber temperature when the desorber was set at 45 c to isolate n nitrosamine formation in the absorber unit the n nitrosamine accumulation rate 0 67 μm h was comparable to the rate observed with fresh mea in experiment 6 although the desorber was set to 110 c in experiment 6 n nitrosamine formation within the desorber was not important for fresh mea fig 3a experiments 6 and 15 are difficult to compare since the concentrations of no no2 and sarcosine differed but clearly no2 was an important contributor to n nitrosamine formation in the absorber after the desorber was heated to 110 c experiment 14 the rate of n nitrosamine accumulation increased by an order of magnitude for the aged mea solvent but did not change for the fresh mea solvent compare figs 3a and 4 suggesting that the desorber unit dominates n nitrosamine formation in the aged mea solvent with the amended 75 mm sarcosine not the 5 m mea serving as the predominant precursor the secondary amine degradation products forming from mea can vary with time and operating conditions gouedard et al 2012 but if sarcosine serves as a representative secondary amine product these results suggest that n nitrosamine formation should shift from the absorber to the desorber unit as mea degradation produces mm levels of secondary amines 3 6 test rig vs autoclave treatments one critical question is the extent to which the use of separate absorber and autoclave like desorber mimics characterizes n nitrosamine accumulation within more realistic interconnected absorber and desorber systems samples collected from the test rig partway through an experiment figs 3 and 4 were autoclaved for 3 h we compared the amounts of n nitrosamines produced during the autoclave treatment yellow diamonds in figs 3 and 4 with those formed during the continued operation of the test rig for this comparison the total n nitrosamines formed after the 3 h autoclave were plotted at 6 h after the samples were collected from the rig since the solvent spends roughly 50 of its time in the desorber unit within the rig and so 3 h of desorber treatment is equivalent to 6 h of continuous cycling moreover the total n nitrosamine concentration measured after the autoclave treatment was increased by the n nitrosamine formation expected to result from the 3 h of exposure in the absorber unit based on the linear formation rate observed when the desorber was at 45 c this increase was less than 10 of the total these total n nitrosamine levels were compared against the levels interpolated from the measurements collected from the rig figs 3 and 4 for fresh mea there was no significant difference between n nitrosamine formation in the test rig or after autoclave treatment fig 3a as expected since n nitrosamine formation associated with the desorber was of negligible importance for fresh mea for the secondary amine pz the autoclave treatment correctly indicated that the n nitrosamine concentration would increase but underestimated n nitrosamine concentrations relative to those observed in the rig fig 3b n nitrosamine concentrations increased from 4 μm to 5 μm 25 increase during autoclaving but would have increased to 9 μm 125 increase based on the trend observed within the test rig similar underestimation of n nitrosamine formation by autoclave treatments was seen in the experiment with simulated aged mea fig 4 although the cause is unclear changes in nitrite between the two systems likely can not explain this difference since the additional nitrite accumulation associated with the 3 h of additional nox absorption in the test rig would be minor compared to the levels already present in the solvent when the samples were taken we speculate that one other important difference between the two systems is the significantly higher interfacial surface areas between the gas and liquid phases in the test rig counter current system with raschig rings relative to the autoclave stagnant liquid in a vial with headspace although a mechanism is unclear one possibility is that gas phase species promote n nitrosamine formation in the desorber evaluating this is technically challenging due to the difficulty of promoting higher interfaces within the autoclave e g by purging a recirculated gas 4 conclusions this study is one of the first to systematically investigate n nitrosamine formation using interconnected absorber and desorber units encompassing a wide range of operational conditions our results indicate that n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea is dominated by reactions with nox in the absorber unit although nitrite is consumed within the desorber unit n nitrosamine formation within this unit was relatively unimportant for the secondary amine pz the n nitrosamine accumulation rate was higher despite the five fold lower amine concentration in the solvent moreover n nitrosamine accumulation was dominated by reactions with nitrite in the desorber unit accelerating over time together with the accumulation of nitrite in the solvent these results suggest that the nitrite consumption in the desorber unit observed with fresh mea solvent was associated with mea degradation perhaps via formation of unstable primary n nitrosamine intermediates when the mea solvent contained mm level accumulated nitrite and 1 5 sarcosine as a model for secondary amine degradation products that might accumulate as degradation products in aged mea solvent n nitrosamine accumulation rates increased and the dominant locus for n nitrosamine formation shifted to the desorber unit for mea operation of the desorber unit at 130 c reduced n nitrosamine accumulation rates by 50 concurring with other research indicating that operating the desorber unit at temperatures above 120 c may thermally degrade n nitrosamines einbu et al 2013 fine et al 2014b voice et al 2015 although we were unable to evaluate pz at that temperature the ability of this strategy to mitigate n nitrosamine accumulation should be further evaluated since higher desorber temperatures may also promote n nitrosopiperazine production from nitrite chandan et al 2013 fine et al 2014a the critical temperature required to facilitate net decomposition also has to be evaluated in the context of overall energy efficiency and amine stability lastly the prevalent practice of using separate absorber columns and autoclave like mimics for desorber units can indicate whether desorber units will promote n nitrosamine formation although with some underestimation certainly separate absorber unit and autoclave like mimics are simpler to operate and do not require an expensive pilot test rig additionally they can cleanly isolate effects associated with absorber and desorber units however it is also important to capture the magnitude

18257,the formation of carcinogenic n nitrosamines from reactions between solvent amines and flue gas nox is an important concern for the application of amine based processes to capture co2 post combustion using an advanced test rig with interconnected absorber and desorber units we evaluated the importance for n nitrosamine formation of the desorber relative to the absorber and any synergism between the two units variations in desorber temperature and in flue gas composition indicated that n nitrosamine formation from fresh monoethanolamine mea occurred predominantly in the absorber n nitrosamine formation was driven by high no2 and o2 flue gas concentrations although no also contributed in contrast n nitrosamine formation from piperazine pz was driven by reactions with nitrite in the heated desorber and accelerated concurrent with nitrite accumulation a complementary experiment simulating aged mea solvent high nitrite 1 5 sarcosine as a proxy of secondary amine degradation products suggested the desorber becomes an order of magnitude more important than the absorber for n nitrosamine formation for fresh mea solvent increasing the desorber temperature from 110 c to 130 c promoted thermal decomposition of n nitrosamines reducing n nitrosamine accumulation rates two fold compared to the test rig the prevailing practice of using separate absorber columns and autoclave like treatments to mimic desorber units predicted the direction but underestimated the magnitude of n nitrosamine formation because n nitrosamine accumulation rates are the net result of competing formation and thermal decomposition processes use of continuously cycling test rigs may be necessary to understand the impacts of different operating conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords

by the reaction of no with no2 is the dominant nitrosating agent within the absorber equation 2 dai and mitch 2014 n2o3 can either nitrosate amines or hydrolyze to produce nitrite equation 3 laboratory scale experiments using autoclave like systems to mimic the high temperature pressure and ph conditions of desorber units 110 150 c 2 bar ph 10 have indicated that these conditions can promote nitrosation of amines by nitrite goldman et al 2013 chandan et al 2013 fine et al 2014a potentially by n2o3 formed via the reverse of equation 3 or catalysis by formaldehyde keefer and roller

fine et al 2014a wang and mitch 2015 voice et al 2015 saeed et al 2018 on separate absorber columns and autoclave like mimics for desorber units results from the difficulty of constructing flow through desorber units due to their high temperature and pressure conditions however there are several reasons to suspect that the interplay between absorber and desorber units not captured by such laboratory scale systems may be important first it is unclear whether the high temperature and pressure conditions within desorber units promote amine degradation leading to amine based precursors that are easier to nitrosate within absorber units second nitrite produced in the absorber column can be consumed in the desorber columns via nitrosation of amines if this nitrosation results from reactions with n2o3 formed via nitrite the reverse of equation 3 n nitrosamine formation would be expected to be second order in nitrite mirvish 1975 however other research has indicated that nitrite associated n nitrosamine formation can be first order in nitrite when associated with formaldehyde keefer and roller 1973 another oxidative degradation product of amines such as mea chi and rochelle 2002 dai et al 2012 gouedard et al 2012 ge et al 2014 when laboratory scale evaluations autoclave samples retrieved after several passes through isolated absorber columns the nitrite accumulation likely is significantly faster than in pilot scale facilities encompassing inter connected absorber desorber systems where nitrite is consumed during each pass through the desorber units if n nitrosamine formation in the desorber is second order in nitrite the accumulation of nitrite in laboratory scale systems would have the effect of overemphasizing the importance of n nitrosamine formation within desorber units relative to that in absorber units finally the high temperature conditions in desorber units may mitigate n nitrosamine accumulation rates in solvents by promoting n nitrosamine decomposition voice et al 2015 tall and zeman 1985 fine et al 2014b an effect not captured in laboratory scale systems employing only absorber columns while pilot scale systems could fill this gap there are few of these units and they often are devoted to long term tests without systematic variation of operational parameters several laboratory scale experimental platforms mimicking absorber desorber cycling including the integrated solvent degradation apparatus isda and the mini plant have been employed to evaluate net n nitrosopiperazine formation from piperazine pz solvents spiked with nitrite voice et al 2015 saeed et al 2018 ali mazari et al 2019 when the desorber mimic within these systems was operated at 120 c high to near quantitative yields of n nitrosopiperazine from nitrite reactions were coupled with its first order decay half life 1 5 days in separate batch reactor studies of n nitrosopiperazine decomposition as a function of temperature the half life of n nitrosopiperazine decomposition dropped to 7 h at 150 c fine et al 2014b however these experiments did not apply nox to an absorber mimic to capture the interplay between these two units additional studies haugen et al 2012 einbu et al 2013 vevelstad et al 2017 used one of the five advanced test rigs designed by sintef norway incorporating inter connected continuously cycling absorber and desorber columns developed as part of the amine technology qualification program tqp amine under the co2 capture mongstad project ccm in norway de koeijer et al 2011 hamborg et al 2014 these studies using 5 m 30 by weight mea solvent were performed as a continuous 14 week campaign that was divided into four test conditions baseline desorber temperature at 120 c 12 o2 and 5 ppmv nox high o2 18 high desorber temperature 140 c and high nox 50 ppmv the overall degradation rate of mea did not vary significantly throughout the campaign n nitroso 2 hydroxylethyl glycine constituted 50 of the total n nitrosamines with most of the remainder uncharacterized increasing the desorber temperature from 120 c to 140 c reduced the level of total n nitrosamines by 50 indicating thermal degradation of n nitrosamines after 14 weeks of operation increasing nox concentrations did not increase total n nitrosamine concentrations suggesting that this concentration may reach steady state over long timescales the goal of this study was to further evaluate the importance of inter connected absorber and desorber units for n nitrosamine formation using another one of the five advanced test rigs developed under the ccm program our study focused on mea as the benchmark primary amine solvent in the industry with limited comparison to piperazine pz as an example secondary amine of interest as a solvent component bishnoi and rochelle 2000 rather than varying conditions with one solvent over prolonged periods we chose to use fresh solvent for each experiment to better control the composition of the solvent and thereby isolate the importance of reaction conditions from complications associated with solvent evolution however an experiment was conducted with a synthetic aged mea solvent consisting of fresh mea spiked with nitrite and a model secondary amine to mimic the effects of secondary amines expected to accumulate within mea over prolonged solvent usage the first objective was to assess the effect of flue gas conditions on n nitrosamine accumulation rates in fresh mea solvent and whether higher temperatures in desorber units could mitigate these n nitrosamine accumulation rates the second objective was to compare the relative importance of the absorber and desorber units for n nitrosamine formation with fresh mea and pz solvents and with a synthetic aged mea solvent the third objective was to evaluate the extent to which n nitrosamine formation differed between experiments conducted with conventional laboratory scale systems i e separate absorber column treatment followed by autoclave like treatment to mimic desorber column treatment and treatment conducted within the test rig incorporating continuous treatment by interconnected absorber and desorber columns 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals deionized water was used for all the experimental procedures including preparation of solvent solutions rinsing the test rig and processing of liquid samples solvent solutions included 5 m 30 by weight mea sigma aldrich 99 with 0 5 water and 10 mg kg fe and 1 m pz sigma aldrich reagentplus 99 with 1 water while the mea concentration was relevant to industrial operations reynolds et al 2012 de koeijer et al 2011 a lower pz concentration than that recommended by other authors goldman et al 2013 nielsen et al 2013 cousins et al 2015 was used due to concerns about the low solubility of pz at room temperature freeman et al 2010 resulting in clogging of the test rig haugen et al 2012 high purity solvents were used rather than industrial solvents to maximize control over the solvent composition the technical grade mea solvents used in industry may contain readily nitrosatable secondary amine impurities and secondary amines are expected to accumulate as products of oxidative degradation of mea strazisar et al 2003 fostås et al 2011 gouedard et al 2012 vevelstad et al 2013 an additional experiment employed a synthetic aged mea solvent consisting of 5 m mea spiked with 3 mm nitrite and 75 mm sarcosine sigma aldrich 98 a model secondary amine the nitrite concentration approximates the level observed in a previous pilot test involving a mea solvent strazisar et al 2003 the sarcosine concentration approximates the level of the secondary amine n 2 hydroxyethyl glycine measured as the major secondary amine degradation product to have

nitrite sigma aldrich acs reagent 97 were used as received 2 2 co2 capture test rig the test rig is a semi automated unit 1 4 m long 0 7 m wide 2 m high controlled by a computer using a labview national instrument tx interface via numerous temperature pressure flow and liquid level sensors photograph shown in figure s1 the total volume of amine solvent used in a typical experiment was approximately 5 l salient features of this complex unit are summarized in fig 1 briefly parts of the rig in contact with gases or liquids are constructed primarily of 316 grade stainless steel with minor use of teflon and glass the rig contains absorber and desorber columns 5 1 cm diameter 1 54 m high each filled to a depth of 30 cm and each operated in a countercurrent fashion with amine solvent flowing down and gases flowing up identical cushion columns were connected to the absorber and desorber columns by gravity flow a peristaltic pump recirculates the amine solvent through the absorber unit at 10 l h via a heated water bath to maintain the solvent at 45 c the synthetic flue gas was concocted by mixing n2 o2 co2 no2 and no using mass flow controllers heat tracing and a blower downstream of the gas mixing point pre heated the fresh and recirculated gases to 45 c another peristaltic pump at the bottom of the absorber column delivered the absorber solvent to the top of the desorber unit at 3 5 l h the desorber temperature was controlled by adjusting the duty of an electrical heater at its bottom the desorber pressure was automatically regulated at 2 5 bar by a pressure release valve at the top of the desorber column lean solvent was returned to the top of the absorber column by this column pressure by adjusting the flowrate of the peristaltic pump conveying rich solvent from the absorber to the desorber together with a valve controlling the flow of lean solvent back to the absorber column approximately equal volumes of solvent could be maintained in each column note that the pressure regulator at the top of the desorber unit prevented the release of most of the co2 liberated from the solvent in the desorber as this co2 and the lean solvent flowed back to the absorber unit it passed through a heat exchanger where heat was transferred to the rich solvent being pumped from the bottom of the absorber to the top of the desorber unit the cooling of the lean solvent contributed to the re absorption of co2 into the lean solvent the overall gas flowrate applied to the absorber column was 3500 l h a 260 1 v v gas to liquid ratio approaching those employed in practice fig 1 however only 0 37 l min 22 l h of this flow represented fresh flue gas the remainder was recirculated gas 159 recycle ratio the gas recycling was employed to reduce gas consumption during pilot experiments which would otherwise consume dozens of compressed gas cylinders the recirculating system achieved co2 loadings relevant to lean and rich mea and pz solvents see below no2 is prone to absorption into the liquid solvents fine and rochelle 2014 and no can be oxidized by o2 to no2 particularly on the wetted surfaces within the absorber finlayson pitts et al 2003 therefore the nox composition in the combined fresh influent and recirculated gases contacting the absorber may differ from that in the fresh influent gas it is challenging to calculate or measure the actual no and no2 concentrations in the absorber and to evaluate their removal during each passage through the absorber however we expect significant depletion of no2 by absorption into the solvent while the no concentration should be less affected approximating the level applied in the fresh influent gas dai et al 2012 these expectations were consistent with our results in experiments 1 7 that nitrite accumulation rates were much more sensitive to the input of no2 than no regardless we could safely expect that the nox concentrations should be proportional to their dose rates from the stock gas cylinders so that the variations of the no and no2 dose rates could provide insights into the effects of varying their concentrations nonetheless the experimental plan encompassed high no2 concentrations in the fresh influent gas to approximate the no2 concentrations expected in the absorber influent if all of the no2 were absorbed during each pass through the absorber see below 2 3 test rig operation the experiments were designed to compare the rates of n nitrosamine accumulation under different flue gas composition and temperature conditions the experimental duration was selected to be 4 days as it enabled the accumulation of n nitrosamines at measurable concentrations and allowed systematic variation of experimental conditions over reasonable timescales without significant modifications to the solvent composition expected from solvent degradation over prolonged use test rig experiments commenced with only n2 and co2 in the flue gas for 12 24 h during which the temperature pressure and flowrates were closely monitored to ensure that they approached steady state throughout the experiments the rich and lean co2 loadings stabilized at 0 5 and 0 2 mol co2 mol mea respectively and at 0 98 and 0 71 mol co2 mol pz respectively the experimental time and monitoring of n nitrosamine and nitrite accumulation commenced upon the addition of o2 no and no2 to the influent synthetic flue gas liquid samples were collected from the rich amine flowing from the absorber and from the lean amine flowing from the desorber fig 1 the first 10 ml of each sample was discarded evaporation of the liquid over time was compensated by adding freshly prepared amine solvent twice per day and the total evaporative loss of the solvent volume during a typical 4 day experiment was 15 in a few experiments the desorber was initially maintained at the same 45 c temperature as the absorber but was then heated to 110 c partway through the experiment the temperature ramp and stabilization occurred within 30 min thorough rinsing and cleaning at least three times using deionized water were performed after each experiment 2 4 experimental conditions table 1 provides the concentrations of constituents tested in the influent flue gases some experiments were performed with the desorber temperature at the same 45 c temperature as the absorber to isolate the extent of n nitrosamine formation attributable to the absorber unit only desorber temperatures of 110 c and 130 c were evaluated as baseline and high temperature conditions although higher temperatures have been considered for some solvents e g 150 c for pz fine et al 2014 vevelstad et al 2013 2014 130 c was the upper limit for the test rig and could only be reached for a limited number of mea experiments before the seals burst experiments were conducted with o2 co2 ratios of 3 12 o2 and 4 co2 relevant to natural gas and 0 18 2 4 o2 and 13 5 co2 relevant to coal combustion table s1 versteeg et al 1996 nox concentrations varied across two orders of magnitude while the no concentration is expected to exceed that of no2 in authentic flue gases dai et al 2012 experiments with equal or higher no2 concentrations were conducted to indicate the importance of no2 moreover as mentioned previously significant absorption of no2 into the solvent is expected experiments involving high no2 concentrations e g experiments 6 7 14 and 15 in table 1 provide a conservative estimate of the potential importance of no2 absorption into the solvent for example the experiment involving simulated aged mea solvent applied 320 ppmv no2 and 18 ppmv no experiments 14 and 15 if all of the no2 were absorbed during each pass through the absorber unit the no2 concentration in the combined fresh influent and recirculated gas reaching the absorber would be 2 ppmv high no2 influent gas concentration experiments were limited due to the high cost associated with concentrated no2 gas cylinders to evaluate the extent to which prolonged autoclaving of absorber samples as a mimic of desorber treatment could predict the n nitrosamine formation occurring in the test rig where there is continuous cycling between the absorber and desorber units selected rich amine samples collected from the effluent of the absorber unit were immediately heated to 110 c in an autoclave for 3 h after the thermal treatment the sample vials were cooled immediately in a water bath total n nitrosamine concentrations were measured before and after the autoclave treatment 2 5 analyses nitrite was analyzed with the n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride colorimetric method clesceri et al 1998 co2 loadings of solvent amines were measured with a barium titration method weiland and trass 1969 because an array of poorly characterized n nitrosamines may form from the degradation products of primary amines einbu et al 2013 gouedard et al 2012 a total n nitrosamine tono analysis was used as the primary analytical method dai et al 2012 briefly after pretreatment with sulfamic acid to remove nitrite a sample was injected into a heated reaction chamber containing an acidic tri iodide solution which causes cleavage of the n no bond in n nitrosamines the liberated no is purged from the reaction chamber by n2 into a chemiluminescence detector ecophysics cld 88sp the total n nitrosamine concentration is quantified based upon the moles of no liberated using n nitrosodimethylamine ndma to develop a standard curve 3 results and discussion 3 1 baseline conditions using fresh 5 m mea solvent duplicate experiments were conducted under the baseline conditions reflecting typical influent flue gas relevant to a natural gas fired power plant with nox reduction technologies absorber column at 45 c desorber column at 110 c 18 ppmv no 2 ppmv no2 and a o2 co2 ratio of 3 experiments 1a and 1b in table 1 nox free control experiments verified that the rig did not shed any nitrosamines or nitrite indicating that the rinsing protocol using di water between experiments was effective the accumulation rates of both nitrite and total n nitrosamines were linear over 4 d fig 2 a linear regression yielded nitrite 0 90 and 0 94 μm h and total n nitrosamine 0 055 and 0 059 μm h formation rates that were highly repeatable between the experimental duplicates table 1 the results of additional replicate experiments are provided in the supporting information table s2 there was no significant difference between the nitrite and total n nitrosamine concentrations fig 2a measured in the lean solvent sample port a in fig 1 or the rich solvent sample port b this similarity is reasonable because the time to complete a cycle through the absorber and desorber treatment units was 1 4 h compared with the 4 d timescale of each experiment this cycle time was short such that changes in concentrations during passage through a treatment unit would be minor relative to the cumulative concentrations 3 2 effect of desorber temperature on n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea based solvent while n nitrosamine formation in the absorber is driven by nox reactions with amines nitrite reactions with amines under high temperature conditions drive n nitrosamine formation in the desorber dai et al 2012 goldman et al 2013 dai and mitch 2014 yu et al 2017a b chen et al 2018 to isolate the contribution of the absorber to n nitrosamine formation within this continuously cycling pilot system the desorber temperature was set to 45 c the same temperature as the absorber effectively negating its contribution experiment 2 in table 1 and fig 2b compared to the baseline condition desorber at 110 c experiment 1 the nitrite accumulation rate was 50 higher indicating that the heated desorber was a sink for nitrite however the n nitrosamine accumulation rates were similar suggesting that nox reactions with amines in the absorber unit drives n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea one possible explanation for the consumption of nitrite within the heated desorber unit without a complementary increase in n nitrosamine accumulation is that nitrosation of mea occurs followed by rapid decay of the unstable primary n nitrosamines mirvish 1975 while this nitrosation would serve to promote mea degradation and nitrosatable secondary amines occur as degradation products of mea strazisar et al 2003 gouedard et al 2012 vevelstad et al 2014 einbu et al 2015 higher concentrations of secondary amine degradation products may be needed to observe significant formation of stable secondary n nitrosamines within the desorber experiments testing this hypothesis with either simulated aged mea solvent or the secondary amine pz are described below a complementary experiment started with the desorber at 45 c for the first 48 h and then the desorber was held at 110 c for the remainder of the experiment fig 3 a the n nitrosamine accumulation rate remained constant but the nitrite accumulation rate decreased when the desorber temperature increased consistent with experiments 1 and 2 fig 2a and b although there were previous bench scale experimental results using separate absorber column and autoclaving treatments that indicated that n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea was more significant in the absorber than in the desorber dai and mitch 2013 wang and mitch 2015 the current results verified this using experiments with interconnected absorber and desorber units when the desorber temperature was set at 130 c experiment 3 in table 1 fig 2c n nitrosamine accumulation rates from fresh mea solvent decreased two fold but there was no difference in nitrite accumulation rates this decrease concurs with a previous experiment conducted using another model of the same pilot rig where n nitrosamine accumulation from a mea based solvent decreased as the desorber temperature increased from 120 to 140 c einbu et al 2013 however in that study the two temperatures were investigated in sequence on the same solvent as part of a 14 week campaign with substantial mea degradation prior to the temperature increase which renders it difficult to isolate the effect of desorber temperature as indicated from experiments 1 and 2 n nitrosamine formation from nitrite mea reactions in the desorber was relatively unimportant for fresh mea solvent autoclave like experiments have demonstrated that thermal decomposition of n nitrosamines can be a possible sink for n nitrosamines at desorber relevant temperatures fowler and tobin 1954 tall and zeman 1985 fine et al 2014b the kinetics of n nitrosamine thermal decomposition were proposed to be first order with rate constants depending on n nitrosamine structure and temperature chandan et al 2013 fine et al 2014a voice et al 2015 the n nitrosamines formed from mea are a complex array of mostly unidentified molecules strazisar et al 2003 gouedard et al 2012 einbu et al 2013 vevelstad et al 2014 however fine et al 2014b reported that n nitroso 2 hydroxyethyl glycine and n nitrosodiethanolamine two representative n nitrosamines derived from mea could undergo thermal decomposition at temperatures above 120 c concurring with our results and those of a previous study einbu et al 2013 3 3 effects of nox composition and o2 co2 ratio for the fresh mea based solvent we had previously evaluated the effect of flue gas composition on n nitrosamine formation from morpholine a secondary amine similar in structure to piperazine dai and mitch 2014 while further validating the effects of desorber temperature we sought to characterize the effects of flue gas composition on n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea as a model primary amine similar to experiments 1 and 3 but at much higher nox concentrations 125 ppmv no and 125 ppmv no2 n nitrosamine accumulation rates dropped two fold with little difference in nitrite accumulation rates when the desorber temperature increased from 110 c to 130 c experiments 6 and 7 in table 1 based upon four different nox concentrations in the synthetic flue gas at a desorber temperature of 110 c experiments 1 4 6 the accumulation of n nitrosamines and nitrite from fresh mea solvent appeared to be simultaneously controlled by both no and no2 by comparing experiments 1 and 4 and experiments 5 and 6 sets which had the same total nox concentration the flue gas with the higher fraction of no2 consistently produced more n nitrosamines as well as nitrite those observations are consistent with our bench scale absorber only experiments conducted using morpholine a secondary amine that can directly form a stable n nitrosamine and by holding one nox species constant while varying the other dai and mitch 2014 in that previous study the n nitrosamine formation rates were linearly dependent on the individual no and no2 concentrations but much more sensitive to no2 than no dai and mitch 2014 the first order dependence of n nitrosamine formation with respect to both no and no2 served as the basis to infer that n2o3 formed by the reaction between no and no2 was the dominant nitrosating agent note that in experiment 4 which included 20 ppmv no but no no2 the nitrite accumulation rate 0 71 μm h was 77 of the value 0 92 μm h on average observed in the presence of both no and no2 experiment 1 these results suggest that no can be a significant source of nitrite accumulation presumably via no oxidation to no2 no2 absorption into the solvent and subsequent reactions involving hydrolysis of a n2o3 intermediate equation 3 previous molecular modeling and experimental validations also confirmed that no2 is not necessary for nitrosamine formation in co2 capture systems with the potential for direct nitrosation of amines by no shi et al 2017 supap et al 2017 experiment 5 had no and no2 concentrations that were both 12 5 fold higher than those in experiment 1 appling the rate law obtained from morpholine dai and mitch 2014 to mea in the present test rig experiments we would expect the n nitrosamine accumulation rate to be 156 fold higher in experiment 5 than experiment 1 however the n nitrosamine accumulation rate was only 8 fold higher consistent with a previous study using the same type of rig where increasing both no and no2 by a factor 10 only promoted n nitrosamine accumulation from mea by just less than 10 fold instead of 100 fold haugen et al 2012 einbu et al 2013 however in the previous study the nox concentration was changed as part of a 14 week campaign on the same solvent making it difficult to isolate the effects of nox from the accumulation of mea degradation products these results suggest a clear difference regarding the effect of nox on n nitrosamine accumulation from primary and secondary amines it is important to note that n nitrosamine formation from primary amines requires initial formation of secondary amine precursors for n nitrosamines by oxidative degradation of the primary amines fostås et al 2011 vevelstad et al 2013 thus while n2o3 likely remains the primary nitrosating agent in the absorber oxidative degradation of the primary amine may be rate limiting although a dependence on both no and no2 remain further studies that screen different combinations of no and no2 concentrations over wider ranges would be needed to better resolve the numerical relationship between n nitrosamine formation rates and nox composition for primary amines such as mea we evaluated o2 co2 ratios of 3 12 o2 and 4 co2 and 0 18 2 4 o2 and 13 5 co2 relevant to natural gas and coal combustion flue gases respectively the effect of desorber temperature on n nitrosamine and nitrite accumulation rates for experiments 8 10 and 11 conducted at the lower o2 co2 ratio were generally consistent with their counterparts at the higher o2 co2 ratio experiments 1 3 increasing the desorber temperature from 45 c to 110 c decreased the nitrite accumulation rate but did not affect the n nitrosamine accumulation rate validating the importance of the absorber unit for n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea increasing the desorber temperature to 130 c did not affect the nitrite accumulation but decreased the n nitrosamine accumulation rate by more than two fold suggesting the importance of thermal decomposition of n nitrosamines while the trends with respect to desorber temperature were the same for different o2 co2 ratios the lower ratio relevant to coal combustion consistently led to slower n nitrosamine accumulation than the natural gas counterpart comparing experiments 1 and 8 5 and 9 2 and 10 and 3 and 11 in table 1 the o2 co2 ratio was less important for nitrite accumulation rates although the accumulation rate decreased two fold for the lower o2 co2 ratio at the higher nox conditions experiments 5 and 9 although both experimental and computational evidence suggest that co2 could inhibit nitrosation in the absorber when carbamate formation protects the amine group versteeg et al 1996 kirsch et al 2000 the increase in flue gas co2 concentration from 4 0 natural gas to 13 5 coal did not affect the steady state co2 loadings for mea in the rig experiments higher co2 concentrations could also reduce n nitrosamine formation by increasing bicarbonate scavenging of n2o3 caulfield et al 1996 sun et al 2011 but n nitrosamine formation rates from morpholine within an absorber column were observed to be insensitive to this range of co2 concentrations dai and mitch 2014 these factors suggest that the lower n nitrosamine accumulation rate was attributable to the lower o2 concentration oxygen could promote nitrosation by transforming no to no2 possibly forming more nitrosating agents n2o3 goldstein and czapski 1996 kirsch et al 2000 and or enhance mea oxidative degradation possibly forming more nitrosatable precursors vevelstad et al 2013 fine et al 2014a indeed previous research demonstrated that the n nitrosamine formation rate depends on o2 concentration for fresh mea wang and mitch 2015 but not for morpholine dai and mitch 2014 the present results from the rig experiments were consistent with the interpretation that o2 promotes n nitrosamine formation from mea by accelerating amine degradation 3 4 importance of absorber vs desorber units for n nitrosamine formation from fresh piperazine using a 1 m pz solvent the desorber temperature was set at either 45 c or 110 c experiments 12 and 13 to isolate the importance of the absorber compared with fresh mea the n nitrosamine accumulation rates for pz were slightly higher when the desorber was set to 45 c considering that the mea concentration 5 m was five fold higher than the pz concentration 1 m these results concur with previous results indicating the significantly higher n nitrosamine formation potential for secondary amines under absorber conditions dai and mitch 2013 chandan et al 2013 wang and mitch 2015 n nitrosamine accumulation rates increased significantly at the higher desorber temperature more than 5 fold higher than for 5 m mea and there was a noticeable acceleration over time possibly due to the net accumulation of nitrite fig 2d while there was little change in nitrite accumulation rates for different desorber temperatures this rate was higher than for 5 m mea the higher nitrite accumulation rate may be associated with the lower pz concentration reducing the probability of pz reaction with nox in the absorber in favor of nitrite formation by hydrolysis of n2o3 these results were further validated with an experiment in which the desorber was set to 45 c for 48 h and then increased to 110 c for the remainder of the experiment fig 3b while the nitrite accumulation rate did not change the n nitrosamine accumulation rate increased rapidly and accelerated over time these results suggest that the desorber served as the primary source of n nitrosamine formation for pz attempts to operate the desorber at 130 c with 1 m pz failed due to the inability of the column seals to operate with this solvent under these conditions however previous research using autoclave like conditions indicated that n nitrosopiperazine undergoes thermal degradation at 120 c half life 1 5 days and degrades faster at higher temperatures half life 7 h at 150 c fine et al 2014b voice et al 2015 unlike mea n nitrosamine formation in the desorber is important for pz suggesting that higher desorber temperatures may increase n nitrosamine formation further research is needed at desorber temperatures of 120 150 c to characterize the balance between enhanced n nitrosopiperazine formation from nitrite and n nitrosopiperazine thermal degradation as a function of temperature 3 5 simulated aged mea solvent the contrast between the importance of the absorber unit for n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea fig 3a a primary amine and the desorber unit for n nitrosamine formation from fresh piperazine fig 3b a secondary amine suggested that the relative importance of the units may change as mea solvent accumulates secondary amine degradation products over time a synthetic aged mea solvent was concocted using 5 m mea spiked with 3 mm nitrite and 75 mm sarcosine 1 5 of the total amines as a model secondary amine these nitrite strazisar et al 2003 and secondary amine einbu et al 2013 concentrations approximate levels observed in previous long term pilot tests involving mea solvent oxidative degradation of mea produces a complex mixture of amine products saeed et al 2018 previous research demonstrated that nitrosamine formation from sarcosine was within a factor of five of that observed for other secondary amines e g diethanolamine and piperazine under both absorber and desorber relevant conditions dai and mitch 2013 to mimic nox conditions relevant to practice the influent flue gas contained 18 ppmv no and 320 ppmv no2 experiments 14 and 15 in table 1 after merging with the recirculated gas the elevated no2 concentration would yield 2 ppmv no2 if all of the no2 absorbed into the solvent with each passage through the absorber unit as discussed previously no is poorly soluble the desorber temperature was increased from 45 c to 110 c halfway through the experiment fig 4 with the high initial nitrite concentration the rate of increase in nitrite concentration was too small over the course of the experiment to be significant by linear regression and did not appear to change drastically with the change in desorber temperature when the desorber was set at 45 c to isolate n nitrosamine formation in the absorber unit the n nitrosamine accumulation rate 0 67 μm h was comparable to the rate observed with fresh mea in experiment 6 although the desorber was set to 110 c in experiment 6 n nitrosamine formation within the desorber was not important for fresh mea fig 3a experiments 6 and 15 are difficult to compare since the concentrations of no no2 and sarcosine differed but clearly no2 was an important contributor to n nitrosamine formation in the absorber after the desorber was heated to 110 c experiment 14 the rate of n nitrosamine accumulation increased by an order of magnitude for the aged mea solvent but did not change for the fresh mea solvent compare figs 3a and 4 suggesting that the desorber unit dominates n nitrosamine formation in the aged mea solvent with the amended 75 mm sarcosine not the 5 m mea serving as the predominant precursor the secondary amine degradation products forming from mea can vary with time and operating conditions gouedard et al 2012 but if sarcosine serves as a representative secondary amine product these results suggest that n nitrosamine formation should shift from the absorber to the desorber unit as mea degradation produces mm levels of secondary amines 3 6 test rig vs autoclave treatments one critical question is the extent to which the use of separate absorber and autoclave like desorber mimics characterizes n nitrosamine accumulation within more realistic interconnected absorber and desorber systems samples collected from the test rig partway through an experiment figs 3 and 4 were autoclaved for 3 h we compared the amounts of n nitrosamines produced during the autoclave treatment yellow diamonds in figs 3 and 4 with those formed during the continued operation of the test rig for this comparison the total n nitrosamines formed after the 3 h autoclave were plotted at 6 h after the samples were collected from the rig since the solvent spends roughly 50 of its time in the desorber unit within the rig and so 3 h of desorber treatment is equivalent to 6 h of continuous cycling moreover the total n nitrosamine concentration measured after the autoclave treatment was increased by the n nitrosamine formation expected to result from the 3 h of exposure in the absorber unit based on the linear formation rate observed when the desorber was at 45 c this increase was less than 10 of the total these total n nitrosamine levels were compared against the levels interpolated from the measurements collected from the rig figs 3 and 4 for fresh mea there was no significant difference between n nitrosamine formation in the test rig or after autoclave treatment fig 3a as expected since n nitrosamine formation associated with the desorber was of negligible importance for fresh mea for the secondary amine pz the autoclave treatment correctly indicated that the n nitrosamine concentration would increase but underestimated n nitrosamine concentrations relative to those observed in the rig fig 3b n nitrosamine concentrations increased from 4 μm to 5 μm 25 increase during autoclaving but would have increased to 9 μm 125 increase based on the trend observed within the test rig similar underestimation of n nitrosamine formation by autoclave treatments was seen in the experiment with simulated aged mea fig 4 although the cause is unclear changes in nitrite between the two systems likely can not explain this difference since the additional nitrite accumulation associated with the 3 h of additional nox absorption in the test rig would be minor compared to the levels already present in the solvent when the samples were taken we speculate that one other important difference between the two systems is the significantly higher interfacial surface areas between the gas and liquid phases in the test rig counter current system with raschig rings relative to the autoclave stagnant liquid in a vial with headspace although a mechanism is unclear one possibility is that gas phase species promote n nitrosamine formation in the desorber evaluating this is technically challenging due to the difficulty of promoting higher interfaces within the autoclave e g by purging a recirculated gas 4 conclusions this study is one of the first to systematically investigate n nitrosamine formation using interconnected absorber and desorber units encompassing a wide range of operational conditions our results indicate that n nitrosamine formation from fresh mea is dominated by reactions with nox in the absorber unit although nitrite is consumed within the desorber unit n nitrosamine formation within this unit was relatively unimportant for the secondary amine pz the n nitrosamine accumulation rate was higher despite the five fold lower amine concentration in the solvent moreover n nitrosamine accumulation was dominated by reactions with nitrite in the desorber unit accelerating over time together with the accumulation of nitrite in the solvent these results suggest that the nitrite consumption in the desorber unit observed with fresh mea solvent was associated with mea degradation perhaps via formation of unstable primary n nitrosamine intermediates when the mea solvent contained mm level accumulated nitrite and 1 5 sarcosine as a model for secondary amine degradation products that might accumulate as degradation products in aged mea solvent n nitrosamine accumulation rates increased and the dominant locus for n nitrosamine formation shifted to the desorber unit for mea operation of the desorber unit at 130 c reduced n nitrosamine accumulation rates by 50 concurring with other research indicating that operating the desorber unit at temperatures above 120 c may thermally degrade n nitrosamines einbu et al 2013 fine et al 2014b voice et al 2015 although we were unable to evaluate pz at that temperature the ability of this strategy to mitigate n nitrosamine accumulation should be further evaluated since higher desorber temperatures may also promote n nitrosopiperazine production from nitrite chandan et al 2013 fine et al 2014a the critical temperature required to facilitate net decomposition also has to be evaluated in the context of overall energy efficiency and amine stability lastly the prevalent practice of using separate absorber columns and autoclave like mimics for desorber units can indicate whether desorber units will promote n nitrosamine formation although with some underestimation certainly separate absorber unit and autoclave like mimics are simpler to operate and do not require an expensive pilot test rig additionally they can cleanly isolate effects associated with absorber and desorber units however it is also important to capture the magnitude of processes particularly when evaluating the net impacts of opposing processes e g n nitrosamine formation vs thermal degradation in the desorber declaration of competing interest the authors declare

this study characterized the effects of extreme weather events on dissolved organic matter dom washout from watershed soils and the corresponding contribution to disinfection by product dbp precursors under simulated weather conditions a laboratory simulation was performed to assess the effects of temperature drought rainfall intensity sea level rise and acid deposition on the amount of dom released from soil samples dbp formation potentials dbpfps were obtained to assess the effect of extreme weather events on dbp formation and drinking water quality the results demonstrated that the dissolved organic carbon doc and carbonaceous dbp levels increased with increasing temperature in a dry drought scenario regardless of the watershed from which a soil sample was obtained and the incubation temperature during rewetting or chlorination processes the doc and carbonaceous dbp levels also increased with increasing temperature brominated dbp formation was increased when bromide was present during the rewetting of soil indicating the effect of sea level rise when bromide was present during the chlorination of water for dbpfp tests only the level of brominated dbps increased acid deposition had various effects under different weather conditions the results of heavy rainfall simulations suggested that water quality deteriorates at the beginning of an extreme rainfall event abundant dom was washed out of soil leading to a peak in the dbpfp level the level of dom in seepage water was less than that of the surface runoff water during rainfall the situation was more severe when the rainfall came after a long drought and the drought rewetting cycle effect occurred graphical abstract soil samples were incubated at different ambient temperature dbpfp of the soil organic matter washed out increased with incubation temperature image 1 keywords climate change extreme weather events water quality disinfection by products 1 introduction the potential effect of climate change on water resources is a matter of concern because both the quantity and quality of water sources can deteriorate as a result of increased temperature and extreme weather events the increases in temperature and sea level rise over the past 20 years have been reported to be much greater than those over the last 100 years and extreme precipitation events are extremely likely to become more intense and frequent in the future ipcc 2014a b temperature is one of the most crucial climate related factors that can cause considerable changes in water quality using the most conservative model the increase in ambient temperature is likely to be 4 8 c from 2081 to 2100 ipcc 2014a b following the increase in ambient temperature water temperature will also increase especially at the surface komatsu et al 2007 predicted that the 10 year average surface water temperature in the 2090s may be 3 4 c higher than that in the 1990s increases in surface water temperature have been observed since the 1960s in europe north america and asia bates et al 2008 du et al 2019 numerous studies have also indicated that rising temperature is accompanied by increases in the amount of extractible nutrients and ph levels and a decrease in dissolved oxygen komatsu et al 2007 a ph increase might reflect lower co2 solubility under higher water temperature which also leads to a decrease in dissolved oxygen van vliet and zwolsman 2008 dissolved organic matter dom is a pervasive component of natural water most studies concerning dom discuss dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don the uk acid waters monitoring network reported that the concentration of doc in 2002 had increased by 91 on average evans et al 2005 studies have also reported that dom is a critical precursor of various disinfection by products dbps zhang et al 2012 uyak and toroz 2007 an increase in dom provides nutrients for microbes and thus results in high chlorine consumption in distribution systems higher disinfectant consumption may increase the concentrations of dbps with different toxicities or carcinogenetic potentials during water treatment processes alarcon herrera et al 1994 additionally increasing temperature is generally believed to be the cause of increases in doc in a climate change scenario evans et al 2005 by using a laboratory simulation tang et al 2013 discovered that doc concentration increases considerably under a 4 c temperature rising sequence more doc combined with increases in the amount of extractible nutrients provide cyanobacteria and other microbes in water with abundant nutrient sources leading to an increase in oxygen demand and subsequent dbp formation during water treatment fang et al 2010 liu et al 2018 higher temperatures favor cyanobacteria by directly affecting their growth rate and the dominance of cyanobacteria is increased by high nutrient concentrations and less vertical turbulent mixing of the water column hunter 2003 komatsu et al 2007 a detailed review concerning the potential effects of climate change on surface water and groundwater quality is provided elsewhere lipczynska kochany 2018 in addition effects of climate change and rising temperature on humic substances and the processes occurring in the fresh water systems were also addressed in this review variation of precipitation patterns is another vital concern associated with climate change two types of extreme weather events associated with precipitation typically occur drought and extremely heavy rainfall researchers have proposed some concerns regarding drought the most obvious being increasing temperature which leads to the many of the effects mentioned in the previous paragraph van vliet and zwolsman 2008 ahmadi et al 2019 other studies have suggested that drought may cause more severe problems because of the effects of drought rewetting cycles evans et al 2005 unlike drought the effects of extremely heavy rainfall remain uncertain hrdinka et al 2012 compared these two event types and demonstrated that extremely heavy rainfall has a stronger effect on water quality than drought even for only a short period during heavy rainfall dom concentrations are high because dom enters the water through vast alluvial washouts causing the deterioration of water quality the risk of waterborne and vector borne diseases may be increased if extreme rainfall events become more frequent and severe hunter 2003 severe rainfall events have a deleterious effect on raw water quality and further influence dbp formation during water treatment delpla and rodriguez 2016 in addition salerno et al 2018 reported that climate change combined with increasing urbanization can lead to severe worsening of river water quality the vulnerability of a river must thus be understood before adaptations can be made to counteract the effects of climate change bhurtun et al 2019 acid deposition and sea level rise affect the ph and bromide content of water respectively decreases in atmospherically anthropogenic acid deposition ion strength together with an increase in humic charge density have caused organic matter solubility to increase resulting in higher doc concentrations de wit et al 2007 monteith et al 2007 sea level rise causes bromide to invade raw water and the presence of bromide in water changes the formation characteristics and toxicities of dbps furthermore carcinogenic bromate forms after ozonation van vliet and zwolsman 2008 dbp formation after the completion of disinfection practices has been frequently discussed dbp levels have been demonstrated to increase with increases in temperature and dom concentration zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2005 richardson et al 2003 additionally when bromide is present in water br dbp species form and the toxicities of these br dbps are greater than those of carbonaceous dbps c dbps chlorine dose ph and contact time are among the potential drivers of change in dbps however most studies have only focused on the influence of climate change on basic water quality parameters i e dom and do or the relationship between dom and dbps delpla et al 2009 several studies have reported that doc and dbp formation potentials dbpfps increase only in the initial period because of the dilution effect resulting from an increase of water volume dbp concentration was found to decrease and remain at a low level during rainfall easthouse et al 1992 the objective of this study was to characterize the dom washout and dbp formation under simulated weather conditions that differed in terms of temperature sea level rise drought acid deposition and rainfall intensity rather than performing long term data analysis laboratory simulations were used to assess the potential effects of extreme weather events on dom washout from soils and the corresponding dbp formed 2 material and methods 2 1 soil sampling surface soil samples were collected from the upstream banks of three reservoirs in taiwan keelung pinglin and kinmen detailed descriptions of the sampling sites are provided in the supplemental information si all soil samples were transported to the laboratory in metal containers and stored at 4 c the moisture content of the samples was determined according to the weight loss after drying in an oven at 105 c for 48 h this treatment also ensured that biological activity in the soil was eliminated the samples were then sieved using a 2 mm sieve and subsequently stored in glass bottles in a 4 c refrigerator 2 2 laboratory simulation studies laboratory simulations were used to elucidate the possible effects of climate change on dom washout from soils and its contribution to the corresponding dbp precursors tang et al 2013 the climate related factors considered in the laboratory simulations were temperature sea level rise the drought wetting scenario and acid deposition five grams of dried soil samples were placed in 1 l glass bottles for incubation this was designated the dry scenario to compare this dry scenario with a drought rewetting cycle scenario 5 g of dried soil sample was added to 50 ml of reverse osmosis treated ro water for use as the wet scenario 5 g 50 ml the soil samples were then incubated at 25 c 45 c or 65 c for 7 days after incubation ro water was added to each bottle to rewet the samples and increase the total solution volume to 500 ml to determine the effects of acid deposition and sea level rise on upstream organic matter the ph of the samples was adjusted to 3 using 0 1 n sulfuric acid compared with ro water at ph 7 and some samples were spiked with 0 5 mg l bromide the rewetted samples were returned to the 25 c 45 c or 65 c incubators and then stirred at 135 rpm for 7 days to simulate the effect of rising temperature after rewetting the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride filters and the filtrates were stored at 4 c until analysis the flowchart of the laboratory simulation study is shown in the si 2 3 rainfall simulation to clarify the impact of extremely heavy rainfall events experiments were conducted using a rainfall simulator the simulator was constructed by fan and wu 1996 and was 3 9 m long 3 m wide and 2 4 3 44 m high veejet 80100 nozzles were employed to simulate rainfall and the pressure of the nozzles was 6 psi 0 4218 kg cm2 during the simulations by adjusting the height of the simulator the raindrop fall distance was set to 8 ft 2 44 m the initial raindrop fall velocity was calculated to be 6 247 m s the mean volumetric raindrop diameter was 2 26 mm the maximum volumetric raindrop diameter was 3 79 mm and the kinetic energy of each unit of rainfall was 793 ft ton acre in after calibration the spatial uniformity coefficient was calculated as 0

samples were sieved using a 2 mm sieve the rainfall intensity was set at 137 mm h for extremely heavy rainfall and 37 mm h for usual rainfall during the rainfall simulation experiments water samples

effect of temperature on soil dom washout dom was extracted washed out from soil by rewetting the soil samples with ro water at different incubation temperatures for 7 days after filtration the ph of the water samples ranged from 5 2 to 10 4 and the conductivity was between 18 3 and 255 μs cm compared with the amount of doc in the water extracted from the soil samples incubated at 25 c that extracted from the soil samples incubated at 65 c was much greater 3 8 vs 25 0 mg l fig 1 regardless of the watershed from which soil was obtained and the incubation temperature during rewetting or chlorination processes the doc and c dbpfp thm and haa levels increased with increasing incubation temperature fig 1a b 1c 2a and 2 b the c dbpfp level for a temperature of 65 c 858 2665 μg l was up to five times that obtained at 25 c 338 928 μg l several simulations were repeated and the results confirmed these observations by contrast don and nitrogenous dbpfps n dbpfps which include han and hk remained at lower levels fig 1d e 1f 2c and 2d one possible reason for this is that don in water sources usually originates from downstream domestic wastewater pollution because the don level was lower in the upstream water sources 0 0 0 9 mg l the n dbpfp levels 2 44 μg l were much lower than the c dbpfp levels temperature positively affects the rate of a chemical reaction the doc and c dbpfp levels were expected to increase with temperature and the result displayed in fig 2 is consistent with those reported in the literature evans et al 2005 tang et al 2013 in this study the difference between the temperatures used was relatively great to enable observation of the potential impact of global warming ipcc 2014a b in the most conservative scenario the highest soil temperature in a tropical area can be much higher than that in the conditions tested in this study however some other simulated experiments were also conducted at temperatures less than 35 c and no apparent changes were observed in the water quality parameters tested in this study data presented in sections c and g of the si a possible explanation for this finding is that the soil samples were obtained from subtropical regions and because temperatures higher than 35 c in summer are not unusual at this latitude the chemical reactions in the soil samples had already acclimated to a high environmental temperature another reason is that a temperature variation of 10 c is not a major difference for soil in a water environment because the specific heat of water is high 3 2 effect of sea level rise to determine the effect of sea level rise on water quality the soil samples were spiked with 0 5 mg l bromide during the rewetting process this simulated the condition that bromide could be absorbed onto or react with soil particles goldberg and kabengi 2010 after incubation the soil samples were treated with the same processes as described in section 3 1 fig 3 a and b reveal that the br thm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm and tribromomethane tbm levels increased when bromide was present during rewetting the br thm levels in the keelung sample were up to two times higher when the samples were spiked with bromide 456 vs 126 μg l for the pinglin sample the increase was 50 846 vs 567 μg l as a comparison when bromide was spiked during chlorination for dbpfp tests only some of the br dbps increased in amount and no differences were observed in the total amount of dbpfps fig 3c the soil samples collected from pinglin and keelung were tested in three simulations and the total amount of thms was consistently found to be higher when bromide was present during rewetting sea water has a fairly high concentration of bromide no matter how bromide enters a body of water either directly from the sea water or through anthropogenic pollution bromide can be expected to be possibly present in a watershed when bromide is present in a water source bromate is formed after ozonation however little information is available concerning the possible effects on the quality of treated water when the bromide concentration of watershed soil is high the results presented in fig 3 indicate that bromide might react with the surface functional groups in soils goldberg and kabengi 2010 but the mechanisms of this reaction remain unclear 3 3 effects of acid deposition and the wet dry scenario in this part of the simulation ro water with an adjusted ph of 3 was mixed with soil during the rewetting processes to simulate the effects of acid deposition because the soil samples had ph values and buffering capacities that were characteristic of their different chemical compositions the final ph values of the samples were not equal after incubation the ph values of the rewetted samples 5 9 7 3 were lower than the final ph values of the samples incubated without acidification 7 2 9 6 concerning the acidified and nonacidified sample pairs under the wet dry scenario fig 4 a and b the mean thmfp level increased by 235 when the ph was decreased in the dry scenario however the mean thmfp level decreased by 63 when the ph was decreased in the wet scenario similar results were obtained for the soil samples from pinglin and keelung see section f in the si the higher dbpfp levels for a lower ph in the dry scenario were probably attributable to the rewetting treatment of the dry scenario samples because the drought rewetting cycle effect occurred when water was added to the long dry soil the drought rewetting cycle effect occurs after a long drought and the organic matter that accumulates in soil can be washed out into water by heavy rain with a lower ph environment providing abundant chemical ions for extracting more organic matter from the soil evans et al 2005 however different chemical reactions occurred at lower ph conditions in the wet scenario the soil samples were submerged in water and the organic matter could be affected by the various surface charges on the surface of the soil the decrease of dbpfp levels may have been due to the different statuses of humic acid the details of which are provided as follows when soil samples contain sufficient moisture taking humic acid binding with carboxylic groups as an example when acid deposition occurred and the moisture content was high the binding sites remained those on carboxylic acid causing the charge density to decrease and the ion strength to increase de wit et al 2007 monteith et al 2007 by achieving a high degree of protonation of functional groups following a decrease in ph tipping and woof 1990 observed a 50 decrease in the amount of dom when the soil ph was reduced by 0 5 therefore extracting humic acid from soil with a low ph was difficult resulting in lower dom concentrations and less subsequent dbp formation a relevant study reported the effects of ph adjustment during the chlorination of water chang et al 2011 because thm precursors prefer to form thms at higher ph conditions the thmfp levels increased with increasing ph fig 4c and d however compared with the results obtained for ph adjustment during rewetting the variation of ph adjustment during chlorination was minor see sections d and e in the si 3 4 dom characteristics of organic soil from pinglin kinmen and keelung watersheds fig 5 presents the eem fluorescence spectra of the dom extracted from soil samples obtained at the watersheds of the three reservoirs areas iii and v in the spectra correspond to the spectra of fulvic and humic acid respectively chen et al 2003 these two categories of organic matter were the main organic substances producing dbps after chlorination as shown in fig 5 the dbpfp tests confirmed that the doc and dbpfp levels of the keelung samples thmfp 338 858 μg l haafp 451 2171 μg l were lower than those of the other two soil sources figs 1c and 5f moreover the soil obtained from the pinglin watershed was discovered to release large amounts of dbp precursors thmfp 471 1816 μg l haafp 793 2666 μg l figs 1b and 5b according to the results presented in previous sections the quality of water from the pinglin watershed was superior to that from the kinmen watershed surprisingly the pinglin soil could release as much dom as the kinmen soil thmfp 536 1830 μg l haafp 928 2445 μg l figs 1a and 5d one notable reason for this is that the average precipitation in pinglin is much higher than that in kinmen causing a strong dilution effect for the aqueous dom in the pinglin watershed additionally downstream from pinglin is the feitsui reservoir where water from upstream watersheds merges and most of the suspended solids are precipitated by contrast the kinmen watershed is subject to less yearly rainfall and more severe pollution removing or diluting the aqueous dom in its natural environment was more difficult for soil from the kinmen watershed and reservoir consequently the kinmen watershed and water treatment utilities are more vulnerable to climate change than the pinglin watershed 3 5 effects of different land uses on dom characteristics in accordance with the case study design soil samples were obtained from different locations along the jin sha stream in kinmen to elucidate the effects of land use on soil dom characteristics two streams merge into the jin sha stream see appendix figure a2 the dou men stream sampling sites g3 g2 g1 and guang cian stream g6 g5 g4 g1 g6 was the most upstream site of the stream g3 was a residential area and g1 was located at the confluence of the two streams the g2 g4 and g5 sites were located next to agricultural fields because of domestic wastewater pollution in the watershed the water washout from the g3 sample had the worst water quality according to dbpfp tests thmfp 1583 μg l haafp 1368 μg l fig 6 a and b the water quality was better at g2 thmfp 660 μg l haafp 424 μg l the main reason for this is that some pollutants were absorbed by soil particles when they came into contact with the soil the outcomes of this observation suggest that the properties of soil at g2 were influenced only by the environmental factors at g2 another reason is the dilution effect from the stream water as water flows downstream organic substances in the water might be diluted resulting in the stream side soil dom concentration being less than that at upstream sampling sites the results generally indicated that the dbpfp level was higher where the two streams merged at g1 however this was not observed for the dry scenario sample taken from the guang cian stream thmfp 1231 μg l haafp 703 μg l fig 6d more opportunities were available to wash out dom from the soil in the dry scenario than in the wet scenario fig 6c because of the effect of the drought rewetting cycle the results also indicated that the effects observed at g3 and g2 might also occur at g4 when agricultural pollution is severe thmfp 1471 μg l haafp 1682 μg l 3 6 simulation of soil dom washout with rainfall a rainfall simulator was used to assess the effect of heavy rainfall on dom washout from soil two rainfall intensities were employed 137 and 37 mm h the soil samples were dry before the simulation tests and it took 55 min for the rainfall to saturate the soil fig 7 adequate volumes of water were subsequently flushed out for normal rainfall 37 mm h the contact duration of rainfall and soil were similar in the runoff and seepage flow and no apparent difference was discerned regarding water quality characteristics the rainfall simulations demonstrated that the washout effects caused by normal rain 37 mm h were weak this is because the water quality remained constant during the rainfall event thmfp 221 μg l haafp 181 μg l on average by contrast heavy rainfall 137 mm h caused a peak in the deterioration of water quality at the beginning of the rainfall after 25 min of contact time for soil saturation a large amount of dom was washed out and the dbpfp levels increased thmfp 838 μg l haafp 762 μg l high water velocity has been suggested to potentially cause short contact duration between a soil matrix and water leading to less absorption of doc in the soil which thus induces an initial increase of doc in the water kalbitz et al 2000 however if the rainfall remains at a strong intensity the increasing water volume induces the dilution effect which moderates the degree of water quality deterioration during the rainfall event thmfp 198 μg l haafp 188 μg l the speciation distribution of dbpfps is provided in appendix g in addition to the laboratory simulation in this study on site sampling surveys were performed for which similar results were obtained easthouse et al 1992 also reported that the highest doc concentration occurred at the beginning of a storm event they also discovered a decreasing trend in doc level as the rainfall continued however these studies investigated only the variation in doc concentration and did not measure the corresponding dbpfps high temperature and drought are potential causes of increased dom accumulation in soil which could lead to a more considerable release of dom and subsequent increase in dbp formation at the beginning of heavy rainfall kalbitz et al 2000 the results of this study are in agreement with the predictions discussed by lipczynska kochany 2018 indeed the scientific climate change report in taiwan tccip 2011 indicated that if the annual number of rainy days daily rainfall 0 1 mm decreases then precipitation in taiwan will become concentrated into a few extreme rainfall events although the dilution effect might moderate the impact of heavy rainfall events the deterioration in water quality at the beginning of heavy rainfall is a concern especially when the rainfall occurs immediately after a severe drought 4 conclusions in this study several environmental factors induced by climate change were assessed for their effect on water quality the results demonstrated that increasing temperature causes increases in the amount of dom and corresponding dbpfps in organic soil when the sea level rise becomes severe bromide may interact with surface functional groups in soils and induce the formation of additional dbp precursors thus causing a potential increase in downstream br thmfp levels further studies are required to determine the role of bromide and its reaction mechanism with soils the results of this study reveal that increasing temperature and sea level rise may affect the release of organic matter from soil resulting in more severe deterioration of water quality acid deposition was discovered to have various effects under different weather conditions thmfp levels increased with decreased ph in the dry scenario but decreased with decreased ph in the wet scenario additionally the diversity of soil matrices from natural environments and land with different uses i e agriculture and domestic wastewater pollution may influence the characteristics of dom and subsequently formed dbps deterioration of water quality was discovered to be more severe at the beginning of an extreme rainfall event abundant dom was washed out from soil during heavy rainfall leading to a peak in the dom level and peak in the corresponding dbpfps for downstream water sources the situation is much worse when rainfall occurs after a long drought in combination with the drought rewetting cycle effect water quality variations related to climate change are dependent on the combinatory effect of all environmental factors elucidating the outcome induced by a single factor is impossible laboratory simulations are unable to elucidate combinatory effects but this study provides the first step toward understanding the specific relationship between each climate related factor and the characteristics of released dom and correspondingly formed dbps which are directly related to the quality of drinking water declaration of

18258,increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events i e floods and droughts combined with higher temperatures can threaten surface water quality and downstream drinking water production this study characterized the effects of extreme weather events on dissolved organic matter dom washout from watershed soils and the corresponding contribution to disinfection by product dbp precursors under simulated weather conditions a laboratory simulation was performed to assess the effects of temperature drought rainfall intensity sea level rise and acid deposition on the amount of dom released from soil samples dbp formation potentials dbpfps were obtained to assess the effect of extreme weather events on dbp formation and drinking water quality the results demonstrated that the dissolved organic carbon doc and carbonaceous dbp levels increased with increasing temperature in a dry drought scenario regardless of the watershed from which a soil sample was obtained and the incubation temperature during rewetting or chlorination processes the doc and carbonaceous dbp levels also increased with increasing temperature brominated dbp formation was increased when bromide was present during the rewetting of soil indicating the effect of sea level rise when bromide was present during the chlorination of water for dbpfp tests only the level of brominated dbps increased acid deposition had various effects under different weather conditions the results of heavy rainfall simulations suggested that water quality deteriorates at the beginning of an extreme rainfall event abundant dom was washed out of soil leading to a peak in the dbpfp level the level of dom in seepage water was less than that of the surface runoff water during rainfall the situation was more severe when the rainfall came after a long drought and the drought rewetting cycle effect occurred graphical abstract soil samples were incubated at different ambient temperature dbpfp of the soil organic matter washed out increased with incubation temperature image 1 keywords climate change extreme weather events water quality disinfection by products 1 introduction the potential effect of climate change on water resources is a matter of concern because both the quantity and quality of water sources can deteriorate as a result of increased temperature and extreme weather events the increases in temperature and sea level rise over the past 20 years have been reported to be much greater than those over the last 100 years and extreme precipitation events are extremely likely to become more intense and frequent in the future ipcc 2014a b temperature is one of the most crucial climate related factors that can cause considerable changes in water quality using the most conservative model the increase in ambient temperature is likely to be 4 8 c from 2081 to 2100 ipcc 2014a b following the increase in ambient temperature water temperature will also increase especially at the surface komatsu et al 2007 predicted that the 10 year average surface water temperature in the 2090s may be 3 4 c higher than that in the 1990s increases in surface water temperature have been observed since the 1960s in europe north america and asia bates et al 2008 du et al 2019 numerous studies have also indicated that rising temperature is accompanied by increases in the amount of extractible nutrients and ph levels and a decrease in dissolved oxygen komatsu et al 2007 a ph increase might reflect lower co2 solubility under higher water temperature which also leads to a decrease in dissolved oxygen van vliet and zwolsman 2008 dissolved organic matter dom is a pervasive component of natural water most studies concerning dom discuss dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved organic nitrogen don the uk acid waters monitoring network reported that the concentration of doc in 2002 had increased by 91 on average evans et al 2005 studies have also reported that dom is a critical precursor of various disinfection by products dbps zhang et al 2012 uyak and toroz 2007 an increase in dom provides nutrients for microbes and thus results in high chlorine consumption in distribution systems higher disinfectant consumption may increase the concentrations of dbps with different toxicities or carcinogenetic potentials during water treatment processes alarcon herrera et al 1994 additionally increasing temperature is generally believed to be the cause of increases in doc in a climate change scenario evans et al 2005 by using a laboratory simulation tang et al 2013 discovered that doc concentration increases considerably under a 4 c temperature rising sequence more doc combined with increases in the amount of extractible nutrients provide cyanobacteria and other microbes in water with abundant nutrient sources leading to an increase in oxygen demand and subsequent dbp formation during water treatment fang et al 2010 liu et al 2018 higher temperatures favor cyanobacteria by directly affecting their growth rate and the dominance of cyanobacteria is increased by high nutrient concentrations and less vertical turbulent mixing of the water column hunter 2003 komatsu et al 2007 a detailed review concerning the potential effects of climate change on surface water and groundwater quality is provided elsewhere lipczynska kochany 2018 in addition effects of climate change and rising temperature on humic substances and the processes occurring in the fresh water systems were also addressed in this review variation of precipitation patterns is another vital concern associated with climate change two types of extreme weather events associated with precipitation typically occur drought and extremely heavy rainfall researchers have proposed some concerns regarding drought the most obvious being increasing temperature which leads to the many of the effects mentioned in the previous paragraph van vliet and zwolsman 2008 ahmadi et al 2019 other studies have suggested that drought may cause more severe problems because of the effects of drought rewetting cycles evans et al 2005 unlike drought the effects of extremely heavy rainfall remain uncertain hrdinka et al 2012 compared these two event types and demonstrated that extremely heavy rainfall has a stronger effect on water quality than drought even for only a short period during heavy rainfall dom concentrations are high because dom enters the water through vast alluvial washouts causing the deterioration of water quality the risk of waterborne and vector borne diseases may be increased if extreme rainfall events become more frequent and severe hunter 2003 severe rainfall events have a deleterious effect on raw water quality and further influence dbp formation during water treatment delpla and rodriguez 2016 in addition salerno et al 2018 reported that climate change combined with increasing urbanization can lead to severe worsening of river water quality the vulnerability of a river must thus be understood before adaptations can be made to counteract the effects of climate change bhurtun et al 2019 acid deposition and sea level rise affect the ph and bromide content of water respectively decreases in atmospherically anthropogenic acid deposition ion strength together with an increase in humic charge density have caused organic matter solubility to increase resulting in higher doc concentrations de wit et al 2007 monteith et al 2007 sea level rise causes bromide to invade raw water and the presence of bromide in water changes the formation characteristics and toxicities of dbps furthermore carcinogenic bromate forms after ozonation van vliet and zwolsman 2008 dbp formation after the completion of disinfection practices has been frequently discussed dbp levels have been demonstrated to increase with increases in temperature and dom concentration zhang et al 2014 zhang et al 2005 richardson et al 2003 additionally when bromide is present in water br dbp species form and the toxicities of these br dbps are greater than those of carbonaceous dbps c dbps chlorine dose ph and contact time are among the potential drivers of change in dbps however most studies have only focused on the influence of climate change on basic water quality parameters i e dom and do or the relationship between dom and dbps delpla et al 2009 several studies have reported that doc and dbp formation potentials dbpfps increase only in the initial period because of the dilution effect resulting from an increase of water volume dbp concentration was found to decrease and remain at a low level during rainfall easthouse et al 1992 the objective of this study was to characterize the dom washout and dbp formation under simulated weather conditions that differed in terms of temperature sea level rise drought acid deposition and rainfall intensity rather than performing long term data analysis laboratory simulations were used to assess the potential effects of extreme weather events on dom washout from soils and the corresponding dbp formed 2 material and methods 2 1 soil sampling surface soil samples were collected from the upstream banks of three reservoirs in taiwan keelung pinglin and kinmen detailed descriptions of the sampling sites are provided in the supplemental information si all soil samples were transported to the laboratory in metal containers and stored at 4 c the moisture content of the samples was determined according to the weight loss after drying in an oven at 105 c for 48 h this treatment also ensured that biological activity in the soil was eliminated the samples were then sieved using a 2 mm sieve and subsequently stored in glass bottles in a 4 c refrigerator 2 2 laboratory simulation studies laboratory simulations were used to elucidate the possible effects of climate change on dom washout from soils and its contribution to the corresponding dbp precursors tang et al 2013 the climate related factors considered in the laboratory simulations were temperature sea level rise the drought wetting scenario and acid deposition five grams of dried soil samples were placed in 1 l glass bottles for incubation this was designated the dry scenario to compare this dry scenario with a drought rewetting cycle scenario 5 g of dried soil sample was added to 50 ml of reverse osmosis treated ro water for use as the wet scenario 5 g 50 ml the soil samples were then incubated at 25 c 45 c or 65 c for 7 days after incubation ro water was added to each bottle to rewet the samples and increase the total solution volume to 500 ml to determine the effects of acid deposition and sea level rise on upstream organic matter the ph of the samples was adjusted to 3 using 0 1 n sulfuric acid compared with ro water at ph 7 and some samples were spiked with 0 5 mg l bromide the rewetted samples were returned to the 25 c 45 c or 65 c incubators and then stirred at 135 rpm for 7 days to simulate the effect of rising

tropical area can be much higher than that in the conditions tested in this study however some other simulated experiments were also conducted at temperatures less than 35 c and no apparent changes

only some of the br dbps increased in amount and no differences were observed in the total amount of dbpfps fig 3c the soil samples collected from pinglin and keelung were tested in three simulations and the total amount of thms was consistently found to be higher when bromide was present during rewetting sea water has a fairly high concentration of bromide no matter how bromide enters a body of water either directly from the sea water or through anthropogenic pollution bromide can be expected to be possibly present in a watershed when bromide is present in a water source bromate is formed after ozonation however little information is available concerning the possible effects on the quality of treated water when the bromide concentration of watershed soil is high the results presented in fig 3 indicate that bromide might react with the surface functional groups in soils goldberg and kabengi 2010 but the mechanisms of this reaction remain unclear 3 3 effects of acid deposition and the wet dry scenario in this part of the simulation ro water with an adjusted ph of 3 was mixed with soil during the rewetting processes to simulate the effects of acid deposition because the soil samples had ph values and buffering capacities that were characteristic of their different chemical compositions the final ph values of the samples were not equal after incubation the ph values of the rewetted samples 5 9 7 3 were lower than the final ph values of the samples incubated without acidification 7 2 9 6 concerning the acidified and nonacidified sample pairs under the wet dry scenario fig 4 a and b the mean thmfp level increased by 235 when the ph was decreased in the dry scenario however the mean thmfp level decreased by 63 when the ph was decreased in the wet scenario similar results were obtained for the soil samples from pinglin and keelung see section f in the si the higher dbpfp levels for a lower ph in the dry scenario were probably attributable to the rewetting treatment of the dry scenario samples because the drought rewetting cycle effect occurred when water was added to the long dry soil the drought rewetting cycle effect occurs after a long drought and the organic matter that accumulates in soil can be washed out into water by heavy rain with a lower ph environment providing abundant chemical ions for extracting more organic matter from the soil evans et al 2005 however different chemical reactions occurred at lower ph conditions in the wet scenario the soil samples were submerged in water and the organic matter could be affected by the various surface charges on the surface of the soil the decrease of dbpfp levels may have been due to the different statuses of humic acid the details of which are provided as follows when soil samples contain sufficient moisture taking humic acid binding with carboxylic groups as an example when acid deposition occurred and the moisture content was high the binding sites remained those on carboxylic acid causing the charge density to decrease and the ion strength to increase de wit et al 2007 monteith et al 2007 by achieving a high degree of protonation of functional groups following a decrease in ph tipping and woof 1990 observed a 50 decrease in the amount of dom when the soil ph was reduced by 0 5 therefore extracting humic acid from soil with a low ph was difficult resulting in lower dom concentrations and less subsequent dbp formation a relevant study reported the effects of ph adjustment during the chlorination of water chang et al 2011 because thm precursors prefer to form thms at higher ph conditions the thmfp levels increased with increasing ph fig 4c and d however compared with the results obtained for ph adjustment during rewetting the variation of ph adjustment during chlorination was minor see sections d and e in the si 3 4 dom characteristics of organic soil from pinglin kinmen and keelung watersheds fig 5 presents the eem fluorescence spectra of the dom extracted from soil samples obtained at the watersheds of the three reservoirs areas iii and v in the spectra correspond to the spectra of fulvic and humic acid respectively chen et al 2003 these two categories of organic matter were the main organic substances producing dbps after chlorination as shown in fig 5 the dbpfp tests confirmed that the doc and dbpfp levels of the keelung samples thmfp 338 858 μg l haafp 451 2171 μg l were lower than those of the other two soil sources figs 1c and 5f moreover the soil obtained from the pinglin watershed was discovered to release large amounts of dbp precursors thmfp 471 1816 μg l haafp 793 2666 μg l figs 1b and 5b according to the results presented in previous sections the quality of water from the pinglin watershed was superior to that from the kinmen watershed surprisingly the pinglin soil could release as much dom as the kinmen soil thmfp 536 1830 μg l haafp 928 2445 μg l figs 1a and 5d one notable reason for this is that the average precipitation in pinglin is much higher than that in kinmen causing a strong dilution effect for the aqueous dom in the pinglin watershed additionally downstream from pinglin is the feitsui reservoir where water from upstream watersheds merges and most of the suspended solids are precipitated by contrast the kinmen watershed is subject to less yearly rainfall and more severe pollution removing or diluting the aqueous dom in its natural environment was more difficult for soil from the kinmen watershed and reservoir consequently the kinmen watershed and water treatment utilities are more vulnerable to climate change than the pinglin watershed 3 5 effects of different land uses on dom characteristics in accordance with the case study design soil samples were obtained from different locations along the jin sha stream in kinmen to elucidate the effects of land use on soil dom characteristics two streams merge into the jin sha stream see appendix figure a2 the dou men stream sampling sites g3 g2 g1 and guang cian stream g6 g5 g4 g1 g6 was the most upstream site of the stream g3 was a residential area and g1 was located at the confluence of the two streams the g2 g4 and g5 sites were located next to agricultural fields because of domestic wastewater pollution in the watershed the water washout from the g3 sample had the worst water quality according to dbpfp tests thmfp 1583 μg l haafp 1368 μg l fig 6 a and b the water quality was better at g2 thmfp 660 μg l haafp 424 μg l the main reason for this is that some pollutants were absorbed by soil particles when they came into contact with the soil the outcomes of this observation suggest that the properties of soil at g2 were influenced only by the environmental factors at g2 another reason is the dilution effect from the stream water as water flows downstream organic substances in the water might be diluted resulting in the stream side soil dom concentration being less than that at upstream sampling sites the results generally indicated that the dbpfp level was higher where the two streams merged at g1 however this was not observed for the dry scenario sample taken from the guang cian stream thmfp 1231 μg l haafp 703 μg l fig 6d more opportunities were available to wash out dom from the soil in the dry scenario than in the wet scenario fig 6c because of the effect of the drought rewetting cycle the results also indicated that the effects observed at g3 and g2 might also occur at g4 when agricultural pollution is severe thmfp 1471 μg l haafp 1682 μg l 3 6 simulation of soil dom washout with rainfall a rainfall simulator was used to assess the effect of heavy rainfall on dom washout from soil two rainfall intensities were employed 137 and 37 mm h the soil samples were dry before the simulation tests and it took 55 min for the rainfall to saturate the soil fig 7 adequate volumes of water were subsequently flushed out for normal rainfall 37 mm h the contact duration of rainfall and soil were similar in the runoff and seepage flow and no apparent difference was discerned regarding water quality characteristics the rainfall simulations demonstrated that the washout effects caused by normal rain 37 mm h were weak this is because the water quality remained constant during the rainfall event thmfp 221 μg l haafp 181 μg l on average by contrast heavy rainfall 137 mm h caused a peak in the deterioration of water quality at the beginning of the rainfall after 25 min of contact time for soil saturation a large amount of dom was washed out and the dbpfp levels increased thmfp 838 μg l haafp 762 μg l high water velocity has been suggested to potentially cause short contact duration between a soil matrix and water leading to less absorption of doc in the soil which thus induces an initial increase of doc in the water kalbitz et al 2000 however if the rainfall remains at a strong intensity the increasing water volume induces the dilution effect which moderates the degree of water quality deterioration during the rainfall event thmfp 198 μg l haafp 188 μg l the speciation distribution of dbpfps is provided in appendix g in addition to the laboratory simulation in this study on site sampling surveys were performed for which similar results were obtained easthouse et al 1992 also reported that the highest doc concentration occurred at the beginning of a storm event they also discovered a decreasing trend in doc level as the rainfall continued however these studies investigated only the variation in doc concentration and did not measure the corresponding dbpfps high temperature and drought are potential causes of increased dom accumulation in soil which could lead to a more considerable release of dom and subsequent increase in dbp formation at the beginning of heavy rainfall kalbitz et al 2000 the results of this study are in agreement with the predictions discussed by lipczynska kochany 2018 indeed the scientific climate change report in taiwan tccip 2011 indicated that if the annual number of rainy days daily rainfall 0 1 mm decreases then precipitation in taiwan will become concentrated into a few extreme rainfall events although the dilution effect might moderate the impact of heavy rainfall events the deterioration in water quality at the beginning of heavy rainfall is a concern especially when the rainfall occurs immediately after a severe drought 4 conclusions in this study several environmental factors induced by climate change were assessed for their effect on water quality the results demonstrated that increasing temperature causes increases in the amount of dom and corresponding dbpfps in organic soil when the sea level rise becomes severe bromide may interact with surface functional groups in soils and induce the formation of additional dbp precursors thus causing a potential increase in downstream br thmfp levels further studies are required to determine the role of bromide and its reaction mechanism with soils the results of this study reveal that increasing temperature and sea level rise may affect the release of organic matter from soil resulting in more severe deterioration of water quality acid deposition was discovered to have various effects under different weather conditions thmfp levels increased with decreased ph in the dry scenario but decreased with decreased ph in the wet scenario additionally the diversity of soil matrices from natural environments and land with different uses i e agriculture and domestic wastewater pollution may influence the characteristics of dom and subsequently formed dbps deterioration of water quality was discovered to be more severe at the beginning of an extreme rainfall event abundant dom was washed out from soil during heavy rainfall leading to a peak in the dom level and peak in the corresponding dbpfps for downstream water sources the situation is much worse when rainfall occurs after a long drought in combination with the drought rewetting cycle effect water quality variations related to climate change are dependent on the combinatory effect of all environmental factors elucidating the outcome induced by a single factor is impossible laboratory simulations are unable to elucidate combinatory effects but this study provides the first step toward understanding the specific relationship between each climate related factor and the characteristics of released dom and correspondingly formed dbps which are directly related to the quality of drinking water declaration of

18259,coastal aquifers provide an important source of water globally understanding how groundwater responds to changes in rainfall recharge is important for sustainable development to this end we investigate how water isotopes 18o 2h 3h and chloride cl concentrations within an island freshwater lens respond under varying rainfall conditions in a region experiencing climate change uniquely this study presents a three year dataset of groundwater collected seasonally between may 2013 and august 2016 from ten wells variation in all tracers was observed the cl and tritium 3h show opposing seasonal variation in some sections of the lens with higher cl observed in the austral summer when less rainfall occurs and evapotranspiration is highest the opposite occurs in the austral winter months when 3h increases from atmospheric input via rainfall recharge and cl is diluted an overall decline in 3h values and enrichment in stable water isotopes over the study period was also observed this study shows that understanding groundwater of freshwater lenses should not rely on a single sampling campaign because seasonal variability is large the identification of a dual recharge regime with contributions from both winter rainfall and episodic events has important implications for understanding the future fate of the freshwater lens on rottnest island the finding that episodic rainfall is a major contributor to groundwater recharge is important and can only be assessed with a multi year isotope dataset for groundwater and rainfall graphical abstract image 1 keywords island freshwater lens water isotopes seawater intrusion mean groundwater residence time 1 introduction coastal aquifers provide a source of water for more than one billion people small and nicholls 2003 and are under increasing strain due to rapid population growth in coastal areas globally these aquifers come with various challenges when utilised as a potable water source including seawater intrusion caused by both natural and anthropogenic causes kinzelbach et al 2003 post 2005 barlow and reichard 2010 jiao and post 2019 while groundwater abstraction is one of the leading causes of seawater intrusion the impacts of climate change on coastal aquifers is also of concern ferguson and gleeson 2012 global sea level rise slr promotes seawater intrusion nicholls et al 2007 but perhaps more importantly a decline in recharge in areas of reduced rainfall leads to a subsequent decrease in the volume of freshwater available for utilisation white and falkland 2010 these issues can be intensified on islands where fresh groundwater is usually present in the form of a shallow lens floating on more saline water below due to the density difference these lenses are particularly vulnerable to climate variability as their very existence relies on rainfall recharge white and falkland 2010 understanding how rainfall recharges freshwater lenses and determining the residence time of groundwater are therefore particularly important tritium 3h and helium have been previously used typically based on the vogel 1967 method to estimate recharge to freshwater lenses houben et al 2014 röper et al 2012 vogel 1967 developed an analytical model to calculate the age stratification of groundwater over a vertical profile assuming an evenly recharged homogeneous aquifer of constant depth with horizontal flow however in a seasonally dynamic system estimating recharge patterns and groundwater residence times requires a more comprehensive approach such as incorporating water isotopes including 3h time series time series data of stable water isotopes have been used previously by jones and banner 2003 in the tropical islands barbados guam and puerto rico to determine the timing of recharge events this approach was not useful on bermuda where there was no distinct seasonality of rainfall δ18o in new caledonia on the other hand nicolini et al 2016 established that there was a seasonal variation of rainfall δ18o but groundwater δ18o was found to be essentially constant over time which the authors attributed to a combination of two processes a large threshold of 120 140 mm of monthly rainfall for recharge to occur and the mixing of rainfall in the soil zone with waters from previous events that have been influenced by evapotranspiration similarly beal et al 2019 recently inferred a bias towards high rainfall periods during the wet season based on δ18o values in groundwater and cave drip water in guam recharge was found to be sensitive to inter annual variations in rainfall amount and intensity highlighting the sensitivity of island freshwater lenses to seasonal or yearly climate variability röper et al 2012 investigated groundwater age distribution recharge conditions and hydrochemistry of a barrier island freshwater lens in the southern north sea using 3h 3he ages and stable water isotopes based on two sample events this study had a limited number of groundwater ages n 9 but they found young waters in the shallow sections of the lens 12 m increasing in age to greater than 70 years at the fresh water saltwater interface röper et al 2012 houben et al 2014 showed that a freshwater lens on the northern german island of langeoog contains climate information reflecting environmental conditions at the time of recharge the knowledge on how current climate change scenarios will impact groundwater resources remains limited cartwright and simmonds 2008 but recently cuthbert et al 2019 suggested that groundwater systems may respond to long term e g decadal responses based on modelling rottnest island located off the coast of perth australia provides a unique setting to investigate the effect of rainfall decline over the past few decades on groundwater contained in a freshwater lens since 1965 south west western australia has undergone a 20 decline in mean winter precipitation the rainfall decline has been attributed to a reorganisation in the southern hemisphere circulation systems particularly the south eastern indian ocean atmospheric and oceanic circulation evans et al 2009 smith et al 2000 and a strong positive phase of the southern annular mode the decline in rainfall has affected the region s storage and management of water resources with a study investigating the freshwater lens on rottnest island finding this has had a considerable impact on the extent of the groundwater resource bryan et al 2016 historical rainfall records and groundwater abstraction rates showed that the shrinkage of the freshwater lens was found to be primarily caused by a decrease in rainfall which led to the contraction in the lens 1 km2 seen in fig 1 a bryan et al 2016 leading to seawater intrusion with both modern 50 years and old 3 7 ka seawater being present in the aquifer bryan et al 2017 the objective of this study is to investigate whether long term climate change decadal to centennial or short term seasonal changes in rainfall are influencing the isotopic character of a shallow 0 30 m freshwater lens on rottnest island previous studies have investigated the extent of seawater mixing calculated groundwater residence times and assessed the long term rainfall decadal and groundwater abstraction patterns for the island however these assessments were based on one or two sample events bryan et al 2016 bryan et al 2017 which most groundwater chemistry investigations generally are while these datasets are informative they do not allow the assessment of variations over time therefore this study presents a seasonal groundwater isotopic and cl dataset collected over a three year period may 2013 to august 2016 this study is unique in that we present groundwater data collected from the two field campaigns described in bryan et al 2016 and bryan et al 2017 together with three years of seasonal groundwater monitoring data and compare it with rainfall data collected to evaluate how the freshwater lens responds to rainfall recharge specifically this study uses environmental tracers cl 2h 18o and 3h to evaluate the recharge mechanisms winter vs episodic events residence times and the interaction of the transition zone within a fresh water lens this is the first study to use seasonal isotopic groundwater data to provide insights on the impacts of the reduction in rainfall and how it is influencing the fresh water lens for this region the outcomes of this study are expected to provide a useful guide for understanding how fresh water lenses on islands respond to changes in seasonal rainfall regimes 2 study area rottnest island is located approximately 18 km off the coast of perth in south west western australia fig 1a and is 10 5 km long and up to 4 5 km wide with a maximum elevation of 45 m above australian height datum ahd rottnest island has a mediterranean type climate characterised by hot dry summers and mild wet winters with 80 of annual precipitation falling between may and september weather systems impacting on the region are dominated by anti cyclonic high pressure systems with periodic tropic and mid latitude depressions and local seasonal sea breezes eliot and clarke 1986 while the island has a long term average rainfall of 688 mm year 1880 2016 the south west western australian region has experienced a decrease in rainfall since the mid 1960 s and a particular decline since 2000 bates et al 2008 with average rainfall decreasing at the study site over time 746 154 1880 1965 608 118 1966 1999 and 556 112 2000 2016 mm annual rainfall in each year of the study period especially 2014 was below the long term average 2013 632 mm 2014 487 mm 2015 543 mm 2016 612 mm the island s land use and vegetation history have been described in detail in bryan et al 2016 some parts of the island have recently been revegetated however the area above the freshwater lens has generally been left free of large trees to maximise recharge to the freshwater lens 2 1 hydrogeological setting the hydrogeological setting has been summarised by bryan et al 2016 and bryan et al 2017 briefly the island is composed of pleistocene to mid holocene carbonate aeolianite tamala limestone with a total thickness of 115 m playford and leech 1977 the tamala limestone consists of creamy white to yellow or light grey calcarenites which contains various proportions of quartz sand fine to medium grained shell fragments and minor clayey lenses playford et al 1976 it is composed of 50 99 fine to coarse sand sized carbonate bioclasts hearty and o leary 2008 mory 1995 playford 1997 playford et al 1976 and is strongly lithified to friable there are no fresh surface water features due to the highly permeable nature of the tamala limestone but there are hypersaline lakes on the eastern side of the island the transition zone below the fresh groundwater is reported to be more than 10 m thick edward and watson 1959 playford and leech 1977 the water table was previously measured to be at a maximum of 0 5 m above sea level with groundwater flowing from the centre of the lens towards the coast and hypersaline lakes bryan et al 2016 the spatial extent of the freshwater lens has contracted significantly 1 km2 since the late 1970s due to a 20 decline in precipitation since the mid 1960s fig 1a bryan et al 2016 the aquifer has been used as a potable water source since the 1970s with the volume of abstraction in recent years between 5 and 9 of rainfall recharge bryan et al 2016 the groundwater abstraction wells are very shallow and tap the top of the water table with 1 mlong well screens ranging from 0 6 to 0 1 m ahd groundwater abstraction has occurred historically from the lens where up to 120 000 m3 per year was used for public water supply on the island the volume has been reduced significantly over the years resulting in the cessation of pumping in 2018 in 2014 groundwater abstraction had reduced to 17 of the volume of previous years 21 400 m3 bryan et al 2016 3 methods during twelve field campaigns between may 2013 and august 2016 110 samples were collected from production wells throughout the study area fig 1a the sample collection and analysis procedure has been described previously bryan et al 2016 2017 in brief samples were collected using permanently installed pumps after purging until stabilisation of in field parameters including ph temperature electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do composite rainfall samples were collected on a weekly basis from june 2013 to december 2016 in a rainfall collector designed to collect samples for isotopic analysis by preventing evaporation the cl and isotopic δ18o δ2h 3h analysis of groundwaters and rainfall was carried out according to the methodology presented by bryan et al 2016 the cl concentration of water samples were analysed by ion chromatography the δ18o and δ2h were analysed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms and values were reported as per mil deviation from the international standard v smow2 vienna standard mean ocean water the δ18o samples were analysed using an equilibration continuous flow irms method while δ2h samples were analysed using an on line combustion dual inlet irms method the δ18o and δ2h measurements were reproducible to 0 15 and 1 respectively the 3h samples were analysed with water samples being distilled and electrolytically enriched prior to analysis by a liquid scintillation method the 3h concentrations were expressed in tritium units tu with a general uncertainty of 0 1 tu and quantification limit of 0 06 tu water levels were monitored at 30 min increments at a subset of monitoring wells for over 2 years from september 2014 to december 2016 using non vented solinst gold loggers which were corrected for barometric pressure hydrographs were constructed from the 2014 2016 dataset using an adjacent averaging method to highlight the general trends in water levels over time fig 2 a groundwater age distributions were evaluated using tracerlpm jurgens et al 2012 this modelling package permits optimization of parameters using either multiple tracers analysed in a single sample tracer tracer method or from a single tracer analysed in multiple samples collected over a period of time time series method jurgens et al 2012 a detailed description of the commonly used lumped parameter models lmps is discussed in jurgens et al 2012 and maloszewski et al 2002 briefly lmps are mathematical models of transport based on aquifer geometry and flow that accounts for hydrodynamic dispersion or mixing within the aquifer discharge area or the well jurgens et al 2012 testing and selection of an appropriate lpm for an aquifer system is needed because the mean age is often non unique between the models the lpm approach assumes tracers are injected and travel conservatively with the water molecule through the aquifer therefore the mean age inferred by tracer concentrations is equal to the mean age of water discharging from the system or to a screened interval jurgens et al 2012 lpms were used in this study for groundwater residence time calculations because they account for the age distribution of the sample all individual lmps piston flow model exponential mixing model exponential piston flow model partial exponential model and dispersion model were assessed including binary mixing models which have been previously used to describe tracer concentrations in karstic aquifers and watersheds with variations in transmissivity jurgens et al 2012 katz et al 2009 long and putnam 2006 the models were run for five wells 6 90 3 77 4 83 1 83 and 16 90 where time series 3h data was collected over the study period the tracers 3h and 18o were used in combination and then separately for each model the 3h and 18o monthly rainfall from 1962 to 2020 are used as input data to the model the 3h input data was from the 3h in rainfall measured by the global network of isotope in precipitation gnip and ansto on a monthly basis since the 1960s at perth western australia which is in close proximity 50 km to the study site pre bomb atmospheric concentrations and atmospheric concentrations since november 2016 when rainfall data was no longer available were assumed to be 2 tu where data was absent 3h values were estimated by interpolation an 18o input function was also used with perth rainfall 18o values from gnip iaea wmo 2016 utilised where available where data was absent a monthly average value was calculated based on existing data values for δ18o in groundwater were also included in the modelling because they are a useful model constraint for rainfall recharge in the lmps the 18o rainfall time series were constructed from data from the nearby gnip monitoring station at perth supplemented by data collected as part of this study from rottnest island from 2014 to 2016 missing data and data prior to gnip monitoring was interpolated based on the monthly mean composite rainfall samples were collected on rottnest island on a weekly basis from may 2014 in a rainfall collector designed to collect samples for isotopic analysis by preventing evaporation besides rainfall data we utilise modelled climate parameters for the study site location from the australian water availability project awap dataset raupach et al 2009 2012 modelled awap weekly climate parameters from nineteen sites around perth wa were used to calculate average values that were subsequently utilised in calculations for rottnest island as the awap model domain does not extend to rottnest island fig 2b and c a cumulative water budget was calculated using bureau of meteorology rainfall bom 2017 and modelled actual evapotranspiration aet data to obtain the total recharge to the freshwater lens for each year of the study 2013 2016 weekly modelled aet is subtracted from weekly rainfall totals p to determine the water budget i e p aet potential recharge is then calculated from all positive monthly water budgets monthly excess rainfall the total sum of all monthly excess water for each year gives the potential infiltration for that particular year 4 results groundwater levels were measured from dedicated monitoring wells as indicated in fig 1a and were responsive to tidal oscillations causing large daily fluctuations the average filtered groundwater levels reveal the seasonal trends better fig 2a all locations showing the same characteristic water level fluctuations over time which appear to be heavily dependent on rainfall and a return to near sea level during low rainfall periods fig 2b the highest water levels are observed in the austral winter months 0 5 m above mean sea level which are characterised by high rainfall while lower water levels near 0 m ahd are observed in the austral summer months fig 2b the wells sampled for this study were production wells used to abstract groundwater it was found that the decrease in rainfall since the 1970s had a greater influence on water levels than groundwater abstraction volume bryan et al 2016 the annual mean actual evapotranspiration aet for rottnest island using the australian water availability project awap dataset is 615 57 mm with soil evaporation and transpiration accounting for 171 29 mm and 444 30 mm respectively raupach et al 2009 2012 an average annual potential recharge of 280 10 mm during the study period was calculated using rainfall and modelled aet data ranging from a minimum of 265 mm in 2014 to a maximum of 295 mm in 2015 which are consistent with previously calculated recharge estimates of between 147 and 245 mm per year calculated using the renewal rate calculation with 3h as the rainfall input and groundwater age tracer bryan et al 2016 4 1 environmental tracers the average rainfall cl concentration over the study period is 1 9 1 8 mmol l while average groundwater cl concentrations range from 4 5 0 7 to 9 1 4 3 mmol l table 1 groundwater cl concentrations range between 4 0 and 20 0 mmol l with a smaller range detected in most wells fig 3 b higher cl values were measured in the austral summer and early autumn months when limited rainfall occurs with average groundwater cl concentrations ranging from 7 8 2 6 to 9 1 4 3 mmol l table 1 fig 3b average groundwater cl values in the higher rainfall austral winter months range from 4 8 0 8 to 5 2 1 1 mmol l moreover greater variability is observed in the austral summer months while less variability is observed in the austral winter months fig 3b the data for most wells follow a similar temporal pattern however for some wells a slightly earlier or later peak in cl concentrations during the austral summer months is observed fig 3b during the summer of 2013 14 very little rain fell and the cl peaks for all groundwaters were aligned in the subsequent two summers on the other hand some summer rainfall occurred and variation in the timing of the cl peaks was observed three wells which show repeated higher increases in cl concentration 6 90 3 93 and 6 93 during the austral summer are located in the north west nw area of the freshwater lens and are represented in green in fig 3b with a significant cl peak in march 2016 well 2 77 located towards the centre of the lens fig 1a with a very shallow well screen 0 49 m ahd deviates from all other wells fig 3b the average 3h value of perth rainfall over the study period between may 2013 and august 2016 was 1 78 0 63 tu table 1 unpublished ansto data and iaea wmo 2016 average groundwater 3h concentrations over the same period range from 0 74 0 10 to 1 16 0 29 tu while average 3h values show an overall decline over the study period fig 3c 3h values rise slightly during the austral winter months before decreasing slowly until the next winter the five wells that were monitored on a regular basis show varying fluctuations over time and some wells show opposing patterns between cl and 3h values the opposite relationship was most notable in groundwaters with a higher concentration of cl e g well 6 90 table s1 the greatest proportion of recharge from rainfall occurs in the austral winter months which corresponds to when groundwaters have higher average 3h values compared to other times throughout the year fig 3c blue line the highest 3h groundwater values however were observed in may 2013 fig 3c averaging 1 16 0 29 tu rainfall values for δ2h and δ18o ranged from 48 7 to 15 7 and from 7 4 to 1 6 respectively between may 2013 and july 2016 based on rainfall δ18o and δ2h values a local meteoric water line lmwl for rottnest island was calculated using a precipitation weighted least squares regression method crawford et al 2014 which is given by δ2h 6 6 δ18o 9 9 fig 4 the rottnest island lmwl lies right beside the lmwl for the perth region given by δ2h 6 7 δ18o 9 5 hollins et al 2018 fig 4 which was expected due to their close proximity average groundwater δ2h values range from 18 2 to 16 4 fig 3d table 1 over the study period while average groundwater δ18o values range from 4 2 to 3 9 fig 3e the groundwater data points lie on the rottnest lmwl which suggests a rainfall origin and that waters have not been significantly influenced by evaporation prior to recharge fig 4 the mean weighted precipitation isotope composition over the study period δ18o 3 67 δ2h 14 09 is more positive than most groundwater samples fig 4 while average δ18o and δ2h groundwater values are fairly constant throughout the study period there does appear to be a very slight upward trend in δ2h values as indicated with the average groundwater line in blue fig 3d 4 2 groundwater residence times the 3h values in shallow groundwaters 4 20 m below ground surface on rottnest island vary significantly which is an important finding when considering most groundwater age assessments use 3h from one sampling event as a result the most accurate way to use the 3h values to calculate groundwater residence times is to use a lpm as it takes into consideration the source 3h fluctuations and allows for the determination of more accurate mean residence times the determination of an lpm from a single tracer such as tritium measured in a single sample is non unique jurgens et al 2012 the reason for this is tritium has an input history concentration change over time as a result measured tritium concentrations can correspond to more than one mean age the lpm results show that a combination of 3h and 18o tracers are required to achieve a good model fit at the study site table 2 and table s2 with the use of 3h and 18o individually resulting in significantly higher model errors as high as 441 average error table 2 compared to when both tracers are used whereby errors were generally 10 the mean residence time values from the combined tracer models are used in this study the binary mixing models were expected to be superior over the single lumped parameter models due to the karstic nature of the tamala limestone however the single dispersion models produced consistently lower errors compared to the binary mixing models table s2 and this may be due to the young eogenetic limestones on rottnest island which have limited karstification and therefore exhibit porous media behaviour the dispersion model likely addresses the dual flow properties of the karst and the modelled residence times provide a mean age which will be a mixture of both younger and older waters the limited role of karsification is supported by the relatively young ages of the tamala limestone formation hearty 2003 lipar and webb 2014 the mean residence times from all dual tracer models range from a minimum of 12 years to a maximum of 65 years table 2 table s2 overall the dispersion model dm performs most consistently in terms of error across all sites for the dual tracers with more consistent mean residence times range 12 36 years and low errors regularly achieved across each site 0 8 to 3 8 most fresh groundwater samples from the lens were calculated to have mean residence times between 12 and 18 years this indicates groundwaters were recharged over the most recent period of rainfall decline experienced for south west western australia however samples in the nw of the lens well 6 90 table s2 were calculated to have double the mean residence time 36 years of wells sampled in other areas of the lens fig 5 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal changes the temporal groundwater data appears to indicate that increasing aet and low rainfall produce higher cl concentrations in groundwater which coincide with low water levels and decrease in 3h values in some wells although rottnest island has a high potential for evaporation we see no direct evidence of evaporation in the δ2h and δ18o values for the groundwater rather they closely resemble rainfall plotting close to the lwml fig 4 in fact four recharge pulses can be identified during the monitoring period as inferred from decreases in cl concentration in groundwater coinciding with periods of rainfall with low cl content and higher winter rainfall amounts prior to sampling the seasonal change in the cl concentration suggests that rainfall recharge dilutes the groundwater transpiration results in the increase of cl concentrations in the soil water or groundwater without 18o enrichment in the root zone farquhar et al 2007 this would explain the observation in our dataset because we do not see enrichment in δ2h and δ18o values this has also been observed in the tamala limestone on the mainland of australia treble et al 2016 whereby the cl concentrations in cave drip waters were affected by transpiration and the drip water did not show isotopic enrichment associated with evaporation the modelled awap data shows that transpiration on rottnest island accounts for up to 60 of aet fig 2c this means that direct evaporation is also significant which would leave an imprint on the isotopic signature unless the evaporation is complete smaller rainfall events are susceptible to direct evaporation as they are not transmitted into the deeper parts of the soil as rapidly as high intensity rainfall events complete evaporation of these small rainfall amounts does indeed fit with the observed bias of the groundwater towards rainfall with a depleted isotopic composition which is associated with the more intense rainfall events the cl concentration in the groundwater increased after periods with a p aet deficit fig 3 during the austral summer besides the dry summer of 2013 2014 when no variation in the timing of cl peaks in groundwaters were observed sporadic rainfall over the late spring and summer of 2014 15 and 2015 16 would allow for the flushing of cl concentrated by evapotranspiration in the unsaturated zone down to the water table which would subsequently increase the groundwater cl concentration similarly the complete evaporation of water from low intensity rainfall events that do not reach the water table and the remaining salts being flushed down by subsequent high intensity events would also produce an increase in cl with no enrichment in water isotopes furthermore the leaching of cl accumulated on the vegetation by dry deposition of airborne sea salts may further contribute to a rise of the groundwater cl concentration following the earliest rainfall after a dry period bresciani et al 2014 these cl accumulation mechanisms provide an explanation for the variation in cl peaks fig 3b three of the four recharge events were not large enough to change the groundwater 3h values to the rainfall highs that were observed in may 2013 fig 3c one reason might be that subsequent recharge events had lower 3h rainfall values but there is no evidence for this in the rainfall 3h record an explanation for the lower 3h values for the recharge events could be that the sampled groundwater becomes mixed with deeper older groundwater from various parts of the lens and that the rainfall amount over the three years was not large enough to displace the older groundwater in the sampled zones this fits with other studies of island freshwater lenses that found groundwaters increased in age to greater than 70 years at the fresh water saltwater interface röper et al 2012 it was also found by maloszewski et al 2002 by using 18o and 3h as tracers that transit times are monthly in comparison with the mean transit times of decades through a fissured porous aquifer 5 2 transition zone mixing an alternative explanation for why we see elevated cl and lower 3h values in the fresh water lens could be the change in location of the transition zone between summer and winter the most significant cl variations are found in the wells located closest to the coast in the nw area of the lens wells 6 90 3 93 and 6 93 green lines in fig 3b and are located in relatively close proximity 150 400 m to well 7 90 which is affected by seawater intrusion as described elsewhere bryan et al 2016 2017 yet the δ18o and δ2h values of groundwaters from these wells do not show clear evidence of seawater mixing this can be explained because the maximum possible seawater proportion was calculated to be between 0 2 and 2 0 of the total volume of water therefore this minor amount of seawater would not affect the δ18o isotopic value of the groundwater by more than 0 1 2 of a signal with 0 compared to 98 of a signal with 4 0 which is within the measurement error therefore the seasonal cl variation for the nw wells 6 90 3 93 and 6 93 could be the vertical movement of the transition zone this would lead to cl being transported upwards with deeper saline groundwater in summer due to the reduction in rainfall recharge which leads to a contraction of the thickness of the freshwater lens we do not have the data to prove conclusively whether the observed groundwater cl variations are driven primarily by unsaturated zone processes or the movement of the lens boundary with upward dispersion of cl from the transition zone however we have assessed that the possible impact from the latter on the mean residence time calculations to be insignificant because the less than 2 seawater contribution represents an uncertainty too small to be noted in the stable isotope analysis likewise it would only contribute a maximum of 2 of older 3h depleted transition zone water the potential error introduced in the model by a portion of older water from below is therefore small and constrained to the nw area of the lens considering the high transmissivity of the limestone it is expected that the lens volume will respond to the perturbations in recharge and sea level contraction of the freshwater lens during late summer when groundwater levels are lowest will occur because groundwater constantly discharges to the sea negligible rainfall recharge occurs and albeit to a small extent groundwater is withdrawn by pumping the rising water table due to rainfall recharge and cessation of pumping in winter will restore the lens volume the fresh saltwater interface thus moves up and down in response to the seasonality of the rainfall as has been shown for carbonate aquifers elsewhere post et al 2018 the drop in groundwater levels by the end of summer causes older 3h depleted groundwater with higher concentrations of cl to migrate upwards with the reverse occurring in the winter months when recharge occurs and provides an explanation for the observed inverse relationship between cl and 3h in many of the wells in the nw region 5 3 episodic recharge temporal variations in the dataset suggest various rainfall patterns are governing the observed seasonal trends in the data the may 2013 sampling campaign occurred after the wettest may on record in eight years in perth resulting from a low pressure system comprised of multiple cold fronts bom 2013 approximately 140 mm of rainfall was recorded in the 20 days prior with a large rainfall event comprised of 61 mm falling in 24 h on the 8th may 2013 20 days before and a further 10 5 mm falling in the following 24 hour period clear indications for recharge to the lens are provided by groundwater samples containing 3h may 2013 average groundwater 3h 1 16 0 29 tu similar to the rainfall for that month 1 24 tu unpublished ansto data and iaea wmo 2016 table s1 this event appeared to affect the entire system demonstrating the importance of episodic recharge by large rainfall events for the lens indeed some wells 1 83 3 77 and 4 83 had higher groundwater values than the rainfall input value table s1 suggesting the episodic recharge event had higher 3h contents than the monthly weighted average of rainfall the δ18o values of the groundwater are also lower than the mean δ18o value of winter precipitation fig 3e again supporting the suggestion that episodic rainfall events that have a lighter isotopic signature contribute to recharge as well as the regular winter rains combined with the observation that lpm modelling of the 18o tracer perth monthly rainfall resulted in δ18o values more positive than the observed groundwater δ18o data causing a consistent negative model fit table 2 the results show that such episodic events may be more important than seasonal winter recharge in maintaining the volume of the fresh water lens this assessment is supported by the study undertaken by barron et al 2012 who found that for most climates in australia the correlation between recharge and the annual rainfall parameters reflecting rainfall intensity were stronger than the correlation between modelled recharge and total annual rainfall furthermore studies in the golgotha cave in the tamala limestone on the mainland found that cave drip rates which are indicative of recharge remained almost constant for a period of several years mahmud et al 2016 treble et al 2013 2016 despite highly seasonal winter precipitation and a summer soil moisture deficit as on rottnest island the may 2013 recharge event had a strong impact on the hydrology of the limestone of the golgotha cave with drip rates abruptly increasing after years of near constancy mahmud et al 2016 5 4 implications for future recharge the finding from this study that episodic rainfall is a major contributor to groundwater recharge from winter rainfall is important and this assessment would not be possible without seasonal time series data this is because under climate projections of decreased total rainfall for the region crosbie et al 2012 ng et al 2010 recharge may be sustained if the frequency of high intensity rainfall events were to increase significantly the groundwater recharged over the past few decades with mean residence times ranging from 12 to 36 years occurred during the ongoing lower than average rainfall periods experienced in the south west western australia region this leads to questions about the impact of recharge variations with future predictions of rainfall from global climate models suggesting that the region could see further declines in winter rainfall by approximately 40 from the 1911 1970 average delworth and zeng 2014 several factors are expected to contribute to the change in climate including an enhancement of atmospheric surface pressure over parts of australia which are consistent with a southerly shift and intensification of the subtropical ridge and the hadley cell delworth and zeng 2014 the modelled rainfall decline is also affected by the long term increasing trend in the southern annular mode which results in a southerly shift of westerly winds and rain producing storms delworth and zeng 2014 producing a further reduction in winter rainfall this is likely to affect recharge to the freshwater lens which in turn will affect the extent of the fresh groundwater store at the study site further investigations are required to deduce the impact of soil moisture conditions on recharge nagra et al 2017 determined a recharge threshold value of about 90 mm for the tamala limestone on the mainland which emphasises the importance of large storm events like the may 2013 recharge event on rottnest island the occurrence of such large recharge events is infrequent in south west western australia and further investigations are required to determine the effect that climate change may have on both their frequency and intensity and on the resulting recharge potential ongoing monitoring of the freshwater lens into the future is thus essential to determine if the continued decrease in rainfall for the region is reflected by changes in the aquifer which is important for both the management of this resource and other shallow unconfined aquifers globally 6 conclusions the objective of this study was to investigate whether long term climate variability decadal or short term seasonal changes in rainfall were influencing the isotopic character of a freshwater lens on rottnest island the study was undertaken during a period of lower than average rainfall for the region may 2013 to august 2016 a large rainfall event in may 2013 allowed us to evaluate winter season vs episodic recharge mechanisms it was found that two key processes can result in the seasonal variation observed primarily the processes were reliant on the location of the monitoring wells within the lens in the centre of the lens the cl and 3h variations were governed by the seasonal variation for example increased cl and lower 3h during the summer months were driven by higher evapotranspiration and lower rainfall the groundwater residence times in this part of the aquifer range from 12 to 18 years in the nw section of the lens the shrinkage and upward movement of the freshwater lens when the water table falls in summeris possible the results from this study highlighted the importance of a time series approach including multiple parameters for monitoring shallow unconfined aquifers to have sufficient input data to drive a process based model e g lumped parameter model and to ensure that seasonal variability is captured groundwater studies of freshwater lenses should not rely on a single sampling campaign because this study shows the seasonal variability is large the 3h values in shallow aquifers can vary considerably over a study period for example the greatest observed 3h variation in a single groundwater well ranged from 0 54 tu to 1 67 tu this observation is important for using 3h as a dating and modelling tool groundwater cl concentrations were indicative of recharge processes highlighting the importance of evapotranspiration while 3h was important for the deduction of the long term recharge trends and also illustrates the importance of large episodic rainfall events the identification of a dual recharge regime with contributions from both winter rainfall and

18259,coastal aquifers provide an important source of water globally understanding how groundwater responds to changes in rainfall recharge is important for sustainable development to this end we investigate how water isotopes 18o 2h 3h and chloride cl concentrations within an island freshwater lens respond under varying rainfall conditions in a region experiencing climate change uniquely this study presents a three year dataset of groundwater collected seasonally between may 2013 and august 2016 from ten wells variation in all tracers was observed the cl and tritium 3h show opposing seasonal variation in some sections of the lens with higher cl observed in the austral summer when less rainfall occurs and evapotranspiration is highest the opposite occurs in the austral winter months when 3h increases from atmospheric input via rainfall recharge and cl is diluted an overall decline in 3h values and enrichment in stable water isotopes over the study period was also observed this study shows that understanding groundwater of freshwater lenses should not rely on a single sampling campaign because seasonal variability is large the identification of a dual recharge regime with contributions from both winter rainfall and episodic events has important implications for understanding the future fate of the freshwater lens on rottnest island the finding that episodic rainfall is a major contributor to groundwater recharge is important and can only be assessed with a multi year isotope dataset for groundwater and rainfall graphical abstract image 1 keywords island freshwater lens water isotopes seawater intrusion mean groundwater residence time 1 introduction coastal aquifers provide a source of water for more than one billion people small and nicholls 2003 and are under increasing strain due to rapid population growth in coastal areas globally these aquifers come with various challenges when utilised as a potable water source including seawater intrusion caused by both natural and anthropogenic causes kinzelbach et al 2003 post 2005 barlow and reichard 2010 jiao and post 2019 while groundwater abstraction is one of the leading causes of seawater intrusion the impacts of climate change on coastal aquifers is also of concern ferguson and gleeson 2012 global sea level rise slr promotes seawater intrusion nicholls et al 2007 but perhaps more importantly a decline in recharge in areas of reduced rainfall leads to a subsequent decrease in the volume of freshwater available for utilisation white and falkland 2010 these issues can be intensified on islands where fresh groundwater is usually present in the form of a shallow lens floating on more saline water below due to the density difference these lenses are particularly vulnerable to climate variability as their very existence relies on rainfall recharge white and falkland 2010 understanding how rainfall recharges freshwater lenses and determining the residence time of groundwater are therefore particularly important tritium 3h and helium have been previously used typically based on the vogel 1967 method to estimate recharge to freshwater lenses houben et al 2014 röper et al 2012 vogel 1967 developed an analytical model to calculate the age stratification of groundwater over a vertical profile assuming an evenly recharged homogeneous aquifer of constant depth with horizontal flow however in a seasonally dynamic system estimating recharge patterns and groundwater residence times requires a more comprehensive approach such as incorporating water isotopes including 3h time series time series data of stable water isotopes have been used previously by jones and banner 2003 in the tropical islands barbados guam and puerto rico to determine the timing of recharge events this approach was not useful on bermuda where there was no distinct seasonality of rainfall δ18o in new caledonia on the other hand nicolini et al 2016 established that there was a seasonal variation of rainfall δ18o but groundwater δ18o was found to be essentially constant over time which the authors attributed to a combination of two processes a large threshold of 120 140 mm of monthly rainfall for recharge to occur and the mixing of rainfall in the soil zone with waters from previous events that have been influenced by evapotranspiration similarly beal et al 2019 recently inferred a bias towards high rainfall periods during the wet season based on δ18o values in groundwater and cave drip water in guam recharge was found to be sensitive to inter annual variations in rainfall amount and intensity highlighting the sensitivity of island freshwater lenses to seasonal or yearly climate variability röper et al 2012 investigated groundwater age distribution recharge conditions and hydrochemistry of a barrier island freshwater lens in the southern north sea using 3h 3he ages and stable water isotopes based on two sample events this study had a limited number of groundwater ages n 9 but they found young waters in the shallow sections of the lens 12 m increasing in age to greater than 70 years at the fresh water saltwater interface röper et al 2012 houben et al 2014 showed that a freshwater lens on the northern german island of langeoog contains climate information reflecting environmental conditions at the time of recharge the knowledge on how current climate change scenarios will impact groundwater resources remains limited cartwright and simmonds 2008 but recently cuthbert et al 2019 suggested that groundwater systems may respond to long term e g decadal responses based on modelling rottnest island located off the coast of perth australia provides a unique setting to investigate the effect of rainfall decline over the past few decades on groundwater contained in a freshwater lens since 1965 south west western australia has undergone a 20 decline in mean winter precipitation the rainfall decline has been attributed to a reorganisation in the southern hemisphere circulation systems particularly the south eastern indian ocean atmospheric and oceanic circulation evans et al 2009 smith et al 2000 and a strong positive phase of the southern annular mode the decline in rainfall has affected the region s storage and management of water resources with a study investigating the freshwater lens on rottnest island finding this has had a considerable impact on the extent of the groundwater resource bryan et al 2016 historical rainfall records and groundwater abstraction rates showed that the shrinkage of the freshwater lens was found to be primarily caused by a decrease in rainfall which led to the contraction in the lens 1 km2 seen in fig 1 a bryan et al 2016 leading to seawater intrusion with both modern 50 years and old 3 7 ka seawater being present in the aquifer bryan et al 2017 the objective of this study is to investigate whether long term climate change decadal to centennial or short term seasonal changes in rainfall are influencing the isotopic character of a shallow 0 30 m freshwater lens on rottnest island previous studies have investigated the extent of seawater mixing calculated groundwater residence times and assessed the long term rainfall decadal and groundwater abstraction patterns for the island however these assessments were based on one or two sample events bryan et al 2016 bryan et al 2017 which most groundwater chemistry investigations generally are while these datasets are informative they do not allow the assessment of variations over time therefore this study presents a seasonal groundwater isotopic and cl dataset collected over a three year period may 2013 to august 2016 this study is unique in that we present groundwater data collected from the two field campaigns described in bryan et al 2016 and bryan et al 2017 together with three years of seasonal groundwater monitoring data and compare it with rainfall data collected to evaluate how the freshwater lens responds to rainfall recharge specifically this study uses environmental tracers cl 2h 18o and 3h to evaluate the recharge mechanisms winter vs episodic events residence times and the interaction of the transition zone within a fresh water lens this is the first study to use seasonal isotopic groundwater data to provide insights on the impacts of the reduction in rainfall and how it is influencing the fresh water lens for this region the outcomes of this study are expected to provide a useful guide for understanding how fresh water lenses on islands respond to changes in seasonal rainfall regimes 2 study area rottnest island is located approximately 18 km off the coast of perth in south west western australia fig 1a and is 10 5 km long and up to 4 5 km wide with a maximum elevation of 45 m above australian height datum ahd rottnest island has a mediterranean type climate characterised by hot dry summers and mild wet winters with 80 of annual precipitation falling between may and september weather systems impacting on the region are dominated by anti cyclonic high pressure systems with periodic tropic and mid latitude depressions and local seasonal sea breezes eliot and clarke 1986 while the island has a long term average rainfall of 688 mm year 1880 2016 the south west western australian region has experienced a decrease in rainfall since the mid 1960 s and a particular decline since 2000 bates et al 2008 with average rainfall decreasing at the study site over time 746 154 1880 1965 608 118 1966 1999 and 556 112 2000 2016 mm annual rainfall in each year of the study period especially 2014 was below the long term average 2013 632 mm 2014 487 mm 2015 543 mm 2016 612 mm the island s land use and vegetation history have been described in detail in bryan et al 2016 some parts of the island have recently been revegetated however the area above the freshwater lens has generally been left free of large trees to maximise recharge to the freshwater lens 2 1 hydrogeological setting the hydrogeological setting has been summarised by bryan et al 2016 and bryan et al 2017 briefly the island is composed of pleistocene to mid holocene carbonate aeolianite tamala limestone with a total thickness of 115 m playford and leech 1977 the tamala limestone consists of creamy white to yellow or light grey calcarenites which contains various proportions of quartz sand fine to medium grained shell fragments and minor clayey lenses playford et al 1976 it is composed of 50 99 fine to coarse sand sized carbonate bioclasts hearty and o leary 2008 mory 1995 playford 1997 playford et al 1976 and is strongly lithified to friable there are no fresh surface water features due to the highly permeable nature of the tamala limestone but there are hypersaline lakes on the eastern side of the island the transition zone below the fresh groundwater is reported to be more than 10 m thick edward and watson 1959 playford and leech 1977 the water table was previously measured to be at a maximum of 0 5 m above sea level with groundwater flowing from the centre of the lens towards the coast and hypersaline lakes bryan et al 2016 the spatial extent of the freshwater lens has contracted significantly 1 km2 since the late 1970s due to a 20 decline in precipitation since the mid 1960s fig 1a bryan et al 2016 the aquifer has been used as a potable water source since the 1970s with the volume of abstraction in recent years between 5 and 9 of rainfall recharge bryan et al 2016 the groundwater abstraction wells are very shallow and tap the top of the water table with 1 mlong well screens ranging from 0 6 to 0 1 m ahd groundwater abstraction has occurred historically from the lens where up to 120 000 m3 per year was used for public water supply on the island the volume has been reduced significantly over the years resulting in the cessation of pumping in 2018 in 2014 groundwater abstraction had reduced to 17 of the volume of previous years 21 400 m3 bryan et al 2016 3 methods during twelve field campaigns between may 2013 and august 2016 110 samples were collected from production wells throughout the study area fig 1a the sample collection and analysis procedure has been described previously bryan et al 2016 2017 in brief samples were collected using permanently installed pumps after purging until stabilisation of in field parameters including ph temperature electrical conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do composite rainfall samples were collected on a weekly basis from june 2013 to december 2016 in a rainfall collector designed to collect samples for isotopic analysis by preventing evaporation the cl and isotopic δ18o δ2h 3h analysis of groundwaters and rainfall was carried out according to the methodology presented by bryan et al 2016 the cl concentration of water samples were analysed by ion chromatography the δ18o and δ2h were analysed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms and values were reported as per mil deviation from the international standard v smow2 vienna standard mean ocean water the δ18o samples were analysed using an equilibration continuous flow irms method while δ2h samples were analysed using an on line combustion dual inlet irms method the δ18o and δ2h measurements were reproducible to 0 15 and 1 respectively the 3h samples were analysed with water samples being distilled and electrolytically enriched prior to analysis by a liquid scintillation method the 3h concentrations were expressed in tritium units tu with a general uncertainty of 0 1 tu and quantification limit of 0 06 tu water levels were monitored at 30 min increments at a subset of monitoring wells for over 2 years from september 2014 to december 2016 using non vented solinst gold loggers which were corrected for barometric pressure hydrographs were constructed from the 2014 2016 dataset using an adjacent averaging method to highlight the general trends in water levels over time fig 2 a groundwater age distributions were evaluated using tracerlpm jurgens et al 2012 this modelling package permits optimization of parameters using either multiple tracers analysed in a single sample tracer tracer method or from a single tracer analysed in multiple samples collected over a period of time time series method jurgens et al 2012 a detailed description of the commonly used lumped parameter models lmps is discussed in jurgens et al 2012 and maloszewski et al 2002 briefly lmps are mathematical models of transport based on aquifer geometry and flow that accounts for hydrodynamic dispersion or mixing within the aquifer discharge area or the well jurgens et al 2012 testing and selection of an appropriate lpm for an aquifer system is needed because the mean age is often non unique between the models the lpm approach assumes tracers are injected and travel conservatively with the water molecule through the aquifer therefore the mean age inferred by tracer concentrations is equal to the mean age of water discharging from the system or to a screened interval jurgens et al 2012 lpms were used in this study for groundwater residence time calculations because they account for the age distribution of the sample all individual lmps piston flow model exponential mixing model exponential piston flow model partial exponential model and dispersion model were assessed including binary mixing models which have been previously used to describe tracer concentrations in karstic aquifers and watersheds with variations in transmissivity jurgens et al 2012 katz et al 2009 long and putnam 2006 the models were run for five wells 6 90 3 77 4 83 1 83 and 16 90 where time series 3h data was collected over the study period the tracers 3h and 18o were used in combination and then separately for each model the 3h and 18o monthly rainfall from 1962 to 2020 are used as input data to the model the 3h input data was from the 3h in rainfall measured by the global network of isotope in precipitation gnip and ansto on a monthly basis since the 1960s at perth western australia which is in close proximity 50 km to the study site pre bomb atmospheric concentrations and atmospheric concentrations since november 2016 when rainfall data was no longer available were assumed to be 2 tu where data was absent 3h values were estimated by interpolation an 18o input function was also used with perth rainfall 18o values from gnip iaea wmo 2016 utilised where available where data was absent a monthly average value was calculated based on existing data values for δ18o in groundwater were also included in the modelling because they are a useful model constraint for rainfall recharge in the lmps the 18o rainfall time series were constructed from data from the nearby gnip monitoring station at perth supplemented by data collected as part of this study from rottnest island from 2014 to 2016 missing data and data prior to gnip monitoring was interpolated based on the monthly mean composite rainfall samples were collected on rottnest island on a weekly basis from may 2014 in a rainfall collector designed to collect samples for isotopic analysis by preventing evaporation besides rainfall data we utilise modelled climate parameters for the study site location from the australian water availability project awap dataset raupach et al 2009 2012 modelled awap weekly climate parameters from nineteen sites around perth wa were used to calculate average values that were subsequently utilised in calculations for rottnest island as the awap model domain does not extend to rottnest island fig 2b and c a cumulative water budget was calculated using bureau of meteorology rainfall bom 2017 and modelled actual evapotranspiration aet data to obtain the total recharge to the freshwater lens for each year of the study 2013 2016 weekly modelled aet is subtracted from weekly rainfall totals p to determine the water budget i e p aet potential recharge is then calculated from all positive monthly water budgets monthly excess rainfall the total sum of all monthly excess water for each year gives the potential infiltration for that particular year 4 results groundwater levels were measured from dedicated monitoring wells as indicated in fig 1a and were responsive to tidal oscillations causing large daily fluctuations the average filtered groundwater levels reveal the seasonal trends better fig 2a all locations showing the same characteristic water level fluctuations over time which appear to be heavily dependent on rainfall and a return to near sea level during low rainfall periods fig 2b the highest water levels are observed in the austral winter months 0 5 m above mean sea level which are characterised by high rainfall while lower water levels near 0 m ahd are observed in the austral summer months fig 2b the wells sampled for this study were production wells used to abstract groundwater it was found that the decrease in rainfall since the 1970s had a greater influence on water levels than groundwater abstraction volume bryan et al 2016 the annual mean actual evapotranspiration aet for rottnest island using the australian water availability project awap dataset is 615 57 mm with soil evaporation and transpiration accounting for 171 29 mm and 444 30 mm respectively raupach et al 2009 2012 an average annual potential recharge of 280 10 mm during the study period was calculated using rainfall and modelled aet data ranging from a minimum of 265 mm in 2014 to a maximum of 295 mm in 2015 which are consistent with previously calculated recharge estimates of between 147 and 245 mm per year calculated using the renewal rate calculation with 3h as the rainfall input and groundwater age tracer bryan et al 2016 4 1 environmental tracers the average rainfall cl concentration over the study period is 1 9 1 8 mmol l while average groundwater cl concentrations range from 4 5 0 7 to 9 1 4 3 mmol l table 1 groundwater cl concentrations range between 4 0 and 20 0 mmol l with a smaller range detected in most wells fig 3 b higher cl values were measured in the austral summer and early autumn months when limited rainfall occurs with average groundwater cl concentrations ranging from 7 8 2 6 to 9 1 4 3 mmol l table 1 fig 3b average groundwater cl values in the higher rainfall austral winter months range from 4 8 0 8 to 5 2 1 1 mmol l moreover greater variability is observed in the austral summer months while less variability is observed in the austral winter months fig 3b the data for most wells follow a similar temporal pattern however for some wells a slightly earlier or later peak in cl concentrations during the austral summer months is observed fig 3b during the summer of 2013 14 very little rain fell and the cl peaks for all groundwaters were aligned in the subsequent two summers on the other hand some summer rainfall occurred and variation in the timing of the cl peaks was observed three wells which show repeated higher increases in cl concentration 6 90 3 93 and 6 93 during the austral summer are located in the north west nw area of the freshwater lens and are represented in green in fig 3b with a significant cl peak in march 2016 well 2 77 located towards the centre of the lens fig 1a with a very shallow well screen 0 49 m ahd deviates from all other wells fig 3b the average 3h value of perth rainfall over the study period between may 2013 and august 2016 was 1 78 0 63 tu table 1 unpublished ansto data and iaea wmo 2016 average groundwater 3h concentrations over the same period range from 0 74 0 10 to 1 16 0 29 tu while average 3h values show an overall decline over the study period fig 3c 3h values rise slightly during the austral winter months before decreasing slowly until the next winter the five wells that were monitored on a regular basis show varying fluctuations over time and some wells show opposing patterns between cl and 3h values the opposite relationship was most notable in groundwaters with a higher concentration of cl e g well 6 90 table s1 the greatest proportion of recharge from rainfall occurs in the austral winter months which corresponds to when groundwaters have higher average 3h values compared to other times throughout the year fig 3c blue line the highest 3h groundwater values however were observed in may 2013 fig 3c averaging 1 16 0 29 tu rainfall values for δ2h and δ18o ranged from 48 7 to 15 7 and from 7 4 to 1 6 respectively between may 2013 and july 2016 based on rainfall δ18o and δ2h values a local meteoric water line lmwl for rottnest island was calculated using a precipitation weighted least squares regression method crawford et al 2014 which is given by δ2h 6 6 δ18o 9 9 fig 4 the rottnest island lmwl lies right beside the lmwl for the perth region given by δ2h 6 7 δ18o 9 5 hollins et al 2018 fig 4 which was expected due to their close proximity average groundwater δ2h values range from 18 2 to 16 4 fig 3d table 1 over the study period while average groundwater δ18o values range from 4 2 to 3 9 fig 3e the groundwater data points lie on the rottnest lmwl which suggests a rainfall origin and that waters have not been significantly influenced by evaporation prior to recharge fig 4 the mean weighted precipitation isotope composition over the study period δ18o 3 67 δ2h 14 09 is more positive than most groundwater samples fig 4 while average δ18o and δ2h groundwater values are fairly constant throughout the study period there does appear to be a very slight upward trend in δ2h values as indicated with the average groundwater line in blue fig 3d 4 2 groundwater residence times the 3h values in shallow groundwaters 4 20 m below ground surface on rottnest island vary significantly which is an important finding when considering most groundwater age assessments use 3h from one sampling event as a result the most accurate way to use the 3h values to calculate groundwater residence times is to use a lpm as it takes into consideration the source 3h fluctuations and allows for the determination of more accurate mean residence times the determination of an lpm from a single tracer such as tritium measured in a single sample is non unique jurgens et al 2012 the reason for this is tritium has an input history concentration change over time as a result measured tritium concentrations can correspond to more than one mean age the lpm results show that a combination of 3h and 18o tracers are required to achieve a good model fit at the study site table 2 and table s2 with the use of 3h and 18o individually resulting in significantly higher model errors as high as 441 average error table 2 compared to when both tracers are used whereby errors were generally 10 the mean residence time values from the combined tracer models are used in this study the binary mixing models were expected to be superior over the single lumped parameter models due to the karstic nature of the tamala limestone however the single dispersion models produced consistently lower errors compared to the binary mixing models table s2 and this may be due to the young eogenetic limestones on rottnest island which have limited karstification and therefore exhibit porous media behaviour the dispersion model likely addresses the dual flow properties of the karst and the modelled residence times provide a mean age which will be a mixture of both younger and older waters the limited role of karsification is supported by the relatively young ages of the tamala limestone formation hearty 2003 lipar and webb 2014 the mean residence times from all dual tracer models range from a minimum of 12 years to a maximum of 65 years table 2 table s2 overall the dispersion model dm performs most consistently in terms of error across all sites for the dual tracers with more consistent mean residence times range 12 36 years and low errors regularly achieved across each site 0 8 to 3 8 most fresh groundwater samples from the lens were calculated to have mean residence times between 12 and 18 years this indicates groundwaters were recharged over the most recent period of rainfall decline experienced for south west western australia however samples in the nw of the lens well 6 90 table s2 were calculated to have double the mean residence time 36 years of wells sampled in other areas of the lens fig 5 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal changes the temporal groundwater data appears to indicate that increasing aet and low rainfall produce higher cl concentrations in groundwater which coincide with low water levels and decrease in 3h values in some wells although rottnest island has a high potential for evaporation we see no direct evidence of evaporation in the δ2h and δ18o values for the groundwater rather they closely resemble rainfall plotting close to the lwml fig 4 in fact four recharge pulses can be identified during the monitoring period as inferred from decreases in cl concentration in groundwater coinciding with periods of rainfall with low cl content and higher winter rainfall amounts prior to sampling the seasonal change in the cl concentration suggests that rainfall recharge dilutes the groundwater transpiration results in the increase of cl concentrations in the soil water or groundwater without 18o enrichment in the root zone farquhar et al 2007 this would explain the observation in our dataset because we do not see enrichment in δ2h and δ18o values this has also been observed in the tamala limestone on the mainland of australia treble et al 2016 whereby the cl concentrations in cave drip waters were affected by transpiration and the drip water did not show isotopic enrichment associated with evaporation the modelled awap data shows that transpiration on rottnest island accounts for up to 60 of aet fig 2c this means that direct evaporation is also significant which would leave an imprint on the isotopic signature unless the evaporation is complete smaller rainfall events are susceptible to direct evaporation as they are not transmitted into the deeper parts of the soil as rapidly as high intensity rainfall events complete evaporation of these small rainfall amounts does indeed fit with the observed bias of the groundwater towards rainfall with a depleted isotopic composition which is associated with the more intense rainfall events the cl concentration in the groundwater increased after periods with a p aet deficit fig 3 during the austral summer besides the dry summer of 2013 2014 when no variation in the timing of cl peaks in groundwaters were observed sporadic rainfall over the late spring and summer of 2014 15 and 2015 16 would allow for the flushing of cl concentrated by evapotranspiration in the unsaturated zone down to the water table which would subsequently increase the groundwater cl concentration similarly the complete evaporation of water from low intensity rainfall events that do not reach the water table and the remaining salts being flushed down by subsequent high intensity events would also produce an increase in cl with no enrichment in water isotopes furthermore the leaching of cl accumulated on the vegetation by dry deposition of airborne sea salts may further contribute to a rise of the groundwater cl concentration following the earliest rainfall after a dry period bresciani et al 2014 these cl accumulation mechanisms provide an explanation for the variation in cl peaks fig 3b three of the four recharge events were not large enough to change the groundwater 3h values to the rainfall highs that were observed in may 2013 fig 3c one reason might be that subsequent recharge events had lower 3h rainfall values but there is no evidence for this in the rainfall 3h record an explanation for the lower 3h values for the recharge events could be that the sampled groundwater becomes mixed with deeper older groundwater from various parts of the lens and that the rainfall amount over the three years was not large enough to displace the older groundwater in the sampled zones this fits with other studies of island freshwater lenses that found groundwaters increased in age to greater than 70 years at the fresh water saltwater interface röper et al 2012 it was also found by maloszewski et al 2002 by using 18o and 3h as tracers that transit times are monthly in comparison with the mean transit times of decades through a fissured porous aquifer 5 2 transition zone mixing an alternative explanation for why we see elevated cl and lower 3h values in the fresh water lens could be the change in location of the transition zone between summer and winter the most significant cl variations are found in the wells located closest to the coast in the nw area of the lens wells 6 90 3 93 and 6 93 green lines in fig 3b and are located in relatively close proximity 150 400 m to well 7 90 which is affected by seawater intrusion as described elsewhere bryan et al 2016 2017 yet the δ18o and δ2h values of groundwaters from these wells do not show clear evidence of seawater mixing this can be explained because the maximum possible seawater proportion was calculated to be between 0 2 and 2 0 of the total volume of water therefore this minor amount of seawater would not affect the δ18o isotopic value of the groundwater by more than 0 1 2 of a signal with 0 compared to 98 of a signal with 4 0 which is within the measurement error therefore the seasonal cl variation for the nw wells 6 90 3 93 and 6 93 could be the vertical movement of the transition zone this would lead to cl being transported upwards with deeper saline groundwater in summer due to the reduction in rainfall recharge which leads to a contraction of the thickness of the freshwater lens we do not have the data to prove conclusively whether the observed groundwater cl variations are driven primarily by unsaturated zone processes or the movement of the lens boundary with upward dispersion of cl from the transition zone however we have assessed that the possible impact from the latter on the mean residence time calculations to be insignificant because the less than 2 seawater contribution represents an uncertainty too small to be noted in the stable isotope analysis likewise it would only contribute a maximum of 2 of older 3h depleted transition zone water the potential error introduced in the model by a portion of older water from below is therefore small and constrained to the nw area of the lens considering the high transmissivity of the limestone it is expected that the lens volume will respond to the perturbations in recharge and sea level contraction of the freshwater lens during late summer when groundwater levels are lowest will occur because groundwater constantly discharges to the sea negligible rainfall recharge occurs and albeit to a small extent groundwater is withdrawn by pumping the rising water table due to rainfall recharge and cessation of pumping in winter will restore the lens volume the fresh saltwater interface thus moves up and down in response to the seasonality of the rainfall as has been shown for carbonate aquifers elsewhere post et al 2018 the drop in groundwater levels by the end of summer causes older 3h depleted groundwater with higher concentrations of cl to migrate upwards with the reverse occurring in the winter months when recharge occurs and provides an explanation for the observed inverse relationship between cl and 3h in many of the wells in the nw region 5 3 episodic recharge temporal variations in the dataset suggest various rainfall patterns are governing the observed seasonal trends in the data the may 2013 sampling campaign occurred after the wettest may on record in eight years in perth resulting from a low pressure system comprised of multiple cold fronts bom 2013 approximately 140 mm of rainfall was recorded in the 20 days prior with a large rainfall event comprised of 61 mm falling in 24 h on the 8th may 2013 20 days before and a further 10 5 mm falling in the following 24 hour period clear indications for recharge to the lens are provided by groundwater samples containing 3h may 2013 average groundwater 3h 1 16 0 29 tu similar to the rainfall for that month 1 24 tu unpublished ansto data and iaea wmo 2016 table s1 this event appeared to affect the entire system demonstrating the importance of episodic recharge by large rainfall events for the lens indeed some wells 1 83 3 77 and 4 83 had higher groundwater values than the rainfall input value table s1 suggesting the episodic recharge event had higher 3h contents than the monthly weighted average of rainfall the δ18o values of the groundwater are also lower than the mean δ18o value of winter precipitation fig 3e again supporting the suggestion that episodic rainfall events that have a lighter isotopic signature contribute to recharge as well as the regular winter rains combined with the observation that lpm modelling of the 18o tracer perth monthly rainfall resulted in δ18o values more positive than the observed groundwater δ18o data causing a consistent negative model fit table 2 the results show that such episodic events may be more important than seasonal winter recharge in maintaining the volume of the fresh water lens this assessment is supported by the study undertaken by barron et al 2012 who found that for most climates in australia the correlation between recharge and the annual rainfall parameters reflecting rainfall intensity were stronger than the correlation between modelled recharge and total annual rainfall furthermore studies in the golgotha cave in the tamala limestone on the mainland found that cave drip rates which are indicative of recharge remained almost constant for a period of several years mahmud et al 2016 treble et al 2013 2016 despite highly seasonal winter precipitation and a summer soil moisture deficit as on rottnest island the may 2013 recharge event had a strong impact on the hydrology of the limestone of the golgotha cave with drip rates abruptly increasing after years of near constancy mahmud et al 2016 5 4 implications for future recharge the finding from this study that episodic rainfall is a major contributor to groundwater recharge from winter rainfall is important and this assessment would not be possible without seasonal time series data this is because under climate projections of decreased total rainfall for the region crosbie et al 2012 ng et al 2010 recharge may be sustained if the frequency of high intensity rainfall events were to increase significantly the groundwater recharged over the past few decades with mean residence times ranging from 12 to 36 years occurred during the ongoing lower than average rainfall periods experienced in the south west western australia region this leads to questions about the impact of recharge variations with future predictions of rainfall from global climate models suggesting that the region could see further declines in winter rainfall by approximately 40 from the 1911 1970 average delworth and zeng 2014 several factors are expected to contribute to the change in climate including an enhancement of atmospheric surface pressure over parts of australia which are consistent with a southerly shift and intensification of the subtropical ridge and the hadley cell delworth and zeng 2014 the modelled rainfall decline is also affected by the long term increasing trend in the southern annular mode which results in a southerly shift of westerly winds and rain producing storms delworth and zeng 2014 producing a further reduction in winter rainfall this is likely to affect recharge to the freshwater lens which in turn will affect the extent of the fresh groundwater store at the study site further investigations are required to deduce the impact of soil moisture conditions on recharge nagra et al 2017 determined a recharge threshold value of about 90 mm for the tamala limestone on the mainland which emphasises the importance of large storm events like the may 2013 recharge event on rottnest island the occurrence of such large recharge events is infrequent in south west western australia and further investigations are required to determine the effect that climate change may have on both their frequency and intensity and on the resulting recharge potential ongoing monitoring of the freshwater lens into the future is thus essential to determine if the continued decrease in rainfall for the region is reflected by changes in the aquifer which is important for both the management of this resource and other shallow unconfined aquifers globally 6 conclusions the objective of this study was to investigate whether long term climate variability decadal or short term seasonal changes in rainfall were influencing the isotopic character of a freshwater lens on rottnest island the study was undertaken during a period of lower than average rainfall for the region may 2013 to august 2016 a large rainfall event in may 2013 allowed us to evaluate winter season vs episodic recharge mechanisms it was found that two key processes can result in the seasonal variation observed primarily the processes were reliant on the location of the monitoring wells within the lens in the centre of the lens the cl and 3h variations were governed by the seasonal variation for example increased cl and lower 3h during the summer months were driven by higher evapotranspiration and lower rainfall the groundwater residence times in this part of the aquifer range from 12 to 18 years in the nw section of the lens the shrinkage and upward movement of the freshwater lens when the water table falls in summeris possible the results from this study highlighted the importance of a time series approach including multiple parameters for monitoring shallow unconfined aquifers to have sufficient input data to drive a process based model e g lumped parameter model and to ensure that seasonal variability is captured groundwater studies of freshwater lenses should not rely on a single sampling campaign because this study shows the seasonal variability is large the 3h values in shallow aquifers can vary considerably over a study period for example the greatest observed 3h variation in a single groundwater well ranged from 0 54 tu to 1 67 tu this observation is important for using 3h as a dating and modelling tool groundwater cl concentrations were indicative of recharge processes highlighting the importance of evapotranspiration while 3h was important for the deduction of the long term recharge trends and also illustrates the importance of large episodic rainfall events the identification of a dual recharge regime with contributions from both winter rainfall and episodic events has important implications for understanding the future fate of the freshwater lens declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
