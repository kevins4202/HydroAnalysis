18340,a recent investigation has demonstrated that peroxymonosulfate pms a peroxide commonly applied as a radical precursor during advanced oxidation processes aops can degrade organic contaminants without the involvement of radicals however little is known about this non radical reaction mechanism in this study the reactivity of pms with several nitrogenous compounds was investigated fluoroquinolone antibiotics except for flumequine were rapidly degraded by direct pms oxidation followed by aliphatic amines e g metoprolol and venlafaxine and nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds e g adenine and caffeine at ph 8 the degradation rate of fluoroquinolones followed a second order kinetic and was highly ph and structure dependent unlike the radical based aops the direct degradation of contaminants by pms was less influenced by the scavenging effect of the water matrix high resolution mass spectrometry hrms analysis demonstrated that the piperazine ring of fluoroquinolones was the main reaction site results showed that the direct electron transfer from nitrogenous moieties piperazine ring to pms can produce amide and aldehyde compounds an amide containing transformation product of ciprofloxacin m z 320 showing the highest signal intensity on hrms was previously recorded during ozonation moreover the hydroxylamine analogue of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin n oxide were tentatively identified and the formation of the latter was not impacted by the dissolved oxygen in water these results suggested that pms also reacts with nitrogenous compounds via oxygen transfer pathway agar disk diffusion tests indicated that pms treatment efficiently removed the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin with the complete degradation of parent antibiotic except for the transformation products in an earlier stage which might still exert antibacterial potency graphical abstract image 1 keywords peroxymonosulfate nitrogenous compounds high resolution mass spectrometry

without the contribution of radicals yang et al 2018 however little is known about the reaction mechanism of this non radical process previous studies have reported that sulfur containing compounds thioether sulfur of β lactam antibiotics can be substituted by the oxygen from pms to produce sulfoxide products chen et al 2018 however the oxygen substitution pathway can be affected by steric hindrance especially for contaminants with complex structures chen et al 2018 pms is a strong electron acceptor with redox potential e 0 hso5 hso4 2 1 82 vnhe steele and appelman 1982 because of its strong electrophilic character pms can oxidize degrade contaminants by electron withdrawing with carbon nanotube as electron transfer mediator yun et al 2017 it has been reported that pms can rapidly inactivate the disease associated prion protein in this process the amino acid residues of prion protein were oxidized by pms through the formation of methionine sulfone and hydroxylated tryptophan residues chesney et al 2016 the transformation of methionine sulfoxide to methionine sulfone might be explained by the oxygen transfer mechanism mentioned above however the formation of hydroxylated tryptophan residues suggested that there might be other reaction pathways for the pms non radical process especially for nitrogenous compounds in this study the reactivity of pms with various nitrogen containing compounds was investigated including nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds aliphatic amines and fluoroquinolones table 1 degradation kinetics experiments i e involving the effect of ph and common water matrix components were conducted on the selected fluoroquinolones due to their high reactivity with pms fluoroquinolones are among the most consumed antibiotic classes in the world due to their resistance to biodegradation and high adsorption affinity fluoroquinolones show long half life times in the environment e g 10 6 days in surface water and 580 days in soil fluoroquinolones have been detected in wastewater surface water groundwater and sediment soil at concentrations ranging from ng l to mg l van doorslaer et al 2014 as shown in table 1 fluoroquinolones are characterized by a core quinolone ring structure containing a nitrogen atom ciprofloxacin norfloxacin and enrofloxacin also have a piperazine ring with two more amine nitrogen atoms the transformation products of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin after pms exposure were tentatively identified by high resolution mass spectrometry ms2 and ms3 fragmentation were applied for most compounds for structural identification based on the characteristics of the transformation products possible reaction mechanisms of pms reaction with nitrogenous compounds were proposed agar diffusion tests were applied to investigate the residual antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin after pms oxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher and used as received

fluorophenyl piperazine 97 metoprolol 98 5 venlafaxine 98 tert butanol 99 and ethanol pure were purchased from sigma aldrich the suwannee river hydrophobic acid fraction was previously isolated croué et al 2000 and used to study the effect of natural organic matter nom on the degradation rate of ciprofloxacin by pms all solutions were prepared in ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm milli q purelab classic 2 2 experimental procedures experiments were conducted in amber glass bottles at room temperature 22 1 c predetermined volumes of target compounds and pms stock solutions were injected into 25 ml of 10 mm phosphate ph 6 2 8 or borate ph 8 2 11 buffer to obtain the desired initial concentrations samples were periodically collected and quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate for most experiments the initial concentrations used for target compound and pms were 5 and 100 μm respectively to better identify the transformation products high concentrations of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin 50 μm were treated with 50 μm and 1 mm of pms the influence of dissolved oxygen on the formation of transformation products from enrofloxacin was investigated by purging the solution before pms spiking with n2 until the dissolved oxygen concentration was reduced to 0 21 mg l the solution was kept in n2 purging throughout the experiment 20 min the concentration of dissolved oxygen was measured using a wtw oxi 330 oxygen meter for antibacterial activity tests 5 μm of ciprofloxacin was degraded by 100 and 250 μm pms most experiments were conducted at least in duplicate 2 3 analytical methods a quantitative analysis of target compounds was conducted with a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1100 coupled with a diode array detector dad agilent 1100 and an xdb c18 column 5 μm 4 6 150 mm agilent mobile phase composition followed various isocratic mixtures of methanol or acetonitrile with 10 mm phosphate buffer all compounds were analysed at their maximum uv absorption detailed information on hplc methods is provided in the supporting information section table s1 the concentration of the residual pms was determined according to an abts colorimetric method previously published zhang et al 2016 briefly 1 ml of sample was spiked into a mixed solution of 0 5 ml of abts 20 mm and 0 2 ml of coso4 20 mm then allowed to react for 1 min where a green colored abts radical was formed then 10 ml of h2so4 2 was immediately added followed by the spectrometric measurement at 734 nm cary 60 agilent the transformation products of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin were identified

chemaxon https chemicalize com accessed in july 2019 2 4 antibacterial activity test agar disk diffusion tests were conducted to investigate the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin 5 μm after pms exposure 100 and 250 μm using escherichia coli b e coli b as the test microorganism according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi 2012 briefly lysogeny lb agar plates were inoculated with 100 μl of an overnight culture of e coli b equivalent to 0 5 mcfarland then blank antibiotic cartridges approximately 6 mm in diameter containing the test solutions were placed on the agar surface the diameters of inhibition zones around discs were measured after the plate was incubated overnight at 37 c a wider zone of no growth indicates a stronger antibacterial activity of the test solution the removal of ciprofloxacin antibacterial activity after pms exposure was determined by comparing the diameters of the inhibition zones from pms treated samples of ciprofloxacin and the ciprofloxacin standards with known concentrations 0 2 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 μm each sample was tested in triplicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactivity of pms with various nitrogen containing compounds the degradation of the selected nitrogenous compounds by pms was individually studied in the absence of chemical catalysts or uv irradiation less than 20 of the selected nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds i e adenine cytosine benzotriazole and caffeine were removed at ph 8 within 90 min fig 1 a approximately 40 of venlafaxine aliphatic tertiary amine was eliminated at ph 8 for the same time frame which was faster than metoprolol aliphatic secondary amine the degradation of metoprolol and venlafaxine by pms was influenced by ph suggesting that the amine group was likely the main reaction site the degradation rates were faster at ph 9 than at ph 8 for both compounds possibly due to the higher proportion of deprotonated molecules at higher ph venlafaxine was degraded faster than metoprolol in both conditions revealing that pms might be more reactive with tertiary amines than secondary amines the degradation efficiencies of fluoroquinolones and their related compounds significantly varied depending on their structural characteristics fig 1b flumequine a fluoroquinolone without a piperazine ring table 1 was stable in the presence of pms in these experimental conditions suggesting that pms does not react with quinolone rings the cyclopropane ring of ciprofloxacin cip is substituted by an ethyl group in norfloxacin 1 2 fluorophenyl piperazine has a fluorobenzene ring instead of the quinolone ring however cip norfloxacin and 1 2 fluorophenyl piperazine have the same piperazine ring structure and exhibited comparable degradation rates toward pms 80 removal within 90 min these results indicated that the piperazine ring was the main reaction site for pms this was further supported by lc hrms analyses section 3 4 from which only piperazine ring cleavage products were identified after pms exposure the n4 cip in table 1 for atom numbering in the piperazine ring of enrofloxacin enr is substituted by an ethyl group tertiary amine which differs from cip secondary amine enr was degraded considerably faster than cip a result that was consistent with the above evidence that tertiary amines were more susceptible to pms attack than secondary amines overall results suggested that pms was more reactive towards fluoroquinolones except for flumequine than the selected nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds and aliphatic amines at ph 8 more detailed experiments were conducted on cip and enr to study the reaction mechanism of pms with nitrogenous compounds 3 2 degradation kinetics of fluoroquinolones by pms the presence of excess ethanol t buoh and nan3 did not affect the degradation kinetic of cip fig s1 which confirmed previous findings that no so4 oh and 1o2 were involved during the oxidation of fluoroquinolones by pms zhou et al 2018 the degradation of cip was promoted by increasing the initial pms dose 25 250 μm following pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 99 fig 2 a the measured rate constants k o b s were derived from the slope of ln c c0 versus time as shown in fig 2b k o b s exhibited a linear relationship toward the initial pms dose suggesting that the overall reaction rate can be described by the second order kinetic according to equations 1 and 2 the apparent second order rate constant k a p p of cip with pms was calculated as 5 28 0 08 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 2 which was comparable with previously reported results by zhou et al 2018 6 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 1 d c i p d t k o b s c i p 2 d c i p d t k a p p c i p p m s as illustrated in fig 3 the degradation efficiency k a p p of cip and enr by pms were highly ph dependent the ph dependent reactivity of fluoroquinolones was also observed with free chlorine dodd et al 2005 manganese oxide zhang and huang 2005 ozone dodd et al 2006 and chlorine dioxide wang et al 2010 the ph dependence of fluoroquinolones degradation can be explained by the change in the distribution of fluoroquinolones and pms acid base species with ph zhou et al 2018 the pk a values of cip and enr relevant to these experimental conditions were provided in table 1 pk a1 and pk a2 were related to the deprotonation of the carboxylic group and the protonation of n4 in the piperazine ring respectively scheme s1 takács novák et al 1990 pms dissociated into so5 2 at alkaline ph hso5 h2o so5 2 h3o pk a2 9 4 ball and edwards 1956 the k a p p values of cip and enr increased with increasing molar fraction of the anionic species fig 3 suggesting that the anion forms of cip and enr were most susceptible to pms oxidation in general n4 in piperazine ring is deprotonated when cip and enr are present in anionic form consequently showing a stronger nucleophilic character the highest k a p p values of cip and enr were found at around ph 9 and ph 8 6 respectively then it sharply decreased with increasing relative abundance of so5 2 suggesting that so5 2 is a weaker oxidant compared to pms so5 2 was also reported as less reactive than pms with β lactam antibiotics due to its weaker electrophilic property chen et al 2018 notably pms showed higher reactivity towards enr than cip in all studied ph conditions 3 3 comparison with other peroxides and the effect of the water matrix the reactivity of pms was compared with other peroxides unlike pms pds and h2o2 did not react with cip under the same experimental conditions fig 4 these results suggested that pds and h2o2 as symmetric peroxides tend to be more stable whereas pms is a more efficient electron acceptor possibly due to its asymmetric structure lei et al 2016 this is consistent with previous findings indicating that pms was more efficient compared to pds for the removal of organic contaminants during the mediated electron transfer through carbon nanotubes yun et al 2017 2018 the water matrix components can compete with the target contaminants to consume radicals during aops consequently lowering the treatment efficiency the effect of the common water matrix components i e nom chloride and bicarbonate ions on the degradation of cip by pms was investigated unlike the radical based aops the degradation of cip by pms was not impacted by the presence of 5 mm of chloride and bicarbonate ions fig 5 pms was previously reported to oxidize chloride ion into chlorine which can contribute to contaminant degradation fortnum et al 1960 however the acceleration of the cip degradation rate was not observed in this study upon the addition of 5 mm of chloride this can be explained by the insufficient formation of chlorine due to the low reaction rate constant of chloride with pms 1 4 10 3 m 1 s 1 fortnum et al 1960 which was about three orders of magnetic lower than the k a p p of cip with pms in this study 5 28 0 08 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 2 the addition of 5 mg c l nom slightly inhibited the removal of cip suggesting that pms can react with nom 3 4 transformation products eleven transformation products of cip after pms oxidation were detected by lc hrms table 2 their structures were tentatively proposed based on the accurate mass derived from hrms and ms2 ms3 fragmentation patterns figs s2 s13 the proposed structures indicated that the degradation of cip occurred by the hydroxylation and dealkylation of the piperazine ring with the subsequent formation of aldehyde and amide moieties the core quinolone ring of cip remained intact and no defluorination or decarboxylation products were detected which were the known transformation products of cip during fenton oxidation giri and golder 2014 so4 jiang et al 2016 and photolytic reactions paul et al 2010 these results were consistent with the fact that flumequine which does not incorporate a piperazine ring did not react with pms fig 1b several transformation products e g p263 p291 p306 p334 p348 p362 and p364 were also obtained during the oxidative transformation of cip by manganese oxide zhang and huang 2005 chlorine dioxide wang et al 2010 permanganate hu et al 2011 and ferrate vi yang et al 2016a revealing that pms may share a similar reaction mechanism with these oxidants however structural isomers corresponding to cip with one additional oxygen atom p348a and p348b or two additional oxygen atoms p364a and p364b were detected in this study particularly p348a and p348b shared the same molecular weight but different ms2 ms3 spectra figs s9 and s10 respectively and retention time p348a was proposed as a hydroxylated analogue of cip with a hydroxyl group located on α carbon whereas p348b was a hydroxylamine compound this may be further supported by the calculated distribution coefficient logd at ph 2 3 ph of lc hrms mobile phase p348b had a higher logd 1 15 than p348a 2 05 consequently showing a longer retention time on the reverse phase column p348b was believed to be rearranged from its n oxide analogue which is a known mechanism for primary and secondary amines hübner et al 2015 most transformation products except for p263 p306 and p348 were not reported in a previous study on the oxidation of 20 μm cip by 0 1 mm pms zhou et al 2018 likely because higher cip 50 μm was applied in the current study to maximize the formation of by products moreover the hrms signal intensity of most products e g p320 p334 p291 reached their maximum when the pms exposure was above 8 mm min fig 6 which was achieved by initially applying 1 mm pms in this study to the best of our knowledge the transformation product p320 has only been reported from the ozonation of cip liu et al 2012 the ms3 spectrum fig s6b of p320 exhibited a dominant ion cluster m z 258 corresponding to the loss of an amide group ch2on from the major ion cluster m z 302 in its ms2 spectrum fig s6a thus the postulated structure of p320 is an amide moiety formed at the secondary aliphatic amine n4 of the piperazine ring fig 6 presents the evolution of the normalized chromatographic peak areas of cip and its transformation products with pms exposure p320 exerted the largest peak area among all identified transformation products i e close to the sum of the peak areas of all transformation products p320 was rapidly formed with the degradation of cip and reached a plateau p263 which refers to the complete loss of the piperazine ring gradually increased with exposure time thus p320 and p263 were the final products in these experimental conditions while all other compounds were intermediates showing a maximum production at different oxidant exposures for example p334b and p362 reached their highest peak areas at 8 and 15 mm min respectively while p320 almost reached a plateau indicating that p334b and p362 were unlikely the intermediates of p320 hydroxylated products p376 and p392 were the major by products after pms oxidation of enr table s3 which was in accordance with a previous study zhou et al 2018 like cip two structural isomers of enr with an additional oxygen atom i e p376a and p376b were identified p376a was proposed as a hydroxylated enr on α carbon while p376b was a n oxide analogue of enr although further confirmation with analytical standards is needed the logd value of p376 b at ph 2 3 1 09 was considerably higher than enr 1 19 and p376a 1 65 consistent with its longer retention time on the lc hrms chromatogram table s3 previous investigations have demonstrated that n oxide analogues of tertiary amines have higher retention times than their precursors on reverse phase columns merel et al 2017 a transformation product of enr after pms oxidation was detected on the hplc uv chromatogram fig s14 which was eluted after the enr peak and proposed as p376b based on an assumption that the eluting order of compounds was comparable on lc hrms and hplc uv coupled with similar reverse phase c18 columns the hplc uv peak area of p376b did not change during the experiments conducted with and without n2 purged solutions fig s15 these results suggested that the dissolved oxygen did not contribute to the formation of enr n oxide alternatively the oxygen likely originated from pms itself the n oxide formation was also proposed for enr oxidized by ozone dodd et al 2006 manganese oxide zhang and huang 2005 and permanganate xu et al 2016 3 5 proposed reaction mechanisms in accordance with the postulated structures of the transformation products and the evolution of their peak areas on lc hrms chromatograms reaction mechanisms for the oxidative transformation of cip by pms were proposed scheme 1 a the reaction was initiated by the direct electron transfer from the piperazine ring to pms in this process pms acted as an electron acceptor rather than a radical precursor to directly oxidize cip the n4 atom of piperazine ring was the critical site for the electrophilic attack of pms the n1 atom is known as less reactive to electrophiles than n4 due to its direct connection to the fluoroquinolone ring substituted by strong electron withdrawing fluorine and cooh dodd et al 2005 giri and golder 2014 nevertheless previous studies have demonstrated that the piperazine ring should be considered as a whole reaction centre with the contribution of both nitrogen atoms to electron transfer wang et al 2010 this could explain the higher reactivity of pms with piperazine ring containing compounds compared to aliphatic amines metoprolol and venlafaxine as shown in fig 1 the initial electron transfer from the piperazine ring to pms produces an imine intermediate ia scheme 1a as proposed by dodd et al 2005 and wang et al 2010 for the oxidation of cip by free chlorine and chlorine dioxide respectively the hydrolysis of the imine intermediate rapidly induced the dealkylation of the piperazine ring to generate p306 the subsequent electron transfer from the amine group of p306 to pms was followed by hydrolysis producing p320 the presence of highly electron withdrawing carbonyl group in p320 possibly limited the electron transfer from amide n to pms thus p320 was stable in the presence of excess pms fig 6a the formation of hydroxylated products p348a and p364 suggested the presence of a similar enamine intermediate ib scheme 1a which has been proposed for the reactions of permanganate hu et al 2011 and ferrate iv yang et al 2016a with cip the double bond of enamine can be oxidized to aldehyde moieties p362 p334 and p291 leading to the complete degradation of piperazine ring the oxygen transfer from pms to secondary amine cip generates n oxide intermediate ic scheme 1a which subsequently rearranged to hydroxylamine compound p348b lee and von gunten 2016 as shown in fig 6b the intensity of p348b reached the maximum at 3 mm min and rapidly decreased with pms exposure suggesting that p348b was subjected to further reactions in the presence of excess pms the oxygen transfer pathway might involve the transfer of the distal oxygen in the peroxide bond of pms to cip an oxygen transfer mechanism was also proposed for the oxidation of arsenite as iii to as v by pms wang et al 2014 the thioether sulfur of β lactam antibiotics can be substituted by the oxygen from pms to produce sulfoxide products chen et al 2018 the aniline moieties of sulfonamide antibiotics can be converted to nitroso or nitrobenzene moieties through pms oxygen substitution yin et al 2018 pms was also proposed to react with tertiary amine enr via oxygen transfer to generate enr n oxide p376b scheme 1b the direct electron transfer pathway also occurred during pms oxidation of enr and led to the hydroxylation on α carbon to produce p376a and p392 based on the degradation pathway of cip it was postulated that the hydroxylated products p392 might undergo further oxidation followed by the dealkylation of the piperazine ring additional investigation is needed to confirm the major pathway of pms reaction electron transfer vs oxygen transfer with nitrogenous compounds which might be helpful to explain the different reaction potential of pms towards secondary and tertiary amine moieties as mentioned above 3 6 antibacterial activity assays fluoroquinolones inhibit the bacterial dna replication by hydrogen binding and charge interactions with the relaxed dna the core quinolone structure would be responsible for dna binding dodd et al 2006 while the fluorine substitute plays an important role in inhibiting the dna gyrase and enhancing cell permeation serna galvis et al 2017 based on lc hrms results the transformation products of cip after pms treatment still retained the core quinolone structure raising concerns about the residual antibacterial activity thus agar diffusion assays were conducted with e coli b as an indicator as shown in fig 7 the antibacterial activity of the solution gradually reduced with the removal of cip during pms treatment however after 40 50 removal of cip with 100 μm of pms the sample resulted in a larger inhibition zone in the agar plate than cip standard solutions this result indicated that the transformation products at an earlier stage e g hydroxylamine product p348b fig 6b might still exert antibacterial potency the residual antibacterial activity was efficiently removed with the complete degradation of cip suggesting that the major final products p320 and p263 showed negligible antibacterial activity compared to cip the structural modifications on the piperazine ring alter the acid base speciation and significantly affect fluoroquinolones cell permeation paul et al 2010 although the amide and aldehyde moieties produced after pms exposure kept the core quinolone structure in this study their physicochemical characteristics might be significantly different from those of cip consequently reducing their uptake by bacteria cell and binding to dna the current results were in agreement with previous findings reporting that the photolytic transformation products of cip retaining the quinolone ring significantly diminished the antibacterial potency of the parent antibiotic paul et al 2010 4 conclusion pms can efficiently degrade the selected fluoroquinolones except for flumequine followed by aliphatic amines and nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds the common water matrix components e g bicarbonate and chloride ions did not impact the degradation rate of cip by pms the electron transfer from the piperazine ring of cip to pms induced the dealkylation and hydroxylation of the molecule and led to the formation of amide and aldehyde moieties pms was also proposed to react with cip and enr via oxygen transfer to produce hydroxylamine analogue of cip and enr n oxide respectively pms efficiently removed the antibacterial activity of cip however the transformation products in earlier stages of the reaction still exerted antibacterial potency a complete elimination of the parent compound as well as its transformation products is required during the fluoroquinolone treatment by pms the findings of this study suggested that the direct pms oxidation can be selectively applied for the removal of nitrogenous compounds e g fluoroquinolones however some persistent transformation products e g n oxides can be formed which are inert to the biodegradation hübner et al 2015 unlike radical based processes this treatment can maintain its efficiency in complex water matrixes however nom slightly inhibited the degradation of cip by pms therefore additional studies are needed to investigate the reactivity of pms with nom fractions of different characteristics to optimize the pms dose for its best treatment efficiency because environmental components e g nitrogen and sulfur containing organics chen et al 2018 yang et al 2018 are susceptible to react with pms the non radical pathway might hinder the formation of radicals during pms activated aops consequently limiting the removal of the targeted hazardous compounds the electron and oxygen transfer pathways proposed in this study assist in understanding the non radical reaction mechanism of pms with organic contaminants and in predicting the formation of potential transformation products similar mechanistic studies and screening of transformation products can be extended to other oxidants used during water treatment which also have similar peroxide bond and asymmetric

18340,a recent investigation has demonstrated that peroxymonosulfate pms a peroxide commonly applied as a radical precursor during advanced oxidation processes aops can degrade organic contaminants without the involvement of radicals however little is known about this non radical reaction mechanism in this study the reactivity of pms with several nitrogenous compounds was investigated

adenine and caffeine at ph 8 the degradation rate of fluoroquinolones followed a second order kinetic and was highly ph and structure dependent unlike the radical based aops the direct degradation of contaminants by pms was less influenced by the scavenging effect of the water matrix high resolution mass spectrometry hrms analysis demonstrated that the piperazine ring of fluoroquinolones was the main reaction site results showed that the direct electron transfer from nitrogenous moieties piperazine ring to pms can produce amide and aldehyde compounds an amide containing transformation product of ciprofloxacin m z 320 showing the highest signal intensity on hrms was previously recorded during ozonation moreover the hydroxylamine analogue of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin n oxide were tentatively identified and the formation of the latter was not impacted by the dissolved oxygen in water these results suggested that pms also reacts with nitrogenous compounds via oxygen transfer

thioether sulfur of β lactam antibiotics can be substituted by the oxygen from pms to produce sulfoxide products chen et al 2018 however the oxygen substitution pathway can be affected by steric hindrance especially for contaminants with complex structures chen et al 2018 pms is a strong electron acceptor with redox potential e 0 hso5 hso4 2 1 82 vnhe steele and appelman 1982 because of its strong electrophilic character pms can oxidize degrade contaminants by electron withdrawing with carbon nanotube as electron transfer mediator yun et al 2017 it has been reported that pms can rapidly inactivate the disease associated prion protein in this process the amino acid residues of prion protein were oxidized by pms through the formation of methionine sulfone and hydroxylated tryptophan residues chesney et al 2016 the transformation of methionine sulfoxide to methionine sulfone might be explained by the oxygen transfer mechanism mentioned above however the formation of hydroxylated tryptophan residues suggested that there might be other reaction pathways for the pms non radical process especially for nitrogenous compounds in this study the reactivity of pms with various nitrogen containing compounds was investigated including nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds aliphatic amines and fluoroquinolones table 1 degradation kinetics experiments i e involving the effect of ph and common water matrix components were conducted on the selected fluoroquinolones due to their high reactivity with pms fluoroquinolones are among the most consumed antibiotic classes in the world due to their resistance to biodegradation and high adsorption affinity fluoroquinolones show long half life times in the environment e g 10 6 days in surface water and 580 days in soil fluoroquinolones have been detected in wastewater surface water groundwater and sediment soil at concentrations ranging from ng l to mg l van doorslaer et al 2014 as shown in table 1 fluoroquinolones are characterized by a core quinolone ring structure containing a nitrogen atom ciprofloxacin norfloxacin and enrofloxacin also have a piperazine ring with two more amine nitrogen atoms the transformation products of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin after pms exposure were tentatively identified by high resolution mass spectrometry ms2 and ms3 fragmentation were applied for most compounds for structural identification based on the characteristics of the transformation products possible reaction mechanisms of pms reaction with nitrogenous compounds were proposed agar diffusion tests were applied to investigate the residual antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin after pms oxidation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents all chemicals were of analytical grade or higher and used as received

et al 2000 and used to study the effect of natural organic matter nom on the degradation rate of ciprofloxacin by pms all solutions were prepared in ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm milli q purelab classic 2 2 experimental procedures experiments were conducted in amber glass bottles at room temperature 22 1 c predetermined volumes of target compounds and pms stock solutions were injected into 25 ml of 10 mm phosphate ph 6 2 8 or borate ph 8 2 11 buffer to obtain the desired initial concentrations samples were periodically collected and quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate for most experiments the initial concentrations used for target compound and pms were 5 and 100 μm respectively to better identify the transformation products high concentrations of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin 50 μm were treated with 50 μm and 1 mm of pms the influence of dissolved oxygen on the formation of transformation products from enrofloxacin was investigated by purging the solution before pms spiking with n2 until the dissolved oxygen concentration was reduced to 0 21 mg l the solution was kept in n2 purging throughout the experiment 20 min the concentration of dissolved oxygen was measured using a wtw oxi 330 oxygen meter for antibacterial activity tests 5 μm of ciprofloxacin was degraded by 100 and 250 μm pms most experiments were conducted at least in duplicate 2 3 analytical methods a quantitative analysis of target compounds was conducted with a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1100 coupled with a diode array detector dad agilent 1100 and an xdb c18 column 5 μm 4 6 150 mm agilent mobile phase composition followed various isocratic mixtures of methanol or acetonitrile with 10 mm phosphate buffer all compounds were analysed at their maximum uv absorption detailed information on hplc methods is provided in the supporting information section table s1 the concentration of the residual pms was determined according to an abts colorimetric method previously published zhang et al 2016 briefly 1 ml of sample was spiked into a mixed solution of 0 5 ml of abts 20 mm and 0 2 ml of coso4 20 mm then allowed to react for 1 min where a green colored abts radical was formed then 10 ml of h2so4 2 was immediately added followed by the spectrometric measurement at 734 nm cary 60 agilent the transformation products of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin were identified

chemaxon https chemicalize com accessed in july 2019 2 4 antibacterial activity test agar disk diffusion tests were conducted to investigate the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin 5 μm after pms exposure 100 and 250 μm using escherichia coli b e coli b as the test microorganism according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute clsi 2012 briefly lysogeny lb agar plates were inoculated with 100 μl of an overnight culture of e coli b equivalent to 0 5 mcfarland then blank antibiotic cartridges approximately 6 mm in diameter containing the test solutions were placed on the agar surface the diameters of inhibition zones around discs were measured after the plate was incubated overnight at 37 c a wider zone of no growth indicates a stronger antibacterial activity of the test solution the removal of ciprofloxacin antibacterial activity after pms exposure was determined by comparing the diameters of the inhibition zones from pms treated samples of ciprofloxacin and the ciprofloxacin standards with known concentrations 0 2 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 μm each sample was tested in triplicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactivity of pms with various nitrogen containing compounds the degradation of the selected nitrogenous compounds by pms was individually studied in the absence of chemical catalysts or uv irradiation less than 20 of the selected nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds i e adenine cytosine benzotriazole and caffeine were removed at ph 8 within 90 min fig 1 a approximately 40 of venlafaxine aliphatic tertiary amine was eliminated at ph 8 for the same time frame which was faster than metoprolol aliphatic secondary amine the degradation of metoprolol and venlafaxine by pms was influenced by ph suggesting that the amine group was likely the main reaction site the degradation rates were faster at ph 9 than at ph 8 for both compounds possibly due to the higher proportion of deprotonated molecules at higher ph venlafaxine was degraded faster than metoprolol in both conditions revealing that pms might be more reactive with tertiary amines than secondary amines the degradation efficiencies of fluoroquinolones and their related compounds significantly varied depending on their structural characteristics fig 1b flumequine a fluoroquinolone without a piperazine ring table 1 was stable in the presence of pms in these experimental conditions suggesting that pms does not react with quinolone rings the cyclopropane ring of ciprofloxacin cip is substituted by an ethyl group in norfloxacin 1 2 fluorophenyl piperazine has a fluorobenzene ring instead of the quinolone ring however cip norfloxacin and 1 2 fluorophenyl piperazine have the same piperazine ring structure and exhibited comparable degradation rates toward pms 80 removal within 90 min these results indicated that the piperazine ring was the main reaction site for pms this was further supported by lc hrms analyses section 3 4 from which only piperazine ring cleavage products were identified after pms exposure the n4 cip in table 1 for atom numbering in the piperazine ring of enrofloxacin enr is substituted by an ethyl group tertiary amine which differs from cip secondary amine enr was degraded considerably faster than cip a result that was consistent with the above evidence that tertiary amines were more susceptible to pms attack than secondary amines overall results suggested that pms was more reactive towards fluoroquinolones except for flumequine than the selected nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds and aliphatic amines at ph 8 more detailed experiments were conducted on cip and enr to study the reaction mechanism of pms with nitrogenous compounds 3 2 degradation kinetics of fluoroquinolones by pms the presence of excess ethanol t buoh and nan3 did not affect the degradation kinetic of cip fig s1 which confirmed previous findings that no so4 oh and 1o2 were involved during the oxidation of fluoroquinolones by pms zhou et al 2018 the degradation of cip was promoted by increasing the initial pms dose 25 250 μm following pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 99 fig 2 a the measured rate constants k o b s were derived from the slope of ln c c0 versus time as shown in fig 2b k o b s exhibited a linear relationship toward the initial pms dose suggesting that the overall reaction rate can be described by the second order kinetic according to equations 1 and 2 the apparent second order rate constant k a p p of cip with pms was calculated as 5 28 0 08 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 2 which was comparable with previously reported results by zhou et al 2018 6 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 1 d c i p d t k o b s c i p 2 d c i p d t k a p p c i p p m s as illustrated in fig 3 the degradation efficiency k a p p of cip and enr by pms were highly ph dependent the ph dependent reactivity of fluoroquinolones was also observed with free chlorine dodd et al 2005 manganese oxide zhang and huang 2005 ozone dodd et al 2006 and chlorine dioxide wang et al 2010 the ph dependence of fluoroquinolones degradation can be explained by the change in the distribution of fluoroquinolones and pms acid base species with ph zhou et al 2018 the pk a values of cip and enr relevant to these experimental conditions were provided in table 1 pk a1 and pk a2 were related to the deprotonation of the carboxylic group and the protonation of n4 in the piperazine ring respectively scheme s1 takács novák et al 1990 pms dissociated into so5 2 at alkaline ph hso5 h2o so5 2 h3o pk a2 9 4 ball and edwards 1956 the k a p p values of cip and enr increased with increasing molar fraction of the anionic species fig 3 suggesting that the anion forms of cip and enr were most susceptible to pms oxidation in general n4 in piperazine ring is deprotonated when cip and enr are present in anionic form consequently showing a stronger nucleophilic character the highest k a p p values of cip and enr were found at around ph 9 and ph 8 6 respectively then it sharply decreased with increasing relative abundance of so5 2 suggesting that so5 2 is a weaker oxidant compared to pms so5 2 was also reported as less reactive than pms with β lactam antibiotics due to its weaker electrophilic property chen et al 2018 notably pms showed higher reactivity towards enr than cip in all studied ph conditions 3 3 comparison with other peroxides and the effect of the water matrix the reactivity of pms was compared with other peroxides unlike pms pds and h2o2 did not react with cip under the same experimental conditions fig 4 these results suggested that pds and h2o2 as symmetric peroxides tend to be more stable whereas pms is a more efficient electron acceptor possibly due to its asymmetric structure lei et al 2016 this is consistent with previous findings indicating that pms was more efficient compared to pds for the removal of organic contaminants during the mediated electron transfer through carbon nanotubes yun et al 2017 2018 the water matrix components can compete with the target contaminants to consume radicals during aops consequently lowering the treatment efficiency the effect of the common water matrix components i e nom chloride and bicarbonate ions on the degradation of cip by pms was investigated unlike the radical based aops the degradation of cip by pms was not impacted by the presence of 5 mm of chloride and bicarbonate ions fig 5 pms was previously reported to oxidize chloride ion into chlorine which can contribute to contaminant degradation fortnum et al 1960 however the acceleration of the cip degradation rate was not observed in this study upon the addition of 5 mm of chloride this can be explained by the insufficient formation of chlorine due to the low reaction rate constant of chloride with pms 1 4 10 3 m 1 s 1 fortnum et al 1960 which was about three orders of magnetic lower than the k a p p of cip with pms in this study 5 28 0 08 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 2 the addition of 5 mg c l nom slightly inhibited the removal of cip suggesting that pms can react with nom 3 4 transformation products eleven transformation products of cip after pms oxidation were detected by lc hrms table 2 their structures were tentatively proposed based on the accurate mass derived from hrms and ms2 ms3 fragmentation patterns figs s2 s13 the proposed structures indicated that the degradation of cip occurred by the hydroxylation and dealkylation of the piperazine ring with the subsequent formation of aldehyde and amide moieties the core quinolone ring of cip remained intact and no defluorination or decarboxylation products were detected which were the known transformation products of cip during fenton oxidation giri and golder 2014 so4 jiang et al 2016 and photolytic reactions paul et al 2010 these results were consistent with the fact that flumequine which does not incorporate a piperazine ring did not react with pms fig 1b several transformation products e g p263 p291 p306 p334 p348 p362 and p364 were also obtained during the oxidative transformation of cip by manganese oxide zhang and huang 2005 chlorine dioxide wang et al 2010 permanganate hu et al 2011 and ferrate vi yang et al 2016a revealing that pms may share a similar reaction mechanism with these oxidants however structural isomers corresponding to cip with one additional oxygen atom p348a and p348b or two additional oxygen atoms p364a and p364b were detected in this study particularly p348a and p348b shared the same molecular weight but different ms2 ms3 spectra figs s9 and s10 respectively and retention time p348a was proposed as a hydroxylated analogue of cip with a hydroxyl group located on α carbon whereas p348b was a hydroxylamine compound this may be further supported by the calculated distribution coefficient logd at ph 2 3 ph of lc hrms mobile phase p348b had a higher logd 1 15 than p348a 2 05 consequently showing a longer retention time on the reverse phase column p348b was believed to be rearranged from its n oxide analogue which is a known mechanism for primary and secondary amines hübner et al 2015 most transformation products except for p263 p306 and p348 were not reported in a previous study on the oxidation of 20 μm cip by 0 1 mm pms zhou et al 2018 likely because higher cip 50 μm was applied in the current study to maximize the formation of by products moreover the hrms signal intensity of most products e g p320 p334 p291 reached their maximum when the pms exposure was above 8 mm min fig 6 which was achieved by initially applying 1 mm pms in this study to the best of our knowledge the transformation product p320 has only been reported from the ozonation of cip liu et al 2012 the ms3 spectrum fig s6b of p320 exhibited a dominant ion cluster m z 258 corresponding to the loss of an amide group ch2on from the major ion cluster m z 302 in its ms2 spectrum fig s6a thus the postulated structure of p320 is an amide moiety formed at the secondary aliphatic amine n4 of the piperazine ring fig 6 presents the evolution of the normalized chromatographic peak areas of cip and its transformation products with pms exposure p320 exerted the largest peak area among all identified transformation products i e close to the sum of the peak areas of all transformation products p320 was rapidly formed with the degradation of cip and reached a plateau p263 which refers to the complete loss of the piperazine ring gradually increased with exposure time thus p320 and p263 were the final products in these experimental conditions while all other compounds were intermediates showing a maximum production at different oxidant exposures for example p334b and p362 reached their highest peak areas at 8 and 15 mm min respectively while p320 almost reached a plateau indicating that p334b and p362 were unlikely the intermediates of p320 hydroxylated products p376 and p392 were the major by products after pms oxidation of enr table s3 which was in accordance with a previous study zhou et al 2018 like cip two structural isomers of enr with an additional oxygen atom i e p376a and p376b were identified p376a was proposed as a hydroxylated enr on α carbon while p376b was a n oxide analogue of enr although further confirmation with analytical standards is needed the logd value of p376 b at ph 2 3 1 09 was considerably higher than enr 1 19 and p376a 1 65 consistent with its longer retention time on the lc hrms chromatogram table s3 previous investigations have demonstrated that n oxide analogues of tertiary amines have higher retention times than their precursors on reverse phase columns merel et al 2017 a transformation product of enr after pms oxidation was detected on the hplc uv chromatogram fig s14 which was eluted after the enr peak and proposed as p376b based on an assumption that the eluting order of compounds was comparable on lc hrms and hplc uv coupled with similar reverse phase c18 columns the hplc uv peak area of p376b did not change during the experiments conducted with and without n2 purged solutions fig s15 these results suggested that the dissolved oxygen did not contribute to the formation of enr n oxide alternatively the oxygen likely originated from pms itself the n oxide formation was also proposed for enr oxidized by ozone dodd et al 2006 manganese oxide zhang and huang 2005 and permanganate xu et al 2016 3 5 proposed reaction mechanisms in accordance with the postulated structures of the transformation products and the evolution of their peak areas on lc hrms chromatograms reaction mechanisms for the oxidative transformation of cip by pms were proposed scheme 1 a the reaction was initiated by the direct electron transfer from the piperazine ring to pms in this process pms acted as an electron acceptor rather than a radical precursor to directly oxidize cip the n4 atom of piperazine ring was the critical site for the electrophilic attack of pms the n1 atom is known as less reactive to electrophiles than n4 due to its direct connection to the fluoroquinolone ring substituted by strong electron withdrawing fluorine and cooh dodd et al 2005 giri and golder 2014 nevertheless previous studies have demonstrated that the piperazine ring should be considered as a whole reaction centre with the contribution of both nitrogen atoms to electron transfer wang et al 2010 this could explain the higher reactivity of pms with piperazine ring containing compounds compared to aliphatic amines metoprolol and venlafaxine as shown in fig 1 the initial electron transfer from the piperazine ring to pms produces an imine intermediate ia scheme 1a as proposed by dodd et al 2005 and wang et al 2010 for the oxidation of cip by free chlorine and chlorine dioxide respectively the hydrolysis of the imine intermediate rapidly induced the dealkylation of the piperazine ring to generate p306 the subsequent electron transfer from the amine group of p306 to pms was followed by hydrolysis producing p320 the presence of highly electron withdrawing carbonyl group in p320 possibly limited the electron transfer from amide n to pms thus p320 was stable in the presence of excess pms fig 6a the formation of hydroxylated products p348a and p364 suggested the presence of a similar enamine intermediate ib scheme 1a which has been proposed for the reactions of permanganate hu et al 2011 and ferrate iv yang et al 2016a with cip the double bond of enamine can be oxidized to aldehyde moieties p362 p334 and p291 leading to the complete degradation of piperazine ring the oxygen transfer from pms to secondary amine cip generates n oxide intermediate ic scheme 1a which subsequently rearranged to hydroxylamine compound p348b lee and von gunten 2016 as shown in fig 6b the intensity of p348b reached the maximum at 3 mm min and rapidly decreased with pms exposure suggesting that p348b was subjected to further reactions in the presence of excess pms the oxygen transfer pathway might involve the transfer of the distal oxygen in the peroxide bond of pms to cip an oxygen transfer mechanism was also proposed for the oxidation of arsenite as iii to as v by pms wang et al 2014 the thioether sulfur of β lactam antibiotics can be substituted by the oxygen from pms to produce sulfoxide products chen et al 2018 the aniline moieties of sulfonamide antibiotics can be converted to nitroso or nitrobenzene moieties through pms oxygen substitution yin et al 2018 pms was also proposed to react with tertiary amine enr via oxygen transfer to generate enr n oxide p376b scheme 1b the direct electron transfer pathway also occurred during pms oxidation of enr and led to the hydroxylation on α carbon to produce p376a and p392 based on the degradation pathway of cip it was postulated that the hydroxylated products p392 might undergo further oxidation followed by the dealkylation of the piperazine ring additional investigation is needed to confirm the major pathway of pms reaction electron transfer vs oxygen transfer with nitrogenous compounds which might be helpful to explain the different reaction potential of pms towards secondary and tertiary amine moieties as mentioned above 3 6 antibacterial activity assays fluoroquinolones inhibit the bacterial dna replication by hydrogen binding and charge interactions with the relaxed dna the core quinolone structure would be responsible for dna binding dodd et al 2006 while the fluorine substitute plays an important role in inhibiting the dna gyrase and enhancing cell permeation serna galvis et al 2017 based on lc hrms results the transformation products of cip after pms treatment still retained the core quinolone structure raising concerns about the residual antibacterial activity thus agar diffusion assays were conducted with e coli b as an indicator as shown in fig 7 the antibacterial activity of the solution gradually reduced with the removal of cip during pms treatment however after 40 50 removal of cip with 100 μm of pms the sample resulted in a larger inhibition zone in the agar plate than cip standard solutions this result indicated that the transformation products at an earlier stage e g hydroxylamine product p348b fig 6b might still exert antibacterial potency the residual antibacterial activity was efficiently removed with the complete degradation of cip suggesting that the major final products p320 and p263 showed negligible antibacterial activity compared to cip the structural modifications on the piperazine ring alter the acid base speciation and significantly affect fluoroquinolones cell permeation paul et al 2010 although the amide and aldehyde moieties produced after pms exposure kept the core quinolone structure in this study their physicochemical characteristics might be significantly different from those of cip consequently reducing their uptake by bacteria cell and binding to dna the current results were in agreement with previous findings reporting that the photolytic transformation products of cip retaining the quinolone ring significantly diminished the antibacterial potency of the parent antibiotic paul et al 2010 4 conclusion pms can efficiently degrade the selected fluoroquinolones except for flumequine followed by aliphatic amines and nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds the common water matrix components e g bicarbonate and chloride ions did not impact the degradation rate of cip by pms the electron transfer from the piperazine ring of cip to pms induced the dealkylation and hydroxylation of the molecule and led to the formation of amide and aldehyde moieties pms was also proposed to react with cip and enr via oxygen transfer to produce hydroxylamine analogue of cip and enr n oxide respectively pms efficiently removed the antibacterial activity of cip however the transformation products in earlier stages of the reaction still exerted antibacterial potency a complete elimination of the parent compound as well as its transformation products is required during the fluoroquinolone treatment by pms the findings of this study suggested that the direct pms oxidation can be selectively applied for the removal of nitrogenous compounds e g fluoroquinolones however some persistent transformation products e g n oxides can be formed which are inert to the biodegradation hübner et al 2015 unlike radical based processes this treatment can maintain its efficiency in complex water matrixes however nom slightly inhibited the degradation of cip by pms therefore additional studies are needed to investigate the reactivity of pms with nom fractions of different characteristics to optimize the pms dose for its best treatment efficiency because environmental components e g nitrogen and sulfur containing organics chen et al 2018 yang et al 2018 are susceptible to react with pms the non radical pathway might hinder the formation of radicals during pms activated aops consequently limiting the removal of the targeted hazardous compounds the electron and oxygen transfer pathways proposed in this study assist in understanding the non radical reaction mechanism of pms with organic contaminants and in predicting the formation of potential transformation products similar mechanistic studies and screening of transformation products can be extended to other oxidants used during water treatment which also have similar peroxide bond and asymmetric structure to pms such as organic peracids luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18341,this study demonstrates new empirical models to predict the decomposition of ozone o3 and the exposures of oxidants i e o3 and hydroxyl radical oh during the ozonation of natural waters four models were developed for the instantaneous o3 demand first order rate constant for the secondary o3 decay o3 exposure o3 dt and oh exposure oh dt as functions of five independent variables namely the o3 dose concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc ph alkalinity and temperature the models were derived by polynomial regression analysis of experimental data obtained by controlling variables in natural water samples from a single source water maegok water in korea and they exhibited high accuracies for regression r2 0 99 for the three o3 models and r2 0 96 for the oh exposure model the three o3 models exhibited excellent internal validity for maegok water samples of different conditions that were not used for the model development they also showed acceptable external validity for seven natural water samples collected from different sources not maegok water the iod model showed somewhat poor external validity however the oh exposure model showed relatively poor internal and external validity the models for oxidant exposures were successfully used to predict the abatement of micropollutants by ozonation the model predictions showed high accuracy for maegok water but not for the other natural waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords ozonation ozone decomposition hydroxyl radical oxidant exposure modeling 1 introduction ozonation has been widely used in drinking water treatment processes to control recalcitrant organic micropollutants mps and pathogenic microorganisms glaze 1987 huber et al 2003 molecular ozone o3 itself is not only a powerful oxidant that is capable of oxidizing various organic compounds von gunten 2003 but also a precursor to generate hydroxyl radical oh an even more reactive and nonselective oxidant that can oxidize a wide spectrum of compounds at diffusion controlled reaction rates staehelin and hoigné 1982 buxton et al 1988 in ozonation processes the determination of optimal o3 dose is an important issue lee and von gunten 2016 because underdose or overdose of o3 can lead to insufficient removal of target micropollutants or increased formation of harmful by products e g bromate ion and total organic bromide and unnecessary costs von gunten and hoigné 1994 johansson and engberg 2018 bian et al 2019 the abatement of a micropollutant mp during ozonation can be predicted by the kinetic equation that consists of the second order rate constants for the reactions of mp with o3 and oh k o3 and k oh and the exposures of o3 oh o3 dt and oh dt 1 ln mp 0 mp t k o3 o3 dt k oh oh dt this equation can be further transformed into those with r ct oh dt o3 dt or r oh o3 r ct k o3 values which are useful to quantitatively evaluate the oh production from the o3 decomposition in natural waters elovitz and von gunten 1999 kwon et al 2017 cruz alcalde et al 2019 the k o3 and k oh values are available for numerous organic compounds buxton et al 1988 ross et al 1998 von gunten 2003 and some unknown values can be estimated by several techniques such as the group contribution method gcm quantitative stricture activity relationship qsar and quantum chemical calculations minakata et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2012 sudhakaran and amy 2013 lee et al 2015 however the oxidant exposures o3 dt and oh dt vary depending on the characteristics of water in which the ozonation is applied and thus they need to be determined experimentally for different water sources the o3 dt and oh dt values can be measured by monitoring the decomposition of o3 and an externally added oh probe compound during the ozonation respectively however it is not viable to apply these measurement methods in the water treatment plant therefore for practical field application the o3 dt and oh dt values need to be predicted by water quality parameters that are routinely monitored in the water treatment plant due to the complicated o3 chemistry in natural water an empirical approach has been used to develop prediction models for the ozonation processes several previous studies have derived models for the o3 decomposition in natural waters as functions of water quality parameters siddiqui et al 1994 amy et al 1998 sohn et al 2004 lee and von gunten 2016 these models usually showed low accuracy because they collected the data from various water sources containing different organic matter however they can be more comprehensive models that are applicable to a broader range of waters meanwhile the prediction model for oh dt during the ozonation of natural waters has not previously been reported accordingly to the best of our knowledge no study has successfully predicted the abatement of mps in ozonation processes by only using the inputs of o3 dose and water quality parameters the objective of the present study was to develop empirical models that can accurately predict the o3 decomposition i e the instantaneous o3 demand iod and the first order rate constant for the secondary o3 decay k and oxidant exposures i e o3 dt and oh dt during the ozonation of natural waters five variables i e the input dose of o3 and four major water quality parameters dissolved organic carbon doc concentration ph alkalinity and temperature were selected for the model development and the decay of o3 and an oh probe compound were monitored with variation of the selected variables in a single natural water sample the four models for iod k o3 dt and oh dt were derived by the polynomial regression of the obtained data the internal and external validation of the developed models was performed finally the developed empirical models were applied to predict the abatement of the selected mps during the ozonation of natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals were of reagent grade and were used as received without

1 shows representative plots for the time dependent decomposition of o3 and pcba during the ozonation of maegok water the experimental condition of task 22 the center point of the 43 tasks for the model development refer to table s2 in the sd the o3 decay proceeded in two phases fig 1a the injected o3 was immediately decomposed by approximately 60 at the first sampling 5 s which was defined as iod after that the residual o3 was gradually decomposed with following the pseudo first order kinetics the first order rate constant in the secondary phase was defined as k the inset of fig 1a the o3 dt was calculated by integrating o3 concentration over time until the depletion of o3 the data for o3 concentration were fitted to an exponential function r2 0 95 and then the best fit curve was integrated over time to obtain the accurate o3 dt value red area in fig 1a meanwhile the oh dt was determined by eq 4 using the decomposition data of pcba fig 1b elovitz and von gunten 1999 4 oh dt ln pcba 0 pcba k oh pcba where k oh pcba is the second order rate constant for the reaction of pcba with oh 5 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 9 4 neta and dorfman 1968 the activation energy for the reaction of pcba and oh is known as 6 65 kj mol 1 kim and lee 2019 which was used to calculate the temperature dependency of k oh pcba following the method described above iod k o3 dt and oh dt values were determined for 43 tasks refer to figs s2 and s3 in the sd for the profiles of o3 and pcba decomposition table s2 in the sd summarizes the determined values 3 2 factors affecting iod k and o3 dt the effects of the five factors i e independent variables for the model development namely o3 dose doc ph alkalinity and temperature on iod k and o3 dt were investigated under the orthogonality conditions with respect to the center point i e only one factor is varied at a time while other parameters are maintained at a typical baseline condition fig 2 the experimental data in fig 2 were taken from tasks 9 18 26 and 35 and fig s2 in the sd presents their time dependent profiles of o3 iod increased with increasing all factors except for alkalinity fig 2a e the influence of the five factors on iod measured by the variations of iod was in the order doc 0 51 mg l 1 temperature 0 36 mg l 1 o3 dose 0 19 mg l 1 ph 0 12 mg l 1 alkalinity 0 06 mg l 1 the 1 k value decreased k increased with increasing doc ph and temperature while it increased k decreased by increasing o3 dose and alkalinity fig 2f j the influence of the five factors on k was in the order doc 193 9 s temperature 67 4 s o3 dose 60 8 s ph 48 3 s alkalinity 19 2 s among the five factors the doc concentration was found to be the most influential factor to affect iod and k fig 2b and g the accelerated o3 decay the increase in both iod and k with increasing the doc concentration is explained by the i direct o3 consumption and ii accelerated radical chain reactions which are mainly responsible for the increase in iod and k respectively it is well known that iod is attributed to the direct reactions of o3 with specific moieties in natural organic matter such as phenols neutral amines or alkenes buffle and von gunten 2006 in addition some of these reactions e g reactions with secondary and tertiary amines and phenols produce superoxide radical anion o2 and oh buffle and von gunten 2006 which secondarily consume o3 at high reaction rates the second order rate constants of o2 and oh with o3 k o3 o2 and k o3 oh are 1 6 109 büehler et al 1984 and 3 109 m 1 s 1 staehelin et al 1984 respectively meanwhile some other fractions in organic matter e g carboxylic acid and primary and secondary alcohols can accelerate the second phase o3 decay increasing k these compounds are relatively less reactive towards molecular o3 but they react with oh to produce o2 which promotes the chain reactions of o3 decomposition staehelin and hoigné 1985 higher o3 dose led to higher iod fig 2a because the high concentration of o3 accelerates the o3 consumption by secondary and further chain reactions of intermediates e g o2 oh or organic radicals in contrast higher o3 dose inhibited the o3 decay in the second phase decreased k fig 2f at higher o3 doses more organic matters are oxidized during the first phase leaving fractions less reactive to o3 this may result in the decrease in k increasing ph accelerated the o3 decay both iod and k fig 2c and h which is primarily due to the initiation reaction of o3 decomposition by hydroxide ion oh i e o3 oh o2 ho2 staehelin and hoigné 1982 ph dependent speciation changes in organic matters can also affect the o3 decay elovitz et al 2000 in general deprotonated forms show higher reactivity with o3 e g the reaction of phenolate with o3 is much faster than that of phenol k o3 phenolate 1 4 109 m 1 s 1 k o3 phenol 1 3 103 m 1 s 1 hoigné and bader 1983 increasing alkalinity inhibits the o3 decay fig 2d and i carbonate as a oh scavenger is known to terminate the radical chain reactions of o3 decomposition i e hco3 co3 2 oh no o2 staehelin and hoigné 1985 however its impact was relatively minor compared to the other factors because carbonate does not directly interact with o3 the temperature elevation significantly lowers the stability of o3 increasing iod and k fig 2e and j based on the temperature dependency of k the apparent activation energy e a for the secondary o3 decay was calculated to be 18 2 kj mol 1 using the arrhenius equation compared to the reported e a values of other natural waters of 46 111 8 kj mol 1 sotelo et al 1987 maegok water is considered to be less sensitive to temperature the o3 dt value is determined by the o3 decay kinetics represented by iod and k in accordance with the above explanations o3 dt decreased with increasing doc ph and temperature but increased with increasing o3 dose and alkalinity fig 2k o the influence of the five factors on o3 dt was in the order doc 133 0 mg l 1 s temperature 74 6 mg l 1 s o3 dose 65 5 mg l 1 s ph 31 6 mg l 1 s alkalinity 10 7 mg l 1 s within the given conditions 3 3 factors affecting oh dt the effects of the five factors o3 dose doc ph alkalinity and temperature on oh dt were investigated fig 3 fig s3 in the sd presents the time dependent profiles of pcba as anticipated oh dt increased with increasing the o3 dose because o3 is the source of oh fig 3a while it decreased with increasing doc and alkalinity due to the oh scavenging effect fig 3b and d the effect of ph on oh dt was almost negligible fig 3 c which is in agreement with the observation in the previous study elovitz et al 2000 elevating temperature decreased oh dt fig 3e which was inconsistent with the previous observations that oh dt was not significantly affected elovitz et al 2000 or slightly increased kwon et al 2017 by the temperature changes this discrepancy may result from i the difference in the characteristics of the tested natural waters or ii the possible loss of o3 the source of oh in the open reactor at elevated temperatures overall the influence of the five factors on oh dt was in the order o3 dose 1 2 10 10 m s alkalinity 8 4 10 11 m s doc 6 8 10 11 m s temperature 2 3 10 11 m s ph 1 2 10 11 m s 3 4 modeling of iod 1 k and o3 dt empirical models for iod 1 k and o3 dt as functions of the five factors were derived by fitting the experimental data fig s2 in the sd to the polynomial regression equations using rsm table 2 presents the three resultant model equations for iod 1 k and o3 dt and their statistical soundness was verified by the four representative estimates r2 0 99 model p value 0 0001 p value of lof 0 167 0 109 and 0 052 and ap values 78 3 36 7 and 60 5 respectively refer to table s3 s5 in the sd for details the studentized residuals for the three models did not clearly show any patterns in the qq plots which verified the normality assumption fig s4a c the model predictions for iod 1 k and o3 dt red lines successfully fitted the experimental data black filled circles for all the cases fig 2 however for some cases the model predictions showed unreasonable trends outside the boundary conditions e g the slight decrease in iod and 1 k at over 1 5 mg l 1 of o3 dose fig 2a and f and the increase in 1 k and o3 dt at over 5 mg c l 1 of doc fig 2g and l indicating that the extrapolation might be risky table 2 presents the model equations derived in this study together with those reported in the previous studies for iod k and o3 dt siddiqui et al 1994 amy et al 1998 sohn et al 2004 the model for o3 dt reported by amy et al 1998 was tested for our conditions blue dotted lines in fig 2k o other models in the literature could not be tested because they include concentrations of br and nh3 n as independent variables which were not considered in our models all the values predicted by the literature model amy et al 1998 were much higher than our model predictions fig 2k o this discrepancy is believed to mainly result from the difference in the doc characteristics of natural waters used in the model development amy et al 1998 used the natural waters in the us to obtain the o3 dt data the higher o3 dt values in their model predictions indicate that the us water samples contain organic matter that is less reactive with o3 so leading to higher o3 dt than ours the validity of the three models for iod 1 k and o3 dt was evaluated by comparing the measured and predicted values for internal and external conditions fig 4 first all the experimental data used to develop the models were compared to the predicted values for iod 1 k and o3 dt respectively fig 4a d and g the data in fig 2 were rearranged the measured and predicted values showed excellent agreement with each other r2 0 99 second additional experiments were performed using maegok water samples which had not been used for the model development refer to fig s5 in the sd for the time dependent profiles of o3 concentration and table s6 in the sd for the determined iod 1 k and o3 dt values when the obtained data were compared to the model predictions fig 4b e and h all predictions agreed well with the experimental data the calculated r2 values for iod 1 k and o3 dt models were 0 95 0 87 and 0 94 respectively to test the external validity of the models experiments were performed using the five other natural waters i e cheonsang hoeya han gamak and taehwa waters refer to fig s6 in the sd for the time dependent profiles of o3 concentration and table s7 in the sd for the determined iod 1 k and o3 dt values and the obtained data were compared to the model predictions fig 4c f and i the experimental data exhibited reasonable correlation with the model predictions even if they have larger deviations compared to the internal data the r2 values for iod 1 k and o3 dt models were 0 57 0 82 and 0 86 respectively further external validation was performed using literature values obtained in natural swiss waters elovitz et al 2000 figs s7a and b in the sd table s8 in the sd summarizes the k and o3 dt values large discrepancies between the experimental and predicted values were observed except for the two natural waters i e lake de brêt and the sihl river waters in general the 1 k and o3 dt values in swiss waters were much higher 2 5 10 times than predicted by our models which implies that the swiss waters contain organic matter that is much less reactive with o3 than that in the korean waters 3 5 modeling of oh dt in the same manner as the o3 models an empirical model for oh dt was derived by fitting the experimental data fig s3 in the sd to the polynomial regression equations table 2 includes the model equation the developed model exhibited good statistical reliability r2 0 95 model p value 0 0001 p value of lof 0 249 and ap values 22 3 refer to table s9 in the sd for more details the qq plot of the studentized residuals also indicated that the normality assumption was not violated fig s4d the model predictions red lines fitted the experimental data black filled circles for all the cases fig 3 the internal and external validity was evaluated for the oh dt model based on the data obtained using maegok and other natural water samples fig 5 as for the validation of o3 models section 3 4 the oh dt values were additionally determined using maegok water samples those not used for the model development refer to fig s8 in the sd for the time dependent profiles of pcba concentration and table s6 in the sd for the determined oh dt values as well as using other natural water samples refer to fig s9 and table s7 in the sd the oh dt model showed good internal validity for the data used for the model development r2 0 96 fig 5a but poorer validity for the separate set of internal data r2 0 67 fig 5b the data from other natural waters showed even greater deviations from the model predictions r2 0 25 fig 5c the measured oh dt values were generally lower than those predicted by the model which implies that organic matters in external water samples have higher oh scavenging efficiency and the lower oh yield from the reaction of o3 than those in maegok water the oh dt values in swiss waters the data from elovitz et al 2000 also showed poor fit to the model predictions fig s10 in the sd 3 6 modeling of mp abatement the abatement of four selected mps i e atrazine ibuprofen caffeine and acetaminophen by ozonation was examined in four natural waters i e maegok hoeya 2016 han and taehwa at different o3 doses using the developed models for o3 dt and oh dt table 2 and the kinetic equation eq 1 the abatement of mps was modelled table s10 in the sd presents k o3 and k oh for the target mps the measured and predicted values of the mp abatement were compared to each other fig 6 a in maegok water the model predictions exhibited an excellent fit to the experimental data for all the tested mps r2 0 93 however in the other natural waters the mp abatement was generally overestimated this result is mainly attributed to the overestimation of oh dt as shown in fig 5c the predicted oh dt values were higher than the model predictions in these natural waters in particular the discrepancies between measured and predicted values were greater for the mps that are less reactive with o3 because the oxidation by oh is more important for these contaminants the fractions of mp degraded by o3 and oh f o3 and f oh were presented as a function of the ratio of oh dt to o3 dt known as r ct elovitz and von gunten 1999 fig 6b as r ct increases f o3 decreases and f oh increases within the range of r ct tested in this study ibuprofen and atrazine resistant to o3 are mainly degraded by oh f oh 0 96 1 00 caffeine is degraded by both o3 and oh f oh 0 35 0 79 in contrast acetaminophen highly reactive with o3 is little affected by oh f oh 0 01 so that the prediction errors were relatively small refer to fig 6a 4 conclusions the major conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 four empirical models for iod 1 k o3 dt and oh dt were developed as functions of the o3 dose doc concentration ph alkalinity and temperature through the polynomial regression analysis of experimental data the ozonation experiments for the model development were performed using samples from a single natural water source maegok water 2 the developed models exhibited high accuracy in predicting the values of iod 1 k o3 dt and oh dt under different conditions in maegok water however they showed some deviations from the experimental data obtained in other domestic natural waters due to the different characteristics of organic matter the deviations were in particular greater for the iod and oh dt models 3 the kinetic equation based on the o3 dt and oh dt models successfully predicted the abatement of selected mps by ozonation in maegok water however its application to other domestic natural waters was limited due to the inaccuracy of the oh dt model the errors can be reduced for the mps that are reactive with o3 less affected by oh 4 further study is needed to incorporate the indicators for organic matter characteristics into the prediction models and thus develop more comprehensive models that can be applied

18341,this study demonstrates new empirical models to predict the decomposition of ozone o3 and the exposures of oxidants i e o3 and hydroxyl radical oh during the ozonation of natural waters four models were developed for the instantaneous o3 demand first order rate constant for the secondary o3 decay o3 exposure o3 dt and oh exposure oh dt as functions of five independent variables namely the o3 dose concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc ph alkalinity and temperature the models were derived by polynomial regression analysis of experimental data obtained by controlling variables in natural water samples from a single source water maegok water in korea and they exhibited high accuracies for regression r2 0 99 for the three o3 models and r2 0 96 for the oh exposure model the three o3 models exhibited excellent internal validity for maegok water samples of different conditions that were not used for the model development they also showed acceptable external validity for seven natural water samples collected from different sources not maegok water the iod model showed somewhat poor external validity however the oh exposure model showed relatively poor internal and external validity the models for oxidant exposures were successfully used to predict the abatement of micropollutants by ozonation the model predictions showed high accuracy for maegok water but not for the other natural waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords ozonation ozone decomposition hydroxyl radical oxidant exposure modeling 1 introduction ozonation has been widely used in drinking water treatment processes to control recalcitrant organic micropollutants mps and pathogenic microorganisms glaze 1987 huber et al 2003 molecular ozone o3 itself is not only a powerful oxidant that is capable of oxidizing various organic compounds von gunten 2003 but also a precursor to generate hydroxyl radical oh an even more reactive and nonselective oxidant that can oxidize a wide spectrum of compounds at diffusion controlled reaction rates staehelin and hoigné 1982 buxton et al 1988 in ozonation processes the determination of optimal o3 dose is an important issue lee and von gunten 2016 because underdose or overdose of o3 can lead to insufficient removal of target micropollutants or increased formation of harmful by products e g bromate ion and total organic bromide and unnecessary costs von gunten and hoigné 1994 johansson and engberg 2018 bian et al 2019 the abatement of a micropollutant mp during ozonation can be predicted by the kinetic equation that consists of the second order rate constants for the reactions of mp with o3 and oh k o3 and k oh and the exposures of o3 oh o3 dt and oh dt 1 ln mp 0 mp t k o3 o3 dt k oh oh dt this equation can be further transformed into those with r ct oh dt o3 dt or r oh o3 r ct k o3 values which are useful to quantitatively evaluate the oh production from the o3 decomposition in natural waters elovitz and von gunten 1999 kwon et al 2017 cruz alcalde et al 2019 the k o3 and k oh values are available for numerous organic compounds buxton et al 1988 ross et al 1998 von gunten 2003 and some unknown values can be estimated by several techniques such as the group contribution method gcm quantitative stricture activity relationship qsar and quantum chemical calculations minakata et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2012 sudhakaran and amy 2013 lee et al 2015 however the oxidant exposures o3 dt and oh dt vary depending on the characteristics of water in which the ozonation is applied and thus they need to be determined experimentally for different water sources the o3 dt and oh dt values can be measured by monitoring the decomposition of o3 and an externally added oh probe compound during the ozonation respectively however it is not viable to apply these measurement methods in the water treatment plant therefore for practical field application the o3 dt and oh dt values need to be predicted by water quality parameters that are routinely monitored in the water treatment plant due to the complicated o3 chemistry in natural water an empirical approach has been used to develop prediction models for the ozonation processes several previous studies have derived models for the o3 decomposition in natural waters as functions of water quality parameters siddiqui et al 1994 amy et al 1998 sohn et al 2004 lee and von gunten 2016 these models usually showed low accuracy because they collected the data from various water sources containing different organic matter however they can be more comprehensive models that are applicable to a broader range of waters meanwhile the prediction model for oh dt during the ozonation of natural waters has not previously been reported accordingly to the best of our knowledge no study has successfully predicted the abatement of mps in ozonation processes by only using the inputs of o3 dose and water quality parameters the objective of the present study was to develop empirical models that can accurately predict the o3 decomposition i e the instantaneous o3 demand iod and the first order rate constant for the secondary o3 decay k and oxidant exposures i e o3 dt and oh dt during the ozonation of natural waters five variables i e the input dose of o3 and four major water quality parameters dissolved organic carbon doc concentration ph alkalinity and temperature were selected for the model development and the decay of o3 and an oh probe compound were monitored with variation of the selected variables in a single natural water sample the four models for iod k o3 dt and oh dt were derived by the polynomial regression of the obtained data the internal and external validation of the developed models was performed finally the developed empirical models were applied to predict the abatement of the selected mps during the ozonation of natural waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals were of reagent grade and were used as received without

nakdong river maegok area in daegu city maegok water cheonsang and hoeya dams lake gamak and the taehwa river in ulsan city cheonsang hoeya gamak and taehwa waters respectively and the han river in seoul city han water korea for cheonsang and hoeya waters samples were taken twice in 2011 and 2016 respectively all natural water samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm ptfe membrane filter advantec

the maegok water concentrate was diluted with deionized water to the desired doc concentration then ph alkalinity and temperature were further adjusted to the desired values refer to section 2 5 to

1 shows representative plots for the time dependent decomposition of o3 and pcba during the ozonation of maegok water the experimental condition of task 22 the center point of the 43 tasks for the model development refer to table s2 in the sd the o3 decay proceeded in two phases fig 1a the injected o3 was immediately decomposed by approximately 60 at the first sampling 5 s which was defined as iod after that the residual o3 was gradually decomposed with following the pseudo first order kinetics the first order rate constant in the secondary phase was defined as k the inset of fig 1a the o3 dt was calculated by integrating o3 concentration over time until the depletion of o3 the data for o3 concentration were fitted to an exponential function r2 0 95 and then the best fit curve was integrated over time to obtain the accurate o3 dt value red area in fig 1a meanwhile the oh dt was determined by eq 4 using the decomposition data of pcba fig 1b elovitz and von gunten 1999 4 oh dt ln pcba 0 pcba k oh pcba where k oh pcba is the second order rate constant for the reaction of pcba with oh 5 109 m 1 s 1 at ph 6 9 4 neta and dorfman 1968 the activation energy for the reaction of pcba and oh is known as 6 65 kj mol 1 kim and lee 2019 which was used to calculate the temperature dependency of k oh pcba following the method described above iod k o3 dt and oh dt values were determined for 43 tasks refer to figs s2 and s3 in the sd for the profiles of o3 and pcba decomposition table s2 in the sd summarizes the determined values 3 2 factors affecting iod k and o3 dt the effects of the five factors i e independent variables for the model development namely o3 dose doc ph alkalinity and temperature on iod k and o3 dt were investigated under the orthogonality conditions with respect to the center point i e only one factor is varied at a time while other parameters are maintained at a typical baseline condition fig 2 the experimental data in fig 2 were taken from tasks 9 18 26 and 35 and fig s2 in the sd presents their time dependent profiles of o3 iod increased with increasing all factors except for alkalinity fig 2a e the influence of the five factors on iod measured by the variations of iod was in the order doc 0 51 mg l 1 temperature 0 36 mg l 1 o3 dose 0 19 mg l 1 ph 0 12 mg l 1 alkalinity 0 06 mg l 1 the 1 k value decreased k increased with increasing doc ph and temperature while it increased k decreased by increasing o3 dose and alkalinity fig 2f j the influence of the five factors on k was in the order doc 193 9 s temperature 67 4 s o3 dose 60 8 s ph 48 3 s alkalinity 19 2 s among the five factors the doc concentration was found to be the most influential factor to affect iod and k fig 2b and g the accelerated o3 decay the increase in both iod and k with increasing the doc concentration is explained by the i direct o3 consumption and ii accelerated radical chain reactions which are mainly responsible for the increase in iod and k respectively it is well known that iod is attributed to the direct reactions of o3 with specific moieties in natural organic matter such as phenols neutral amines or alkenes buffle and von gunten 2006 in addition some of these reactions e g reactions with secondary and tertiary amines and phenols produce superoxide radical anion o2 and oh buffle and von gunten 2006 which secondarily consume o3 at high reaction rates the second order rate constants of o2 and oh with o3 k o3 o2 and k o3 oh are 1 6 109 büehler et al 1984 and 3 109 m 1 s 1 staehelin et al 1984 respectively meanwhile some other fractions in organic matter e g carboxylic acid and primary and secondary alcohols can accelerate the second phase o3 decay increasing k these compounds are relatively less reactive towards molecular o3 but they react with oh to produce o2 which promotes the chain reactions of o3 decomposition staehelin and hoigné 1985 higher o3 dose led to higher iod fig 2a because the high concentration of o3 accelerates the o3 consumption by secondary and further chain reactions of intermediates e g o2 oh or organic radicals in contrast higher o3 dose inhibited the o3 decay in the second phase decreased k fig 2f at higher o3 doses more organic matters are oxidized during the first phase leaving fractions less reactive to o3 this may result in the decrease in k increasing ph accelerated the o3 decay both iod and k fig 2c and h which is primarily due to the initiation reaction of o3 decomposition by hydroxide ion oh i e o3 oh o2 ho2 staehelin and hoigné 1982 ph dependent speciation changes in organic matters can also affect the o3 decay elovitz et al 2000 in general deprotonated forms show higher reactivity with o3 e g the reaction of phenolate with o3 is much faster than that of phenol k o3 phenolate 1 4 109 m 1 s 1 k o3 phenol 1 3 103 m 1 s 1 hoigné and bader 1983 increasing alkalinity inhibits the o3 decay fig 2d and i carbonate as a oh scavenger is known to terminate the radical chain reactions of o3 decomposition i e hco3 co3 2 oh no o2 staehelin and hoigné 1985 however its impact was relatively minor compared to the other factors because carbonate does not directly interact with o3 the temperature elevation significantly lowers the stability of o3 increasing iod and k fig 2e and j based on the temperature dependency of k the apparent activation energy e a for the secondary o3 decay was calculated to be 18 2 kj mol 1 using the arrhenius equation compared to the reported e a values of other natural waters of 46 111 8 kj mol 1 sotelo et al 1987 maegok water is considered to be less sensitive to temperature the o3 dt value is determined by the o3 decay kinetics represented by iod and k in accordance with the above explanations o3 dt decreased with increasing doc ph and temperature but increased with increasing o3 dose and alkalinity fig 2k o the influence of the five factors on o3 dt was in the order doc 133 0 mg l 1 s temperature 74 6 mg l 1 s o3 dose 65 5 mg l 1 s ph 31 6 mg l 1 s alkalinity 10 7 mg l 1 s within the given conditions 3 3 factors affecting oh dt the effects of the five factors o3 dose doc ph alkalinity and temperature on oh dt were investigated fig 3 fig s3 in the sd presents the time dependent profiles of pcba as anticipated oh dt increased with increasing the o3 dose because o3 is the source of oh fig 3a while it decreased with increasing doc and alkalinity due to the oh scavenging effect fig 3b and d the effect of ph on oh dt was almost negligible fig 3 c which is in agreement with the observation in the previous study elovitz et al 2000 elevating temperature decreased oh dt fig 3e which was inconsistent with the previous observations that oh dt was not significantly affected elovitz et al 2000 or slightly increased kwon et al 2017 by the temperature changes this discrepancy may result from i the difference in the characteristics of the tested natural waters or ii the possible loss of o3 the source of oh in the open reactor at elevated temperatures overall the influence of the five factors on oh dt was in the order o3 dose 1 2 10 10 m s alkalinity 8 4 10 11 m s doc 6 8 10 11 m s temperature 2 3 10 11 m s ph 1 2 10 11 m s 3 4 modeling of iod 1 k and o3 dt empirical models for iod 1 k and o3 dt as functions of the five factors were derived by fitting the experimental data fig s2 in the sd to the polynomial regression equations using rsm table 2 presents the three resultant model equations for iod 1 k and o3 dt and their statistical soundness was verified by the four representative estimates r2 0 99 model p value 0 0001 p value of lof 0 167 0 109 and 0 052 and ap values 78 3 36 7 and 60 5 respectively refer to table s3 s5 in the sd for details the studentized residuals for the three models did not clearly show any patterns in the qq plots which verified the normality assumption fig s4a c the model predictions for iod 1 k and o3 dt red lines successfully fitted the experimental data black filled circles for all the cases fig 2 however for some cases the model predictions showed unreasonable trends outside the boundary conditions e g the slight decrease in iod and 1 k at over 1 5 mg l 1 of o3 dose fig 2a and f and the increase in 1 k and o3 dt at over 5 mg c l 1 of doc fig 2g and l indicating that the extrapolation might be risky table 2 presents the model equations derived in this study together with those reported in the previous studies for iod k and o3 dt siddiqui et al 1994 amy et al 1998 sohn et al 2004 the model for o3 dt reported by amy et al 1998 was tested for our conditions blue dotted lines in fig 2k o other models in the literature could not be tested because they include concentrations of br and nh3 n as independent variables which were not considered in our models all the values predicted by the literature model amy et al 1998 were much higher than our model predictions fig 2k o this discrepancy is believed to mainly result from the difference in the doc characteristics of natural waters used in the model development amy et al 1998 used the natural waters in the us to obtain the o3 dt data the higher o3 dt values in their model predictions indicate that the us water samples contain organic matter that is less reactive with o3 so leading to higher o3 dt than ours the validity of the three models for iod 1 k and o3 dt was evaluated by comparing the measured and predicted values for internal and external conditions fig 4 first all the experimental data used to develop the models were compared to the predicted values for iod 1 k and o3 dt respectively fig 4a d and g the data in fig 2 were rearranged the measured and predicted values showed excellent agreement with each other r2 0 99 second additional experiments were performed using maegok water samples which had not been used for the model development refer to fig s5 in the sd for the time dependent profiles of o3 concentration and table s6 in the sd for the determined iod 1 k and o3 dt values when the obtained data were compared to the model predictions fig 4b e and h all predictions agreed well with the experimental data the calculated r2 values for iod 1 k and o3 dt models were 0 95 0 87 and 0 94 respectively to test the external validity of the models experiments were performed using the five other natural waters i e cheonsang hoeya han gamak and taehwa waters refer to fig s6 in the sd for the time dependent profiles of o3 concentration and table s7 in the sd for the determined iod 1 k and o3 dt values and the obtained data were compared to the model predictions fig 4c f and i the experimental data exhibited reasonable correlation with the model predictions even if they have larger deviations compared to the internal data the r2 values for iod 1 k and o3 dt models were 0 57 0 82 and 0 86 respectively further external validation was performed using literature values obtained in natural swiss waters elovitz et al 2000 figs s7a and b in the sd table s8 in the sd summarizes the k and o3 dt values large discrepancies between the experimental and predicted values were observed except for the two natural waters i e lake de brêt and the sihl river waters in general the 1 k and o3 dt values in swiss waters were much higher 2 5 10 times than predicted by our models which implies that the swiss waters contain organic matter that is much less reactive with o3 than that in the korean waters 3 5 modeling of oh dt in the same manner as the o3 models an empirical model for oh dt was derived by fitting the experimental data fig s3 in the sd to the polynomial regression equations table 2 includes the model equation the developed model exhibited good statistical reliability r2 0 95 model p value 0 0001 p value of lof 0 249 and ap values 22 3 refer to table s9 in the sd for more details the qq plot of the studentized residuals also indicated that the normality assumption was not violated fig s4d the model predictions red lines fitted the experimental data black filled circles for all the cases fig 3 the internal and external validity was evaluated for the oh dt model based on the data obtained using maegok and other natural water samples fig 5 as for the validation of o3 models section 3 4 the oh dt values were additionally determined using maegok water samples those not used for the model development refer to fig s8 in the sd for the time dependent profiles of pcba concentration and table s6 in the sd for the determined oh dt values as well as using other natural water samples refer to fig s9 and table s7 in the sd the oh dt model showed good internal validity for the data used for the model development r2 0 96 fig 5a but poorer validity for the separate set of internal data r2 0 67 fig 5b the data from other natural waters showed even greater deviations from the model predictions r2 0 25 fig 5c the measured oh dt values were generally lower than those predicted by the model which implies that organic matters in external water samples have higher oh scavenging efficiency and the lower oh yield from the reaction of o3 than those in maegok water the oh dt values in swiss waters the data from elovitz et al 2000 also showed poor fit to the model predictions fig s10 in the sd 3 6 modeling of mp abatement the abatement of four selected mps i e atrazine ibuprofen caffeine and acetaminophen by ozonation was examined in four natural waters i e maegok hoeya 2016 han and taehwa at different o3 doses using the developed models for o3 dt and oh dt table 2 and the kinetic equation eq 1 the abatement of mps was modelled table s10 in the sd presents k o3 and k oh for the target mps the measured and predicted values of the mp abatement were compared to each other fig 6 a in maegok water the model predictions exhibited an excellent fit to the experimental data for all the tested mps r2 0 93 however in the other natural waters the mp abatement was generally overestimated this result is mainly attributed to the overestimation of oh dt as shown in fig 5c the predicted oh dt values were higher than the model predictions in these natural waters in particular the discrepancies between measured and predicted values were greater for the mps that are less reactive with o3 because the oxidation by oh is more important for these contaminants the fractions of mp degraded by o3 and oh f o3 and f oh were presented as a function of the ratio of oh dt to o3 dt known as r ct elovitz and von gunten 1999 fig 6b as r ct increases f o3 decreases and f oh increases within the range of r ct tested in this study ibuprofen and atrazine resistant to o3 are mainly degraded by oh f oh 0 96 1 00 caffeine is degraded by both o3 and oh f oh 0 35 0 79 in contrast acetaminophen highly reactive with o3 is little affected by oh f oh 0 01 so that the prediction errors were relatively small refer to fig 6a 4 conclusions the major conclusions of this study are summarized as follows 1 four empirical models for iod 1 k o3 dt and oh dt were developed as functions of the o3 dose doc concentration ph alkalinity and temperature through the polynomial regression analysis of experimental data the ozonation experiments for the model development were performed using samples from a single natural water source maegok water 2 the developed models exhibited high accuracy in predicting the values of iod 1 k o3 dt and oh dt under different conditions in maegok water however they showed some deviations from the experimental data obtained in other domestic natural waters due to the different characteristics of organic matter the deviations were in particular greater for the iod and oh dt models 3 the kinetic equation based on the o3 dt and oh dt models successfully predicted the abatement of selected mps by ozonation in maegok water however its application to other domestic natural waters was limited due to the inaccuracy of the oh dt model the errors can be reduced for the mps that are reactive with o3 less affected by oh 4 further study is needed to incorporate the indicators for organic matter characteristics into the prediction models and thus develop more comprehensive models that can be applied

18342,antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a growing threat to global human health horizontal gene transfer hgt of antibiotic resistance genes args is recognized as the primary contributor to antibiotic resistance dissemination silver nanoparticles agnps are widely used in personal care products as antimicrobial agents while heavy metals are known to induce antibiotic resistance in bacteria it is not known whether agnps in the environment can stimulate the hgt of args here we report that both agnps and ionic silver ag at environmentally relevant and sub lethal concentrations facilitate the conjugative transfer of plasmid borne args across bacterial genera from the donor escherichia coli k 12 le392 to the recipient pseudomonas putida kt2440 the underlying mechanisms of the ag or agnps promoted hgt were unveiled by detecting oxidative stress and cell membrane permeability combined with genome wide rna sequencing and proteomic analyses it was found that both ag and agnps exposure induced various bacterial responses that included reactive oxygen species ros generation membrane damage and the sos response this study exposes the potential ecological risks of environmental levels of agnps and ag for promoting the spread of args and highlights concerns regarding the management of nanoparticles and heavy metals graphical abstract image 1 keywords silver ion silver nanoparticles environmental concentration antibiotic resistance genes horizontal gene transfer reactive oxygen species 1 introduction antibiotic resistance is an emerging global public health

transfer of mobile genetic elements mges that include transposons integrons and plasmids andersson and hughes 2014 blair et al 2015 gyles and boerlin 2014 horizontal gene transfer hgt includes conjugation the transfer of mges from a donor cell to a recipient cell transformation the uptake of naked dna and transduction the use of bacteriophages as transporters of genetic information alekshun and levy 2007 ashbolt et al 2013 as a major transmission pathway for antibiotic resistance sorensen et al 2005 thomas and nielsen 2005 conjugation consists of dna transfer by physical cell contact between one bacterium and another in the process the circular plasmids serve as shuttles and reservoirs for args baharoglu et al 2010 conjugation will occur between bacteria of the same genera intra species but also between different genera inter species at a lower frequency debruyn et al 2012 inoue et al 2005 generally the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in medicine veterinary animal feeding and aquaculture are considered as the main driving forces of the spread of antibiotic resistance via mutation giedraitiene et al 2011 gillespie et al 2005 henderson begg et al 2006 and hgt lopatkin et al 2016 lu et al 2017 however in recent years increasing evidence suggests that heavy metals can induce antibiotic resistance via direct mutation chen et al 2015 or indirect co selection pal et al 2017 wales and davies 2015 for example cu ii cd ii zn ii and hg ii have been reported to induce antibiotic resistance via co selection di cesare et al 2016 ji et al 2012 seiler and berendonk 2012 in addition cu ii ag i cr vi and zn ii were able to enhance the intra species conjugative transfer of args between escherichia coli strains zhang et al 2018 additionally previous studies report that nano al2o3 and nano tio2 both promote the conjugative transfer of args qiu et al 2012 2015 however limited studies are reporting whether and how silver ions ag or silver nanoparticles agnps could promote the dissemination of antibiotic resistance via inter species hgt silver was widely used in medicine to treat bacterial infections before the discovery and development of the antibiotics in the 1940s recently the utilization of silver to treat infectious diseases is attracting attention again due to the severe threat of antibiotic resistance mohler et al 2018 silver is also considered as an environmental contaminant since its presence will deteriorate water quality compared to other elementary substance forms of silver agnps are much smaller in size and have a larger surface area to volume ratio allowing them to interact with cell membranes and to affect bacterial structure or metabolism anaya et al 2016 carlson et al 2008 hong et al 2016 lok et al 2006 due to the broad spectrum antimicrobial activities of agnps durán et al 2016 marambio jones and hoek 2010 agnps are being increasingly used in medicine food technology textiles fabrics consumer products and water treatment blaser et al 2008 kaegi et al 2011 yu et al 2013 up to 500 tons of agnps are annually produced and used worldwide brunetti et al 2015 thus as a ubiquitous and emerging contaminant agnps are detected in various aquatic ecosystems including surface freshwater sewer networks wastewater treatment plants wwtp and seawater with concentrations ranging from low levels at 0 8 ng l to much higher levels at 1 mg l kaegi et al 2013 levard et al 2012 yu et al 2013 although the majority of agnps 85 released into wastewater would likely to be transformed into ag2s up to 5 of the agnps were still found to be remained as metallic nanoparticles in the effluent of wastewater treatment systems kaegi et al 2011 because both silver ions ag and agnps have antimicrobial effects there are concerns that ag and agnps may induce antibiotic resistance larimer et al 2014 percival et al 2005 in particular ag and agnps are able to introduce reactive oxygen species ros and cell membrane damage to bacteria anaya et al 2016 carlson et al 2008 and these are detected as major mechanisms by which biocidal agents or pharmaceuticals facilitate conjugative transfer of args lu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 thus we raise the hypothesis that ag and agnps can promote conjugative transfer due to their antimicrobial nature to prove this hypothesis we evaluated the effects of both ag and agnps at environmentally relevant and sub inhibitory concentrations on the frequency of the plasmid mediated conjugative transfer of args from e coli to pseudomonas putida i e inter species conjugation furthermore we examined the mechanisms associated with increased hgt caused by both ag and agnps through a series of molecular investigations these investigations included monitoring intracellular ros levels determining cell membrane permeability changes and by detecting changes in gene expression and protein abundance for elements involved in the sos response oxidative stress and conjugative transfer to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the effects and mechanisms of agnps on the horizontal transfer of args the findings advance the understanding of the roles of both ag and agnps on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and provide reasoning for improved management of nps 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains culture conditions and agnps e coli k 12 le392 was selected as the donor strain to assess the efficiency of conjugative plasmid transfer the donor e coli harbors a conjugative plasmid rp4 60099 bp that includes genes for resistance to ampicillin amp tetracycline tet and kanamycin kan the recipient p putida kt2440 was purchased from the american type culture collection atcc number 47054 and had higher chloramphenicol chl resistance than the donor e coli both the donor and recipient strains were incubated at 30 c in luria broth lb medium 10 g tryptone 5 g yeast extract and 10 g sodium chloride in 1 l deionized water ph 7 4 and shaken at 150 rpm overnight then the prepared bacterial strains were collected by centrifugation at 6000 g for 5 min at 4 c the subsequent cell pellets were then washed using phosphate buffered saline 1 pbs ph 7 2 and resuspended in pbs before being applied to the conjugation experiments and mechanistic investigations described below the agnps solution 10 16 w w was purchased from fraunhofer institute for molecular biology and applied ecology ime germany these are synthesized by an aqueous reduction method and then monodispersed with monolayer capping agent 4 each of polyoxyethylene glycerol trioleate and polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan mono laurat tween 20 the agnps had a primary particle size of 15 nm as determined by transmission electron microscopy tem just prior to the conjugation exposure experiments described below fresh agnps solutions of 1 mg ml were prepared by diluting the purchased agnps in milli q water and these were subsequently treated by ultrasonication 80 w for 30 min in a water bath 20 c the dissolution of ag from agnps in milli q water was less than 0 8 i e 0 78 mg ag from 100 mg l agnps after 24 h according to our previous study chen et al 2018 the agno3 solution was supplied by sigma aldrich usa the antibiotics tetracycline tet and chloramphenicol chl were supplied by sigma aldrich usa the antibiotic ampicillin amp was purchased from gold biotechnology usa and kanamycin kan was supplied by astral scientific australia 2 2 evaluation of the impact of agnps on conjugative transfer frequency of args the cultured bacteria were resuspended in pbs solution to obtain 1 108 cfu ml for the conjugation experiments mating the 1 108 cfu ml donor and recipient bacteria were mixed at 1 1 ratio and exposed to different concentrations of agnps with ag concentrations at 0 01 0 1 1 10 100 and 1000 μg l and agno3 with ag concentrations at 0 01 0 1 1 10 100 and 1000 μg l for 6 h addition of milliq water only was included as the no added ag control group the determination of transconjugants was conducted according to the previously described method lu et al 2018 briefly the donor e coli has high resistance to tet kan and amp but was sensitive to chl while the recipient p putida was resistant to chl but sensitive to tet kan and amp thus the transconjugant has high resistance against all four antibiotics these strains were then separated on lb agar plates containing different antibiotic combinations then the transfer frequency was calculated by dividing the number of transconjugants by the number of total recipients all experiments were conducted using biological triplicates additional conjugation exposure experiments were conducted to determine whether agnps promote ros generation in these experiments 100 μm of thiourea a ros scavenger was added into the across genera mating system described above at 10 min before adding 0 0 01 and 0 1 μg l agnps the conjugation transfer frequency of the ros scavenger treated group was then compared with the non scavenger treated group all experiments were conducted with biological triplicates as described in our previous study lu et al 2018 2 3 minimum inhibitory concentrations mics analysis the mics of agnps ag amp tet kan and chl against donor e coli recipient p putida and transconjugants were tested by following the initial experiment set up suggested by to the eucast clinical breakpoints methods

chemicals sterilized lb was set as the blank control a microplate spectrophotometer was used to measure the optical density at 600 nm od600 after 16 h incubation at 37 c for transconjugants one transconjugant from each of the seven transconjugant selective plates selected for transconjugants under seven different agnp treatments were randomly selected the mics were calculated as the concentrations of metal ions or antibiotics that completely inhibited the growth of bacterial cells all mic experiments were conducted with biological triplicates 2 4 bacterial identification by maldi tof ms matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms was used to identify the bacteria species of transconjugants briefly three of the previous randomly selected colonies for mic testing were cultured overnight to reach od600 of 1 0 sinapinic acid matrix solution was prepared at a concentration of 10 mg ml in 50 acetonitrile and 1 trifluoroacetic acid about 1 5 μl of sample matrix mixture 1 5 vol was spotted onto the maldi target and dried in air following air drying the samples were analyzed using a maldi tof tof mass spectrometer ab 4700

permeability a cytoflex flow cytometer facs beckman coulter usa was applied for the detection of both ros and cell membrane permeability for the ros detection the dcfda cellular ros detection assay kit abcam uk was employed according to the manufacturer s instructions cell membrane permeability was tested using the propidium iodide dye pi at the concentration of 2 mm life technologies usa as described previously lu et al 2018 2 6 plasmid extraction and gel electrophoresis the donor strain recipient strain together with the previous randomly selected transconjugants for mic testing were cultured in lb broth overnight and harvested for plasmid extraction as previously described lu et al 2018 plasmid extraction for the selected transconjugants was performed using the invitrogentm purelink quick plasmid miniprep kit life technologies usa following the manufacturer s instructions following extraction agarose gel electrophoresis was applied to verify the presence of plasmids in each transconjugant 2 7 transmission electron microscope tem imaging tem was performed to characterize whether the cell morphology or membrane was changed under exposure of agnps and ag briefly 0 1 μg

of rp4 plasmid was significantly increased across the bacterial species under the exposure of both agnps and ag at environmentally relevant and sub mic concentrations fig 1 compared with the control groups the conjugative transfer frequency of rp4 plasmid was significantly increased under the exposure of agnps at 0 1 and 1 μg l p 0 05 p 0 01 fig 1 specifically the conjugative transfer frequency 2 4 0 3 10 6 per recipient cell at 0 1 μg l agnps was up to 1 8 fold higher than that of the control groups 1 4 0 1 10 6 per recipient cell fig 1 a similarly ag also promoted the horizontal transfer of rp4 plasmid during the exposures at 1 μg l to 100 μg l this transfer frequency was up to 2 4 fold higher 3 3 0 7 10 6 per recipient cell than that of the control groups at 1 μg l of ag treatment p 0 01 fig 1 b in contrast when the exposure concentrations of agnps and ag increased to 1000 μg l the conjugative transfer frequencies of rp4 plasmid significantly decreased p 0 01 compared to the control likely this was due to the reduced recipient number and viability in the mating system at the agnps ag concentrations that were highly above mics flow cytometry indicated that despite over 85 of the donor e coli were alive after 6 h of the 1000 μg l agnps and ag treatments respectively fig s1 a and b only 4 9 and 0 8 of the recipient p putida were still alive after 6 h of the 1000 μg l agnps and ag treatments respectively fig s1 c and d to confirm the conjugative plasmid transfer we verified the transconjugant by determining 1 mics against antibiotics 2 matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight maldi tof mass spectrometer bacteria strain typing and 3 confirmation of plasmid by gel electrophoresis firstly the antibiotic resistance spectrums against tet kan amp and chl were scanned for donor recipient and transconjugant strains table s1 the donor e coli strain exhibited multidrug resistant against tet kan and amp with mics of 256 mg l 512 mg l and 1024 mg l respectively however it was susceptible to chl with a mic at 8 mg l in contrast the recipient strain exhibited a higher mic to chl mic 32 mg l but was susceptible to tet kan and amp when compared to the donor with mic at 64 mg l 64 mg l and 256 mg l respectively as expected all agnps mediated transconjugants had high mics against all four types of antibiotics with mics of 256 512 1024 and 32 mg l for tet kan amp and chl respectively table s1 secondly we used maldi tof mass spectrometer bacteria strain typing to identify the bacteria species of the transconjugants the classification of the strains was conducted by using ribosomal protein matching profiling hotta et al 2010 the results indicated that all selected strains were characterized as p putida kt2440 lastly we performed plasmid extractions from donor recipient and transconjugant cells to confirm the existence of the rp4 plasmid plasmid gel electrophoresis showed the donor and all transconjugant cells carried rp4 plasmids while the recipient did not fig s2 this was supporting the notion that the transconjugants received the plasmid from the donor collectively these results validate that all transconjugants were pseudomonas species containing the rp4 plasmid that codes for the multiple resistances against tet kan and amp 3 2 both agnps and ag induced over production of ros antibiotics are reported to enhance the bacterial plasmid conjugative transfer by elevating the oxidative stress and sos response beaber et al 2004 maiques et al 2006 analogously ag and agnps are known to able to induce oxidative stress amongst bacteria which eventually causes dna damage and triggers the sos response carlson et al 2008 lee et al 2014 consequently we investigated whether ag and agnps might promote the conjugative transfer of args by inducing oxidative stress and the sos response in bacteria for this we used a combination of approaches including flow cytometry rna sequencing and proteomics ros generation of e coli k 12 le392 and p putida kt2440 was seen to increase with the increasing concentrations of agnps and ag during the 2 h agnps treatment from 0 1 μg l to 1000 μg l the donor e coli k 12 strain expressed a significant increase of ros production p 0 05 p 0 01 the maximum value was observed at 1000 μg l agnps where there was a 3 44 fold increase of ros production compared to the untreated control in contrast for the recipient p putida kt2440 there was only a significant increase of ros production during exposure to the high agnps concentrations of 100 and 1000 μg l p 0 01 where there was a maximum increase of 2 3 fold compared to the untreated control fig 2 a regarding the ag treatment compared to the untreated control the ros production in the donor e coli k 12 was significantly increased during the exposures of ag from 1 to 1000 μg l p 0 05 p 0 01 this ros production was maximized at 1000 μg l ag with a 10 0 fold increase compared to the control it is worth noting that the significant increase of ros production in the donor started from a 10 fold lower concentration for agnps in comparison to ag similar to the agnps treatment the recipient p putida kt2440 only expressed a significant ros increase at the high ag concentrations of 100 and 1000 μg l p 0 05 p 0 01 specifically the increases of ros production at 1000 μg l ag in the donor 9 9 0 6 fold and the recipient 14 9 0 9 fold fig 2b were significantly p 0 01 higher than the increases caused by 1000 μg l agnps 3 4 0 3 fold for the donor and 2 3 0 1 fold for the recipient fig 2 a to verify whether ros was a key factor contributed to the promoted conjugative plasmid transfer we tested the effect of the ros scavenger thiourea on the agnps mediated ros generation and conjugative transfer when thiourea was added the ros levels of both donor e coli and recipient p putida under all agnps dosages remained similar to the untreated control level p 0 05 fig s3 furthermore the ros scavenger significantly repressed the conjugative transfer frequency of rp4 plasmid at the agnps dosages of 0 01 and 0 1 μg l p 0 01 fig 2 c the oxidative stress and sos responses were detected in both of the donor and recipient bacteria at the transcriptional and translational levels during the exposure to ag and agnps the gene expression profiles were obtained after 2 h exposure to sub inhibitory concentrations 0 1 μg l of agnps and ag the protein abundance levels were determined after 6 h exposure compared to the untreated control exposure to agnps and ag altered the transcriptional and translational responses of specific genes involved in oxidative stress response pathways specifically the agnps and ag exposure led to the upregulation of oxidative stress response genes including hydrogen peroxide oxidative damage protectant gene dps dukan and touati 1996 catalase hydroperoxidase and superoxide radicals degradation genes kate and katg loewen and switala 1986 superoxide dismutase encoding gene soda britton and fridovich 1977 and superoxide removal transcriptional activator gene soxs demple 1996 in the donor e coli in addition increased expressions of the peroxiredoxin alkylhydroperoxide reductase encoding genes ahpc and ahpf ochsner et al 2000 and soda were observed in the recipient p putida in particular the dps gene in e coli was up regulated by more than 3 2 fold and the ahpc gene in p putida was up regulated 9 2 fold moreover the protein translation of some of the genes mentioned above in e coli kate katg and dps and p putida sodb superoxide dismutase britton and fridovich 1977 and katg were also increased during exposure to agnps and ag also other oxidative stress response proteins such as peroxiredoxin tpx somprasong et al 2012 oxidative damage protectant dps dukan and touati 1996 organic hydroperoxide resistance protein ohr ochsner et al 2001 alkyl hydroperoxide reductase tsaa jeong et al 2000 and putative oxidoreductase pp 4203 were seen to increase in p putida fig 2 d the transcriptional profiles of both donor e coli and recipient p putida also showed evidence that agnps and ag exposure triggered the sos response in e coli the expression levels of umuc and umud genes which encode for sos mutagenesis error prone repair were increased 1 6 and 7 5 fold furthermore the transcription of dinb dna polymerase and the rec recombination system family reca recn and recx involved in the sos response were up regulated during the agnps and ag ion exposure similarly in p putida the transcription of the genes hexr and soxr coding for the dna binding transcriptional regulator were up regulated as well fig 2 d collectively these phenotypes gene expression and protein abundance investigations indicate that the agnps and ag enhanced conjugative transfer of args is associated with increased oxidative stress and up regulated sos response in bacterial cells 3 3 both agnps and ag increased cell membrane permeability oxidative stress induced by ros overproduction during agnps and ag exposure can cause bacteria cell membrane damage choi et al 2008 farr and kogoma 1991 and increase the membrane permeability potentially this could facilitate the transmission of genetic materials wang et al 2015b consequently we assessed whether cell membrane damage played an essential role in the ag agnps mediated plasmid conjugation facs assays of both e coli k 12 and p putida kt2440 treated with agnps and ag showed that the percentage of pi positive cells increased with increasing concentrations of agnps and ag thus indicating that bacterial cell membrane permeability was increased with increasing concentrations of agnps and ag fig 3 a and b during exposure to the tested agnps concentrations both donor e coli k 12 and recipient p putida kt2440 expressed significant increases p 0 05 p 0 01 of cell membrane permeability excepting the 0 1 μg l ag np treated donor e coli and the 0 01 μg l ag np treated recipient p putida in particular cell membrane permeability of p putida kt2440 under the exposure of 1000 μg l ag nps was up to 11 7 fold higher than that of the untreated cells p 0 01 the ag treatments from 1 μg l and above significantly increased independent sample t test p 0 05 p 0 01 the membrane permeability for both donor e coli k 12 and recipient p putida kt2440 fig 3 a and b cell membrane damage was further confirmed through tem tem images of 1 1 mixed donor e coli k 12 le392 and recipient p putida kt2440 under 0 1 μg l agnps and ag concentration were examined in the untreated control group fig 3 c the cell membranes were distinct and the cytoplasm was compact the cells were dispersed in the media with limited physical contact when treated with 0 1 μg l agnps obvious cell membrane damage was observed and the cell borders were indistinct more cell contact between the cells was evident fig 3 d at 0 1 μg l of ag treatment the membranes of bacteria were still distinguishable and the cytoplasm was compact however there was slightly more cell to cell contact between these cells fig 3 e the transcription and translational levels of cell membrane related genes in both donor and recipient which regulate cell membrane permeability were altered under agnps and ag treatment in the donor the transcription levels of the cell outer membrane protein encoding genes csgg ecnb slp ybay and yiad were up regulated in response to ag or agnps for instance the expression of ecnb gene was increased for 8 0 folds when exposed to agnps fig 3 f compared to the control group the gene ecnb encodes for protein entericidins b which is predicted to modulate membrane stability bishop et al 1998 additionally the translation of the donor e coli osmotic stress response genes osmb osmc osme osmf and osmy and the mechanosensitive channel encoding gene mscs were significantly up regulated when exposed to ag for osmb there was a 3 0 fold increase p 0 05 and a 2 0 fold increase for osme p 0 01 in contrast the expression of those genes were not largely changed when exposed to agnps p 0 05 moreover the transcriptional responses of lipopolysaccharide synthesis genes waaa waab waao waap waaq waar waas and waay were largely elevated under agnps treatment while the expression of those genes was not significantly altered under ag treatment for example expression of the waaa gene involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis required for the integrity of the outer membrane brabetz et al 2000 was increased by 2 3 folds p 0 01 fig 3 f on the other hand the major lipoprotein in e coli lpp the outer membrane porin protein ompa ompc and the outer membrane assembly proteins bama to bame were less abundant after the ag agnps exposure fig 3 f for the recipient p putida similarly the expression levels of the genes czcb 1 czcc 1 exbd fpva ompq ompr oprj pp 2669 pp 2754 and pp 4825 increased during the ag agnps exposure an increased maximum fold change of 3 7 was observed for pp 2669 these changes indicated transcriptional response to ag agnps induced membrane damage in p putida in terms of p putida protein levels the outer membrane porin proteins oprd opre and oprf as well as the outer membrane lipoprotein slyb were increased to a maximum of 2 8 fold change slyb under ag agnps treatments fig 3 f 3 4 ag agnps increased rp4 gene expression and atp synthesis in the recipient in addition to these regulated genes involved in oxidative stress sos and cell membranes mentioned above a few genes involved in rp4 plasmid were significantly regulated for the rp4 plasmid related genes the global regulator gene kora was up regulated under exposure to agnps ag and reached the highest fold change of 5 3 when exposed to agnps however the mrna expression of the conjugative transfer transcriptional regulator and the pilin regulatory genes did not increase under the exposure to agnps but were up regulated under ag exposure conversely the expression of replication regulator genes trac1 and trac2 were increased when exposed to agnps but did not increase under ag exposure fig s4 lastly it is worth noting that the abundance of recipient p putida atp synthesis proteins atph and atpg were increased by 2 0 fold fdr 0 05 and 1 4 fold fdr 0 05 when exposed to agnps and increased by 2 9 fold fdr 0 05 and 1 3 fold fdr 0 05 when exposed to ag respectively fig s4 4 discussion 4 1 both silver ions and agnps promoted the dissemination of antibiotic resistance through conjugation the dissemination of antibiotic resistance is a severe challenge to human health previous studies focus on the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance driven by antibiotics here we show that both ag and agnps at clinically relevant and environmentally relevant concentrations significantly stimulated the conjugative transfer of the antibiotics resistance gene carrying plasmid rp4 we verified that transconjugants were the recipient p putida kt2440 with rp4 plasmid based on antibiotic mic tests maldi tof ms and plasmid electrophoresis these all supported our conclusion that both agnps and ag enhanced the horizontal transfer of args agnps as emerging artificial contaminants have different physicochemical properties than bulk silver due to their different shape size and or surface properties carlson et al 2008 morones et al 2005 a recent study reported that ag at 100 μg l could promote the conjugative gene transfer within e coli bacteria genera zhang et al 2018 our result found out that together with ag agnps could promote the conjugative gene transfer across bacteria genera we found that both agnps and ag promoted the conjugative plasmid transfer at environmentally relevant concentrations and the transfer frequencies decreased at high agnps ag exposure moreover according to facs detection tem imaging and molecular analysis both agnps and ag were found to increase ros generation induce membrane damage and stimulate the sos response in donor and recipient cells however in our study we found that compared with ionic silver agnps promoted the hgt at a lower initial concentration and the mechanisms underlying the increased conjugation differed between the agnps and ag treatments it was seen that the ag treatment largely elevated the expression of donor e coli osmotic stress response genes while agnps treatment did not fig 3 f this indicates that the agnps induced toxicity is not mediated by dissolved ag but is dependent on the nanoparticle physicochemical properties this indication is further supported by rna sequencing results that the cell outer surface lipopolysaccharide synthesis genes of the donor e coli were up regulated only under agnps exposure but not under ag exposure fig 3 f it is reported that lipopolysaccharides may protect the cell by binding to cationic substances thereby prevent direct contact between the bacterial outer membrane and cationic toxins such as ag ivask et al 2012 therefore deteriorated cell membrane integrity and increase the sensitivity of cell induced by agnps may lead to the cellular defense response by over producing lipopolysaccharide likewise nano al2o3 and nano tio2 were also found to facilitate the conjugative transfer of plasmids due to their nanoparticle physicochemical properties whereas bulk or ionic al2o3 and tio2 could not qiu et al 2012 2015 therefore we suggest that agnps promote the plasmid conjugation differently than ionic silver due to the unique nanoparticle physicochemical properties a previous study also reported that distinct arg profiles were shaped after spiking with agnps or ag in lab scale wastewater treatment reactors in which greater abundance of stra aminoglycoside resistance genes were detected with agnps while more mls bacitracin and macrolide lincosamide streptogramin were observed in the reactor dosed with ag ma et al 2016 although they did not offer evidence to explain reasons they suggested that agnps might behave differently than ag in the water environment agnps target the outer membrane thereby leading to induced membrane damage and ros generation this may be a more effective damaging element than the osmotic silver ions defuse as the donor cells could remove ag via the ion efflux system booth and louis 1999 consequently these explained why agnps could enhance conjugation at a lower initial concentration than ag 4 2 mechanisms of ag and agnps promoted conjugative transfer this study employed multiple approaches to reveal the mechanisms to explain why both ag and agnps could promote the conjugative transfer of the rp4 plasmid based on the phenotypic and genetic expression data we propose there are multiple factors playing critical roles in the conjugation process including the generation of ros an elevated sos response and increased permeability of cell membranes of both donor and recipient bacteria thus increasing conjugation activity of the rp4 plasmid fig 4 the increased production of ros is a crucial factor for accelerating conjugation due to both ag and agnps exposure oxidation by ros is responsible for damage to cellular structures and ultimately cell death curtin et al 2002 oxidative stress caused by ros is known to promote the conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistant genes beaber et al 2004 in this study the levels of ros production in both donor and recipient strains increased significantly with increasing the concentrations of agnps ag the increase of ros generation was also observed from the transcriptional and translational response in the donor and recipient we also detected that the addition of the ros scavenger thiourea could significantly reduce the ros overproduction and lower agnps ag mediated conjugative transfer frequency this further confirmed that the ros overproduction induced by agnps ag have contributed to promoting the conjugative transfer our results are consistent with previous studies indicating that sub inhibitory levels of antibiotics baharoglu et al 2011 biocide lu et al 2018 and even the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine wang et al 2018 can accelerate the horizontal transfer of args by increasing intracellular ros formation ros can lead to dna damage thereby inducing the sos response when exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations 0 1 μg l of agnps and ag 12 genes in e coli and 2 in p putida that are relevant to the sos response showed increased expression in particular the umud gene in e coli was up regulated more than 7 5 fold and this has previously shown to play critical roles in the sos response to dna damage woodgate and ennis 1991 however conjugative transfer of ssdna is found to induce the bacterial sos stress response baharoglu et al 2010 thus the relationship between the sos response and conjugative transfer may have multiple causative factors increased membrane permeability has previously been associated with enhanced conjugative transfer frequency wang et al 2015a zhang et al 2016 in this study we found that under the exposure to a broad range of concentrations of both agnps and ag the cell membrane permeability of the donor and recipient increased significantly tem images demonstrated that the cell borders of agnps ag treated cells were indistinct and more instances of cell to cell contact were evident also genes in the recipient p putida that are related to the cell membrane permeability were up regulated based on both transcriptional and translational levels in the donor the translation levels of the major outer membrane prolipoprotein lpp that contributes to the maintenance of the membrane structure were largely down regulated fig 3f based on these results we hypothesize that the agnps ag enhanced the conjugative transfer by inducing changes in the cell membrane integrity it is also worth mentioning that the rp4 plasmid encoding genes in donor e coli were up regulated under either agnps or ag treatment this included the global regulator conjugative transfer transcriptional regulator replication regulator and pilin regulator encoding genes moreover the atp synthesis protein abundance was increased in the recipient which may play a role in the increased conjugation by providing more energy berzhinskene ia et al 1980 lopatkin et al 2016 a summary of the collective effects on conjugation of the antibiotic resistance plasmid under agnps and ag exposure is proposed fig 4 firstly the exposure caused acute bacteria ros overproduction which might lead to cell membrane damage and dna damage consequently membrane damage could then favor the conjugative plasmid transfer by impairing the membrane barrier meanwhile the response to ros caused dna damage then provoked the damage repair sos response which might also stimulate the conjugative gene transfer fig 4 4 3 implications of this study the release of ag and agnps to various water environments is widely detected blaser et al 2008 yu et al 2013 in particular the ecotoxicity of agnps has attracted increasing attention due to its increased release from different applications e g it uses in cosmetics fabrics and paints here we show that ag and agnps at environmentally relevant concentrations could promote the spread of args from e coli to p putida in the real world the effects of ag and agnps should be more complex in terms of more complicated matrix conditions including speciation bioavailability and transformation of agnps and more diverse bacteria communities for example the environmental transformation of agnps varies depending on the media specific competing rates of direct oxysulfidation and oxidative dissolution a quantitative kinetic study suggested that agnps could be sulfidated via an oxidative dissolution precipitation mechanism instead of oxysulfidation liu et al 2011 thereby the bio active ag along with peroxide a common ros would be released as intermediates by this oxidation mechanism liu and hurt 2010 liu et al 2011 this dissolved ag from agnps and the consequent peroxide generation can also trigger horizontal transfer of args in addition high concentrations of agnps in some specific environments e g landfill leachate could contribute to the long term release of ag liu and hurt 2010 therefore agnps could considerably accelerate the spread of antibiotics resistance not only from its nano properties but also in the form of released ions on the other hand the dissolved ag and the remaining agnps can inhibit the bacterial growth this could decrease the gene transfer frequencies as suggested by a very recent study su et al 2019 thus it is necessary to establish an in situ mating system to investigate the effects of agnps or ag on the arg transfer among the diverse microbial communities furthermore agnps and ag are increasingly applied in clinical treatments as alternative antibacterial agents due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance mohler et al 2018 it is a concern that as an antimicrobial agent misuse and overuse of agnps and ag might not only lead to the develop resistance to silver percival et al 2005 randall et al 2015 but also induce the resistance to antibiotics via mutation kaweeteerawat et al 2017 or horizontal transfer of args as shown in this study consequently in addition to developing control strategies to limit the agnps pollution in various environments there is an urgent requirement to monitor and provide guidance on the clinical application of agnps 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that agnps and ag could accelerate the horizontal transfer of args when present at environmentally relevant and sub inhibitory concentrations and thereby enhancing the transmission of antibiotic resistance we further investigated the underlying mechanisms for agnps or ag enhanced conjugative transfer by collecting multi evidence of cellular responses these included ros detection cell membrane permeability cell ultrastructure and changes in gene expression and protein abundance this study revealed that both ag and agnps could promote the conjugative gene transfer via inducing ros overproduction triggering sos response and increasing cell membrane permeability additionally the increased ros generation and conjugative gene transfer frequency could be negated by the addition of a ros scavenger this is the first study to demonstrate the increased dissemination of args through hgt promoted by agnps further research on the effects of agnps on the args transfer between microbial community for example in activated sludge and soils in situ and human guts in vivo is much needed to elucidate the potential effect of agnps on environmental conjugation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18342,antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a growing threat to global human health horizontal gene transfer hgt of antibiotic resistance genes args is recognized as the primary contributor to antibiotic resistance dissemination silver nanoparticles agnps are widely used in personal care products as antimicrobial agents while heavy metals are known to induce antibiotic resistance in bacteria it is not known whether agnps in the environment can stimulate the hgt of args here we report that both agnps and ionic silver ag at environmentally relevant and sub lethal concentrations facilitate the conjugative transfer of plasmid borne args across bacterial genera from the donor escherichia coli k 12 le392 to the recipient pseudomonas putida kt2440 the underlying mechanisms of the ag or agnps promoted hgt were unveiled by detecting oxidative stress and cell membrane permeability combined with genome wide rna sequencing and proteomic analyses it was found that both ag and agnps exposure induced various bacterial responses that included reactive oxygen species ros generation membrane damage and the sos response this study exposes the potential ecological risks of environmental levels of agnps and ag for promoting the spread of args and highlights concerns regarding the management of nanoparticles and heavy metals graphical abstract image 1 keywords silver ion

between one bacterium and another in the process the circular plasmids serve as shuttles and reservoirs for args baharoglu et al 2010 conjugation will occur between bacteria of the same genera intra species but also between different genera inter species at a lower frequency debruyn et al 2012 inoue et al 2005 generally the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in medicine veterinary animal feeding and aquaculture are considered as the main driving forces of the spread of antibiotic resistance via mutation giedraitiene et al 2011 gillespie et al 2005 henderson begg et al 2006 and hgt lopatkin et al 2016 lu et al 2017 however in recent years increasing evidence suggests that heavy metals can induce antibiotic resistance via direct mutation chen et al 2015 or indirect co selection pal et al 2017 wales and davies 2015 for example cu ii cd ii zn ii and hg ii have been reported to induce antibiotic resistance via co selection di cesare et al 2016 ji et al 2012 seiler and berendonk 2012 in addition cu ii ag i cr vi and zn ii were able to enhance the intra species conjugative transfer of args between escherichia coli strains zhang et al 2018 additionally previous studies report that nano al2o3 and nano tio2 both promote the conjugative transfer of args qiu et al 2012 2015 however limited studies are reporting whether and how silver ions ag or silver nanoparticles agnps could promote the dissemination of antibiotic resistance via inter species hgt silver was widely used in medicine to treat bacterial infections before the discovery and development of the antibiotics in the 1940s recently the utilization of silver to treat infectious diseases is attracting attention again due to the severe threat of antibiotic resistance mohler et al 2018 silver is also considered as an environmental contaminant since its presence will deteriorate water quality compared to other elementary substance forms of silver agnps are much smaller in size and have a larger surface area to volume ratio allowing them to interact with cell membranes and to affect bacterial structure or metabolism anaya et al 2016 carlson et al 2008 hong et al 2016 lok et al 2006 due to the broad spectrum antimicrobial activities of agnps durán et al 2016 marambio jones and hoek 2010 agnps are being increasingly used in medicine food technology textiles fabrics consumer products and water treatment blaser et al 2008 kaegi et al 2011 yu et al 2013 up to 500 tons of agnps are annually produced and used worldwide brunetti et al 2015 thus as a ubiquitous and emerging contaminant agnps are detected in various aquatic ecosystems including surface freshwater sewer networks wastewater treatment plants wwtp and seawater with concentrations ranging from low levels at 0 8 ng l to much higher levels at 1 mg l kaegi et al 2013 levard et al 2012 yu et al 2013 although the majority of agnps 85 released into wastewater would likely to be transformed into ag2s up to 5 of the agnps were still found to be remained as metallic nanoparticles in the effluent of wastewater treatment systems kaegi et al 2011 because both silver ions ag and agnps have antimicrobial effects there are concerns that ag and agnps may induce antibiotic resistance larimer et al 2014 percival et al 2005 in particular ag and agnps are able to introduce reactive oxygen species ros and cell membrane damage to bacteria anaya et al 2016 carlson et al 2008 and these are detected as major mechanisms by which biocidal agents or pharmaceuticals facilitate conjugative transfer of args lu et al 2018 wang et al 2018 thus we raise the hypothesis that ag and agnps can promote conjugative transfer due to their antimicrobial nature to prove this hypothesis we evaluated the effects of both ag and agnps at environmentally relevant and sub inhibitory concentrations on the frequency of the plasmid mediated conjugative transfer of args from e coli to pseudomonas putida i e inter species conjugation furthermore we examined the mechanisms associated with increased hgt caused by both ag and agnps through a series of molecular investigations these investigations included monitoring intracellular ros levels determining cell membrane permeability changes and by detecting changes in gene expression and protein abundance for elements involved in the sos response oxidative stress and conjugative transfer to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the effects and mechanisms of agnps on the horizontal transfer of args the findings advance the understanding of the roles of both ag and agnps on the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and provide reasoning for improved management of nps 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains culture conditions and agnps e coli k 12 le392 was selected as the donor strain to assess the efficiency of conjugative plasmid transfer the donor e coli harbors a conjugative plasmid rp4 60099 bp that includes genes for resistance to ampicillin amp tetracycline tet and kanamycin kan the recipient p putida kt2440 was purchased from the american type culture collection atcc number 47054 and had higher chloramphenicol chl resistance than the donor e coli both the donor and recipient strains were incubated at 30 c in luria broth lb medium 10 g tryptone 5 g yeast extract and 10 g sodium chloride in 1 l deionized water ph 7 4 and shaken at 150 rpm overnight then the prepared bacterial strains were collected by centrifugation at 6000 g for 5 min at 4 c the subsequent cell pellets were then washed using phosphate buffered saline 1 pbs ph 7 2 and resuspended in pbs before being applied to the conjugation experiments and mechanistic investigations described below the agnps solution 10 16 w w was purchased from fraunhofer institute for molecular biology and applied ecology ime germany these are synthesized by an aqueous reduction method and then monodispersed with monolayer capping agent 4 each of polyoxyethylene glycerol trioleate and polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan mono laurat tween 20 the agnps had a primary particle size of 15 nm as determined by transmission electron microscopy tem just prior to the conjugation exposure experiments described below fresh agnps solutions of 1 mg ml were prepared by diluting the purchased agnps in milli q water and these were subsequently treated by ultrasonication 80 w for 30 min in a water bath 20 c the dissolution of ag from agnps in milli q water was less than 0 8 i e 0 78 mg ag from 100 mg l agnps after 24 h according to our previous study chen et al 2018 the agno3 solution was supplied by sigma aldrich usa the antibiotics tetracycline tet and chloramphenicol chl were supplied by sigma aldrich usa the antibiotic ampicillin amp was purchased from gold biotechnology usa and kanamycin kan was supplied by astral scientific australia 2 2 evaluation of the impact of agnps on conjugative transfer frequency of args the cultured bacteria were resuspended in pbs solution to obtain 1 108 cfu ml for the conjugation experiments mating the 1 108 cfu ml donor and recipient bacteria were mixed at 1 1 ratio and exposed to different concentrations of agnps with ag concentrations at 0 01 0 1 1 10 100 and 1000 μg l and agno3 with ag concentrations at 0 01 0 1 1 10 100 and 1000 μg l for 6 h addition of milliq water only was included as the no added ag control group the determination of transconjugants was conducted according to the previously described method lu et al 2018 briefly the donor e coli has high resistance to tet kan and amp but was sensitive to chl while the recipient p putida was resistant to chl but sensitive to tet kan and amp thus the transconjugant has high resistance against all four antibiotics these strains were then separated on lb agar plates containing different antibiotic combinations then the transfer frequency was calculated by dividing the number of transconjugants by the number of total recipients all experiments were conducted using biological triplicates additional conjugation exposure experiments were conducted to determine whether agnps promote ros generation in these experiments 100 μm of thiourea a ros scavenger was added into the across genera mating system described above at 10 min before adding 0 0 01 and 0 1 μg l agnps the conjugation transfer frequency of the ros scavenger treated group was then compared with the non scavenger treated group all experiments were conducted with biological triplicates as described in our previous study lu et al 2018 2 3 minimum inhibitory concentrations mics analysis the mics of agnps ag amp tet kan and chl against donor e coli recipient p putida and transconjugants were tested by following the initial experiment set up suggested by to the eucast clinical breakpoints methods

chemicals sterilized lb was set as the blank control a microplate spectrophotometer was used to measure the optical density at 600 nm od600 after 16 h incubation at 37 c for transconjugants one transconjugant from each of the seven transconjugant selective plates selected for transconjugants under seven different agnp treatments were randomly selected the mics were calculated as the concentrations of metal ions or antibiotics that completely inhibited the growth of bacterial cells all mic experiments were conducted with biological triplicates 2 4 bacterial identification by maldi tof ms matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry maldi tof ms was used to identify the bacteria species of transconjugants briefly three of the previous randomly

kit abcam uk was employed according to the manufacturer s instructions cell membrane permeability was tested using the propidium iodide dye pi at the concentration of 2 mm life technologies usa as described previously lu et al 2018 2 6 plasmid extraction and gel electrophoresis the donor strain recipient strain together with the previous randomly selected transconjugants for mic testing were cultured in lb broth overnight and harvested for plasmid extraction as previously described lu et al 2018 plasmid extraction for the selected transconjugants was performed using the invitrogentm purelink quick plasmid miniprep kit life technologies usa following the manufacturer s instructions following extraction agarose gel electrophoresis was applied to verify the presence of plasmids in each transconjugant 2 7 transmission electron microscope tem imaging tem was performed to characterize whether the cell morphology or membrane was changed under exposure of agnps and ag briefly 0 1 μg

deposited to the proteomexchange consortium via the pride partner repository with the dataset identifier pxd012641 3 results 3 1 both agnps and ag significantly increased the conjugative transfer frequency the mics of agnps and ag against donor and recipient strains were determined mics of the donor against agnps and ag were 100 and 25 μg l respectively while mics of the recipient against agnps and ag were 50 and 12 5 μg l respectively table s1 in order to test whether agnps and ag were able to enhance conjugative transfer wide ranging exposure levels were chosen for the mating processes these included clinically relevant concentrations 100 1000 μg l mohler et al 2018 and environmentally relevant concentrations 0 01 100 μg l yu et al 2013 the conjugative transfer frequency of rp4 plasmid was significantly increased across the bacterial species under the exposure of both agnps and ag at environmentally relevant and sub mic concentrations fig 1 compared with the control groups the conjugative transfer frequency of rp4 plasmid was significantly increased under the exposure of agnps at 0 1 and 1 μg l p 0 05 p 0 01 fig 1 specifically the conjugative transfer frequency 2 4 0 3 10 6 per recipient cell at 0 1 μg l agnps was up to 1 8 fold higher than that of the control groups 1 4 0 1 10 6 per recipient cell fig 1 a similarly ag also promoted the horizontal transfer of rp4 plasmid during the exposures at 1 μg l to 100 μg l this transfer frequency was up to 2 4 fold higher 3 3 0 7 10 6 per recipient cell than that of the control groups at 1 μg l of ag treatment p 0 01 fig 1 b in contrast when the exposure concentrations of agnps and ag increased to 1000 μg l the conjugative transfer frequencies of rp4 plasmid significantly decreased p 0 01 compared to the control likely this was due to the reduced recipient number and viability in the mating system at the agnps ag concentrations that were highly above mics flow cytometry indicated that despite over 85 of the donor e coli were alive after 6 h of the 1000 μg l agnps and ag treatments respectively fig s1 a and b only 4 9 and 0 8 of the recipient p putida were still alive after 6 h of the 1000 μg l agnps and ag treatments respectively fig s1 c and d to confirm the conjugative plasmid transfer we verified the transconjugant by determining 1 mics against antibiotics 2 matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight maldi tof mass spectrometer bacteria strain typing and 3 confirmation of plasmid by gel electrophoresis firstly the antibiotic resistance spectrums against tet kan amp and chl were scanned for donor recipient and transconjugant strains table s1 the donor e coli strain exhibited multidrug resistant against tet kan and amp with mics of 256 mg l 512 mg l and 1024 mg l respectively however it was susceptible to chl with a mic at 8 mg l in contrast the recipient strain exhibited a higher mic to chl mic 32 mg l but was susceptible to tet kan and amp when compared to the donor with mic at 64 mg l 64 mg l and 256 mg l respectively as expected all agnps mediated transconjugants had high mics against all four types of antibiotics with mics of 256 512 1024 and 32 mg l for tet kan amp and chl respectively table s1 secondly we used maldi tof mass spectrometer bacteria strain typing to identify the bacteria species of the transconjugants the classification of the strains was conducted by using ribosomal protein matching profiling hotta et al 2010 the results indicated that all selected strains were characterized as p putida kt2440 lastly we performed plasmid extractions from donor recipient and transconjugant cells to confirm the existence of the rp4 plasmid plasmid gel electrophoresis showed the donor and all transconjugant cells carried rp4 plasmids while the recipient did not fig s2 this was supporting the notion that the transconjugants received the plasmid from the donor collectively these results validate that all transconjugants were pseudomonas species containing the rp4 plasmid that codes for the multiple resistances against tet kan and amp 3 2 both agnps and ag induced over production of ros antibiotics are reported to enhance the bacterial plasmid conjugative transfer by elevating the oxidative stress and sos response beaber et al 2004 maiques et al 2006 analogously ag and agnps are known to able to induce oxidative stress amongst bacteria which eventually causes dna damage and triggers the sos response carlson et al 2008 lee et al 2014 consequently we investigated whether ag and agnps might promote the conjugative transfer of args by inducing oxidative stress and the sos response in bacteria for this we used a combination of approaches including flow cytometry rna sequencing and proteomics ros generation of e coli k 12 le392 and p putida kt2440 was seen to increase with the increasing concentrations of agnps and ag during the 2 h agnps treatment from 0 1 μg l to 1000 μg l the donor e coli k 12 strain expressed a significant increase of ros production p 0 05 p 0 01 the maximum value was observed at 1000 μg l agnps where there was a 3 44 fold increase of ros production compared to the untreated control in contrast for the recipient p putida kt2440 there was only a significant increase of ros production during exposure to the high agnps concentrations of 100 and 1000 μg l p 0 01 where there was a maximum increase of 2 3 fold compared to the untreated control fig 2 a regarding the ag treatment compared to the untreated control the ros production in the donor e coli k 12 was significantly increased during the exposures of ag from 1 to 1000 μg l p 0 05 p 0 01 this ros production was maximized at 1000 μg l ag with a 10 0 fold increase compared to the control it is worth noting that the significant increase of ros production in the donor started from a 10 fold lower concentration for agnps in comparison to ag similar to the agnps treatment the recipient p putida kt2440 only expressed a significant ros increase at the high ag concentrations of 100 and 1000 μg l p 0 05 p 0 01 specifically the increases of ros production at 1000 μg l ag in the donor 9 9 0 6 fold and the recipient 14 9 0 9 fold fig 2b were significantly p 0 01 higher than the increases caused by 1000 μg l agnps 3 4 0 3 fold for the donor and 2 3 0 1 fold for the recipient fig 2 a to verify whether ros was a key factor contributed to the promoted conjugative plasmid transfer we tested the effect of the ros scavenger thiourea on the agnps mediated ros generation and conjugative transfer when thiourea was added the ros levels of both donor e coli and recipient p putida under all agnps dosages remained similar to the untreated control level p 0 05 fig s3 furthermore the ros scavenger significantly repressed the conjugative transfer frequency of rp4 plasmid at the agnps dosages of 0 01 and 0 1 μg l p 0 01 fig 2 c the oxidative stress and sos responses were detected in both of the donor and recipient bacteria at the transcriptional and translational levels during the exposure to ag and agnps the gene expression profiles were obtained after 2 h exposure to sub inhibitory concentrations 0 1 μg l of agnps and ag the protein abundance levels were determined after 6 h exposure compared to the untreated control exposure to agnps and ag altered the transcriptional and translational responses of specific genes involved in oxidative stress response pathways specifically the agnps and ag exposure led to the upregulation of oxidative stress response genes including hydrogen peroxide oxidative damage protectant gene dps dukan and touati 1996 catalase hydroperoxidase and superoxide radicals degradation genes kate and katg loewen and switala 1986 superoxide dismutase encoding gene soda britton and fridovich 1977 and superoxide removal transcriptional activator gene soxs demple 1996 in the donor e coli in addition increased expressions of the peroxiredoxin alkylhydroperoxide reductase encoding genes ahpc and ahpf ochsner et al 2000 and soda were observed in the recipient p putida in particular the dps gene in e coli was up regulated by more than 3 2 fold and the ahpc gene in p putida was up regulated 9 2 fold moreover the protein translation of some of the genes mentioned above in e coli kate katg and dps and p putida sodb superoxide dismutase britton and fridovich 1977 and katg were also increased during exposure to agnps and ag also other oxidative stress response proteins such as peroxiredoxin tpx somprasong et al 2012 oxidative damage protectant dps dukan and touati 1996 organic hydroperoxide resistance protein ohr ochsner et al 2001 alkyl hydroperoxide reductase tsaa jeong et al 2000 and putative oxidoreductase pp 4203 were seen to increase in p putida fig 2 d the transcriptional profiles of both donor e coli and recipient p putida also showed evidence that agnps and ag exposure triggered the sos response in e coli the expression levels of umuc and umud genes which encode for sos mutagenesis error prone repair were increased 1 6 and 7 5 fold furthermore the transcription of dinb dna polymerase and the rec recombination system family reca recn and recx involved in the sos response were up regulated during the agnps and ag ion exposure similarly in p putida the transcription of the genes hexr and soxr coding for the dna binding transcriptional regulator were up regulated as well fig 2 d collectively these phenotypes gene expression and protein abundance investigations indicate that the agnps and ag enhanced conjugative transfer of args is associated with increased oxidative stress and up regulated sos response in bacterial cells 3 3 both agnps and ag increased cell membrane permeability oxidative stress induced by ros overproduction during agnps and ag exposure can cause bacteria cell membrane damage choi et al 2008 farr and kogoma 1991 and increase the membrane permeability potentially this could facilitate the transmission of genetic materials wang et al 2015b consequently we assessed whether cell membrane damage played an essential role in the ag agnps mediated plasmid conjugation facs assays of both e coli k 12 and p putida kt2440 treated with agnps and ag showed that the percentage of pi positive cells increased with increasing concentrations of agnps and ag thus indicating that bacterial cell membrane permeability was increased with increasing concentrations of agnps and ag fig 3 a and b during exposure to the tested agnps concentrations both donor e coli k 12 and recipient p putida kt2440 expressed significant increases p 0 05 p 0 01 of cell membrane permeability excepting the 0 1 μg l ag np treated donor e coli and the 0 01 μg l ag np treated recipient p putida in particular cell membrane permeability of p putida kt2440 under the exposure of 1000 μg l ag nps was up to 11 7 fold higher than that of the untreated cells p 0 01 the ag treatments from 1 μg l and above significantly increased independent sample t test p 0 05 p 0 01 the membrane permeability for both donor e coli k 12 and recipient p putida kt2440 fig 3 a and b cell membrane damage was further confirmed through tem tem images of 1 1 mixed donor e coli k 12 le392 and recipient p putida kt2440 under 0 1 μg l agnps and ag concentration were examined in the untreated control group fig 3 c the cell membranes were distinct and the cytoplasm was compact the cells were dispersed in the media with limited physical contact when treated with 0 1 μg l agnps obvious cell membrane damage was observed and the cell borders were indistinct more cell contact between the cells was evident fig 3 d at 0 1 μg l of ag treatment the membranes of bacteria were still distinguishable and the cytoplasm was compact however there was slightly more cell to cell contact between these cells fig 3 e the transcription and translational levels of cell membrane related genes in both donor and recipient which regulate cell membrane permeability were altered under agnps and ag treatment in the donor the transcription levels of the cell outer membrane protein encoding genes csgg ecnb slp ybay and yiad were up regulated in response to ag or agnps for instance the expression of ecnb gene was increased for 8 0 folds when exposed to agnps fig 3 f compared to the control group the gene ecnb encodes for protein entericidins b which is predicted to modulate membrane stability bishop et al 1998 additionally the translation of the donor e coli osmotic stress response genes osmb osmc osme osmf and osmy and the mechanosensitive channel encoding gene mscs were significantly up regulated when exposed to ag for osmb there was a 3 0 fold increase p 0 05 and a 2 0 fold increase for osme p 0 01 in contrast the expression of those genes were not largely changed when exposed to agnps p 0 05 moreover the transcriptional responses of lipopolysaccharide synthesis genes waaa waab waao waap waaq waar waas and waay were largely elevated under agnps treatment while the expression of those genes was not significantly altered under ag treatment for example expression of the waaa gene involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis required for the integrity of the outer membrane brabetz et al 2000 was increased by 2 3 folds p 0 01 fig 3 f on the other hand the major lipoprotein in e coli lpp the outer membrane porin protein ompa ompc and the outer membrane assembly proteins bama to bame were less abundant after the ag agnps exposure fig 3 f for the recipient p putida similarly the expression levels of the genes czcb 1 czcc 1 exbd fpva ompq ompr oprj pp 2669 pp 2754 and pp 4825 increased during the ag agnps exposure an increased maximum fold change of 3 7 was observed for pp 2669 these changes indicated transcriptional response to ag agnps induced membrane damage in p putida in terms of p putida protein levels the outer membrane porin proteins oprd opre and oprf as well as the outer membrane lipoprotein slyb were increased to a maximum of 2 8 fold change slyb under ag agnps treatments fig 3 f 3 4 ag agnps increased rp4 gene expression and atp synthesis in the recipient in addition to these regulated genes involved in oxidative stress sos and cell membranes mentioned above a few genes involved in rp4 plasmid were significantly regulated for the rp4 plasmid related genes the global regulator gene kora was up regulated under exposure to agnps ag and reached the highest fold change of 5 3 when exposed to agnps however the mrna expression of the conjugative transfer transcriptional regulator and the pilin regulatory genes did not increase under the exposure to agnps but were up regulated under ag exposure conversely the expression of replication regulator genes trac1 and trac2 were increased when exposed to agnps but did not increase under ag exposure fig s4 lastly it is worth noting that the abundance of recipient p putida atp synthesis proteins atph and atpg were increased by 2 0 fold fdr 0 05 and 1 4 fold fdr 0 05 when exposed to agnps and increased by 2 9 fold fdr 0 05 and 1 3 fold fdr 0 05 when exposed to ag respectively fig s4 4 discussion 4 1 both silver ions and agnps promoted the dissemination of antibiotic resistance through conjugation the dissemination of antibiotic resistance is a severe challenge to human health previous studies focus on the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance driven by antibiotics here we show that both ag and agnps at clinically relevant and environmentally relevant concentrations significantly stimulated the conjugative transfer of the antibiotics resistance gene carrying plasmid rp4 we verified that transconjugants were the recipient p putida kt2440 with rp4 plasmid based on antibiotic mic tests maldi tof ms and plasmid electrophoresis these all supported our conclusion that both agnps and ag enhanced the horizontal transfer of args agnps as emerging artificial contaminants have different physicochemical properties than bulk silver due to their different shape size and or surface properties carlson et al 2008 morones et al 2005 a recent study reported that ag at 100 μg l could promote the conjugative gene transfer within e coli bacteria genera zhang et al 2018 our result found out that together with ag agnps could promote the conjugative gene transfer across bacteria genera we found that both agnps and ag promoted the conjugative plasmid transfer at environmentally relevant concentrations and the transfer frequencies decreased at high agnps ag exposure moreover according to facs detection tem imaging and molecular analysis both agnps and ag were found to increase ros generation induce membrane damage and stimulate the sos response in donor and recipient cells however in our study we found that compared with ionic silver agnps promoted the hgt at a lower initial concentration and the mechanisms underlying the increased conjugation differed between the agnps and ag treatments it was seen that the ag treatment largely elevated the expression of donor e coli osmotic stress response genes while agnps treatment did not fig 3 f this indicates that the agnps induced toxicity is not mediated by dissolved ag but is dependent on the nanoparticle physicochemical properties this indication is further supported by rna sequencing results that the cell outer surface lipopolysaccharide synthesis genes of the donor e coli were up regulated only under agnps exposure but not under ag exposure fig 3 f it is reported that lipopolysaccharides may protect the cell by binding to cationic substances thereby prevent direct contact between the bacterial outer membrane and cationic toxins such as ag ivask et al 2012 therefore deteriorated cell membrane integrity and increase the sensitivity of cell induced by agnps may lead to the cellular defense response by over producing lipopolysaccharide likewise nano al2o3 and nano tio2 were also found to facilitate the conjugative transfer of plasmids due to their nanoparticle physicochemical properties whereas bulk or ionic al2o3 and tio2 could not qiu et al 2012 2015 therefore we suggest that agnps promote the plasmid conjugation differently than ionic silver due to the unique nanoparticle physicochemical properties a previous study also reported that distinct arg profiles were shaped after spiking with agnps or ag in lab scale wastewater treatment reactors in which greater abundance of stra aminoglycoside resistance genes were detected with agnps while more mls bacitracin and macrolide lincosamide streptogramin were observed in the reactor dosed with ag ma et al 2016 although they did not offer evidence to explain reasons they suggested that agnps might behave differently than ag in the water environment agnps target the outer membrane thereby leading to induced membrane damage and ros generation this may be a more effective damaging element than the osmotic silver ions defuse as the donor cells could remove ag via the ion efflux system booth and louis 1999 consequently these explained why agnps could enhance conjugation at a lower initial concentration than ag 4 2 mechanisms of ag and agnps promoted conjugative transfer this study employed multiple approaches to reveal the mechanisms to explain why both ag and agnps could promote the conjugative transfer of the rp4 plasmid based on the phenotypic and genetic expression data we propose there are multiple factors playing critical roles in the conjugation process including the generation of ros an elevated sos response and increased permeability of cell membranes of both donor and recipient bacteria thus increasing conjugation activity of the rp4 plasmid fig 4 the increased production of ros is a crucial factor for accelerating conjugation due to both ag and agnps exposure oxidation by ros is responsible for damage to cellular structures and ultimately cell death curtin et al 2002 oxidative stress caused by ros is known to promote the conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistant genes beaber et al 2004 in this study the levels of ros production in both donor and recipient strains increased significantly with increasing the concentrations of agnps ag the increase of ros generation was also observed from the transcriptional and translational response in the donor and recipient we also detected that the addition of the ros scavenger thiourea could significantly reduce the ros overproduction and lower agnps ag mediated conjugative transfer frequency this further confirmed that the ros overproduction induced by agnps ag have contributed to promoting the conjugative transfer our results are consistent with previous studies indicating that sub inhibitory levels of antibiotics baharoglu et al 2011 biocide lu et al 2018 and even the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine wang et al 2018 can accelerate the horizontal transfer of args by increasing intracellular ros formation ros can lead to dna damage thereby inducing the sos response when exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations 0 1 μg l of agnps and ag 12 genes in e coli and 2 in p putida that are relevant to the sos response showed increased expression in particular the umud gene in e coli was up regulated more than 7 5 fold and this has previously shown to play critical roles in the sos response to dna damage woodgate and ennis 1991 however conjugative transfer of ssdna is found to induce the bacterial sos stress response baharoglu et al 2010 thus the relationship between the sos response and conjugative transfer may have multiple causative factors increased membrane permeability has previously been associated with enhanced conjugative transfer frequency wang et al 2015a zhang et al 2016 in this study we found that under the exposure to a broad range of concentrations of both agnps and ag the cell membrane permeability of the donor and recipient increased significantly tem images demonstrated that the cell borders of agnps ag treated cells were indistinct and more instances of cell to cell contact were evident also genes in the recipient p putida that are related to the cell membrane permeability were up regulated based on both transcriptional and translational levels in the donor the translation levels of the major outer membrane prolipoprotein lpp that contributes to the maintenance of the membrane structure were largely down regulated fig 3f based on these results we hypothesize that the agnps ag enhanced the conjugative transfer by inducing changes in the cell membrane integrity it is also worth mentioning that the rp4 plasmid encoding genes in donor e coli were up regulated under either agnps or ag treatment this included the global regulator conjugative transfer transcriptional regulator replication regulator and pilin regulator encoding genes moreover the atp synthesis protein abundance was increased in the recipient which may play a role in the increased conjugation by providing more energy berzhinskene ia et al 1980 lopatkin et al 2016 a summary of the collective effects on conjugation of the antibiotic resistance plasmid under agnps and ag exposure is proposed fig 4 firstly the exposure caused acute bacteria ros overproduction which might lead to cell membrane damage and dna damage consequently membrane damage could then favor the conjugative plasmid transfer by impairing the membrane barrier meanwhile the response to ros caused dna damage then provoked the damage repair sos response which might also stimulate the conjugative gene transfer fig 4 4 3 implications of this study the release of ag and agnps to various water environments is widely detected blaser et al 2008 yu et al 2013 in particular the ecotoxicity of agnps has attracted increasing attention due to its increased release from different applications e g it uses in cosmetics fabrics and paints here we show that ag and agnps at environmentally relevant concentrations could promote the spread of args from e coli to p putida in the real world the effects of ag and agnps should be more complex in terms of more complicated matrix conditions including speciation bioavailability and transformation of agnps and more diverse bacteria communities for example the environmental transformation of agnps varies depending on the media specific competing rates of direct oxysulfidation and oxidative dissolution a quantitative kinetic study suggested that agnps could be sulfidated via an oxidative dissolution precipitation mechanism instead of oxysulfidation liu et al 2011 thereby the bio active ag along with peroxide a common ros would be released as intermediates by this oxidation mechanism liu and hurt 2010 liu et al 2011 this dissolved ag from agnps and the consequent peroxide generation can also trigger horizontal transfer of args in addition high concentrations of agnps in some specific environments e g landfill leachate could contribute to the long term release of ag liu and hurt 2010 therefore agnps could considerably accelerate the spread of antibiotics resistance not only from its nano properties but also in the form of released ions on the other hand the dissolved ag and the remaining agnps can inhibit the bacterial growth this could decrease the gene transfer frequencies as suggested by a very recent study su et al 2019 thus it is necessary to establish an in situ mating system to investigate the effects of agnps or ag on the arg transfer among the diverse microbial communities furthermore agnps and ag are increasingly applied in clinical treatments as alternative antibacterial agents due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance mohler et al 2018 it is a concern that as an antimicrobial agent misuse and overuse of agnps and ag might not only lead to the develop resistance to silver percival et al 2005 randall et al 2015 but also induce the resistance to antibiotics via mutation kaweeteerawat et al 2017 or horizontal transfer of args as shown in this study consequently in addition to developing control strategies to limit the agnps pollution in various environments there is an urgent requirement to monitor and provide guidance on the clinical application of agnps 5 conclusions this study demonstrated that agnps and ag could accelerate the horizontal transfer of args when present at environmentally relevant and sub inhibitory concentrations and thereby enhancing the transmission of antibiotic resistance we further investigated the underlying mechanisms for agnps or ag enhanced conjugative transfer by collecting multi evidence of cellular responses these included ros detection cell membrane permeability cell ultrastructure and changes in gene expression and protein abundance this study revealed that both ag and agnps could promote the conjugative gene transfer via inducing ros overproduction triggering sos response and increasing cell membrane permeability additionally the increased ros generation and conjugative gene transfer frequency could be negated by the addition of a ros scavenger this is the first study to demonstrate the increased dissemination of args through hgt promoted by agnps further research on the effects of agnps on the args transfer between microbial community for example in activated sludge and soils in situ and human guts in vivo is much needed to elucidate the potential effect of agnps on environmental conjugation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

reveal that p released from biochar produced at 700 c e700 was more easily absorbed by p putida than that released from biochar produced at 400 c e400 this is attributed to the higher polyphosphates poly p content in e700 and poly p has higher affinity to p putida surface compared to orthophosphates furthermore e400 has a negative effect on intracellular poly p formation in p putida which is probably caused by the oxidative stress induced by the free radicals from e400 as intracellular poly p plays a critical role on bacteria survival and their interaction with surrounding environment high temperature biochar e700 in this case would be more suitable for soil remediation graphical abstract image 1 keywords ebpr sludge phosphorus recovery biochar biotransformation of phosphorus free radicals 1 introduction sewage sludge produced from wastewater treatment plants contains precious phosphorus p as the global p stock will be depleted in the following centuries desmidt et al 2014 recovering p from wastewater sewage sludge is of great environmental significance converting sewage sludge into biochar and applying sludge biochar as a p fertilizer to soil is a convenient and feasible approach li et al 2018 mackay et al 2017 qian and jiang 2014 among the various types of sludge the sludge derived from enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process is a competitive raw material to produce biochar huang and tang 2015 qian et al 2019a as ebpr sludge contains much higher p 5 17 than other sludge 1 2 bond and rees 1999 in our previous work we identified p species in ebpr sludge and developed a readily and green method to enhance the availability of p in ebpr sludge biochar qian et al 2019a we concluded that ebpr sludge biochar could be a robust p fertilizer in the soil when biochar is applied to the soil it would inevitably interact with soil microorganisms soil microorganisms are considered as a critical p pool in the soil and play a regulating role on the level of available p in the soil yevdokimov et al 2016 therefore it is imperative to understand the interaction between biochar and soil microorganisms several studies reported that the availability of biochar p could be enhanced by certain microorganisms efthymiou et al 2018a 2018b he et al 2014 qian et al 2019b rafique et al 2017 the enhanced p release could be induced by the low ph he et al 2014 and the complexation role of organic acids secreted by these microorganisms efthymiou et al 2018a qian et al 2019b in addition biochar itself may also have certain impact on the microbial activities of soil bacteria that in turn affects the biotransformation of p it is known that besides p many other substances in biochar e g heavy metal khan et al 2013 zielinska and oleszczuk 2015 and harmful organic matters smith et al 2012 wang et al 2016 would be also introduced into the soil with the application of biochar khan et al 2013 reported that the presence of cu zn and cd increased when soil was treated with sewage sludge biochar high concentration of heavy metals could decrease the biodiversity and biomass of soil microorganisms wang et al 2007 the readily available heavy metals in biochar may have negative impact on soil microorganisms besides smith et al 2012 found that some organic matters in the water extract of pinewood biochar significantly inhibited the growth of aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms wang et al 2016 reported that certain small aromatic molecules released from acorus calamus biochar may be the substances that inhibited the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa besides the inherent pollutants of biochar it is reported that the free radicals fr on some biochar can also cause the cytotoxicity liao et al 2014 lieke et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 liao et al 2014 found that biochars with abundant frs could significantly inhibit plant germination and growth and they hypothesized that biochar induced reactive oxygen species ros could be the culprit during the process lieke et al 2018 found that rice straw biochar produced at 500 c had neurotoxic effect on a model organism caenorhabditis elegans which was probably caused by that the frs in the biochar could react with biotic macromolecules and induce the oxidative stress responses zhang et al 2019 stated that the frs content in biochar is positively correlated with the toxicity of biochar on aquatic algae and the generation of intracellular ros in aquatic algae induced by biochar frs was the reason of toxicity therefore besides considering the beneficial aspects of biochar it is also important to understand if the addition of biochar would affect the microbial activities and their transformation of p to date there is no report on the potential negative effect from sludge biochar on soil microorganisms to understand the interaction between the ebpr sludge biochar and soil microorganisms two ebpr sludge biochars with different pyrolysis temperature i e 400 and 700 c were prepared the transformation of p released from the two biochars with the presence of pseudomonas putida p putida a common microorganism presented in soil kim and park 2014 was studied the potential inhibition factors from biochar i e heavy metal organic matters and frs on microbial p transformation were investigated and discussed this study will provide crucial fundamental data for the large scale application of ebpr sludge biochar firstly the forms of the released p and the absorption pattern of the p in ebpr sludge biochar are elucidated secondly the adverse effect of ebpr sludge biochar on p putida and the toxic component of the ebpr sludge biochar are revealed finally the feasibility of ebpr sludge biochar produced at different temperature as a p fertilizer are comprehensively evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar preparation two biochars with the pyrolysis temperature of 400 and 700 c were prepared with a high temperature furnace according to qian et al 2019a after cooling down the two biochars denoted as e400 and e700 were stored in a sealed plastic bag at 4 c for further use the feedstock of the biochar i e ebpr sludge was collected from two ebpr reactors shen et al 2017 after the sludge water mixture was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was discarded and the concentrated sludge was collected and dried at 70 c overnight the dried sludge moisture content of 2 5 was smashed and passed through a 250 μm sieve sealed in a plastic bag and stored at 4 c freezer the biochar was also passed through a 250 μm mesh after being grounded 2 2 elemental content of biochar two biochar samples were digested according to epa 3050a method and three replicates were applied for each biochar the digestion solution of the samples was passed through a 0 45 μm heavy metal free mce mixed cellulose ester filter argos technologies usa and diluted with di water the concentration of p was determined by the molybdate ascorbic acid method the concentration of mg k ca na fe and al was determined by icp oes perkinelmer optima 8000 usa and the concentration of the heavy metal was analyzed by icap q icp ms thermo scientific the content of

media mm and liquid state 31p nmr characterization of the released p a mineral media mm without any p source was prepared the composition is 5 g l 1 succinic acid disodium salt anhydrous 1 g l 1 nh4cl

unless otherwise mentioned twenty one flasks containing 40 ml mm each were prepared for each type of biochar in each flask 20 0 5 mg biochar e400 or e700 was added then these 42 reactors were incubated at 23 2 c and 150 rpm reactors were sampled at 4 h 8 h 12 h 24 h 48 h 96 h and 720 h at each sampling point three flasks three replicates were taken out for sampling 20 ml of the mixture in each flask was taken out and filtered through 0 45 μm nylon filter the concentration of the dissolved orthophosphates dop was determined by the vanadomolybdophosphoric acid colorimetric method the concentration of dissolved total p dtp was determined by the molybdate ascorbic acid method after digestion with hno3 and h2so4 qian et al 2019b the amount of released p q i mg g 1 at each time interval can be obtained by eq 1 1 q i c i v i m where q i mg g 1 is the amount of released dop or dtp c i mg l 1 is the concentration of dop or dtp m g is the dosage of the biochar v i l is the volume of the sample i e 40 ml the amount of dissolved condensed p d con p was obtained by subtracting the amount of dop from that of dtp according to the p release kinetics p release almost reached equilibrium at 48 h thus the filtrate at 48 h was used for liquid state 31p nmr analysis the detailed analytical method can be found in s2 in si 2 4 incubation of p putida with mineral media containing biochar mm biochar in this experiment three mineral media i e luria bertani lb broth mm and mm biochar were used for different purposes lb broth was prepared by adding 12 5 g lb broth powder miller novagen into 1 l di water without ph adjustment mm biochar mm e400 or mm e700 is the mm medium with the addition of 0 5 g l 1 biochar e400 or e700 the biochar powder was pre autoclaved 120 c 20 min before being added into the sterilized mm medium the incubation experiment was conducted as follows p putida was first inoculated in lb broth at 30 c and 150 rpm overnight then the bacteria suspension was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was discarded and 10 ml of mm was added in the centrifuge tube to prepare the inoculum four hundred μl of the inoculum was added into a 100 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 40 ml of mm e400 or mm e700 the sample in the erlenmeyer flask was incubated on a shaker at 23 2 c and 150 rpm for 10 days three replicates were prepared for each mm biochar group on the 1st 2nd and 10th day of incubation the erlenmeyer flasks were taken out from the shaker and settled down for 5 min and 5 ml of the suspension was withdrawn from the flask for the analysis of total p dtp dop od600 and cfu as p putida is a type of phosphorus accumulating bacteria kulakova et al 2011 and the intracellular polyphosphate poly p is a crucial phosphorus sink in the environment the stored intracellular poly p in the sample was also characterized the total p of the sample was determined after h2so4 hno3 digestion dtp and dop were analyzed according to the methods described above the amount of released p q j at each sampling time was calculated by eq 2 and eq 3 2 q j c j v j m j 1 3 q j c j v j m k 2 j c j 1 v s a m p l i n g m j 2 or 3 where q j mg g 1 is the amount of released p tp dtp or dop at the j th sampling time c j mg l 1 is the p concentration at the j th sampling time m g is the dosage of the biochar v j l is the volume of the sample at the j th sampling time v sampling l is the sampling volume i e 5 ml the amount of p absorbed and adsorbed by p putida denoted as micro p was obtained by subtracting the dtp from tp in the same sample the d con p in the solution was obtained by subtracting the dop from dtp the intracellular poly p was characterized by 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi sigma aldrich staining the fluorescence of poly p dapi complex and dna dapi complex are bright yellow and blue respectively under a dapi filter 358 nm excitation 461 nm emission samples were visualized at 1000 using a fluorescent microscope nikon eclipse ti e an external color camera was used for capturing the image the topview software was used for image processing more detailed description of these analysis can be found in qian et al 2019b 2 5 incubation of p putida with mm e700 cu2 the sludge derived biochar inevitably contains some heavy metals including cu zn pb ni cd and as table s1 according to the heavy metal threshold values for contaminated soil mef 2007 toth et al 2016 it is found that the content of cu in both e400 4 22 mg g 1 and e700 4 72 mg g 1 exceeded the higher guide value 0 2 mg g 1 table s1 the presence of cu2 was reported to have negative effect on intracellular poly p formation tsai et al 2013 thus the effect of cu2 on the formation of poly p in p putida cells was studied in this experiment cu2 was added into mm e700 denoted as mm e700 cu at the beginning of the incubation to obtain the final cu2 concentration of 3 3 μm which equals to the concentration of cu2 released in mm e400 then this experiment group was subjected to the same incubation procedure conducted on group mm e700 in section 2 3 and three replicates were applied for each group 2 6 identification of organic matters released from biochar and p putida during the incubation four samples were prepared in this experiment i e 1 mm e400 with the absence of p putida 2 the suspension of p putida incubated with mm containing 0 05 g l 1 kh2po4 p the suspension of p putida incubated with 3 mm e400 or 4 mm e700 to prepare the samples for organic matter identification the incubation solution was proportionally scaled up from 40 ml section 2 3 to 300 ml and the incubation procedure was unchanged after two days incubation 150 ml of the suspension was withdrawn and passed through a 0 45 μm nylon filter then 100 ml filtrate was passed through two connected cartridges oasishlb i e solid phase extraction followed by a liquid liquid extraction with the mixture of n hexane chloroform and dichloromethane 1 1 1 the organic matters on the cartridges were eluted by four types of solvents methanol acetone dichloromethane and n hexane and the organic matters in different solvents were analyzed separately using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms gcms qp2010ultra shimadzu the extract in liquid liquid extraction was re dissolved in 1 ml dichloromethane before gc ms analysis for gc ms analysis 2 or 3 μl sample was injected into an rtx 5ms 30 m 0 25 mm id restek column using splitless mode at 280 c with helium as a carrier gas at 1 ml min the gc oven temperature program was as follows initial 50 c for 7 min increased at 7 c min 1 to 325 c and then held for 7 min the ms was at electron ionization mode ion source temperature was 230 c and scan mode m z range was 30 580 the mass spectra of the peaks were compared with those in the nist11 library and a compound was identified if the similarity index is above 80 a series of standard solution containing alkanes with different chain lengths c10 c40 table s2 in si were used for semi quantitative analysis of the organic matters 2 7 incubation of p putida with mm biochar solution mm e400s mm e700s the medium used in this experiment was mm biochar solution mm e400s mm e700s for mm e400s mm e700s biochar particles were removed from the media before p putida incubation to prepare mm e400s mm e700s sterilized biochar was firstly added into mm with a solid to liquid ratio of 1 2000 then the mixture was shaken at 23 2 c and 150 rpm for 48 h and filtered by a 500 ml pes filter sterilized 0 2 μm vwr usa installed on a vacuum filtration finally the solution i e mm e400s mm e700s was collected and used for p putida incubation the incubation procedure was the same as the one conducted in mm biochar experiment section 2 3 and three replicates were applied for each group 2 8 epr test of biochar first derivative epr spectra of biochars e400 and e700 were obtained at 22 2 c on a bruker biospin elexsys ii e500 epr spectrometer the modulation amplitude was varied from 0 05 to 1 0 g the sweep time was 30 72 s the time constant was 10 24 ms and the microwave power was varied from 0 02 to 2 mw corresponding to attenuation of 20 40 db which was sufficiently high to avoid sample power saturation the amounts of radicals present in e400 and e700 were quantified by comparing the epr signal intensity of the biochar samples with that of standard samples of the stable free radical 2 2 diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl dpph that had been diluted in a solid matrix of non paramagnetic al2o3 calibration standards were prepared by accurately weighing dpph approximately 4 mg and adding it into an accurately weighed amount of al2o3 approximately 3 g the dpph and al2o3 were ground together with a mortar and pestle until they were completely homogeneous then 100 mg of this mixture was taken and added to another 3 g of al2o3 and further ground together until it was fully homogenized again 100 mg of this diluted homogenized mixture was added to another 3 g of al2o3 so that 3 homogeneous solids containing different concentrations of dpph were accurately prepared aliquots of these dpph al2o3 solid samples were packed into 3 mm id cylindrical quartz tubes to a depth of 2 5 cm which served as the calibration standards and were measured under different instrumental parameters in order to construct a range of calibration curves of double integrated epr signal intensities versus the concentration of dpph in the al2o3 matrix in g g 1 the density difference between the dpph al2o3 standards and e400 and e700 samples were taken into account by weighing the dpph al2o3 e400 and e700 that were packed into 2 5 cm of the cylindrical epr tubes the weight for dpph al2o3 was 0 165 g the amounts of radicals present in e400 and e700 could be approximately calculated by comparing the double integrated epr signal intensity from the appropriate calibration plot and applying eq 4 4 c o n c e n t r a t i o n p p m 0

intracellular ros in p putida cells was measured using 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate h2dcfda sigma aldrich and the detailed method is shown in s3 in si 2 10 statistical analysis the independent samples t test was applied to compare differences among the experimental data the statistical analyses were conducted with spss 17 0 for windows significance was assigned at the p 0 05 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 release kinetics of biochar p in mm and released p species fig 1 a depicts the release kinetics of biochar p in mm within 720 h it is observed that the release of the p species from e400 and e700 almost reached equilibrium within 48 h with 720 h incubation dtp released from e400 and e700 were up to 100 8 and 98 3 mg g 1 respectively it is noted that the p release patterns of e400 p and e700 p are different e400 could release large amount of dtp 94 4 mg g 1 within first 4 h although there was a decline in dtp from e400 it was always higher than 89 6 mg g 1 during the reaction the reduction was mainly due to the reduction on dop release which was probably caused by the precipitation of the dop with ca2 in mm e700 only released 51 4 mg g 1 dtp within 4 h and gradually released dtp in the next 44 h at 48 h the released dtp reached 87 4 mg g 1 then the release rate of dtp from e700 slowed down fig 1b and c illustrate the 31p nmr spectra of the p species released from e400 and e700 in the spectrum of e400 fig 1b the peaks arising from 6 06 and 4 35 ppm are attributed to orthophosphates ortho p and pyrophosphates pyro p the product of the condensation of two orthophosphates omelon and grynpas 2008 respectively turner and leytem 2004 in addition to ortho p 6 06 ppm and pyro p 4 36 ppm more peaks appear in the spectrum of e700 fig 1c they are 4 00 4 09 and 20 44 ppm the former two peaks are attributed to the terminal p of the polyphosphates poly p huang et al 2017 whereas the latter one is assigned to the middle chain p of the poly p these results indicate that the soluble p species in mm e400 were the mixture of ortho p and pyro p while those in mm e700 were the mixture of ortho p pyro p and poly p from the amount of released dop and dtp at each time interval fig 1a it can be concluded that the proportion of the d con p pyro p and poly p released from e700 54 8 65 5 was much higher than that released from e400 12 1 30 7 the high proportion of the released con p from ebpr sludge biochar is due to the high con p content of ebpr sludge biochar qian et al 2019a the distribution of the p species is varied in different studies li et al 2018 found that the predominant p species in the activated sludge biochar was ortho p similar to the results of our study huang and tang 2015 found the coexists of ortho p pyro p and poly p in the activated sludge biochar in their study as the feedstock plays crucial role on the property of the biochar lehmann and joseph 2009 the inconsistent distributions of the p species in biochars in different studies largely result from the differences on the p species distributions in the original sludge 3 2 transformation of p released from e400 and e700 with the presence of p putida as most soluble p in e400 and e700 could be released within days fig 2 a a 10 day incubation of p putida with mm e400 or mm e700 was conducted as shown in fig 2a the presence of micro p in mm e400 and mm e700 indicates that the p released from both e400 and e700 could be absorbed by p putida with the incubation time increased from 1 day to 2 days the amount of micro p in mm e400 group increased from 28 4 mg g 1 to 60 0 mg g 1 and that in mm e700 group increased from 50 1 mg g 1 to 75 9 mg g 1 such increase was caused by the proliferation of p putida which can be confirmed by the abrupt increase of living p putida concentration in the two groups from approx 2 0 109 to 1 3 1010 cfu ml 1 within the first two days fig 2b after 10 days incubation there was no significant further increase of micro p in mm e400 group compared with the micro p in mm e400 group on day 2 independent samples t test p 0 082 and mm e700 group compared with the micro p in mm e700 group on day 2 independent samples t test p 0 086 this phenomenon is probably due to the lack of nutrients in the media as substantial decline of the living p putida concentration in both groups were observed on day 10 fig 2b from fig 1a it can be obtained that the dop and d con p released from e400 on day 2 48 h were 63 6 and 26 6 mg g 1 respectively and those released from e700 were 30 1 and 57 2 mg g 1 respectively all the four values were substantially reduced with the presence of p putida fig 2a this suggests that both ortho p and condensed p could be utilized by p putida which is in agreement with qian et al 2019b in the first two days of incubation the amount of micro p in mm e700 group was higher than that in mm e400 group which suggests that the p species released from e700 was more easily to be absorbed by p putida generally efficient adsorption of the nutrients from the bulk solution to bacteria surface could facilitate the absorption of the nutrients by the bacteria by determining the zeta potential of p putida under the ph range from 4 0 to 8 0 s2 in si it is found that p putida was negatively charged at ph around 7 0 the ph of the medium fig s1 thus the adsorption of p by p putida was through the divalent bridge provided by ca2 and mg2 in the media kobayashi et al 2018 liu et al 2002 as the condensed p was reported to have a stronger affinity to divalent cations than the ortho p van wazer and callis 1958 and mm e700 contained higher proportion of condensed p 54 8 65 5 than mm e400 12 1 30 7 it is reasonable that more p in mm e700 could be adsorbed and then absorbed by p putida 3 3 formation of intracellular poly p fig 3 shows the staining results of p putida cells in mm e400 and mm e700 groups surprisingly no bright yellow particles were found in p putida cells during the whole incubation period in mm e400 group fig 3a c indicating that little poly p was formed in p putida cells while for mm e700 group bright yellow particles in p putida cells can be found within 1 day fig 3d and increased substantially on the 2nd day of incubation fig 3e indicating that large amount of poly p was formed in p putida cells on the 10th day of incubation fig 3f the amount of bright yellow particles decreased in mm e700 group which could be due to the degradation of poly p for energy or nutrients supply when the medium was not suitable to support the growth of p putida kulaev et al 2005 the intracellular poly p plays pivotal roles on the growth and survival of the living microorganisms kulaev et al 1999 seufferheld et al 2008 it is the energy pool and p source for the microbial growth and it also protects microorganisms from environmental stress kulaev et al 1999 however it is revealed that mm e400 may have some adverse impact on p putida cells and inhibited the formation of poly p therefore it is imperative to understand the inhibition mechanisms caused by mm e400 the potential inhibitory factors can be the released heavy metals organic matters and frs from biochar which will be discussed in the following sections 3 4 effect of heavy metals on the formation of poly p in p putida cells in mm e700 cu group the micro p on the 1st 2nd and 10th day of incubation were 43 5 70 2 and 71 6 mg g 1 respectively fig 4 a which had no significant differences with the micro p in mm e700 group on the 1st independent samples t test p 0 181 2nd independent samples t test p 0 094 and 10th independent samples t test p 0 060 day of incubation respectively the concentrations of living cells in mm e700 cu group on the 1st and 2nd day of incubation were 2 0 109 and 1 1 1010 cfu ml 1 respectively fig s2 which also had no significant differences with those in mm e700 group on the 1st independent samples t test p 0 112 and 2nd independent samples t test p 0 106 day of incubation respectively although the density was not as high as that in group mm e700 bright yellow particles can also be observed in group mm e700 cu on the 2nd day of incubation these results indicate that cu2 released from biochar had very limited effect on the formation of poly p in the cells 3 5 organic matters released from e400 and e700 some organic matters released from biochar could inhibit the growth of microorganisms smith et al 2012 wang et al 2016 thus the organic matters presented in the suspension of p putida incubated by mm e400 and mm e700 were extracted and analyzed by gc ms in order to have a better comparison the organic matters presented in mm e400 and in the suspension of p putida incubated by mm containing 0 05 g l 1 kh2po4 p were also analyzed the results from solid phase extraction and liquid liquid extraction show that almost all the organic matters in the sample could be collected by solid phase extraction accompanied with methanol elution thus only the results obtained from this extraction method are shown in this paper fig s3 fig s4 and tables s3 s10 no detectable organic matter was presented in the sample of mm e400 except for the organic matters in original mm and some impurities tables s3 and s4 on the contrast many organic matters can be found in the samples with the presence of p putida tables s5 s10 such as alkanes acids n containing compounds etc some of the organic matters were released from p putida while others could be released from the biochar table 1 shows the organic matters presented in the suspension of p putida incubated with mm e400 and mm e700 but not presented in the suspension of p putida incubated with mm containing 0 05 g l 1 kh2po4 p these organic matters could be released from e400 and e700 with the presence of p putida generally the organic compounds could be divided into different categories including alkane alcohol ketone aldehyde acid ester n containing compound and phenol among them alkanes could be released from both biochar fonts et al 2012 and p putida kunacheva et al 2017 and they are easily degradable compounds balba et al 1998 the alcohols except for r 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxolane 4 methanol ketones aldehydes acids and esters are reported to be the biodegradation products of alkanes wentzel et al 2007 therefore the compounds such as alkanes alcohols ketones aldehydes acids and esters would not have toxic effect on p putida in this study the alcohol r 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxolane 4 methanol was presented in both mm e400 and mm e700 group although the toxicity of this compound is unknown it probably had no influence on intracellular poly p formation as the concentration of this compound in mm e400 was comparable with that in mm e700 0 0086 mg l 1 vs 0 010 mg l 1 the n containing compound pyrrolo 1 2 a pyrazine 1 4 dione hexahydro 3 phenylmethyl detected in group mm e400 is reported to be antibiotic however it exhibited little cytotoxicity with the concentration up to 12 5 mg l 1 kannabiran 2016 its concentration in mm e400 group was only 0 0046 mg l 1 which probably had no effect on intracellular poly p formation the compounds 2h pyran 2 one tetrahydro 4 hydroxy 6 pentyl indole 3 methyl acetate and 2 4 bis 1 1 dimethylethyl phenol detected in mm e700 may present some cytotoxic properties abdel hady et al 2016 oberhänsli et al 1991 padmavathi et al 2014 however the formation of intracellular poly p was not impaired by e700 which is probably due to its low concentration therefore the gc ms results strongly suggest that the organic matter released from e400 and e700 had little influence on the formation of intracellular poly p 3 6 effect of biochar solution on the formation of intracellular poly p from the results in fig 4 and table 1 it can be concluded that heavy metals and organic matters released from e400 and e700 had little influence on the formation of poly p in p putida cells due to their low concentration therefore it could be some other compounds released from the e400 biochar repressed the formation of poly p in p putida cells before verifying this assumption we need to confirm that the soluble substances from e400 indeed had a negative effect on poly p formation therefore mm biochar solution was applied to incubate p putida the trends on the changes of micro p and concentration of living p putida with incubation time in mm e400s and mm e700s were similar to those in mm e400 and mm e700 fig s5 meanwhile the much higher amount of micro p in group mm e700s than that in group mm e400s confirms that the soluble condensed p was more easily used by p putida than the soluble ortho p fig s5a fig 5 illustrates the staining results of p putida cells in mm e400s and mm e700s unexpectedly plenty of bright yellow particles were present in mm e400s group since the beginning of incubation fig 5a which is completely different from the results shown in fig 3a and b no bright yellow particle was found as such the soluble compounds released from e400 did not inhibit the formation of poly p at all on the other hand the bright yellow particles in group mm e700s on day 1 fig 5d are more abundant compared to those in mm e700 fig 3d this could be caused by the high p concentration at the beginning of the incubation in mm e700s group fig s3a sforza et al 2018 3 7 frs in different biochar the presence of intracellular poly p in mm e400s group and the absence of poly p in mm e400 strongly suggests that e400 solid particles repressed the formation of intracellular poly p in p putida as the frs presented in some biochar could lead to cytotoxicity liao et al 2014 lieke et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the frs in e400 and e700 were characterized by epr analysis and the results are shown in fig 6 a strong epr signal was found for e400 fig 6 in contrast to a weak epr signal observed for e700 this result is in consistent with many previous studies liu et al 2018 found that the epr signal intensity of the biochar produced by corn cob reached its highest level when the pyrolysis temperature was 400 c and substantially decreased when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c zhang et al 2019 examined the epr signals of pine needle derived biochars and they found that the amount of frs in biochar reached its maximum when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 500 c but decreased when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 600 c from fig 6 it is also observed that the g factor of e400 was 2 0049 indicative of a combination of oxygen centered and carbon centered radicals presented in e400 trubetskaya et al 2016 after being calibrated with dpph the amount of frs presented in e400 is estimated to be 3 5 mg g 1 whereas that in e700 is only 0 1 of that in e400 the results strongly support the dapi staining results indicating that the frs in e400 indeed impaired the formation of intracellular poly p of p putida it is widely recognized that the frs in the biochars could induce cellular oxidative stress balakrishna et al 2009 lieke et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 and the cellular oxidative stress could result in the damage of proteins lipids and dna seufferheld et al 2008 storz and imlayt 1999 as the formation of intracellular poly p is directly related to the key enzymes e g polyphosphate kinase ppk a type of protein brown and kornberg 2008 we assume that the suppressed formation of intracellular poly p in e400 mm group was caused by the inactivation of the enzymes involved in the poly p synthesis under oxidative stress many previous studies also show that the lowered activity of ppk caused by the oxidative stress could be a crucial reason for the inhibited activity of phosphorus removal bacteria sun et al 2017 zheng et al 2011 2018 the intracellular ros levels of p putida induced by e400 and e700 were measured as the inhibition of intracellular poly p formation by e400 was found at both the 1st and 2nd day incubation fig 3 the intracellular ros levels of the p putida at the 30 min 1st and 2nd day of incubation were examined as shown in fig s6 the cells in both mm e400 and mm e700 had lower fluorescence intensities than those in control group incubated in mm containing 0 05 g l 1 kh2po4 p during the two days of incubation indicating that the fr induced intracellular ros could be eliminated in time after its formation this phenomenon could be caused by that p putida had high surviving capability it can develop the defensive cellular systems to overcome the deleterious effects of oxidative stress kim and park 2014 this may also explain that e400 had little effect on the growth of p putida fig 2b the intracellular poly p could play important roles not only on p storage and turnover but also on bacteria survival from environmental stress gray and jakob 2015 kulaev et al 1999 it is reported that p putida cells with low intracellular poly p level were more sensitive to harsh environmental conditions such as ultraviolet irradiation the addition of antibiotics and heavy metals nikel et al 2013 this study revealed that the low temperature sludge biochar may have some adverse impacts on soil bacteria and soil environment on one hand it would reduce the p storage capacity of some soil bacteria which may decrease the p storage capacity of soil on the other hand it would impair the adaptability of some soil microorganisms toward harsh environment therefore the high temperature sludge biochar is more suitable to be used as a p fertilizer with a lower environmental risk 4 conclusions the interaction between ebpr sludge biochar and p putida and the transformation of p by the soil bacteria were studied the results show that the p species released from e700 was more likely to be absorbed by p putida e400 could suppress the formation of intracellular poly p of p putida while e700 had little influence on that such inhibition phenomenon only occurred with the e400 biochar particles were present and the soluble compounds from e400 was not inhibitory much higher frs were detected from e400 than e700 and the inhibition effect from e400 on intracellular poly p formation was probably caused by the oxidative stress induced by the frs the higher affinity of the p species to p putida and the low frs content make e700 the biochar produced at high temperature a more suitable material for soil application this study provides crucial information on biochar p utilization and ebpr sludge p reutilization which is beneficial to develop new technologies to relieve the global p resource crisis

18343,biochar derived from enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr sludge could be a potential phosphorus p fertilizer soil microorganisms play a regulating role on the turnover of p in soil when the ebpr sludge biochar is added to soil it would inevitably interact with soil microorganisms thus for the wise use of the ebpr sludge biochar it is imperative to understand the interaction between the biochar and soil microorganisms in this study pseudomonas putida p putida a common soil microorganism was applied to investigate the biotransformation of p in two ebpr sludge biochars the results reveal that p released from biochar produced at 700 c e700 was more easily absorbed by p putida than that released from biochar produced at 400 c e400 this is attributed to the higher polyphosphates poly p content in e700 and poly p has higher affinity to p putida surface compared to orthophosphates furthermore e400 has a negative effect on intracellular poly p formation in p putida which is probably caused by the oxidative stress induced by the free radicals from e400 as intracellular poly p plays a critical role on bacteria survival and their interaction with surrounding environment high temperature biochar e700 in this case would be more suitable for soil remediation graphical abstract image 1 keywords ebpr sludge phosphorus recovery biochar biotransformation of phosphorus free radicals 1 introduction sewage sludge produced from wastewater treatment plants contains precious phosphorus p as the global p stock will be depleted in the following centuries desmidt et al 2014 recovering p from wastewater sewage sludge is of great environmental significance converting sewage sludge into biochar and applying sludge biochar as a p fertilizer to soil is a convenient and feasible approach li et al 2018 mackay et al 2017 qian and jiang 2014 among the various types of sludge the sludge derived from enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process is a competitive raw material to produce biochar huang and tang 2015 qian et al 2019a as ebpr sludge contains much higher p 5 17 than other sludge 1 2 bond and rees 1999 in our previous work we identified p species in ebpr sludge and developed a readily and green method to enhance the availability of p in ebpr sludge biochar qian et al 2019a we concluded that ebpr sludge biochar could be a robust p fertilizer in the soil when biochar is applied to the soil it would inevitably interact with soil microorganisms soil microorganisms are considered as a critical p pool in the soil and play a regulating role on the level of available p in the soil yevdokimov et al 2016 therefore it is imperative to understand the interaction between biochar and soil microorganisms several studies reported that the availability of biochar p could be enhanced by certain microorganisms efthymiou et al 2018a 2018b he et al 2014 qian et al 2019b rafique et al 2017 the enhanced p release could be induced by the low ph he et al 2014 and the complexation role of organic acids secreted by these microorganisms efthymiou et al 2018a qian et al 2019b in addition biochar itself may also have certain impact on the microbial activities of soil bacteria that in turn affects the biotransformation of p it is known that besides p many other substances in biochar e g heavy metal khan et al 2013 zielinska and oleszczuk 2015 and harmful organic matters smith et al 2012 wang et al 2016 would be also introduced into the soil with the application of biochar khan et al 2013 reported that the presence of cu zn and cd increased when soil was treated with sewage sludge biochar high concentration of heavy metals could decrease the biodiversity and biomass of soil microorganisms wang et al 2007 the readily available heavy metals in biochar may have negative impact on soil microorganisms besides smith et al 2012 found that some organic matters in the water extract of pinewood biochar significantly inhibited the growth of aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms wang et al 2016 reported that certain small aromatic molecules released from acorus calamus biochar may be the substances that inhibited the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa besides the inherent pollutants of biochar it is reported that the free radicals fr on some biochar can also cause the cytotoxicity liao et al 2014 lieke et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 liao et al 2014 found that biochars with abundant frs could significantly inhibit plant germination and growth and they hypothesized that biochar induced reactive oxygen species ros could be the culprit during the process lieke et al 2018 found that rice straw biochar produced at 500 c had neurotoxic effect on a model organism caenorhabditis elegans which was probably caused by that the frs in the biochar could react with biotic macromolecules and induce the oxidative stress responses zhang et al 2019 stated that the frs content in biochar is positively correlated with the toxicity of biochar on aquatic algae and the generation of intracellular ros in aquatic algae induced by biochar frs was the reason of toxicity therefore besides considering the beneficial aspects of biochar it is also important to understand if the addition of biochar would affect the microbial activities and their transformation of p to date there is no report on the potential negative effect from sludge biochar on soil microorganisms to understand the interaction between the ebpr sludge biochar and soil microorganisms two ebpr sludge biochars with different pyrolysis temperature i e 400 and 700 c were prepared the transformation of p released from the two biochars with the presence of pseudomonas putida p putida a common microorganism presented in soil kim and park 2014 was studied the potential inhibition factors from biochar i e heavy metal organic matters and frs on microbial p transformation were investigated and discussed this study will provide crucial fundamental data for the large scale application of ebpr sludge biochar firstly the forms of the released p and the absorption pattern of the p in ebpr sludge biochar are elucidated secondly the adverse effect of ebpr sludge biochar on p putida and the toxic component of the ebpr sludge biochar are revealed finally the feasibility of ebpr sludge biochar produced at different temperature as a p fertilizer are comprehensively evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar preparation two biochars with the pyrolysis temperature of 400 and 700 c were prepared with a high temperature furnace according to qian et al 2019a after cooling down the two biochars denoted as e400 and e700 were stored in a sealed plastic bag at 4 c for further use the feedstock of the biochar i e ebpr sludge was collected from two ebpr reactors shen et al 2017 after the sludge water mixture was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was discarded and the concentrated sludge was collected and dried at 70 c overnight the dried sludge moisture content of 2 5 was smashed and passed through a 250 μm sieve sealed in a plastic bag and stored at 4 c freezer the biochar was also passed through a 250 μm mesh after being grounded 2 2 elemental content of biochar two biochar samples were digested according to epa 3050a method and three replicates were applied for each biochar the digestion solution of the samples was passed through a 0 45 μm heavy metal free mce mixed cellulose ester filter argos technologies usa and diluted with di water the concentration of p was determined by the molybdate ascorbic acid method

unless otherwise mentioned twenty one flasks containing 40 ml mm each were prepared for each type of biochar in each flask 20 0 5 mg biochar e400 or e700 was added then these 42 reactors were incubated at 23 2 c and 150 rpm reactors were sampled at 4 h 8 h 12 h 24 h 48 h 96 h and 720 h at each sampling point three flasks three replicates were taken out for sampling 20 ml of the mixture in each flask was taken out and filtered through 0 45 μm nylon filter the concentration of the dissolved orthophosphates dop was determined by the vanadomolybdophosphoric acid colorimetric method the concentration of dissolved total p dtp was determined by the molybdate ascorbic acid method after digestion with hno3 and h2so4 qian et al 2019b the amount of released p q i mg g 1 at each time interval can be obtained by eq 1 1 q i c i v i m where q i mg g 1 is the amount of released dop or dtp c i mg l 1 is the concentration of dop or dtp m g is the dosage of the biochar v i l is the volume of the sample i e 40 ml the amount of dissolved condensed p d con p was obtained by subtracting the amount of dop from that of dtp according to the p release kinetics p release almost reached equilibrium at 48 h thus the filtrate at 48 h was used for liquid state 31p nmr analysis the detailed analytical method can be found in s2 in si 2 4 incubation of p putida with mineral media containing biochar mm biochar in this experiment three mineral media i e luria bertani lb broth mm and mm biochar were used for different purposes lb broth was prepared by adding 12 5 g lb broth powder miller novagen into 1 l di water without ph adjustment mm biochar mm e400 or mm e700 is the mm medium with the addition of 0 5 g l 1 biochar e400 or e700 the biochar powder was pre autoclaved 120 c 20 min before being added into the sterilized mm medium the incubation experiment was conducted as follows p putida was first inoculated in lb broth at 30 c and 150 rpm overnight then the bacteria suspension was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was discarded and 10 ml of mm was added in the centrifuge tube to prepare the inoculum four hundred μl of the inoculum was added into a 100 ml erlenmeyer flask containing 40 ml of mm e400 or mm e700 the sample in the erlenmeyer flask was incubated on a shaker at 23 2 c and 150 rpm for 10 days three replicates were prepared for each mm biochar group on the 1st 2nd and 10th day of incubation the erlenmeyer flasks were taken out from the shaker and settled down for 5 min and 5 ml of the suspension was withdrawn from the flask for the analysis of total p dtp dop od600 and cfu as p putida is a type of phosphorus accumulating bacteria kulakova et al 2011 and the intracellular polyphosphate poly p is a crucial phosphorus sink in the environment the stored intracellular poly p in the sample was also characterized the total p of the sample was determined after h2so4 hno3 digestion dtp and dop were analyzed according to the methods described above the amount of released p q j at each sampling time was calculated by eq 2 and eq 3 2 q j c j v j m j 1 3 q j c j v j m k 2 j c j 1 v s a m p l i n g m j 2 or 3 where q j mg g 1 is the amount of released p tp dtp or dop at the j th sampling time c j mg l 1 is the p concentration at the j th sampling time m g is the dosage of the biochar v j l is the volume of the sample at the j th sampling time v sampling l is the sampling volume i e 5 ml the amount of p absorbed and adsorbed by p putida denoted as micro p was obtained by subtracting the dtp from tp in the same sample the d con p in the solution was obtained by subtracting the dop from dtp the intracellular poly p was characterized by 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi sigma aldrich staining the fluorescence of poly p dapi complex and dna dapi complex are bright yellow and blue respectively under a dapi filter 358 nm excitation 461 nm emission samples were visualized at 1000 using a fluorescent microscope nikon eclipse ti e an external color camera was used for capturing the image the topview software was used for image processing more detailed description of these analysis can be found in qian et al 2019b 2 5 incubation of p putida with mm e700 cu2 the sludge derived biochar inevitably contains some heavy metals including cu zn pb ni cd and as table s1 according to the heavy metal threshold values for contaminated soil mef 2007 toth et al 2016 it is found that the content of cu in both e400 4 22 mg g 1 and e700 4 72 mg g 1 exceeded the higher guide value 0 2 mg g 1 table s1 the presence of cu2 was reported to have negative effect on intracellular poly p formation tsai et al 2013 thus the effect of cu2 on the formation of poly p in p putida cells was studied in this experiment cu2 was added into mm e700 denoted as mm e700 cu at the beginning of the incubation to obtain the final cu2 concentration of 3 3 μm which equals to the concentration of cu2 released in mm e400 then this experiment group was subjected to the same incubation procedure conducted on group mm e700 in section 2 3 and three replicates were applied for each group 2 6 identification of organic matters released from biochar and p putida during the incubation four samples were prepared in this experiment i e 1 mm e400 with the absence of p putida 2 the suspension of p putida incubated with mm containing 0 05 g l 1 kh2po4 p the suspension of p putida incubated with 3 mm e400 or 4 mm e700 to prepare the samples for organic matter identification the incubation solution was proportionally scaled up from 40 ml section 2 3 to 300 ml and the incubation procedure was unchanged after two days incubation 150 ml of the suspension was withdrawn and passed through a 0 45 μm nylon filter then 100 ml filtrate was passed through two connected cartridges oasishlb i e solid phase extraction followed by a liquid liquid extraction with the mixture of n hexane chloroform and dichloromethane 1 1 1 the organic matters on the cartridges were eluted by four types of solvents methanol acetone dichloromethane and n hexane and the organic matters in different solvents were analyzed separately using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms gcms qp2010ultra shimadzu the extract in liquid liquid extraction was re dissolved in 1 ml dichloromethane before gc ms analysis for gc ms analysis 2 or 3 μl sample was injected into an rtx 5ms 30 m 0 25 mm id restek column using splitless mode at 280 c with helium as a carrier gas at 1 ml min the gc oven temperature program was as follows initial 50 c for 7 min increased at 7 c min 1 to 325 c and then held for 7 min the ms was at electron ionization mode ion source temperature was 230 c and scan mode m z range was 30 580 the mass spectra of the peaks were compared with those in the nist11 library and a compound was identified if the similarity index is above 80 a series of standard solution containing alkanes with different chain lengths c10 c40 table s2 in si were used for semi quantitative analysis of the organic matters 2 7 incubation of p putida with mm biochar solution mm e400s mm e700s the medium used in this experiment was mm biochar solution mm e400s mm e700s for mm e400s mm e700s biochar particles were removed from the media before p putida incubation to prepare mm e400s mm e700s sterilized biochar was firstly added into mm with a solid to liquid ratio of 1 2000 then the mixture was shaken at 23 2 c and 150 rpm for 48 h and filtered by a 500 ml pes filter sterilized 0 2 μm vwr usa installed on a vacuum filtration finally the solution i e mm e400s mm e700s was collected and used for p putida incubation the incubation procedure was the same as the one conducted in mm biochar experiment section 2 3 and three replicates were applied for each group 2 8 epr test of biochar first derivative epr spectra of biochars e400 and e700 were obtained at 22 2 c on a bruker biospin elexsys ii e500 epr spectrometer the modulation amplitude was varied from 0 05 to 1 0 g the sweep time was 30 72 s the time constant was 10 24 ms and the microwave power was varied from 0 02 to 2 mw corresponding to attenuation of 20 40 db which was sufficiently high to avoid sample power saturation the amounts of radicals present in e400 and e700 were quantified by comparing the epr signal intensity of the biochar samples with that of standard samples of the stable free radical 2 2 diphenyl 1 picrylhydrazyl dpph that had been diluted in a solid matrix of non paramagnetic al2o3 calibration standards were prepared by accurately weighing dpph approximately 4 mg and adding it into an accurately weighed amount of al2o3 approximately 3 g the dpph and al2o3 were ground together with a mortar and pestle until they were completely homogeneous then 100 mg of this mixture was taken and added to another 3 g of al2o3 and further ground together until it was fully homogenized again 100 mg of this diluted homogenized mixture was added to another 3 g of al2o3 so that 3 homogeneous solids containing different concentrations of dpph were accurately prepared aliquots of these dpph al2o3 solid samples were packed into 3 mm id cylindrical quartz tubes to a depth of 2 5 cm which served as the calibration standards and were measured under different instrumental parameters in order to construct a range of calibration curves of double integrated epr signal intensities versus the concentration of dpph in the al2o3 matrix in g g 1 the density difference between the dpph al2o3 standards and e400 and e700 samples were taken into account by weighing the dpph al2o3 e400 and e700 that were packed into 2 5 cm of the cylindrical epr tubes the weight for dpph al2o3 was 0 165 g the amounts of radicals present in e400 and e700 could be approximately calculated by comparing the double integrated epr signal intensity from the appropriate calibration plot and applying eq 4 4 c o n c e n t r a t i o n p p m 0

intracellular ros in p putida cells was measured using 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate h2dcfda sigma aldrich and the detailed method is shown in s3 in si 2 10 statistical analysis the independent samples t test was applied to compare differences among the experimental data the statistical analyses were conducted with spss 17 0 for windows significance was assigned at the p 0 05 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 release kinetics of biochar p in mm and released p species fig 1 a depicts the release kinetics of biochar p in mm within 720 h it is observed that the release of the p species from e400 and e700 almost reached equilibrium within 48 h with 720 h incubation dtp released from e400 and e700 were up to 100 8 and 98 3 mg g 1 respectively it is noted that the p release patterns of e400 p and e700 p are different e400 could release large amount of dtp 94 4 mg g 1 within first 4 h although there was a decline in dtp from e400 it was always higher than 89 6 mg g 1 during the reaction the reduction was mainly due to the reduction on dop release which was probably caused by the precipitation of the dop with ca2 in mm e700 only released 51 4 mg g 1 dtp within 4 h and gradually released dtp in the next 44 h at 48 h the released dtp reached 87 4 mg g 1 then the release rate of dtp from e700 slowed down fig 1b and c illustrate the 31p nmr spectra of the p species released from e400 and e700 in the spectrum of e400 fig 1b the peaks arising from 6 06 and 4 35 ppm are attributed to orthophosphates ortho p and pyrophosphates pyro p the product of the condensation of two orthophosphates omelon and grynpas 2008 respectively turner and leytem 2004 in addition to ortho p 6 06 ppm and pyro p 4 36 ppm more peaks appear in the spectrum of e700 fig 1c they are 4 00 4 09 and 20 44 ppm the former two peaks are attributed to the terminal p of the polyphosphates poly p huang et al 2017 whereas the latter one is assigned to the middle chain p of the poly p these results indicate that the soluble p species in mm e400 were the mixture of ortho p and pyro p while those in mm e700 were the mixture of ortho p pyro p and poly p from the amount of released dop and dtp at each time interval fig 1a it can be concluded that the proportion of the d con p pyro p and poly p released from e700 54 8 65 5 was much higher than that released from e400 12 1 30 7 the high proportion of the released con p from ebpr sludge biochar is due to the high con p content of ebpr sludge biochar qian et al 2019a the distribution of the p species is varied in different studies li et al 2018 found that the predominant p species in the activated sludge biochar was ortho p similar to the results of our study huang and tang 2015 found the coexists of ortho p pyro p and poly p in the activated sludge biochar in their study as the feedstock plays crucial role on the property of the biochar lehmann and joseph 2009 the inconsistent distributions of the p species in biochars in different studies largely result from the differences on the p species distributions in the original sludge 3 2 transformation of p released from e400 and e700 with the presence of p putida as most soluble p in e400 and e700 could be released within days fig 2 a a 10 day incubation of p putida with mm e400 or mm e700 was conducted as shown in fig 2a the presence of micro p in mm e400 and mm e700 indicates that the p released from both e400 and e700 could be absorbed by p putida with the incubation time increased from 1 day to 2 days the amount of micro p in mm e400 group increased from 28 4 mg g 1 to 60 0 mg g 1 and that in mm e700 group increased from 50 1 mg g 1 to 75 9 mg g 1 such increase was caused by the proliferation of p putida which can be confirmed by the abrupt increase of living p putida concentration in the two groups from approx 2 0 109 to 1 3 1010 cfu ml 1 within the first two days fig 2b after 10 days incubation there was no significant further increase of micro p in mm e400 group compared with the micro p in mm e400 group on day 2 independent samples t test p 0 082 and mm e700 group compared with the micro p in mm e700 group on day 2 independent samples t test p 0 086 this phenomenon is probably due to the lack of nutrients in the media as substantial decline of the living p putida concentration in both groups were observed on day 10 fig 2b from fig 1a it can be obtained that the dop and d con p released from e400 on day 2 48 h were 63 6 and 26 6 mg g 1 respectively and those released from e700 were 30 1 and 57 2 mg g 1 respectively all the four values were substantially reduced with the presence of p putida fig 2a this suggests that both ortho p and condensed p could be utilized by p putida which is in agreement with qian et al 2019b in the first two days of incubation the amount of micro p in mm e700 group was higher than that in mm e400 group which suggests that the p species released from e700 was more easily to be absorbed by p putida generally efficient adsorption of the nutrients from the bulk solution to bacteria surface could facilitate the absorption of the nutrients by the bacteria by determining the zeta potential of p putida under the ph range from 4 0 to 8 0 s2 in si it is found that p putida was negatively charged at ph around 7 0 the ph of the medium fig s1 thus the adsorption of p by p putida was through the divalent bridge provided by ca2 and mg2 in the media kobayashi et al 2018 liu et al 2002 as the condensed p was reported to have a stronger affinity to divalent cations than the ortho p van wazer and callis 1958 and mm e700 contained higher proportion of condensed p 54 8 65 5 than mm e400 12 1 30 7 it is reasonable that more p in mm e700 could be adsorbed and then absorbed by p putida 3 3 formation of intracellular poly p fig 3 shows the staining results of p putida cells in mm e400 and mm e700 groups surprisingly no bright yellow particles were found in p putida cells during the whole incubation period in mm e400 group fig 3a c indicating that little poly p was formed in p putida cells while for mm e700 group bright yellow particles in p putida cells can be found within 1 day fig 3d and increased substantially on the 2nd day of incubation fig 3e indicating that large amount of poly p was formed in p putida cells on the 10th day of incubation fig 3f the amount of bright yellow particles decreased in mm e700 group which could be due to the degradation of poly p for energy or nutrients supply when the medium was not suitable to support the growth of p putida kulaev et al 2005 the intracellular poly p plays pivotal roles on the growth and survival of the living microorganisms kulaev et al 1999 seufferheld et al 2008 it is the energy pool and p source for the microbial growth and it also protects microorganisms from environmental stress kulaev et al 1999 however it is revealed that mm e400 may have some adverse impact on p putida cells and inhibited the formation of poly p therefore it is imperative to understand the inhibition mechanisms caused by mm e400 the potential inhibitory factors can be the released heavy metals organic matters and frs from biochar which will be discussed in the following sections 3 4 effect of heavy metals on the formation of poly p in p putida cells in mm e700 cu group the micro p on the 1st 2nd and 10th day of incubation were 43 5 70 2 and 71 6 mg g 1 respectively fig 4 a which had no significant differences with the micro p in mm e700 group on the 1st independent samples t test p 0 181 2nd independent samples t test p 0 094 and 10th independent samples t test p 0 060 day of incubation respectively the concentrations of living cells in mm e700 cu group on the 1st and 2nd day of incubation were 2 0 109 and 1 1 1010 cfu ml 1 respectively fig s2 which also had no significant differences with those in mm e700 group on the 1st independent samples t test p 0 112 and 2nd independent samples t test p 0 106 day of incubation respectively although the density was not as high as that in group mm e700 bright yellow particles can also be observed in group mm e700 cu on the 2nd day of incubation these results indicate that cu2 released from biochar had very limited effect on the formation of poly p in the cells 3 5 organic matters released from e400 and e700 some organic matters released from biochar could inhibit the growth of microorganisms smith et al 2012 wang et al 2016 thus the organic matters presented in the suspension of p putida incubated by mm e400 and mm e700 were extracted and analyzed by gc ms in order to have a better comparison the organic matters presented in mm e400 and in the suspension of p putida incubated by mm containing 0 05 g l 1 kh2po4 p were also analyzed the results from solid phase extraction and liquid liquid extraction show that almost all the organic matters in the sample could be collected by solid phase extraction accompanied with methanol elution thus only the results obtained from this extraction method are shown in this paper fig s3 fig s4 and tables s3 s10 no detectable organic matter was presented in the sample of mm e400 except for the organic matters in original mm and some impurities tables s3 and s4 on the contrast many organic matters can be found in the samples with the presence of p putida tables s5 s10 such as alkanes acids n containing compounds etc some of the organic matters were released from p putida while others could be released from the biochar table 1 shows the organic matters presented in the suspension of p putida incubated with mm e400 and mm e700 but not presented in the suspension of p putida incubated with mm containing 0 05 g l 1 kh2po4 p these organic matters could be released from e400 and e700 with the presence of p putida generally the organic compounds could be divided into different categories including alkane alcohol ketone aldehyde acid ester n containing compound and phenol among them alkanes could be released from both biochar fonts et al 2012 and p putida kunacheva et al 2017 and they are easily degradable compounds balba et al 1998 the alcohols except for r 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxolane 4 methanol ketones aldehydes acids and esters are reported to be the biodegradation products of alkanes wentzel et al 2007 therefore the compounds such as alkanes alcohols ketones aldehydes acids and esters would not have toxic effect on p putida in this study the alcohol r 2 2 dimethyl 1 3 dioxolane 4 methanol was presented in both mm e400 and mm e700 group although the toxicity of this compound is unknown it probably had no influence on intracellular poly p formation as the concentration of this compound in mm e400 was comparable with that in mm e700 0 0086 mg l 1 vs 0 010 mg l 1 the n containing compound pyrrolo 1 2 a pyrazine 1 4 dione hexahydro 3 phenylmethyl detected in group mm e400 is reported to be antibiotic however it exhibited little cytotoxicity with the concentration up to 12 5 mg l 1 kannabiran 2016 its concentration in mm e400 group was only 0 0046 mg l 1 which probably had no effect on intracellular poly p formation the compounds 2h pyran 2 one tetrahydro 4 hydroxy 6 pentyl indole 3 methyl acetate and 2 4 bis 1 1 dimethylethyl phenol detected in mm e700 may present some cytotoxic properties abdel hady et al 2016 oberhänsli et al 1991 padmavathi et al 2014 however the formation of intracellular poly p was not impaired by e700 which is probably due to its low concentration therefore the gc ms results strongly suggest that the organic matter released from e400 and e700 had little influence on the formation of intracellular poly p 3 6 effect of biochar solution on the formation of intracellular poly p from the results in fig 4 and table 1 it can be concluded that heavy metals and organic matters released from e400 and e700 had little influence on the formation of poly p in p putida cells due to their low concentration therefore it could be some other compounds released from the e400 biochar repressed the formation of poly p in p putida cells before verifying this assumption we need to confirm that the soluble substances from e400 indeed had a negative effect on poly p formation therefore mm biochar solution was applied to incubate p putida the trends on the changes of micro p and concentration of living p putida with incubation time in mm e400s and mm e700s were similar to those in mm e400 and mm e700 fig s5 meanwhile the much higher amount of micro p in group mm e700s than that in group mm e400s confirms that the soluble condensed p was more easily used by p putida than the soluble ortho p fig s5a fig 5 illustrates the staining results of p putida cells in mm e400s and mm e700s unexpectedly plenty of bright yellow particles were present in mm e400s group since the beginning of incubation fig 5a which is completely different from the results shown in fig 3a and b no bright yellow particle was found as such the soluble compounds released from e400 did not inhibit the formation of poly p at all on the other hand the bright yellow particles in group mm e700s on day 1 fig 5d are more abundant compared to those in mm e700 fig 3d this could be caused by the high p concentration at the beginning of the incubation in mm e700s group fig s3a sforza et al 2018 3 7 frs in different biochar the presence of intracellular poly p in mm e400s group and the absence of poly p in mm e400 strongly suggests that e400 solid particles repressed the formation of intracellular poly p in p putida as the frs presented in some biochar could lead to cytotoxicity liao et al 2014 lieke et al 2018 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the frs in e400 and e700 were characterized by epr analysis and the results are shown in fig 6 a strong epr signal was found for e400 fig 6 in contrast to a weak epr signal observed for e700 this result is in consistent with many previous studies liu et al 2018 found that the epr signal intensity of the biochar produced by corn cob reached its highest level when the pyrolysis temperature was 400 c and substantially decreased when the pyrolysis temperature was 500 c zhang et al 2019 examined the epr signals of pine needle derived biochars and they found that the amount of frs in biochar reached its maximum when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 500 c but decreased when the pyrolysis temperature increased to 600 c from fig 6 it is also observed that the g factor of e400 was 2 0049 indicative of a combination of oxygen centered and carbon centered radicals presented in e400 trubetskaya et al 2016 after being calibrated with dpph the amount of frs presented in e400 is estimated to be 3 5 mg g 1 whereas that in e700 is only 0 1 of that in e400 the results strongly support the dapi staining results indicating that the frs in e400 indeed impaired the formation of intracellular poly p of p putida it is widely recognized that the frs in the biochars could induce cellular oxidative stress balakrishna et al 2009 lieke et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 and the cellular oxidative stress could result in the damage of proteins lipids and dna seufferheld et al 2008 storz and imlayt 1999 as the formation of intracellular poly p is directly related to the key enzymes e g polyphosphate kinase ppk a type of protein brown and kornberg 2008 we assume that the suppressed formation of intracellular poly p in e400 mm group was caused by the inactivation of the enzymes involved in the poly p synthesis under oxidative stress many previous studies also show that the lowered activity of ppk caused by the oxidative stress could be a crucial reason for the inhibited activity of phosphorus removal bacteria sun et al 2017 zheng et al 2011 2018 the intracellular ros levels of p putida induced by e400 and e700 were measured as the inhibition of intracellular poly p formation by e400 was found at both the 1st and 2nd day incubation fig 3 the intracellular ros levels of the p putida at the 30 min 1st and 2nd day of incubation were examined as shown in fig s6 the cells in both mm e400 and mm e700 had lower fluorescence intensities than those in control group incubated in mm containing 0 05 g l 1 kh2po4 p during the two days of incubation indicating that the fr induced intracellular ros could be eliminated in time after its formation this phenomenon could be caused by that p putida had high surviving capability it can develop the defensive cellular systems to overcome the deleterious effects of oxidative stress kim and park 2014 this may also explain that e400 had little effect on the growth of p putida fig 2b the intracellular poly p could play important roles not only on p storage and turnover but also on bacteria survival from environmental stress gray and jakob 2015 kulaev et al 1999 it is reported that p putida cells with low intracellular poly p level were more sensitive to harsh environmental conditions such as ultraviolet irradiation the addition of antibiotics and heavy metals nikel et al 2013 this study revealed that the low temperature sludge biochar may have some adverse impacts on soil bacteria and soil environment on one hand it would reduce the p storage capacity of some soil bacteria which may decrease the p storage capacity of soil on the other hand it would impair the adaptability of some soil microorganisms toward harsh environment therefore the high temperature sludge biochar is more suitable to be used as a p fertilizer with a lower environmental risk 4 conclusions the interaction between ebpr sludge biochar and p putida and the transformation of p by the soil bacteria were studied the results show that the p species released from e700 was more likely to be absorbed by p putida e400 could suppress the formation of intracellular poly p of p putida while e700 had little influence on that such inhibition phenomenon only occurred with the e400 biochar particles were present and the soluble compounds from e400 was not inhibitory much higher frs were detected from e400 than e700 and the inhibition effect from e400 on intracellular poly p formation was probably caused by the oxidative stress induced by the frs the higher affinity of the p species to p putida and the low frs content make e700 the biochar produced at high temperature a more suitable material for soil application this study provides crucial information on biochar p utilization and ebpr sludge p reutilization which is beneficial to develop new technologies to relieve the global p resource crisis

18344,environmental impact studies of rivers affected by wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents have been greatly restricted by the difficulties associated with carrying out bioassays in the field and also by the complex interactions between the pollutants contained in the discharges the cotton strip assay csa enables study of the organic matter decomposition potential an important ecosystem process in rivers by taking all of the factors affecting this process into account however the csa has never been used for assessment of wwtp effluents in the present study we selected six fluvial zones affected by discharges from small wwtps and placed cotton strips at increasing distances from the discharge points in each zone after 17 days we evaluated decay of the strips by measuring cotton tensile strength loss ctsl and cotton mass loss cml we then determined the relationships between these parameters and various physico chemical and biological properties in the water as well as the δ15n isotopic signal and metal contents of aquatic mosses transplanted in the same sampling sites and used as biomonitors although the wwtps were similar some of the discharges stimulated and others inhibited decomposition of the cotton strips this was probably due to differences in the proportions of various types of pollutants with trophic or toxic effects in the discharges the csa proved to be a simple practical and economic bioassay and suitable for evaluating the ecological integrity of fluvial ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords ecosystem services environmental monitoring plan ecological integrity biodegradation monitoring bioassay 1 introduction waste water treatment plant wwtp effluents comprise a complex mixture of organic matter nutrients metals pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products and other types of compounds the nutrients derived directly from these effluents or from mineralization of the organic matter favour the autotrophic components of fluvial ecosystems although excess concentrations may lead to eutrophication processes on the other hand toxic pollutants can have negative effects that inhibit the development of aquatic organisms physico chemical analysis of the discharges is of little value for predicting the effects on the functioning of fluvial ecosystems because of the potential additive synergistic and antagonistic interactions in the complex mixture of substances kienzler et al 2016 and in situ ecotoxicological assessment of this type of effects is scarce although structural indexes are often used to evaluate the health of fluvial ecosystems the use of indicators of ecosystem processes such as organic matter decomposition and primary production is less common clapcott et al 2010 tiegs et al 2013 however these functional indicators provide useful information about organic matter processing and energy transfer that is not given by structural indexes niyogi et al 2013 decay of dead organic matter is a fundamental process in any ecosystem as mineralized nutrients maintain primary production a reduction in the breakdown of organic matter will affect primary productivity as well as the ecosystem service of water purification schäfer et al 2012 the litter bag assay is the method most commonly used to evaluate litter decomposition but the results vary depending on the mesh size bag shape litter species litter mass etc lecerf and chauvet 2008 ágoston szabó 2016 although many of these parameters can be standardized it is almost impossible to standardize litter quality tiegs et al 2013 use of cotton strips as a standard substrate has therefore been proposed in order to enable comparison of decomposition rates in different types of studies and the method has been demonstrated to be useful for studying the organic matter decomposition potential in both soils and fluvial environments e g trettin et al 1996 boulton and quinn 2000 tiegs et al 2007 clapcott and barmuta 2010 the cotton strip assay is ecologically relevant as it is based on the decomposition of cellulose the most abundant polymer on earth loss of the tensile strength of the cotton strips is one of the parameters measured in the csa this process tends to occur much more rapidly than the loss of leaf litter mass from riparian trees and the exposure times are short and operationally practical another advantage of the csa is that the cotton strips lack nutrients and they are therefore useful for studying how nutrients affect litter decay newman et al 2001 moreover cotton strips are less likely to be fragmented and lost than the litter in the litter bag assay egglishaw 1972 the aim of the present study was to evaluate how the effluents from wwtps serving small urban populations less than 20 000 population equivalent affect the rate of organic matter decomposition estimated by the csa in the rivers receiving the discharges we hypothesized that the decomposition rates will be positively affected by the effluents and will generally decrease with the distance from the discharge point as the bioavailability of the nutrients decreases this is because the effluents are mainly generated by small populations rather than by large industries which would be more likely to discharge compounds with potentially toxic effects this is the first time that this test has been used for in situ assessment of the impact of wwtps studies of the environmental impacts of small wwtps are scarce despite the fact that small treatment plants in regions such as the study area discharge large amounts of effluents into rivers and are generally less efficient than the plants that serve large cities 2 methods 2 1 study areas six wwtps in galicia nw spain were selected for study the wwtps each serve less than 20 000 population equivalent are not close to other sources of contamination and discharge their effluents directly into fluvial ecosystems table 1 some of the rivers in the study area have small tributaries or streams however these streams arise in areas that are not affected by pollution sources and in all cases the flow rates are much lower than those of the main rivers six sampling points were established at each wwtp one point upstream of the discharge point another immediately beside the discharge point 0 m and points at 100 200 400 and 1000 m downstream of the discharge points fig 1 2 2 preparing and exposing the cotton strips cotton strips were prepared by cutting unprimed 100 natural cotton canvas 12 oz natural cotton duck 400 g m 2 manufacturer russell and chapple into rectangles of length 8 cm and width 27 threads following the procedure described by tiegs et al 2013 the strips were held in a forced air oven at 40 c until exposure laboratory control strips were processed in the same way as the experimental strips but were kept in the oven 40 c during the exposure period the strips were weighed before being attached with plastic cable ties to concrete bricks to minimise disturbance from the hydrological conditions and to maximise contact with the benthos in the exposure sites fig 2 the bricks were placed in areas with similar substrates granulometry current speed etc to minimise interference in the decomposition process pieces of mesh were placed in front of each hole in the brick facing the direction of current to protect the cotton strips and to prevent them being covered or moved by passing objects fig 2 at each exposure site the bricks were placed almost perpendicular to the current at a slight angle to prevent obstruction of the mesh protectors fig 2 triplicate cotton strips were exposed at each sampling point for 17 days in september 2016 as the flow rate of the rivers is usually minimal at this time of year in the study region table 1 and the impact of the wwtp effluents should therefore be maximal the strips were collected after the exposure period washed vigorously in situ and placed in 50 ml conical centrifuge tubes falcon containing 80 ethanol to prevent any further decomposition before processing 2 3 processing the strips in the laboratory the cotton strips were removed from the tubes and dried at 40 c for 48 h the dried strips were weighed to determine loss of biomass the tension of each replicate strip was measured immediately in a system consisting of two clamps an extensometer sf 500 yueqing china and a manual test stand the strips were manually stretched by fitting the ends to the clamps with the aim of stretching the strips 2 cm every minute the cotton tensile strength loss ctsl was calculated as the percentage loss for each

of the aquatic moss fontinalis squamosa were exposed for 10 days beside the cotton strips in each exposure site for determination the δ15n isotopic signal and evaluation of metal accumulation the moss samples were first devitalized in order to prevent the moss metabolism interfering in the accumulation of metals fernández et al 2009 by exposing them to different temperatures for several hours 8 h at 40 c 8 h at 80 c and 8 h at 100 c the moss transplants were exposed in bags 10 10 cm made from fibreglass mosquito netting mesh size 2 mm previously washed in a 2 5 solution of sodium hypochlorite aliquots of 0 6 g dry weight of moss were placed in each bag in the laboratory the moss samples were removed from the bags placed in paper bags and dried in an oven 48 h at 40 c the moss samples were then ground in a zirconium oxide tangential mill retsch mm400 haan germany and placed in glass vessels for storage at room temperature until chemical analysis subsamples of moss 3 mg 0 1 dry weight

in a mass spectrometer icp ms agilent 7700x santa clara ca usa 2 6 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was carried out using ibm spss statistics version 24 automatic linear modelling analysis yang 2013 was used to explore the main predictors of ctsl and cml taking all variables measured in the water samples and in the moss transplants into account as some variables were measured at all sampling sites and others were only measured at the discharge points and at the preceding sites the two corresponding data sets were analysed separately the forward stepwise variable selection method was used and inclusion exclusion was determined with the corrected akaike information criterion aicc in addition to the usual parameters the software estimates a parameter known as predictor importance calculated as the residual sum of squares with the predictor removed from the model normalized to a sum of 1 the parameter thus varied from 0 less importance to 1 greater importance collinearity was previously diagnosed by examining the variance inflation factor vif and in some cases variables were eliminated to prevent this problem 3 results 3 1 spatial variation in cml and ctsl analysis of the laboratory control strips showed that the sensitivity of manual stretching was adequate with low variability between control replicates particularly for the mass loss parameter table 2 the changes in cml and ctsl varied along the different stretches of river considered figs 3 and 4 thus on some occasions the values of these parameters fluctuated although with no clear increasing or decreasing trend e g for wwtp iii and ctsl fig 3 and wwtp ii and cml fig 4 in some cases the values of ctsl and cml tended to increase with increasing distance from the discharge as observed at wwtp v figs 3 and 4 decreasing trends were also observed e g for ctsl and cml at wwtp iv figs 3 and 4 when both parameters were expressed relative to the laboratory controls ctsllc and cmllc the values were always positive i e the mass or tensile strength of the laboratory controls not degraded was always higher than in the field samples table 3 however some negative values were obtained when cml and ctsl were expressed relative to the field control i e the point situated upstream of the discharge these negative values sometimes corresponded to the points closest to the discharge point e g for ctslfc and wwtp v fig 3 a positive value was only obtained at the point furthest from the discharge on other occasions the most negative values corresponded to the points furthest from the discharge points e g ctslfc and cmlfc at wwtp iv figs 3 and 4 the trends in cml values were similar for both types of control in all wwtps fig 4 by contrast the values of ctsl were more variable although the trends were still fairly similar fig 3 the values of cml were less disperse fig 4 than those of ctsl e g for wwtp v at 200 m and 400 m from the discharge point fig 3 the relationship between cml and ctsl was examined by regression analysis and in both cases linear regression models provided adequate fits to the data considering all sampling points the association between both parameters expressed relative to the laboratory control was highly significant p 0 001 with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 718 the equivalent relationship for the values expressed relative to the field controls was highly significant although with a lower coefficient of determination r2 0 654 3 2 relationships between cml ctsl and the physico chemical characteristics of the water and chemical composition of the moss transplants the ranges of values determined for each of the study variables are shown in table 3 conductivity was significantly related to both cmllc and ctsllc with a slightly higher coefficient of determination in the former case fig 5 the coefficients of determination for the relationships between conductivity and the parameters expressed relative to the field controls were much lower 0 269 and 0 091 for cmlfc and ctslfc respectively cml and ctsl were not significantly related to ph turbidity total n total organic c bod5 cod or water temperature considering the anions and cations analysed the strongest relationship was that between ctslfc and phosphates r2 0 924 fig 6 although with a negative slope sulphate concentrations were related to both ctsllc and cmllc and a significant relationship between ca and ctsllc was also observed neither cml or ctsl were significantly related to the other anions and cations cl no2 no3 na nh4 k mg 2 regression analysis revealed that δ15n in the transplanted moss was highly significantly related to cmllc a significant relationship was observed for ctsllc although the coefficient of determination was much lower fig 7 regression analysis was also used to examine the relationships between loss of mass or tensile strength and the metal concentrations in the transplanted moss although in all cases the coefficients of determination were very low with values often close to zero 3 3 linear modelling linear modelling was used to search for the main predictors of ctsl and cml for the variables measured at all sampling sites table 4 for both ctsl and cml relative to the field control cu was the most important variable selected whereas conductivity was the variable selected in most cases ctsllc cmlfc and cmllc for cml relative to both controls δ15n was selected as the most important variable the models for cml produced a better fit with higher coefficients of determination the analysis conducted with the parameters measured only at the discharge point and at the upstream site table 5 showed the importance of phosphates and calcium as already indicated by the individual regressions for ctsl the programme did not select any variable for cmlfc whereas for cmllc the isotopic signal δ15n in moss and ammonium in water were identified as explanatory variables as the linear regression analysis detected collinearity in some cases some variables were therefore excluded to avoid this problem however the final results were similar to those obtained before removal of any of the variables 4 discussion the positive values of ctsl and cml expressed relative to the laboratory controls indicate greater degradation of the test cotton strips than of the control strips figs 3 and 4 the negative values observed in some cases when the degradation parameters were expressed relative to the field controls indicate that the discharge had an inhibitory effect on the decomposition in these cases when the most negative values corresponded to the samples close to the discharge points this may indicate the presence in the effluents of immediately bioavailable toxic substances that inhibit the degradation of organic matter bastias et al 2018 however when the most negative values corresponded to the samples furthest from the discharge points this may be attributed to the toxic substances not being immediately bioavailable for example toxins that display affinity for organic matter may pass into solution once the organic matter always present at high concentrations in the wwtp effluents considered is degraded zaidi and imam 2008 however the values of both ctslfc and cmlfc at the most distant sampling point located at 1000 m from the discharge were almost always positive indicating greater loss of mass or tensile strength than in the field control upstream of the discharge and suggesting that the effluent almost always affected the most distant sampling points included in the study we found that cml and ctsl were positively related tiegs et al 2007 observed a curvilinear relationship between cml and ctsl with tensile strength loss varying between 0 and 95 within a narrow range of mass loss of 20 30 according to these authors the use of mass loss rather than tensile strength loss would reduce the sensitivity of the cotton strip assay in the present study the relationship between these parameters was linear and also highly significant suggesting that mass loss is a useful indicator of degradation the lower dispersion of data is also an advantage relative to ctsl among the relationships between the degradation parameters and the physico chemical characteristics of the water the general lack of association with water temperature is noteworthy an association was only observed in the linear model for mlfc in fifth place and with a negative slope which implies less loss of mass at higher temperature although a relationship between temperature and cotton tensile strength is not always observed niyogi et al 2013 temperature is often reported to be one of the most important parameters affecting organic matter degradation trettin et al 1996 griffiths and tiegs 2016 however the lack of correlation between temperature and cotton degradation in the present study may be due to the fact that the mean daily temperature or occasional temperature measurements do not realistically reflect how variations in temperature affect the decomposition rates vyšná et al 2014 it is also possible that the cotton strips were exposed to a limited range of temperatures and that no temperature effect occurred slocum et al 2009 reported that temperature clearly affected degradation of cotton strips although these researchers used two very different temperatures 20 c and 35 c the significant negative relationship with a high coefficient of determination between ctslfc and phosphates implies that a higher concentration of these compounds in water will be associated with lower loss of tensile strength this finding directly contrasts with those of other studies e g newman et al 2001 bierschenk 2012 tiegs et al 2013 it is generally considered that microbial communities are stimulated by the presence of nutrients however tiegs et al 2013 suggested that the different microbial communities in different sites act as an inoculum for the communities colonizing the organic substrate and that the variation in microbial communities will influence the decomposition rate independently of the direct effects of nutrients it is also possible that the toxins present in the effluents will negatively affect the decomposition rate bastias et al 2018 and that phosphates will be more available when decomposition rates are low degradation of organic matter generates sulphates which explains why discharge of urban sewage leads to increased concentrations of this anion antelo and arce 1996 in sites characterised by high concentrations of sulphates the rate of degradation of organic matter including cotton strips will be high which would explain the significant relationships between both ctsllc and cmllc and sulphate concentrations observed in the present study the significant relationship between ctsllc and ca may indicate that high concentrations of ca favour decomposition as also indicated by the positive correlations between ca in leaf litter and rates of decomposition observed in forest soils jacob et al 2010 it is also possible that some of the ca in the water will be derived from organic matter decomposition so that higher concentrations will be found in sites characterised by high decomposition rates upadhyay 1987 aquatic bryophytes can be used as a tool for biomonitoring water quality debén et al 2015 2017 the significant relationships between the parameters measured in the moss and those measured in the cotton strips appear to indicate an association between the composition of the wwtp effluents and the decomposition of the cotton strips wwtp effluents are enriched in 15n curt et al 2004 cole et al 2005 particularly effluents subjected to secondary treatments hicks et al 2017 such as those considered in the present study as a result macrophyte δ15n has been proposed as an indicator of the presence of n of anthropogenic origin in aquatic ecosystems cole et al 2005 carballeira et al 2012 2013 both the individual regressions and the linear modelling indicate a relationship between the isotopic signal δ15n in moss transplants and the degradation rates confirming the validity of both measures as descriptors of organic load exposure thus although the result obtained for phosphates was unexpected the importance of another nutrient n was clearly observed in this case it is important to note that the physico chemical characteristics of the water were determined in the present study by single measurements and may be poorly representative owing to the high temporal variability of physico chemical characteristics and contaminant levels found in river waters and wwtp effluents meybeck et al 1996 salgado et al 2011 morosini et al 2017 as a result it is possible that the significant relationships for parameters measured in water were merely circumstantial on the other hand the chemical composition of the transplanted moss may be considered more representative as it reflects the concentrations in the water during exposure of the transplants debén et al 2016 2017 carballeira et al 2019 although no significant relationship between the parameters measured in the cotton strips and metal concentrations in mosses was initially observed the metals were selected in the linear modelling cu was particularly important although with a negative slope which implies a toxic effect so that the rate of degradation will decrease as the metal concentration increases chew et al 2001 mn was also included in the model with a positive slope possibly indicating that this element is associated with the discharges larger organic loads should imply larger amounts of microorganisms that help degrade the cellulose organic matter can have complex effects on metal toxicity and bioaccumulation and the toxicity and bioaccumulation of elements may decrease due to the formation of complexes with dissolved organic matter luider et al 2004 ravichandran 2004 by contrast other studies have shown that the solubility and bioavailability of elements such as rh hg and zn may increase with the amount of dissolved organic matter in water rupa et al 2003 chen et al 2004 ravichandran 2004 sures and zimmermann 2007 thus the csa will indirectly provide information about the bioavailability and accumulation of some metals however determining the origin of the toxicity in sewage is very difficult due to the multiple overlapping factors affecting the process gartiser et al 2010 vasquez and fatta kassinos 2013 indicated the weak correlation between physico chemical and ecotoxicological data for treated wastewater from sewage treatment plants moreover the stressors affecting the allochthonous organic matter breakdown rates are almost unknown schäfer et al 2012 in view of the scarcity of other similar studies using the csa the relationships between the rate of decay of the cotton strips and the concentrations of metals in the effluent and the river water are in short difficult to explain due to the complex interactions between the decomposer organisms grazers shredders microbes etc the type of material and stage of decomposition the environmental conditions the metals present in the environment the metals released during the decomposition process and those bound to other substances and the presence of other pollutants schaller et al 2011 van nevel et al 2014 schaller and brackhage 2015 ferreira et al 2016 sewage treatment has advanced greatly in recent years and the quality of the effluents discharged from modern wwtps is such that several in situ studies have not detected any differences between control sites and sites affected by the effluents spänhoff et al 2007 however such findings can only be corroborated by integrated environmental monitoring involving various lines of evidence loe the primary loe in integrated monitoring plans adapted to wwtps usually consists of the physico chemical characterization of the discharges by conventional analysis of parameters that play an important role in the survival of aquatic species gosset et al 2016 with the aim of verifying whether the treatments comply with the limits outlined in the prevailing legislation for the discharge of effluents in different types of water bodies wwtps were originally designed to reduce the amounts of biodegradable organic matter solids and even nutrients in effluents but not to totally remove harmful substances ormad et al 2011 therefore in addition to this loe analysis of persistent organic pollutants that can potentially be accumulated should be conducted while not overlooking emergent compounds that are ubiquitous in sewage effluent kümmerer 2009 european commission 2012 however physico chemical characterization does not indicate how the biota may be affected carballeira et al 2012 the impacts on ecosystems due to the interactive effects between contaminants present in urban sewage waste on release into the environment are unclear and unpredictable filby et al 2007 thus a second loe should be included in order to evaluate the overall toxicity of effluents by the use of a battery of bioassays carried out under laboratory conditions in order to standardize the ecotoxicological assessment of wwtp discharges ecetoc 2004 ospar 2007 eea 2011 the complexity of wwtp effluents which contain both stimulators organic matter and inhibitors toxins modifies the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes and produces spatial discontinuities in ecosystem functioning aristi et al 2015 therefore only bioassays carried out in field conditions in situ provide realistic information about the ecotoxicity of discharges gosset et al 2016 in situ bioassays could form part of a third loe aimed at evaluating the ecological integrity however these types of bioassay are often difficult to develop and interpret due to the complex interactions between contaminants and between these and numerous physical factors filby et al 2007 in this respect the csa can be considered a simple rapid economic and standardized protocol for characterizing the receptor ecosystem integrity from a functional perspective relative to conventional structural methods such as the study of epilithic diatoms or benthic macroinvertebrate communities for validation of the usefulness of the csa as a routine monitoring tool future studies should consider different scenarios and conditions in order to take the probable complex interactions between decomposers and mixtures of contaminants into account 5 conclusions despite the similarity in the wwtps under study the response measured by decomposition of cotton strips varied in the different sites and was more complex than originally hypothesized i e a straightforward decrease in the decomposition rates with increasing distance from the discharge points probably because the complex interactions between the contaminants present in the effluents generate trophic and or toxic effects in variable proportions for most of the wwtps considered the effects of the discharges extended more than 1 km downstream mass loss appears to be a suitable measure of decomposition potential showing even lower between replicate variability than tensile strength loss we recommend that bioassays such as the cotton strip assay which can be conducted in situ under field conditions should be included in environmental monitoring plans for wwtps in order to evaluate the ecological integrity of the fluvial ecosystems affected such bioassays provide information about the effects on the receptor ecosystems where the organisms involved in the decomposition process are exposed to effluent discharges under natural environmental

18344,environmental impact studies of rivers affected by wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents have been greatly restricted by the difficulties associated with carrying out bioassays in the field and also by the complex interactions between the pollutants contained in the discharges the cotton strip assay csa enables study of the organic matter decomposition potential an important ecosystem process in rivers by taking all of the factors affecting this process into account however the csa has never been used for assessment of wwtp effluents in the present study we selected six fluvial zones affected by discharges from small wwtps and placed cotton strips at increasing distances from the discharge points in each zone after 17 days we evaluated decay of the strips by measuring cotton tensile strength loss ctsl and cotton mass loss cml we then determined the relationships between these parameters and various physico chemical and biological properties in the water as well as the δ15n isotopic signal and metal contents of aquatic mosses transplanted in the same sampling sites and used as biomonitors although the wwtps were similar some of the discharges stimulated and others inhibited decomposition of the cotton strips this was probably due to differences in the proportions of various types of pollutants with trophic or toxic effects in the discharges the csa proved to be a simple practical and economic bioassay and suitable for evaluating the ecological integrity of fluvial ecosystems graphical abstract image 1 keywords ecosystem services environmental monitoring plan ecological integrity biodegradation monitoring bioassay 1 introduction waste water treatment plant wwtp effluents comprise a complex mixture of organic matter nutrients metals pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products and other types of compounds the nutrients derived directly from these effluents or from mineralization of the organic matter favour the autotrophic components of fluvial ecosystems although excess concentrations may lead to eutrophication processes on the other hand toxic pollutants can have negative effects that inhibit the development of aquatic organisms physico chemical analysis of the discharges is of little value for predicting the effects on the functioning of fluvial ecosystems because of the potential additive synergistic and antagonistic interactions in the complex mixture of substances kienzler et al 2016 and in situ ecotoxicological assessment of this type of effects is scarce although structural indexes are often used to evaluate the health of fluvial ecosystems the use of indicators of ecosystem processes such as organic matter decomposition and primary production is less common clapcott et al 2010 tiegs et al 2013 however these functional indicators provide useful information about organic matter processing and energy transfer that is not given by structural indexes niyogi et al 2013 decay of dead organic matter is a fundamental process in any ecosystem as mineralized nutrients maintain primary production a reduction in the breakdown of organic matter will affect primary productivity as well as the ecosystem service of water purification schäfer et al 2012 the litter bag assay is the method most commonly used to evaluate litter decomposition but the results vary depending on the mesh size bag shape litter species litter mass etc lecerf and chauvet 2008 ágoston szabó 2016 although many of these parameters can be standardized it is almost impossible to standardize litter quality tiegs et al 2013 use of cotton strips as a standard substrate has therefore been proposed in order to enable comparison of decomposition rates in different types of studies and the method has been demonstrated to be useful for studying the organic matter decomposition potential in both soils and fluvial environments e g trettin et al 1996 boulton and quinn 2000 tiegs et al 2007 clapcott and barmuta 2010 the cotton strip assay is ecologically relevant as it is based on the decomposition of cellulose the most abundant polymer on earth loss of the tensile strength of the cotton strips is one of the parameters measured in the csa this process tends to occur much more rapidly than the loss of leaf litter mass from riparian trees and the exposure times are short and operationally practical another advantage of the csa is that the cotton strips lack nutrients and they are therefore useful for studying how nutrients affect litter decay newman et al 2001 moreover cotton strips are less likely to be fragmented and lost than the litter in the litter bag assay egglishaw 1972 the aim of the present study was to evaluate how the effluents from wwtps serving small urban populations less than 20 000 population equivalent affect the rate of organic matter decomposition estimated by the csa in the rivers receiving the discharges we hypothesized that the decomposition rates will be positively affected by the effluents and will generally decrease with the distance from the discharge point as the bioavailability of the nutrients decreases this is because the effluents are mainly generated by small populations rather than by large industries which would be more likely to discharge compounds with potentially toxic effects this is the first time that this test has been used for in situ assessment of the impact of wwtps studies of the environmental impacts of small wwtps are scarce despite the fact that small treatment plants in regions such as the study area discharge large amounts of effluents into rivers and are generally less efficient than the plants that serve large cities 2 methods 2 1 study areas six wwtps in galicia nw spain were selected for study the wwtps each serve less than 20 000 population equivalent are not close to other sources of contamination and discharge their effluents directly into fluvial ecosystems table 1 some of the rivers in the study area have small tributaries or streams however these streams arise in areas that are not affected by pollution sources and in all cases the flow rates are much lower than those of the main rivers six sampling points were established at each wwtp one point upstream of the discharge point another immediately beside the discharge point 0 m and points at 100 200 400 and 1000 m downstream of the discharge points fig 1 2 2 preparing and exposing the cotton strips cotton strips were prepared by cutting unprimed 100 natural cotton canvas 12 oz natural cotton duck 400 g m 2 manufacturer russell and chapple into rectangles of length 8 cm and width 27 threads following the procedure described by tiegs et al 2013 the strips were held in a forced air oven at 40 c until exposure laboratory control strips were processed in the same way as the experimental strips but were kept in the oven 40 c during the exposure period the strips were weighed before being attached with plastic cable ties to concrete bricks to minimise disturbance from the hydrological conditions and to maximise contact with the benthos in the exposure sites fig 2 the bricks were placed in areas with similar substrates granulometry current speed etc to minimise interference in the decomposition process pieces of mesh were placed in front of each hole in the brick facing the direction of current to protect the cotton strips and to prevent them being covered or moved by passing objects fig 2 at each exposure site the bricks were placed almost perpendicular to the current at a slight angle to prevent obstruction of the mesh protectors fig 2 triplicate cotton strips were exposed at each sampling point for 17 days in september 2016 as the flow rate of the rivers is usually minimal at this time of year in the study region table 1 and the impact of the wwtp effluents should therefore be maximal the strips were collected after the exposure period washed vigorously in situ and placed in 50 ml conical centrifuge tubes falcon containing 80 ethanol to prevent any further decomposition before processing 2 3 processing the strips in the laboratory the cotton strips were removed from the tubes and dried at 40 c for 48 h the dried strips were weighed to determine loss of biomass the tension of each replicate strip was measured immediately in a system consisting of two clamps an extensometer sf 500 yueqing china and a manual test stand the strips were manually stretched by fitting the ends to the clamps with the aim of stretching the strips 2 cm every minute the cotton tensile strength loss ctsl was calculated as the percentage loss for each

of the aquatic moss fontinalis squamosa were exposed for 10 days beside the cotton strips in each exposure site for determination the δ15n isotopic signal and evaluation of metal accumulation the moss samples were first devitalized in order to prevent the moss metabolism interfering in the accumulation of metals fernández et al 2009 by exposing them to different temperatures for several hours 8 h

aliquots of 0 6 g dry weight of moss were placed in each bag in the laboratory the moss samples were removed from the bags placed in paper bags and dried in an oven 48 h at 40 c the moss samples were then ground in a zirconium oxide tangential mill retsch mm400 haan germany and placed in glass vessels for storage at room temperature until chemical analysis subsamples of moss 3 mg 0 1 dry weight

in a mass spectrometer icp ms agilent 7700x santa clara ca usa 2 6 statistical analysis the statistical analysis was carried out using ibm spss statistics version 24 automatic linear modelling analysis yang 2013 was used to explore the main predictors of ctsl and cml taking all variables measured in the water samples and in the moss transplants into account as some variables were measured at all sampling sites and others were only measured at the discharge points and at the preceding sites the two corresponding data sets were analysed separately the forward stepwise variable selection method was used and inclusion exclusion was determined with the corrected akaike information criterion aicc in addition to the usual parameters the software estimates a parameter known as predictor importance calculated as the residual sum of squares with the predictor removed from the model normalized to a sum of 1 the parameter thus varied from 0 less importance to 1 greater importance collinearity was previously diagnosed by examining the variance inflation factor vif and in some cases variables were eliminated to prevent this problem 3 results 3 1 spatial variation in cml and ctsl analysis of the laboratory control strips showed that the sensitivity of manual stretching was adequate with low variability between control replicates particularly for the mass loss parameter table 2 the changes in cml and ctsl varied along the different stretches of river considered figs 3 and 4 thus on some occasions the values of these parameters fluctuated although with no clear increasing or decreasing trend e g for wwtp iii and ctsl fig 3 and wwtp ii and cml fig 4 in some cases the values of ctsl and cml tended to increase with increasing distance from the discharge as observed at wwtp v figs 3 and 4 decreasing trends were also observed e g for ctsl and cml at wwtp iv figs 3 and 4 when both parameters were expressed relative to the laboratory controls ctsllc and cmllc the values were always positive i e the mass or tensile strength of the laboratory controls not degraded was always higher than in the field samples table 3 however some negative values were obtained when cml and ctsl were expressed relative to the field control i e the point situated upstream of the discharge these negative values sometimes corresponded to the points closest to the discharge point e g for ctslfc and wwtp v fig 3 a positive value was only obtained at the point furthest from the discharge on other occasions the most negative values corresponded to the points furthest from the discharge points e g ctslfc and cmlfc at wwtp iv figs 3 and 4 the trends in cml values were similar for both types of control in all wwtps fig 4 by contrast the values of ctsl were more variable although the trends were still fairly similar fig 3 the values of cml were less disperse fig 4 than those of ctsl e g for wwtp v at 200 m and 400 m from the discharge point fig 3 the relationship between cml and ctsl was examined by regression analysis and in both cases linear regression models provided adequate fits to the data considering all sampling points the association between both parameters expressed relative to the laboratory control was highly significant p 0 001 with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 718 the equivalent relationship for the values expressed relative to the field controls was highly significant although with a lower coefficient of determination r2 0 654 3 2 relationships between cml ctsl and the physico chemical characteristics of the water and chemical composition of the moss transplants the ranges of values determined for each of the study variables are shown in table 3 conductivity was significantly related to both cmllc and ctsllc with a slightly higher coefficient of determination in the former case fig 5 the coefficients of determination for the relationships between conductivity and the parameters expressed relative to the field controls were much lower 0 269 and 0 091 for cmlfc and ctslfc respectively cml and ctsl were not significantly related to ph turbidity total n total organic c bod5 cod or water temperature considering the anions and cations analysed the strongest relationship was that between ctslfc and phosphates r2 0 924 fig 6 although with a negative slope sulphate concentrations were related to both ctsllc and cmllc and a significant relationship between ca and ctsllc was also observed neither cml or ctsl were significantly related to the other anions and cations cl no2 no3 na nh4 k mg 2 regression analysis revealed that δ15n in the transplanted moss was highly significantly related to cmllc a significant relationship was observed for ctsllc although the coefficient of determination was much lower fig 7 regression analysis was also used to examine the relationships between loss of mass or tensile strength and the metal concentrations in the transplanted moss although in all cases the coefficients of determination were very low with values often close to zero 3 3 linear modelling linear modelling was used to search for the main predictors of ctsl and cml for the variables measured at all sampling sites table 4 for both ctsl and cml relative to the field control cu was the most important variable selected whereas conductivity was the variable selected in most cases ctsllc cmlfc and cmllc for cml relative to both controls δ15n was selected as the most important variable the models for cml produced a better fit with higher coefficients of determination the analysis conducted with the parameters measured only at the discharge point and at the upstream site table 5 showed the importance of phosphates and calcium as already indicated by the individual regressions for ctsl the programme did not select any variable for cmlfc whereas for cmllc the isotopic signal δ15n in moss and ammonium in water were identified as explanatory variables as the linear regression analysis detected collinearity in some cases some variables were therefore excluded to avoid this problem however the final results were similar to those obtained before removal of any of the variables 4 discussion the positive values of ctsl and cml expressed relative to the laboratory controls indicate greater degradation of the test cotton strips than of the control strips figs 3 and 4 the negative values observed in some cases when the degradation parameters were expressed relative to the field controls indicate that the discharge had an inhibitory effect on the decomposition in these cases when the most negative values corresponded to the samples close to the discharge points this may indicate the presence in the effluents of immediately bioavailable toxic substances that inhibit the degradation of organic matter bastias et al 2018 however when the most negative values corresponded to the samples furthest from the discharge points this may be attributed to the toxic substances not being immediately bioavailable for example toxins that display affinity for organic matter may pass into solution once the organic matter always present at high concentrations in the wwtp effluents considered is degraded zaidi and imam 2008 however the values of both ctslfc and cmlfc at the most distant sampling point located at 1000 m from the discharge were almost always positive indicating greater loss of mass or tensile strength than in the field control upstream of the discharge and suggesting that the effluent almost always affected the most distant sampling points included in the study we found that cml and ctsl were positively related tiegs et al 2007 observed a curvilinear relationship between cml and ctsl with tensile strength loss varying between 0 and 95 within a narrow range of mass loss of 20 30 according to these authors the use of mass loss rather than tensile strength loss would reduce the sensitivity of the cotton strip assay in the present study the relationship between these parameters was linear and also highly significant suggesting that mass loss is a useful indicator of degradation the lower dispersion of data is also an advantage relative to ctsl among the relationships between the degradation parameters and the physico chemical characteristics of the water the general lack of association with water temperature is noteworthy an association was only observed in the linear model for mlfc in fifth place and with a negative slope which implies less loss of mass at higher temperature although a relationship between temperature and cotton tensile strength is not always observed niyogi et al 2013 temperature is often reported to be one of the most important parameters affecting organic matter degradation trettin et al 1996 griffiths and tiegs 2016 however the lack of correlation between temperature and cotton degradation in the present study may be due to the fact that the mean daily temperature or occasional temperature measurements do not realistically reflect how variations in temperature affect the decomposition rates vyšná et al 2014 it is also possible that the cotton strips were exposed to a limited range of temperatures and that no temperature effect occurred slocum et al 2009 reported that temperature clearly affected degradation of cotton strips although these researchers used two very different temperatures 20 c and 35 c the significant negative relationship with a high coefficient of determination between ctslfc and phosphates implies that a higher concentration of these compounds in water will be associated with lower loss of tensile strength this finding directly contrasts with those of other studies e g newman et al 2001 bierschenk 2012 tiegs et al 2013 it is generally considered that microbial communities are stimulated by the presence of nutrients however tiegs et al 2013 suggested that the different microbial communities in different sites act as an inoculum for the communities colonizing the organic substrate and that the variation in microbial communities will influence the decomposition rate independently of the direct effects of nutrients it is also possible that the toxins present in the effluents will negatively affect the decomposition rate bastias et al 2018 and that phosphates will be more available when decomposition rates are low degradation of organic matter generates sulphates which explains why discharge of urban sewage leads to increased concentrations of this anion antelo and arce 1996 in sites characterised by high concentrations of sulphates the rate of degradation of organic matter including cotton strips will be high which would explain the significant relationships between both ctsllc and cmllc and sulphate concentrations observed in the present study the significant relationship between ctsllc and ca may indicate that high concentrations of ca favour decomposition as also indicated by the positive correlations between ca in leaf litter and rates of decomposition observed in forest soils jacob et al 2010 it is also possible that some of the ca in the water will be derived from organic matter decomposition so that higher concentrations will be found in sites characterised by high decomposition rates upadhyay 1987 aquatic bryophytes can be used as a tool for biomonitoring water quality debén et al 2015 2017 the significant relationships between the parameters measured in the moss and those measured in the cotton strips appear to indicate an association between the composition of the wwtp effluents and the decomposition of the cotton strips wwtp effluents are enriched in 15n curt et al 2004 cole et al 2005 particularly effluents subjected to secondary treatments hicks et al 2017 such as those considered in the present study as a result macrophyte δ15n has been proposed as an indicator of the presence of n of anthropogenic origin in aquatic ecosystems cole et al 2005 carballeira et al 2012 2013 both the individual regressions and the linear modelling indicate a relationship between the isotopic signal δ15n in moss transplants and the degradation rates confirming the validity of both measures as descriptors of organic load exposure thus although the result obtained for phosphates was unexpected the importance of another nutrient n was clearly observed in this case it is important to note that the physico chemical characteristics of the water were determined in the present study by single measurements and may be poorly representative owing to the high

parameters measured in the cotton strips and metal concentrations in mosses was initially observed the metals were selected in the linear modelling cu was particularly important although with a negative slope which implies a toxic effect so that the rate of degradation will decrease as the metal concentration increases chew et al 2001 mn was also included in the model with a positive slope possibly indicating that this element is associated with the discharges larger organic loads should imply larger amounts of microorganisms that help degrade the cellulose organic matter can have complex effects on metal toxicity and bioaccumulation and the toxicity and bioaccumulation of elements may decrease due to the formation of complexes with dissolved organic matter luider et al 2004

between these and numerous physical factors filby et al 2007 in this respect the csa can be considered a simple rapid economic and standardized protocol for characterizing the receptor ecosystem integrity from a functional perspective relative to conventional structural methods such as the study of epilithic diatoms or benthic macroinvertebrate communities for validation of the usefulness of the csa as a routine monitoring tool future studies should consider different scenarios and conditions in order to take the probable complex interactions between decomposers and mixtures of contaminants into account 5 conclusions despite the similarity in the wwtps under study the response measured by decomposition of cotton strips varied in the different sites and was more complex than originally hypothesized i e a straightforward decrease in the decomposition rates with increasing distance from the discharge points probably because the complex interactions between the contaminants present in the effluents generate trophic and or toxic effects in variable proportions for most of the wwtps considered the effects of the discharges extended more than 1 km downstream mass loss appears to be a suitable measure of decomposition potential showing even lower between replicate variability than tensile strength loss we recommend that bioassays such as the cotton strip assay which can be conducted in situ under field conditions should be included in environmental monitoring plans for wwtps in order to evaluate the ecological integrity of the fluvial ecosystems affected such bioassays provide information about the effects on the receptor ecosystems where the organisms involved in the decomposition process are exposed to effluent discharges under natural environmental
