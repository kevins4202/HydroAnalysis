7395,reaction infiltration instability in which chemical reactions can dissolve minerals and therefore create preferential pore fluid flow channels in fluid saturated rocks may play an important role in controlling groundwater quality in groundwater hydrology although this topic has been studied for many years there is a recent debate which says that the use of large density asymptotics in the previous studies is invalid however there is a crucial conceptual mistake in this debate which leads to results and conclusions that are inconsistent with the fundamental laws of physics it is well known that in terms of distance time and velocity there are only two independent variables but they are treated as three independent variables a procedure that is the main source of the physically unrealistic results and conclusions in the debate in this paper we will discuss the results and conclusions related to the debate with emphasis on the issues leading to the corresponding errors in particular we demonstrate that there is an unappreciated constraint condition between the dimensional dimensionless distance time and velocity in the debate by using this constraint condition it can be confirmed that as the ratio of the reactant concentration in the incoming fluid stream to the mineral concentration approaches zero the dimensionless transport parameter h automatically approaches infinity therefore it is further confirmed that the previous work conducted by chadam and others remains valid keywords reaction infiltration instability chemical dissolution large density ratio front instability porous media 1 introduction reaction infiltration instability in which chemical reactions can dissolve minerals and therefore create preferential pore fluid flow channels in fluid saturated rocks may play an important role in controlling groundwater quality in groundwater hydrology imhoff et al 1996 2003 maji and sudicky 2008 miller et al 1990 seyedabbasi et al 2008 to solve this problem chadam et al 1986 conducted a seminal study by using large density asymptotics in which the density ratio γ of the reactant concentration in the incoming fluid stream c in to the mineral concentration c sol is approaching zero in their study chemical dissolution fronts were considered to propagate in the infinite space which is filled with fluid saturated rocks the following two main conclusions were drawn from their study 1 as the density ratio γ approaches zero the thickness of a chemical dissolution front also approaches zero leading to a sharp shape of the chemical dissolution front 2 for a given reaction infiltration system with a given inflow velocity in the fluid saturated rock a chemical dissolution front is unstable if the wavelength of an applied small perturbation is greater than the critical wavelength of the system due to the theoretical importance of this seminal study extensive theoretical analysis and computational simulations have been further followed in the past years ortoleva et al 1987a b ormond and ortoleva 2000 chen and liu 2002 2004 chen et al 2009 lai et al 2014 2016 in particular imhoff and miller extended the work of chadam et al 1986 to the theoretical study of non aqueous phase liquid napl dissolution instability in fluid saturated porous media imhoff and miller 1996 which plays an important role in removing napls from contaminated groundwater resources imhoff et al 1996 2003 maji and sudicky 2008 miller et al 1990 seyedabbasi et al 2008 however there is a recent debate ladd and szymczak 2017 to question the validity of using large density asymptotics in the work of chadam et al 1986 unfortunately there are serious mistakes that lead to questionable conclusions in the debate paper first the treatment of distance time and velocity as three independent variables violates the fundamental principle in physics this violation leads to a constraint condition between the density ratio γ and the dimensionless transport parameter h note that this density ratio χ is also called the mineral dissolution ratio in previous papers zhao et al 2010 zhao 2014 second the main conclusions in the debate paper are questionable actually we can use the related equations in the debate paper itself to demonstrate that the constraint condition between the mineral dissolution ratio γ and the dimensionless transport parameter h clearly requires that as γ 0 the accompanied condition of h must be automatically satisfied thus this fact not only demonstrates that γ indeed plays a role in determining the degree of reactant penetration in the downstream region but also demonstrates that in the limit of γ 0 the reactant concentration in the downstream of the front indeed vanishes in addition this fact can be further confirmed when a physically consistent set of dimensional dimensionless distance time and velocity are used to derive the dimensionless governing partial differential equations of the reaction infiltration instability problem in addition the criterion for a reaction infiltration instability derived by zhao and coworkers zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b is significantly different from that derived by chadam et al 1986 in reality there are two significantly different approaches to the establishment of a criterion for assessing the instability of a dissolution front when it propagates in a chemical dissolution system either with a given inflow velocity chadam et al 1986 or with a variable inflow velocity zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b unfortunately this significant difference was neglected in the debate ladd and szymczak 2017 in the former case the main focus is on the computational simulation aspects of morphological evolution of chemical dissolution fronts in supercritical chemical dissolution systems while in the later case the main focus is on the theoretical analysis aspects of instability of chemical dissolution fronts in critical chemical dissolution systems in the following sections we will address the above mentioned issues in detail to facilitate the following discussions the same definitions of the variables as those used in the debate ladd and szymczak 2017 are employed in this paper 2 the treatment of distance time and velocity as three independent variables leading to an unappreciated constraint condition between γ and h it is well known that for continuum mechanics problems in physics distance and time are two fundamentally independent variables while velocity and acceleration are derivative variables we will demonstrate what happens when this most common knowledge is violated in the section of asymptotic limits in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 toward this end we need to introduce the following equations involved to the reaction infiltration instability problem 1 r r v 0 d 2 v v v 0 c c c in 3 t t t d ks γ t where r and r are the dimensional and dimensionless distance vectors d is the constant diffusion coefficient of the fully dissolved matrix v 0 is the flow velocity in a uniform undissolved matrix v and v are the dimensional and dimensionless flow velocities k is the rate constant with a unit of m s c in is the reactant concentration in the incoming fluid stream c and c are the dimensional and dimensionless concentrations s is the constant surface area per unit volume of the undissolved mineral phase with a unit of 1 m t is the dimensional time with a unit of second t is the dimensionless time γ is the dimensionless ratio of the reactant concentration in the incoming fluid stream to the mineral concentration t d is the dissolution time scale with a unit of second the last two quantities are defined as follows 4 γ c in c sol 5 t d t r γ 1 ks γ where c sol is the mineral concentration t r is the reaction time scale with a unit of second and is defined in the following form 6 t r 1 ks note that eqs 1 3 are in correspondence to eqs 16 17 and 21 in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 respectively the detailed corresponding relationships between equations used in this paper and in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 can be found in table 1 by considering eqs 1 3 the following equation exists mathematically 7 d r d t v 0 ks γ d d r dt from fundamental definitions in physics we have the following relationships 8 v d r dt v d r d t substitution of eq 8 into eq 7 yields the following equation 9 v v 0 2 ks γ d v v 0 in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 the dimensionless transport parameter h is defined as follows 10 h dks v 0 2 substitution of eq 10 into eq 9 yields the following equation 11 v 1 γ h v v 0 it is straightforwardly concluded that the validity condition of the first expression i e v v v 0 in eq 2 can be described as follows 12 1 γ h 1 or γ h 1 clearly enough the constraint condition in eq 12 is directly contradictory to the quasi steady state condition which is derived and presented in eq 36 of the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 as follows 13 γ h 1 3 the main conclusions in the debate are questionable in the section of conclusions in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 there is a paragraph which says that we have offered a critical review of the reaction infiltration instability pointing out two significant misconceptions that have arisen from hidden assumptions in the asymptotic analysis first that the mineral dissolution ratio γ plays a role in determining the degree of reactant penetration second that in the limit γ 0 the reactant concentration downstream of the front vanishes chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a chadam et al 1988 chadam and ortoleva 1990 zhao et al 2008 2010 2013a 2014 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2015 both these statements are incorrect eqs 27 and 30 show that the mineral dissolution ratio γ plays no role in determining the quasi stationary concentration profile in particular the downstream concentration only vanishes when h 1 let us prove why the main conclusions in the debate are questionable below for this purpose we need to reconsider eqs 22 24 in the debate paper as follows 14 γ h φ t v 0 15 γ h φ c t v c 2 c h c θ φ 1 φ 16 φ t c θ φ 1 φ where θ φ 1 φ is the heaviside function φ is the matrix porosity φ 1 is the porosity of the fully dissolved matrix other quantities have the same meanings as those defined previously the heaviside function has the following definition 17 θ x 0 x 0 18 θ x 1 x 0 substitution of the constraint condition in eq 12 into eqs 14 and 15 yields the following equations 19 φ t v 0 20 φ c t v c 2 c 1 γ c θ φ 1 φ eq 20 indicates that as γ 0 the last term in the right hand side of this equation approaches infinity so that it becomes the predominant term in this equation to ensure that eq 20 makes sense physically the following condition should hold mathematically 21 c θ φ 1 φ 0 this clearly demonstrates that eq 21 can be mathematically valid if the following two cases are true 1 c 0 in the whole analytical domain 2 the whole analytical domain can be divided into two parts an upstream domain i e in the region of x 0 in which θ φ 1 φ 0 i e φ φ 1 physically meaning that the dissolvable minerals of the matrix are fully dissolved and a downstream domain i e in the region of x 0 in which c 0 meaning that no chemical dissolution takes place in this region since the first case is scientifically insignificant we only consider the second case hereafter the scientific problem associated with this second case which is commonly called the stefan problem has been studied theoretically and computationally for many years chadam et al 1986 1988 ortoleva et al 1987a b chadam and ortoleva 1990 ormond and ortoleva 2000 chen and liu 2002 2004 zhao et al 2008 2010 2013a b chen et al 2009 zhao 2014 lai et al 2014 2016 zhao et al 2015 in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 the reason for this phenomenon was also explained as follows more precisely as h the gradients of c must become ever steeper in order to balance the term h c the penetration length into the matrix becomes vanishingly small in comparison to the concentration length scale in the upstream region the quasi stationary thin front limit described by chadam et al 1986 therefore involves two sequential limiting steps first γ 0 then h the mathematical validity condition of eq 21 demonstrates that as γ 0 the dissolution front which is represented by the porosity profile at the interface between the upstream region and the downstream region is sharp this fact not only demonstrates that the mineral dissolution ratio γ indeed plays a role in determining the degree of reactant penetration in the downstream region i e x 0 but also demonstrates that in the limit γ 0 the reactant concentration in the downstream of the front indeed vanishes in addition the constraint condition in eq 12 clearly demonstrates that as γ 0 the accompanied condition of h can be automatically satisfied thus it can be concluded that the related conclusions drawn from the previous work see chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a chadam et al 1988 chadam and ortoleva 1990 zhao et al 2008 2010 2013a 2014 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2015 are correct while the main conclusions stated in the debate are questionable it is interesting to demonstrate that if a physically consistent set of dimensional dimensionless distance time and velocity are used then we can just use the mineral dissolution ratio γ alone to derive the dimensionless governing partial differential equations of the reaction infiltration instability problem for this purpose we need to reconsider the dimensional governing partial differential equations of the problem i e eqs 1 3 in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 as follows 22 φ t v 0 23 φ c t v c d i c ksc θ φ 1 φ 24 c sol φ t ksc θ φ 1 φ where c sol is the mineral concentration i is a unity matrix we can first define the following two independent variables for both the dimensionless distance vector and the dimensionless time 25 r ks γ d r 26 t t t d ks γ t then we can use eqs 25 and 26 to derive the dimensionless velocity vector below 27 d r d t 1 ks γ d d r dt this equation can be straightforwardly written as 28 v 1 ks γ d v v v v ks γ d it is obvious that since v is a derived velocity scale the fundamental principle in physics which was violated by using an independent velocity scale v 0 in the debate ladd and szymczak 2017 can now be satisfied by using the above mentioned dimensionless variables and the dimensionless concentration defined in eq 2 we can obtain the dimensionless governing partial differential equations of the reaction infiltration instability problem as follows 29 φ t v 0 30 φ c t v c 2 c 1 γ c θ φ 1 φ 31 φ t c θ φ 1 φ eqs 29 31 clearly demonstrate that when a physically consistent set of dimensional dimensionless distance time and velocity are used the term of γ h automatically disappears in the dimensionless governing partial differential equations of the reaction infiltration instability problem this indicates that although there are two distinct velocities as a result of using two different time scales only one time scale should be used in the process of deriving the dimensionless governing partial differential equations when two different time scales are simultaneously used it can cause an inconsistency of time scale in the dimensionless governing partial differential equations if we compare eqs 14 and 15 with eqs 29 and 30 then we can find that it is the physical inconsistency that leads to the constraint condition of γ h 1 which needs to be applied to get eqs 14 and 15 corrected specifically in the debate ladd and szymczak 2017 this physical inconsistency is caused by using distance time and velocity as three independent variables to derive the dimensionless governing partial differential equations of the reaction infiltration instability problem thus the treatment of distance time and velocity as three independent variables is equivalent to the use of two different time scales simultaneously in the dimensionless governing partial differential equations 4 two different approaches for dealing with reaction infiltration instability problems in the conclusion section of the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 there is a statement which says that attempts to extend the thin front stability analysis to finite reaction rates zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b do not lead to new results see section 5 but only repeat previous calculations chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a b in a different scaling however because two different approaches were used there are two significant differences between the work of zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b and the work of chadam et al 1986 and ortoleva et al 1987a b as explained in detail below from the previous work chadam et al 1986 zhao 2014 the dimensionless growth rate of a small perturbation can be expressed as follows 32 ω m zh zh 1 γ φ 1 φ 0 zh zh 2 4 m 2 1 γ m where 33 γ k φ 0 k φ 1 and m is the dimensionless wavenumber of the small perturbation ω m zh is the dimensionless growth rate of the small perturbation k φ 0 is the permeability of the porous rock ahead of the dissolution front that is represented by the porosity profile k φ 1 is the permeability of the porous rock behind of the dissolution front φ 0 is the uniform porosity of the undissolved material zh is a dimensionless parameter since ω m zh is a function of the dimensionless wavenumber i e m and the dimensionless parameter zh it is interesting to investigate 1 how ω m zh varies with m for a given value of zh and 2 how ω m zh varies with zh for a given value of m these two cases can lead to two different approaches for dealing with reaction infiltration instability problems for the purpose of illustrating these two different approaches we need specific values for parameters φ 0 φ 1 and γ if the initial porosity φ 0 and the final porosity φ 1 are assumed to be 0 1 and 0 2 respectively then we can use the commonly used kozeny carman formula carman 1956 to determine the value of parameter γ in eq 33 as a result the value of parameter γ is equal to 0 0988 to investigate the general behavior of dissolution front instability in the first case which was considered by chadam et al 1986 fig 1 shows how the dimensionless growth rate varies with the dimensionless wavenumber due to different zh numbers in the chemical dissolution system it is noted that for a given value of the zh number there is a maximum value i e a cutoff value of the dimensionless wavenumber beyond which the dimensionless growth rate is smaller than zero so that the dissolution front is stable when it propagates in the chemical dissolution system since the analytical domain is a full space of infinite extension there is also an optimal value of the dimensionless wavenumber at which the dimensionless growth rate reaches its maximum value so that the dissolution front becomes most unstable when it propagates in the chemical dissolution system on the other hand it can be also observed that when the zh number increases both the cutoff dimensionless wavenumber and the optimal dimensionless wavenumber increase accordingly however it should be pointed out that as a typical example of the first case chadam et al 1986 only considered a specific situation of zh 1 0 in their paper this means that the inflow velocity is prescribed as a given constant in the reaction infiltration system considered by them chadam et al 1986 if we substitute zh 1 0 into eq 32 then we can obtain the same results for both the cutoff dimensionless wavenumber and the optimal dimensionless wavenumber as follows 34 m cutoff 2 1 γ 3 2 γ γ 2 35 m optimal 1 γ 2 3 2 γ γ 2 where m cutoff is the cutoff dimensionless wavenumber in the case of zh 1 0 m optimal is the optimal dimensionless wavenumber associated with zh 1 0 similarly to investigate the general behavior of dissolution front instability in the second case which was considered by zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b fig 2 shows how the dimensionless growth rate varies with the zh number due to different dimensionless wavenumbers in the chemical dissolution system in this case for a given value of the dimensionless wavenumber there is a minimum value i e a critical value of the zh number beyond which the dimensionless growth rate is not only greater than zero but increases monotonically as well therefore it is possible to establish the following criteria 1 if the zh number is smaller than the corresponding critical zh number then the dissolution front is in a stable state 2 if the zh number is equal to the corresponding critical zh number then the dissolution front is in a neutral state and 3 if the zh number is greater than the corresponding critical zh number then the dissolution front is in an unstable state this is the basic reason for using the critical zh number instead of the dimensionless wavenumber to establish a criterion for assessing the instability of a dissolution front because chadam et al 1986 did not consider the second case at all there is clearly a significant difference between the work of zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b and the work of chadam et al 1986 since the thickness of a horizontal stratum within the upper crust of the earth is a finite value it is desirable to establish a criterion associated with the second case to judge the instability of a dissolution front when it propagates in a horizontal stratum for instance when the in situ leaching method is used in mining engineering it is necessary to determine the maximum horizontal velocity of the injected fluid in the horizontal stratum so that the dissolution front can maintain stability as it propagates because the zh number is directly proportional to the horizontal velocity of the injected fluid zhao et al 2010 2015 the criterion associated with the second case can be used to determine the maximum horizontal velocity of the injected fluid which corresponds to the critical zh number zh critical with m 1 0 taken as an example we can obtain the corresponding critical zh number from eq 32 as follows 36 zh critical 3 2 γ γ 2 2 1 γ consequently the criterion associated with the fundamental mode i e the mode with m 1 0 of a dissolution front can be straightforwardly expressed as 37 zh zh critical 3 2 γ γ 2 2 1 γ this means that eq 37 is only valid for the fundamental mode with m 1 0 incidentally this criterion can be employed to design a computational model which is used to simulate the instability of a dissolution front in a fluid saturated porous medium for example if the dimensionless thickness in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the injected fluid flow of a computational model is slightly 3 1416 then we can use eq 37 to judge whether the single finger mode which is associated with the fundamental mode takes place in the computational model this is the reason why we commonly used the dimensionless thickness width of 5 in previous simulations zhao et al 2008 2010 2015 zhao 2014 the current status of research shows that in some special cases analytical solutions for the instability of a dissolution front in the fluid saturated porous medium can be obtained when the chemical dissolution system is either subcritical or critical chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a b but it is impossible to obtain analytical solutions for describing the evolution process of a dissolution front when the chemical dissolution system is supercritical zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b even for some special cases chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a b therefore it is necessary to develop and use computational methods to obtain numerical solutions for describing the morphological evolution of a dissolution front in supercritical chemical dissolution systems through using the computational methods many important factors which were not considered in the previous work chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a b have been considered including the morphological evolution of chemical dissolution fronts in supercritical chemical dissolution systems for example reactive surface areas associated with different particle shapes zhao et al 2007 mineral dissolution ratios zhao et al 2010 permeability porosity functions lai et al 2014 and medium permeability anisotropy lai et al 2016 have been considered for supercritical chemical dissolution systems consequently many useful conclusions have been drawn from the computational simulations zhao et al 2007 2010 lai et al 2014 2016 this fact indicates that there is another significant difference between the work of zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b and the work of chadam et al 1986 in the former case the main focus is on the computational simulation aspects of morphological evolution of chemical dissolution fronts in supercritical chemical dissolution systems while in the later case the main focus is on the theoretical analysis aspects of instability of chemical dissolution fronts in critical chemical dissolution systems 5 application background and examples since reaction infiltration instability can play a controlling role in determining pore fluid flow patterns through creating preferential pore fluid flow channels in fluid saturated rocks soils it has broad application background in a number of scientific and engineering fields for instance in the field of hydrology reaction infiltration instability may significantly affect groundwater quality imhoff et al 1996 2003 maji and sudicky 2008 miller et al 1990 seyedabbasi et al 2008 in particular it can be employed to remove toxic materials such as nonaqueous phase liquids from contaminated land sites zhao et al 2012 in the field of geology not only can reaction infiltration instability be used to reveal the dynamic mechanism of karst formations but also it can be employed to better understand the ore forming mechanisms within the upper crust of the earth ortoleva et al 1987a b ormond and ortoleva 2000 chen and liu 2002 2004 chen et al 2009 lai et al 2014 2016 in the field of petroleum engineering reaction infiltration instability can be used to increase the oil production through injecting hydrochloric acid into carbonate rocks in the surroundings of drilling wells fredd and fogler 1998 golfier et al 2002 panga et al 2005 kalia and balakotaiah 2007 2009 cohen et al 2008 despite the fact that reaction infiltration instability has broad application background in a number of scientific and engineering fields the key issue associated with the application of this phenomenon is to establish a theoretical criterion which can be effectively used to judge whether or not a chemical dissolution front is unstable in the reaction infiltration system due to the approximate nature of any numerical methods it is impossible to use computational simulation results to establish such a theoretical criterion although computational simulation results can be used to display the evolution process of a chemical dissolution front in the reaction infiltration system this is the main reason why great efforts have been made over past years for conducting theoretical studies on reaction infiltration instability in fluid saturated porous media chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a chadam et al 1988 chadam and ortoleva 1990 zhao et al 2008 2010 2013a 2014 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2015 by means of using the established theoretical criterion it is possible to explain many physical consequences observed in the real world for example the established theoretical criterion has been successfully applied to explain the controlling mechanisms associated with three main different patterns of pore fluid flow channels which were observed in the laboratory experiments of reaction infiltration instability in fluid saturated carbonate rocks zhao et al 2013b golfier et al 2002 on the other hand since the theoretical criterion is established on the basis of using the related governing equations proposed in this study the successful explanation of the laboratory experimental results has demonstrated the correctness and usefulness of the proposed governing equations for simulating reaction infiltration instability problems in fluid saturated porous media with the established theoretical criterion as a theoretical guidance the related governing equations proposed in this study has also been applied to computationally simulate the evolution process of reaction infiltration instability in fluid saturated carbonate rocks zhao et al 2013a if readers are interested in the details of such an application please refer to the previously published paper zhao et al 2013a due to the versatility of the numerical method the computational simulation method which is based on the proposed governing equations in this study can be equally applied to simulate reaction infiltration instability problems in the real world since the main purpose of this study is focused on the theoretical aspect of the reaction infiltration instability problem the specific applications to the computational simulation of reaction infiltration instability problems in naturally formed reaction infiltration systems will be discussed in the future research 6 conclusions from the physical point of view there are only two independent variables in considering distance time and velocity once distance and time are selected as two independent variables velocity becomes a derivative variable based on this fundamental concept in physics there is a constraint condition between the mineral dissolution ratio γ and the dimensionless transport parameter h the neglect of this constraint condition is the main source leading to questionable conclusions in the recent debate ladd and szymczak 2017 in addition this constraint condition indicates that as the mineral dissolution ratio approaches zero i e γ 0 the dimensionless transport parameter h approaches infinity i e h automatically so that γ 0 and h in fact merge into one condition this fact not only demonstrates that the mineral dissolution ratio γ indeed plays a role in determining the degree of reactant penetration in the downstream region i e x 0 but also demonstrates that in the limit γ 0 the reactant concentration in the downstream of the dissolution front indeed vanishes in terms of establishing a criterion for assessing the instability of a dissolution front there are two different approaches in the first approach the zh number is considered as a given number e g zh 1 in the paper of chadam et al 1986 so that both the cutoff dimensionless wavenumber and the optimal dimensionless wavenumber can be determined for this given value of the zh number in the second approach the dimensionless wavenumber is considered as a given number e g m 1 in previous studies zhao et al 2010 2015 zhao 2014 so that the critical zh number can be determined for this given value of the dimensionless wavenumber therefore there is a significant difference between the work of zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b and the work of chadam et al 1986 however this significant difference was neglected in the debate ladd and szymczak 2017 in addition there is another significant difference between the work of zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b and the work of chadam et al 1986 in the former case the main focus is on the computational simulation aspects of morphological evolution of chemical dissolution fronts in supercritical chemical dissolution systems while in the later case the main focus is on the theoretical analysis aspects of instability of chemical dissolution fronts in critical chemical dissolution systems this significant difference was also ignored in the debate acknowledgements this work is financially supported by the natural science foundation of china grant no 11272359 the authors express their thanks to the anonymous

7395,reaction infiltration instability in which chemical reactions can dissolve minerals and therefore create preferential pore fluid flow channels in fluid saturated rocks may play an important role in controlling groundwater quality in groundwater hydrology although this topic has been studied for many years there is a recent debate which says that the use of large density asymptotics in the previous studies is invalid however there is a crucial conceptual mistake in this debate which leads to results and conclusions that are inconsistent with the fundamental laws of physics it is well known that in terms of distance time and velocity there are only two independent variables but they are treated as three independent variables a procedure that is the main source of the physically unrealistic results and conclusions in the debate in this paper we will discuss the results and conclusions related to the debate with emphasis on the issues leading to the corresponding errors in particular we demonstrate that there is an unappreciated constraint condition between the dimensional dimensionless distance time and velocity in the debate by using this constraint condition it can be confirmed that as the ratio of the reactant concentration in the incoming fluid stream to the mineral concentration approaches zero the dimensionless transport parameter h automatically approaches infinity therefore it is further confirmed that the previous work conducted by chadam and others remains valid keywords reaction infiltration instability chemical dissolution large density ratio front instability porous media 1 introduction reaction infiltration instability in which chemical reactions can dissolve minerals and therefore create preferential pore fluid flow channels in fluid saturated rocks may play an important role in controlling groundwater quality in groundwater hydrology imhoff et al 1996 2003 maji and sudicky 2008 miller et al 1990 seyedabbasi et al 2008 to solve this problem chadam et al 1986 conducted a seminal study by using large density asymptotics in which the density ratio γ of the reactant concentration in the incoming fluid stream c in to the mineral concentration c sol is approaching zero in their study chemical dissolution fronts were considered to propagate in the infinite space which is filled with fluid saturated rocks the following two main conclusions were drawn from their study 1 as the density ratio γ approaches zero the thickness of a chemical dissolution front also approaches zero leading to a sharp shape of the chemical dissolution front 2 for a given reaction infiltration system with a given inflow velocity in the fluid saturated rock a chemical dissolution front is unstable if the wavelength of an applied small perturbation is greater than the critical wavelength of the system due to the theoretical importance of this seminal study extensive theoretical analysis and computational simulations have been further followed in the past years ortoleva et al 1987a b ormond and ortoleva 2000 chen and liu 2002 2004 chen et al 2009 lai et al 2014 2016 in particular imhoff and miller extended the work of chadam et al 1986 to the theoretical study of non aqueous phase liquid napl dissolution instability in fluid saturated porous media imhoff and miller 1996 which plays an important role in removing napls from contaminated groundwater resources imhoff et al 1996 2003 maji and sudicky 2008 miller et al 1990 seyedabbasi et al 2008 however there is a recent debate ladd and szymczak 2017 to question the validity of using large density asymptotics in the work of chadam et al 1986 unfortunately there are serious mistakes that lead to questionable conclusions in the debate paper first the treatment of distance time and velocity as three independent variables violates the fundamental principle in physics this violation leads to a constraint condition between the density ratio γ and the dimensionless transport parameter h note that this density ratio χ is also called the mineral dissolution ratio in previous papers zhao et al 2010 zhao 2014 second the main conclusions in the debate paper are questionable actually we can use the related equations in the debate paper itself to demonstrate that the constraint condition between the mineral dissolution ratio γ and the dimensionless transport parameter h clearly requires that as γ 0 the accompanied condition of h must be automatically satisfied thus this fact not only demonstrates that γ indeed plays a role in determining the degree of reactant penetration in the downstream region but also demonstrates that in the limit of γ 0 the reactant concentration in the downstream of the front indeed vanishes in addition this fact can be further confirmed when a physically consistent set of dimensional dimensionless distance time and velocity are used to derive the dimensionless governing partial differential equations of the reaction infiltration instability problem in addition the criterion for a reaction infiltration instability derived by zhao and coworkers zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b is significantly different from that derived by chadam et al 1986 in reality there are two significantly different approaches to the establishment of a criterion for assessing the instability of a dissolution front when it propagates in a chemical dissolution system either with a given inflow velocity chadam et al 1986 or with a variable inflow velocity zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b unfortunately this significant difference was neglected in the debate ladd and szymczak 2017 in the former case the main focus is on the computational simulation aspects of morphological evolution of chemical dissolution fronts in supercritical chemical dissolution systems while in the later case the main focus is on the theoretical analysis aspects of instability of chemical dissolution fronts in critical chemical dissolution systems in the following sections we will address the above mentioned issues in detail to facilitate the following discussions the same definitions of the variables as those used in the debate ladd and szymczak 2017 are employed in this paper 2 the treatment of distance time and velocity as three independent variables leading to an unappreciated constraint condition between γ and h it is well known that for continuum mechanics problems in physics distance and time are two fundamentally independent variables while velocity and acceleration are derivative variables we will demonstrate what happens when this most common knowledge is violated in the section of asymptotic limits in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 toward this end we need to introduce the following equations involved to the reaction infiltration instability problem 1 r r v 0 d 2 v v v 0 c c c in 3 t t t d ks γ t where r and r are the dimensional and dimensionless distance vectors d is the constant diffusion coefficient of the fully dissolved matrix v 0 is the flow velocity in a uniform undissolved matrix v and v are the dimensional and dimensionless flow velocities k is the rate constant with a unit of m s c in is the reactant concentration in the incoming fluid stream c and c are the dimensional and dimensionless concentrations s is the constant surface area per unit volume of the undissolved mineral phase with a unit of 1 m t is the dimensional time with a unit of second t is the dimensionless time γ is the dimensionless ratio of the reactant concentration in the incoming fluid stream to the mineral concentration t d is the dissolution time scale with a unit of second the last two quantities are defined as follows 4 γ c in c sol 5 t d t r γ 1 ks γ where c sol is the mineral concentration t r is the reaction time scale with a unit of second and is defined in the following form 6 t r 1 ks note that eqs 1 3 are in correspondence to eqs 16 17 and 21 in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 respectively the detailed corresponding relationships between equations used in this paper and in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 can be found in table 1 by considering eqs 1 3 the following equation exists mathematically 7 d r d t v 0 ks γ d d r dt from fundamental definitions in physics we have the following relationships 8 v d r dt v d r d t substitution of eq 8 into eq 7 yields the following equation 9 v v 0 2 ks γ d v v 0 in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 the dimensionless transport parameter h is defined as follows 10 h dks v 0 2 substitution of eq 10 into eq 9 yields the following equation 11 v 1 γ h v v 0 it is straightforwardly concluded that the validity condition of the first expression i e v v v 0 in eq 2 can be described as follows 12 1 γ h 1 or γ h 1 clearly enough the constraint condition in eq 12 is directly contradictory to the quasi steady state condition which is derived and presented in eq 36 of the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 as follows 13 γ h 1 3 the main conclusions in the debate are questionable in the section of conclusions in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 there is a paragraph which says that we have offered a critical review of the reaction infiltration instability pointing out two significant misconceptions that have arisen from hidden assumptions in the asymptotic analysis first that the mineral dissolution ratio γ plays a role in determining the degree of reactant penetration second that in the limit γ 0 the reactant concentration downstream of the front vanishes chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a chadam et al 1988 chadam and ortoleva 1990 zhao et al 2008 2010 2013a 2014 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2015 both these statements are incorrect eqs 27 and 30 show that the mineral dissolution ratio γ plays no role in determining the quasi stationary concentration profile in particular the downstream concentration only vanishes when h 1 let us prove why the main conclusions in the debate are questionable below for this purpose we need to reconsider eqs 22 24 in the debate paper as follows 14 γ h φ t v 0 15 γ h φ c t v c 2 c h c θ φ 1 φ 16 φ t c θ φ 1 φ where θ φ 1 φ is the heaviside function φ is the matrix porosity φ 1 is the porosity of the fully dissolved matrix other quantities have the same meanings as those defined previously the heaviside function has the following definition 17 θ x 0 x 0 18 θ x 1 x 0 substitution of the constraint condition in eq 12 into eqs 14 and 15 yields the following equations 19 φ t v 0 20 φ c t v c 2 c 1 γ c θ φ 1 φ eq 20 indicates that as γ 0 the last term in the right hand side of this equation approaches infinity so that it becomes the predominant term in this equation to ensure that eq 20 makes sense physically the following condition should hold mathematically 21 c θ φ 1 φ 0 this clearly demonstrates that eq 21 can be mathematically valid if the following two cases are true 1 c 0 in the whole analytical domain 2 the whole analytical domain can be divided into two parts an upstream domain i e in the region of x 0 in which θ φ 1 φ 0 i e φ φ 1 physically meaning that the dissolvable minerals of the matrix are fully dissolved and a downstream domain i e in the region of x 0 in which c 0 meaning that no chemical dissolution takes place in this region since the first case is scientifically insignificant we only consider the second case hereafter the scientific problem associated with this second case which is commonly called the stefan problem has been studied theoretically and computationally for many years chadam et al 1986 1988 ortoleva et al 1987a b chadam and ortoleva 1990 ormond and ortoleva 2000 chen and liu 2002 2004 zhao et al 2008 2010 2013a b chen et al 2009 zhao 2014 lai et al 2014 2016 zhao et al 2015 in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 the reason for this phenomenon was also explained as follows more precisely as h the gradients of c must become ever steeper in order to balance the term h c the penetration length into the matrix becomes vanishingly small in comparison to the concentration length scale in the upstream region the quasi stationary thin front limit described by chadam et al 1986 therefore involves two sequential limiting steps first γ 0 then h the mathematical validity condition of eq 21 demonstrates that as γ 0 the dissolution front which is represented by the porosity profile at the interface between the upstream region and the downstream region is sharp this fact not only demonstrates that the mineral dissolution ratio γ indeed plays a role in determining the degree of reactant penetration in the downstream region i e x 0 but also demonstrates that in the limit γ 0 the reactant concentration in the downstream of the front indeed vanishes in addition the constraint condition in eq 12 clearly demonstrates that as γ 0 the accompanied condition of h can be automatically satisfied thus it can be concluded that the related conclusions drawn from the previous work see chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a chadam et al 1988 chadam and ortoleva 1990 zhao et al 2008 2010 2013a 2014 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2015 are correct while the main conclusions stated in the debate are questionable it is interesting to demonstrate that if a physically consistent set of dimensional dimensionless distance time and velocity are used then we can just use the mineral dissolution ratio γ alone to derive the dimensionless governing partial differential equations of the reaction infiltration instability problem for this purpose we need to reconsider the dimensional governing partial differential equations of the problem i e eqs 1 3 in the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 as follows 22 φ t v 0 23 φ c t v c d i c ksc θ φ 1 φ 24 c sol φ t ksc θ φ 1 φ where c sol is the mineral concentration i is a unity matrix we can first define the following two independent variables for both the dimensionless distance vector and the dimensionless time 25 r ks γ d r 26 t t t d ks γ t then we can use eqs 25 and 26 to derive the dimensionless velocity vector below 27 d r d t 1 ks γ d d r dt this equation can be straightforwardly written as 28 v 1 ks γ d v v v v ks γ d it is obvious that since v is a derived velocity scale the fundamental principle in physics which was violated by using an independent velocity scale v 0 in the debate ladd and szymczak 2017 can now be satisfied by using the above mentioned dimensionless variables and the dimensionless concentration defined in eq 2 we can obtain the dimensionless governing partial differential equations of the reaction infiltration instability problem as follows 29 φ t v 0 30 φ c t v c 2 c 1 γ c θ φ 1 φ 31 φ t c θ φ 1 φ eqs 29 31 clearly demonstrate that when a physically consistent set of dimensional dimensionless distance time and velocity are used the term of γ h automatically disappears in the dimensionless governing partial differential equations of the reaction infiltration instability problem this indicates that although there are two distinct velocities as a result of using two different time scales only one time scale should be used in the process of deriving the dimensionless governing partial differential equations when two different time scales are simultaneously used it can cause an inconsistency of time scale in the dimensionless governing partial differential equations if we compare eqs 14 and 15 with eqs 29 and 30 then we can find that it is the physical inconsistency that leads to the constraint condition of γ h 1 which needs to be applied to get eqs 14 and 15 corrected specifically in the debate ladd and szymczak 2017 this physical inconsistency is caused by using distance time and velocity as three independent variables to derive the dimensionless governing partial differential equations of the reaction infiltration instability problem thus the treatment of distance time and velocity as three independent variables is equivalent to the use of two different time scales simultaneously in the dimensionless governing partial differential equations 4 two different approaches for dealing with reaction infiltration instability problems in the conclusion section of the debate paper ladd and szymczak 2017 there is a statement which says that attempts to extend the thin front stability analysis to finite reaction rates zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b do not lead to new results see section 5 but only repeat previous calculations chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a b in a different scaling however because two different approaches were used there are two significant differences between the work of zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b and the work of chadam et al 1986 and ortoleva et al 1987a b as explained in detail below from the previous work chadam et al 1986 zhao 2014 the dimensionless growth rate of a small perturbation can be expressed as follows 32 ω m zh zh 1 γ φ 1 φ 0 zh zh 2 4 m 2 1 γ m where 33 γ k φ 0 k φ 1 and m is the dimensionless wavenumber of the small perturbation ω m zh is the dimensionless growth rate of the small perturbation k φ 0 is the permeability of the porous rock ahead of the dissolution front that is represented by the porosity profile k φ 1 is the permeability of the porous rock behind of the dissolution front φ 0 is the uniform porosity of the undissolved material zh is a dimensionless parameter since ω m zh is a function of the dimensionless wavenumber i e m and the dimensionless parameter zh it is interesting to investigate 1 how ω m zh varies with m for a given value of zh and 2 how ω m zh varies with zh for a given value of m these two cases can lead to two different approaches for dealing with reaction infiltration instability problems for the purpose of illustrating these two different approaches we need specific values for parameters φ 0 φ 1 and γ if the initial porosity φ 0 and the final porosity φ 1 are assumed to be 0 1 and 0 2 respectively then we can use the commonly used kozeny carman formula carman 1956 to determine the value of parameter γ in eq 33 as a result the value of parameter γ is equal to 0 0988 to investigate the general behavior of dissolution front instability in the first case which was considered by chadam et al 1986 fig 1 shows how the dimensionless growth rate varies with the dimensionless wavenumber due to different zh numbers in the chemical dissolution system it is noted that for a given value of the zh number there is a maximum value i e a cutoff value of the dimensionless wavenumber beyond which the dimensionless growth rate is smaller than zero so that the dissolution front is stable when it propagates in the chemical dissolution system since the analytical domain is a full space of infinite extension there is also an optimal value of the dimensionless wavenumber at which the dimensionless growth rate reaches its maximum value so that the dissolution front becomes most unstable when it propagates in the chemical dissolution system on the other hand it can be also observed that when the zh number increases both the cutoff dimensionless wavenumber and the optimal dimensionless wavenumber increase accordingly however it should be pointed out that as a typical example of the first case chadam et al 1986 only considered a specific situation of zh 1 0 in their paper this means that the inflow velocity is prescribed as a given constant in the reaction infiltration system considered by them chadam et al 1986 if we substitute zh 1 0 into eq 32 then we can obtain the same results for both the cutoff dimensionless wavenumber and the optimal dimensionless wavenumber as follows 34 m cutoff 2 1 γ 3 2 γ γ 2 35 m optimal 1 γ 2 3 2 γ γ 2 where m cutoff is the cutoff dimensionless wavenumber in the case of zh 1 0 m optimal is the optimal dimensionless wavenumber associated with zh 1 0 similarly to investigate the general behavior of dissolution front instability in the second case which was considered by zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b fig 2 shows how the dimensionless growth rate varies with the zh number due to different dimensionless wavenumbers in the chemical dissolution system in this case for a given value of the dimensionless wavenumber there is a minimum value i e a critical value of the zh number beyond which the dimensionless growth rate is not only greater than zero but increases monotonically as well therefore it is possible to establish the following criteria 1 if the zh number is smaller than the corresponding critical zh number then the dissolution front is in a stable state 2 if the zh number is equal to the corresponding critical zh number then the dissolution front is in a neutral state and 3 if the zh number is greater than the corresponding critical zh number then the dissolution front is in an unstable state this is the basic reason for using the critical zh number instead of the dimensionless wavenumber to establish a criterion for assessing the instability of a dissolution front because chadam et al 1986 did not consider the second case at all there is clearly a significant difference between the work of zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b and the work of chadam et al 1986 since the thickness of a horizontal stratum within the upper crust of the earth is a finite value it is desirable to establish a criterion associated with the second case to judge the instability of a dissolution front when it propagates in a horizontal stratum for instance when the in situ leaching method is used in mining engineering it is necessary to determine the maximum horizontal velocity of the injected fluid in the horizontal stratum so that the dissolution front can maintain stability as it propagates because the zh number is directly proportional to the horizontal velocity of the injected fluid zhao et al 2010 2015 the criterion associated with the second case can be used to determine the maximum horizontal velocity of the injected fluid which corresponds to the critical zh number zh critical with m 1 0 taken as an example we can obtain the corresponding critical zh number from eq 32 as follows 36 zh critical 3 2 γ γ 2 2 1 γ consequently the criterion associated with the fundamental mode i e the mode with m 1 0 of a dissolution front can be straightforwardly expressed as 37 zh zh critical 3 2 γ γ 2 2 1 γ this means that eq 37 is only valid for the fundamental mode with m 1 0 incidentally this criterion can be employed to design a computational model which is used to simulate the instability of a dissolution front in a fluid saturated porous medium for example if the dimensionless thickness in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the injected fluid flow of a computational model is slightly 3 1416 then we can use eq 37 to judge whether the single finger mode which is associated with the fundamental mode takes place in the computational model this is the reason why we commonly used the dimensionless thickness width of 5 in previous simulations zhao et al 2008 2010 2015 zhao 2014 the current status of research shows that in some special cases analytical solutions for the instability of a dissolution front in the fluid saturated porous medium can be obtained when the chemical dissolution system is either subcritical or critical chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a b but it is impossible to obtain analytical solutions for describing the evolution process of a dissolution front when the chemical dissolution system is supercritical zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b even for some special cases chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a b therefore it is necessary to develop and use computational methods to obtain numerical solutions for describing the morphological evolution of a dissolution front in supercritical chemical dissolution systems through using the computational methods many important factors which were not considered in the previous work chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a b have been considered including the morphological evolution of chemical dissolution fronts in supercritical chemical dissolution systems for example reactive surface areas associated with different particle shapes zhao et al 2007 mineral dissolution ratios zhao et al 2010 permeability porosity functions lai et al 2014 and medium permeability anisotropy lai et al 2016 have been considered for supercritical chemical dissolution systems consequently many useful conclusions have been drawn from the computational simulations zhao et al 2007 2010 lai et al 2014 2016 this fact indicates that there is another significant difference between the work of zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b and the work of chadam et al 1986 in the former case the main focus is on the computational simulation aspects of morphological evolution of chemical dissolution fronts in supercritical chemical dissolution systems while in the later case the main focus is on the theoretical analysis aspects of instability of chemical dissolution fronts in critical chemical dissolution systems 5 application background and examples since reaction infiltration instability can play a controlling role in determining pore fluid flow patterns through creating preferential pore fluid flow channels in fluid saturated rocks soils it has broad application background in a number of scientific and engineering fields for instance in the field of hydrology reaction infiltration instability may significantly affect groundwater quality imhoff et al 1996 2003 maji and sudicky 2008 miller et al 1990 seyedabbasi et al 2008 in particular it can be employed to remove toxic materials such as nonaqueous phase liquids from contaminated land sites zhao et al 2012 in the field of geology not only can reaction infiltration instability be used to reveal the dynamic mechanism of karst formations but also it can be employed to better understand the ore forming mechanisms within the upper crust of the earth ortoleva et al 1987a b ormond and ortoleva 2000 chen and liu 2002 2004 chen et al 2009 lai et al 2014 2016 in the field of petroleum engineering reaction infiltration instability can be used to increase the oil production through injecting hydrochloric acid into carbonate rocks in the surroundings of drilling wells fredd and fogler 1998 golfier et al 2002 panga et al 2005 kalia and balakotaiah 2007 2009 cohen et al 2008 despite the fact that reaction infiltration instability has broad application background in a number of scientific and engineering fields the key issue associated with the application of this phenomenon is to establish a theoretical criterion which can be effectively used to judge whether or not a chemical dissolution front is unstable in the reaction infiltration system due to the approximate nature of any numerical methods it is impossible to use computational simulation results to establish such a theoretical criterion although computational simulation results can be used to display the evolution process of a chemical dissolution front in the reaction infiltration system this is the main reason why great efforts have been made over past years for conducting theoretical studies on reaction infiltration instability in fluid saturated porous media chadam et al 1986 ortoleva et al 1987a chadam et al 1988 chadam and ortoleva 1990 zhao et al 2008 2010 2013a 2014 zhao 2014 zhao et al 2015 by means of using the established theoretical criterion it is possible to explain many physical consequences observed in the real world for example the established theoretical criterion has been successfully applied to explain the controlling mechanisms associated with three main different patterns of pore fluid flow channels which were observed in the laboratory experiments of reaction infiltration instability in fluid saturated carbonate rocks zhao et al 2013b golfier et al 2002 on the other hand since the theoretical criterion is established on the basis of using the related governing equations proposed in this study the successful explanation of the laboratory experimental results has demonstrated the correctness and usefulness of the proposed governing equations for simulating reaction infiltration instability problems in fluid saturated porous media with the established theoretical criterion as a theoretical guidance the related governing equations proposed in this study has also been applied to computationally simulate the evolution process of reaction infiltration instability in fluid saturated carbonate rocks zhao et al 2013a if readers are interested in the details of such an application please refer to the previously published paper zhao et al 2013a due to the versatility of the numerical method the computational simulation method which is based on the proposed governing equations in this study can be equally applied to simulate reaction infiltration instability problems in the real world since the main purpose of this study is focused on the theoretical aspect of the reaction infiltration instability problem the specific applications to the computational simulation of reaction infiltration instability problems in naturally formed reaction infiltration systems will be discussed in the future research 6 conclusions from the physical point of view there are only two independent variables in considering distance time and velocity once distance and time are selected as two independent variables velocity becomes a derivative variable based on this fundamental concept in physics there is a constraint condition between the mineral dissolution ratio γ and the dimensionless transport parameter h the neglect of this constraint condition is the main source leading to questionable conclusions in the recent debate ladd and szymczak 2017 in addition this constraint condition indicates that as the mineral dissolution ratio approaches zero i e γ 0 the dimensionless transport parameter h approaches infinity i e h automatically so that γ 0 and h in fact merge into one condition this fact not only demonstrates that the mineral dissolution ratio γ indeed plays a role in determining the degree of reactant penetration in the downstream region i e x 0 but also demonstrates that in the limit γ 0 the reactant concentration in the downstream of the dissolution front indeed vanishes in terms of establishing a criterion for assessing the instability of a dissolution front there are two different approaches in the first approach the zh number is considered as a given number e g zh 1 in the paper of chadam et al 1986 so that both the cutoff dimensionless wavenumber and the optimal dimensionless wavenumber can be determined for this given value of the zh number in the second approach the dimensionless wavenumber is considered as a given number e g m 1 in previous studies zhao et al 2010 2015 zhao 2014 so that the critical zh number can be determined for this given value of the dimensionless wavenumber therefore there is a significant difference between the work of zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b and the work of chadam et al 1986 however this significant difference was neglected in the debate ladd and szymczak 2017 in addition there is another significant difference between the work of zhao et al 2007 2008 2010 2013b and the work of chadam et al 1986 in the former case the main focus is on the computational simulation aspects of morphological evolution of chemical dissolution fronts in supercritical chemical dissolution systems while in the later case the main focus is on the theoretical analysis aspects of instability of chemical dissolution fronts in critical chemical dissolution systems this significant difference was also ignored in the debate acknowledgements this work is financially supported by the natural science foundation of china grant no 11272359 the authors express their thanks to the anonymous

7396,in this study we propose an approach based on the residual based bootstrap method to obtain valid prediction intervals using monthly short term three months and mid term six months drought observations the effects of north atlantic and arctic oscillation indexes on the constructed prediction intervals are also examined performance of the proposed approach is evaluated for the palmer drought severity index pdsi obtained from konya closed basin located in central anatolia turkey the finite sample properties of the proposed method are further illustrated by an extensive simulation study our results revealed that the proposed approach is capable of producing valid prediction intervals for future pdsi values keywords bootstrap drought konya basin pdsi prediction 1 introduction drought is a temporary and recurring meteorological event originating from the lack of precipitation over an extended period of time early indications of droughts can provide valuable information to help mitigate some of its consequences of drought for instance decision makers may plan and manage the water resource systems accordingly in arid and semi arid regions drought has negative effects on the crops and may be reduced by storing sufficient water from available sources hence it is important to forecast the drought duration in the crop growing season the success of drought preparedness and mitigation depends upon timely information on the drought onset and development in time mehr et al 2014 which can be obtained through continuous drought monitoring using common indices over a region many drought indices have been developed for monitoring and examining meteorological droughts the intensity and spatial extent of droughts are generally quantied by drought indices among others the palmer drought severity index pdsi providing a standardized measurement of moisture conditions to compare between locations and over time is widely adopted it uses readily available temperature and precipitation data to estimate relative dryness and has been reasonably successful at quantifying long term drought as it uses temperature data and a physical water balance model it can capture the basic effect of global warming on drought through changes in potential evapotranspiration for these reasons we selected the pdsi as a drought indicator in this study we also used north atlantic oscillation index naoi and arctic oscillation index aoi as exogenous variables since drought events to some extent are linked to large scale atmosphere and ocean interactions even in the mid latitude regions in addition the intensity and spatial extent of droughts are generally quantified by drought indices mehr et al 2014 used el nino southern oscillation enso indices as an indicator for drought forecasting ozger et al 2014 also used the enso index for drought forecasting by using a wavelet and fuzzy logic combination model a striking finding from these studies is that the enso index has strong potential effect in drought forecasting drought forecast is an important problem and thus has received great attention in the literature mishra and desai 2005 2006 kim and valdes 2003 morid et al 2007 and belayneh et al 2014 presented an excellent overview of research on drought forecasting however those works only consider point forecasts even though prediction intervals provide better inferences taking into account uncertainty in the model technically construction of such prediction intervals requires some distributional assumptions which are generally unknown in practice moreover the constructed prediction intervals along with the estimated parameter values can be affected due to any departure from the assumptions and may lead us to unreliable results one remedy to construct prediction intervals without considering distributional assumptions is to apply the well known resampling methods such as the bootstrap it is known that the original nonparametric bootstrap proposed by efron 1979 fails to provide satisfactory answers to general statistical inference problems for dependent data since the assumption of independently and identically distributed i i d data is violated as a way to deal with dependent data several types of resampling techniques including residual based bootstrap method have been proposed in this technique the residuals obtained from the original dataset by fitting some general models such as linear regression autoregression or nonparametric regression models are resampled to obtain the bootstrap sample of the data for more information see freedman 1981 efron and tibshirani 1986 liu 1988 and hardle and bowman 1988 in this paper we used the residual based bootstrap method to obtain valid prediction intervals for future pdsi values it works in summary as follows first the least squares ls method is used to obtain the model parameters and the residuals are calculated then the bootstrap method is applied to the data to obtain the bootstrap sample of the original data points which are used to calculate the bootstrap estimators of the ls coefficients finally the future values are obtained by means of bootstrap replicates and quantiles of the monte carlo estimates of the bootstrap distribution the rest of the paper is organized as follows we describe the data in section 2 in section 3 we provide a detailed information on the bootstrap method used in this study the data is analysed and the results are presented in section 4 the simulation study results are presented in section 5 followed by some concluding remarks in section 6 2 study area and data the pdsi estimates duration and intensity of drought events by measuring departure of the moisture supply based on a supply and demand concept of the water balance equation it incorporates precipitation and temperature data and local available water content of the soil from an unspecified period that best corresponds to past 9 12 months past conditions are incorporated because long term drought is cumulative so the intensity of drought at a particular time is dependent on the current conditions plus the cumulative patterns of previous months from the inputs all the basic terms of the water balance equation are determined including evapotranspiration soil recharge runoff and moisture loss from the surface layer hayes 2007 the equations are described in palmer s original study 1965 and in the more recent analysis by alley 1984 by accounting for moisture conditions in the past the pdsi estimates when a drought or wet spell begins ends and the duration of the event palmer 1965 alley 1984 table 1 provides a drought classification based on pdsi the primary benefit of the pdsi is identified by alley 1984 as it provides decision makers with a measurement of the abnormality of recent weather events for a region and places current conditions in a historical perspective it also provides spatial and temporal representations of historical droughts it is most effective at measuring impacts sensitive to soil moisture conditions such as agriculture moreover it has also been useful as a drought monitoring tool and been used to trigger actions associated with drought contingency plans the monthly pdsi data which consists of 552 observations were obtained starting from january 1970 and ending on december 2015 konya closed basin is located between 36 51 and 39 29 north latitudes and 31 36 and 34 52 east longitudes in central anatolia region of turkey its surface area is roughly 54 000 km2 and it constitutes approximately 7 of turkey fig 1 basin s altitude varies from 900 m to 3534 m the basin is surrounded by sakarya and kızılırmak basins in the north kızılırmak and seyhan basins in the east eastern mediterranean basin in the south antalya and akarcay basins in the west the basin is surrounded with the city centers of konya karaman aksaray nigde isparta ankara nevsehir and antalya cities the konya closed basin is at the top of the regions with the lowest annual rainfall in turkey total annual precipitation in the basin ranges from 286 mm to 740 mm it is known that the drought that has occurred in this arid semi arid climate has very serious socio economic effects agricultural practices with wild irrigation unrecorded water wells loss of function of natural wetlands due to the lack of long term conservation strategies decline of groundwater level loss of habitat and soil salinization constitute the main problems of the basin the information about the stations in konya basin used in the study is shown in table 2 the climate indexes data from 1970 to 2015 were obtained from noaa earth system research laboratory naoi is based on the surface sea level pressure difference between the subtropical azores high and the subpolar low the arctic oscillation ao is a large scale mode of climate variability also referred to as the northern hemisphere annular mode it is the result of the coupling between the stratospheric polar vortex and tropospheric circulation decastro et al 2006 fluctuation in the ao creates a seesaw pattern in which atmospheric pressure at the northern polar and middle latitudes alternates between positive and negative phases these atmospheric oscillation index values were obtained from the climate prediction center cpc at the national center of environmental prediction ncep www cpc noaa gov 2 1 exploratory data analysis the seasonal trend decomposition plots of the pdsi series are presented in fig 2 which includes the plots of the raw data seasonal trend and remainder components for each pdsi series fig 2 intuitively shows that the seasonality and trend are not presented in all pdsi series we checked the stationary condition of the pdsi values by applying ljung box lb and augmented dickey fuller adf t statistic tests and small p values p value 0 000 for the lb test and p value 0 010 for the adf test reject the null hypothesis against

seasonality of the pdsi series the log likelihood values were calculated from the selected exponential smoothing and an additional seasonal term added models and the calculated p value 1 000 suggests that the seasonal component is not significant autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf plots of the pdsi series are given in figs 3 and 4 respectively the time series plots and acf pacf plots suggest that the autoregressive ar model could be appropriate to model the pdsi series to find the optimal lag we defined many possible subsets of the ar p models with different p values to choose the best model we used akaike information criterion aic since it is proposed to determine the best model for forecasting and the results show that ar 1 model is optimal according to aic for all the pdsi series the quantile quantile plots of data based vs fitted pdsi values obtained by ar 1 model are presented in fig 5 it is clear from these figures that the data based and fitted pdsi series come from populations with a common distribution in other words the pdsi series are well fitted by ar 1 model for all the stations 3 methodology let x t t 1 n be a sequence of stationary random variables from an ar 1 process then the autoregressive model of order 1 considered in this paper is defined by 1 x t ϕ 0 ϕ 1 x t 1 t t 1 n where ϕ z 1 ϕ 1 z 0 for z 1 t is a sequence of i i d random variables with zero mean and unit variance and ϕ 0 and ϕ 1 are the model parameters for a realization of ar 1 process x 0 x 1 x n let x t 1 x t 1 for t 1 2 n let also y x 1 x 2 x n 1 n and x 1 x 0 1 x 1 1 x n 1 x 1 x 2 x n so that we have y x ϕ then the ls estimator of ϕ ϕ is obtained as in eq 2 2 ϕ x x 1 x y for autoregressive time series models the bootstrap method is one of the most general tools to approximate the properties of estimators without requiring the full knowledge of the underlying data and distributional assumptions let x t t 1 n be a sequence of stationary dependent random variables of size n having an unknown common distribution function f whose parameter θ 0 g μ is of our interest where g r d r is a smooth function we further assume that the distribution has a finite mean μ and a finite variance σ 2 both unknown let θ n g x n x n n 1 i 1 n x i be the estimator of θ 0 based on χ n then the bootstrap estimator of θ n is obtained by θ n g x n where x n n 1 i 1 n x i is calculated from the bootstrap sample χ n x t t 1 n the bootstrap sample x t t 1 n is obtained by sampling x t t 1 n randomly with replacement it is important to note that the smooth function model is a flexible model that allows us to obtain the strong consistency properties of the bootstrap estimators and it contains many types of smooth estimators the main idea behind this model is that if the statistics of interest are represented by the function of mean such as variance kurtosis skewness etc then one can show the theoretical properties of the bootstrap estimators by using the smooth function of means model for detailed information on the smooth functions of means model please see hall 1992 let x t and x n h be the fitted value of x t and h step

see pan and politis 2016 and references therein for detailed information about bootstrap prediction intervals for autoregressive time series models let h 1 s s 1 be defined as the lead time then the complete algorithm used in this study to construct prediction interval for ar 1 model is as follows step 1 obtain the ls estimators ϕ by using eq 2 step 2 calculate the fitted residuals as t x t x t where x t ϕ 0 ϕ 1 x t 1 for t 2 n step 3 center the fitted residuals as r t t for t 2 n where n 1 1 t 2 n t let f n represent the empirical distribution function of r t step 4 construct bootstrap residuals t t 1 i i d with replacement from f n step 5 calculate the bootstrap observations x t as follows x t ϕ 0 ϕ 1 x t 1 t t 2 n where x 1 is chosen at random from y in practice to ensure stationarity of the generated bootstrap series n m bootstrap observations are generated for some large positive m and the first m observations are discarded step 6 compute the ls estimators of ar 1 coefficients based on the bootstrapped data obtained in step 5 ϕ 0 and ϕ 1 by using eq 2 step 7 obtain the future bootstrap predicted values by using recursion formula given below x n t ϕ 0 ϕ 1 x n t 1 t 1 h where x n t 1 x n t 1 when t 1 step 8 generate the future bootstrap observations as follows x n t ϕ 0 ϕ 1 x n t 1 n t t 1 h where x n t 1 x n t 1 when t 1 step 9 calculate the bootstrap root replicate x n h x n h step 10 repeat steps 4 9 b times where b denotes the number of bootstrap simulation for each h let q α represents the α th quantile of the constructed distribution of the bootstrap root replicates then the 100 1 α bootstrap prediction interval for x n h is calculated as in eq 6 given below 6 x n h q α 2 x n h q 1 α 2 where x n h ϕ 0 ϕ 1 x n t 1 for t 1 h and x n t 1 x n t 1 when t 1 we used the oscillation indexes mentioned in sections 1 and 2 as predictors in the ar model to see their effects on the constructed prediction intervals for future observations to this end we used the following autoregressive with exogenous terms arx 1 model 7 x t ϕ 0 ϕ 1 x t 1 γ f t 1 t t 1 n where f t 1 represents an v u vector of exogenous variables as discussed by goncalves and perron 2016 the forecasting algorithm based on iteration has the drawback of requiring forecasts of the future values of the predictors hence we used a direct approach which overcomes this difficulty in this context we considered the following arx model 8 x t ϕ 0 ϕ 1 x t h γ f t h t t h n which can be estimated by the ls method the recursion formula to obtain point forecasts by this method is expressed as x n h ϕ 0 ϕ 1 x n γ f n as discussed by goncalves and perron 2016 and goncalves et al 2017 the regression errors t will generally be serially correlated to order h 1 when forecasting h 1 this serial correlation affects the distribution of the estimated parameters goncalves et al 2017 modify the resampling algorithm by drawing using the block wild bootstrap to make it robust to serial correlation to this end they divide the sample residuals t h into non overlapping blocks of b consecutive observations where the block length is set to h when h 1 then the bootstrap errors are generated as 9 i j 1 b i j 1 b η j for j 1 t h b i h 1 h b and η j i i d 0 1 we note that all the calculations in this study are performed under the assumption that the considered model forms are correct 4 results to obtain out of sample prediction intervals described in section 2 we divide each time series into the following two parts i the first part consisting of a length spanning from january 1970 to december 2013 a total of 528 observations on which the model construction will be based to calculate 24 steps ahead monthly 8 steps ahead mid term and 4 steps ahead short term predictions ii and the second part containing the period january 2014 december 2015 at which comparison with the observed values will be made for each series b 1000 bootstrap simulations were performed and we set the significance level α 0 05 to obtain 95 bootstrap prediction intervals for future pdsi values the calculations were carried out using r 3 3 3 the constructed prediction intervals for monthly short term and mid term drought pdsi observations together with the data based values are presented in figs 6 8 respectively our findings showed that the bootstrap method with ar 1 and arx 1 models resulted in reasonable prediction intervals for future pdsi values so that almost all such values are well covered by the constructed prediction intervals we might conclude that the bootstrap method produces narrower prediction intervals for the short term forecasts compared to those constructed for long term forecasts this is because the latter is expected to contain more uncertain table 3 presents the estimated coefficients of the oscillation indices and their p values the p values with denote the significant oscillation index for the corresponding station it is obvious that the effects of ao are statistically significant only for aksaray station similarly the effects of nao are also significant for karaman and seydisehir stations the overall result suggests that the ao and nao indexes do not play a crucial role for the monthly pdsi values in konya basin since the prediction intervals constructed by oscillation indices are not significantly different from the intervals obtained by using only ar 1 model on the other hand the significant effects of the oscillation indexes can be readily seen in the short term and mid term forecast in karaman station see figs 7 and 8 we may speculate that the future short term and mid term drought values fluctuate in a increasing manner with time and even becomes more evident like a form of linear trend appearance as we move to larger scale drought duration it is worthwhile to note that the bootstrap prediction intervals seem to be self adjusted to exhibit similar behavior having imbedded effects of the oscillation indexes 5 simulation analysis results we performed a simulation study to compare the performances of the bootstrap prediction intervals constructed through the ar 1 and arx 1 models this comparison was made through the coverage probability length of prediction intervals and their estimated standard errors se the significance level α is set to 0 05 to obtain 95 prediction intervals for future values the simulation set up is as follows step 1 generate a synthetic data set as in eq 10 10 x t ϕ 0 ϕ 1 x t 1 γ f t 1 t t 1 n where ϕ 0 0 ϕ 1 0 5 γ 0 05 0 2 with 0 05 increment and n 250 the error terms follow t n 0 1 distribution and we consider only one exogenous variable so that f t 1 is an n 1 vector of exogenous variable step 2 generate r 1000 future values x n h for h 1 24 step 3 calculate the bootstrap root replicate x n h b x n h b for h 1 24 and b 1 b then estimate the coverage probabilities of bootstrap prediction intervals for x n h as 1 r r 1 r 1 x n h q α 2 x n h x n h q 1 α 2 where q α and 1 represent the α th quantile of the constructed distribution of the bootstrap root replicates and the indicator function respectively the corresponding interval lengths are calculated by x n h q 1 α 2 x n h q α 2 step 4 repeat steps 1 3 mc 1000 where mc represents the number of monte carlo simulations times to calculate the average values and standard errors of the coverage probabilities and interval lengths the resuls are presented in fig 9 indicating that the bootstrap prediction intervals obtained by ar 1 and arx 1 models tend to have similar performances both prediction intervals have a coverage probability close to nominal level 95 the only difference between the constructed bootstrap prediction intervals is the estimated standard errors of interval lengths they have due to the effect of exogenous variable arx 1 model produces more variant interval lengths compared to ar 1 model 6 discussion and conclusions in this study we proposed the residual bootstrap method to construct prediction intervals for future pdsi based drought observations using autoregressive time series models from a hydroclimatological standpoint we also attempted to explore possible effects of the both north atlantic and arctic oscillations using their representative index on the constructed prediction intervals all the numerical analysis considered in this study approved that the bootstrap method resulted in valid prediction intervals for future pdsi values the interval lengths came out to be considerably narrower for the short term forecast than those of long term forecasts in this sense consideration of short term forecasts such as three months may be more reasonable for drought management if it does not require for longer term for some reason we can find this emphasis in the study by ozger et al 2014 who pointed out that most models forecast droughts with high accuracy for short lead times less than 3 months and did not yield satisfactory forecasts for 6 12 months belayneh and adamowski 2012 stated that short term drought forecasting is useful for monitoring the effects of drought on agricultural systems and is essential for the management of water resources however long term drought forecasting helps to understand the regional behavior of drought although the both oscillation indexes did not exhibit a notable effect on the prediction intervals whose fluctuation characteristics are thought to be consistent with that of future pdsi values as a matter of fact it did not come to surprise since a number of previous studies have shown the relation between nao and or ao and climate hydrological surface variables in many ways among others kucuk et al 2009 for lake levels sarlak et al 2005 meshram et al 2017 for drought moreover karabork et al 2005 showed that simultaneous and lag cross correlation analyses showed that precipitation stream flow maximum temperature and minimum temperature patterns over turkey have significant negative correlations with the naoi the physical mechanisms behind such teleconnection associated with nao were well documented in the last two decades for example the nao related temperature patterns are essentially controlled by the advection of heat through the anomalous mean flow characterized by the surface wind field trigo et al 2002 who carried out a multivariate analysis of the influence of the nao over the climatology of north atlantic and european sectors using the ncep reanalysis data set introduced an additional mechanism i e the modulation of short wave and long wave radiation by cloud cover variations in connection with the nao in order to explain the patterns of daily maximum and minimum temperatures afterward the performances of the bootstrap methods could be further studied for other drought indices and our approach here can also be used in other meteorological hydrological areas where the prediction is important acknowledgements we thank

7396,in this study we propose an approach based on the residual based bootstrap method to obtain valid prediction intervals using monthly short term three months and mid term six months drought observations the effects of north atlantic and arctic oscillation indexes on the constructed prediction intervals are also examined performance of the proposed approach is evaluated for the palmer drought severity index pdsi obtained from konya closed basin located in central anatolia turkey the finite sample properties of the proposed method are further illustrated by an extensive simulation study our results revealed that the proposed approach is capable of producing valid prediction intervals for future pdsi values keywords bootstrap drought konya basin pdsi prediction 1 introduction drought is a temporary and recurring meteorological event originating from the lack of precipitation over an extended period of time early indications of droughts can provide valuable information to help mitigate some of its consequences of drought for instance decision makers may plan and manage the water resource systems accordingly in arid and semi arid regions drought has negative effects on the crops and may be reduced by storing sufficient water from available sources hence it is important to forecast the drought duration in the crop growing season the success of drought preparedness and mitigation depends upon timely information on the drought onset and development in time mehr et al 2014 which can be obtained through continuous drought monitoring using common indices over a region many drought indices have been developed for monitoring and examining meteorological droughts the intensity and spatial extent of droughts are generally quantied by drought indices among others the palmer drought severity index pdsi providing a standardized measurement of moisture conditions to compare between locations and over time is widely adopted it uses readily available temperature and precipitation data to estimate relative dryness and has been reasonably successful at quantifying long term drought as it uses temperature data and a physical water balance model it can capture the basic effect of global warming on drought through changes in potential evapotranspiration for these reasons we selected the pdsi as a drought indicator in this study we also used north atlantic oscillation index naoi and arctic oscillation index aoi as exogenous variables since drought events to some extent are linked to large scale atmosphere and ocean interactions even in the mid latitude regions in addition the intensity and spatial extent of droughts are generally quantified by drought indices mehr et al 2014 used el nino southern oscillation enso indices as an indicator for drought forecasting ozger et al 2014 also used the enso index for drought forecasting by using a wavelet and fuzzy logic combination model a striking finding from these studies is that the enso index has strong potential effect in drought forecasting drought forecast is an important problem and thus has received great attention in the literature mishra and desai 2005 2006 kim and valdes 2003 morid et al 2007 and belayneh et al 2014 presented an excellent overview of research on drought forecasting however those works only consider point forecasts even though prediction intervals provide better inferences taking into account uncertainty in the model technically construction of such prediction intervals requires some distributional assumptions which are generally unknown in practice moreover the constructed prediction intervals along with the estimated parameter values can be affected due to any departure from the assumptions and may lead us to unreliable results one remedy to construct prediction intervals without considering distributional assumptions is to apply the well known resampling methods such as the bootstrap it is known that the original nonparametric bootstrap proposed by efron 1979 fails to provide satisfactory answers to general statistical inference problems for dependent data since the assumption of independently and identically distributed i i d data is violated as a way to deal with dependent data several types of resampling techniques including residual based bootstrap method have been proposed in this technique the residuals obtained from the original dataset by fitting some general models such as linear regression autoregression or nonparametric regression models are resampled to obtain the bootstrap sample of the data for more information see freedman 1981 efron and tibshirani 1986 liu 1988 and hardle and bowman 1988 in this paper we used the residual based bootstrap method to obtain valid prediction intervals for future pdsi values it works in summary as follows first the least squares ls method is used to obtain the model parameters and the residuals are calculated then the bootstrap method is applied to the data to obtain the bootstrap sample of the original data points which are used to calculate the bootstrap estimators of the ls coefficients finally the future values are obtained by means of bootstrap replicates and quantiles of the monte carlo estimates of the bootstrap distribution the rest of the paper is organized as follows we describe the data in section 2 in section 3 we provide a detailed information on the bootstrap method used in this study the data is analysed and the results are presented in section 4 the simulation study results are presented in section 5 followed by some concluding remarks in section 6 2 study area and data the pdsi estimates duration and intensity of drought events by measuring departure of the moisture supply based on a supply and demand concept of the water balance equation it incorporates precipitation and temperature data and local available water content of the soil from an unspecified period that best corresponds to past 9 12 months past conditions are incorporated because long term drought is cumulative so the intensity of drought at a particular time is dependent on the current conditions plus the cumulative patterns of previous months from the inputs all the basic terms of the water balance equation are determined including evapotranspiration soil recharge runoff and moisture loss from the surface layer hayes 2007 the equations are described in palmer s original study 1965 and in the more recent analysis by alley 1984 by accounting for moisture conditions in the past the pdsi estimates when a drought or wet spell begins ends and the duration of the event palmer 1965 alley 1984 table 1 provides a drought classification based on pdsi the primary benefit of the pdsi is identified by alley 1984 as it provides decision makers with a measurement of the abnormality of recent weather events for a region and places current conditions in a historical perspective it also provides spatial and temporal representations of historical droughts it is most effective at measuring impacts sensitive to soil moisture conditions such as agriculture moreover it has also been useful as a drought monitoring tool and been used to trigger actions associated with drought contingency plans the monthly pdsi data which consists of 552 observations were obtained starting from january 1970 and ending on december 2015 konya closed basin is located between 36 51 and 39 29 north latitudes and 31 36 and 34 52 east longitudes in central anatolia region of turkey its surface area is roughly 54 000 km2 and it constitutes approximately 7 of turkey fig 1 basin s altitude varies from 900 m to 3534 m the basin is surrounded by sakarya and kızılırmak basins in the north kızılırmak and seyhan basins in the east eastern mediterranean basin in the south antalya and akarcay basins in the west the basin is surrounded with the city centers of konya karaman aksaray nigde isparta ankara nevsehir and antalya cities the konya closed basin is at the top of the regions with the lowest annual rainfall in turkey total annual precipitation in the basin ranges from 286 mm to 740 mm it is known that the drought that has occurred in this arid semi arid climate has very serious socio economic effects agricultural practices with wild irrigation unrecorded water wells loss of function of natural wetlands due to the lack of long term conservation strategies decline of groundwater level loss of habitat and soil salinization constitute the main problems of the basin the information about the stations in konya basin used in the study is shown in table 2 the climate indexes data from 1970 to 2015 were obtained from noaa earth system research laboratory naoi is based on the surface sea level pressure difference between the subtropical azores high and the subpolar low the arctic oscillation ao is a large scale mode of climate variability also referred to as the northern hemisphere annular mode it is the result of the coupling between the stratospheric polar vortex and tropospheric circulation decastro et al 2006 fluctuation in the ao creates a seesaw pattern in which atmospheric pressure at the northern polar and middle latitudes alternates between positive and negative phases these atmospheric oscillation index values were obtained from the climate prediction center cpc at the national center of environmental prediction ncep www cpc noaa gov 2 1 exploratory data analysis the seasonal trend decomposition plots of the pdsi series are presented in fig 2 which includes the plots of the raw data seasonal trend and remainder components for each pdsi series fig 2 intuitively shows that the seasonality and trend are not presented in all pdsi series we checked the stationary condition of the pdsi values by applying ljung box lb and augmented dickey fuller adf t statistic tests and small p values p value 0 000 for the lb test and p value 0 010 for the adf test reject the null hypothesis against stationary alternative and suggest that the pdsi series are mean zero stationary processes moreover we applied log likelihood ratio test under the null hypothesis of no stable seasonality to check the seasonality of the pdsi series the log likelihood values were calculated from the selected exponential smoothing and an additional seasonal term added models and the calculated p value 1 000 suggests that the seasonal component is not significant autocorrelation function acf and partial autocorrelation function pacf plots of the pdsi series are given in figs 3 and 4 respectively the time series plots and acf pacf plots suggest that the autoregressive ar model could be appropriate to model the pdsi series to find the optimal lag we defined many possible subsets of the ar p models with different p values to choose the best model we used akaike information criterion aic since it is proposed to determine the best model for forecasting and the results show that ar 1 model is optimal according to aic for all the pdsi series the quantile quantile plots of data based vs fitted pdsi values obtained by ar 1 model are presented in fig 5 it is clear from these figures that the data

comparison was made through the coverage probability length of prediction intervals and their estimated standard errors se the significance level α is set to 0 05 to obtain 95 prediction intervals for future values the simulation set up is as follows step 1 generate a synthetic data set as in eq 10 10 x t ϕ 0 ϕ 1 x t 1 γ f t 1 t t 1 n where ϕ 0 0 ϕ 1 0 5 γ 0 05 0 2 with 0 05 increment and n 250 the error terms follow t n 0 1 distribution and we consider only one exogenous variable so that f t 1 is an n 1 vector of exogenous variable step 2 generate r 1000 future values x n h for h 1 24 step 3 calculate the bootstrap root replicate x n h b x n h b for h 1 24 and b 1 b then estimate the coverage probabilities of bootstrap prediction intervals for x n h as 1 r r 1 r 1 x n h q α 2 x n h x n h q 1 α 2 where q α and 1 represent the α th quantile of the constructed distribution of the bootstrap root replicates and the indicator function respectively the corresponding interval lengths are calculated by x n h q 1 α 2 x n h q α 2 step 4 repeat steps 1 3 mc 1000 where mc represents the number of monte carlo simulations times to calculate the average values and standard errors of the coverage probabilities and interval lengths the resuls are presented in fig 9 indicating that the bootstrap prediction intervals obtained by ar 1 and arx 1 models tend to have similar performances both prediction intervals have a coverage probability close to nominal level 95 the only difference between the constructed bootstrap prediction intervals is the estimated standard errors of interval lengths they have due to the effect of exogenous variable arx 1 model produces more variant interval lengths compared to ar 1 model 6 discussion and conclusions in this study we proposed the residual bootstrap method to construct prediction intervals for future pdsi based drought observations using autoregressive time series models from a hydroclimatological standpoint we also attempted to explore possible effects of the both north atlantic and arctic oscillations using their representative index on the constructed prediction intervals all the numerical analysis considered in this study approved that the bootstrap method resulted in valid prediction intervals for future pdsi values the interval lengths came out to be considerably narrower for the short term forecast than those of long term forecasts in this sense consideration of short term forecasts such as three months may be more reasonable for drought management if it does not require for longer term for some reason we can find this emphasis in the study by ozger et al 2014 who pointed out that most models forecast droughts with high accuracy for short lead times less than 3 months and did not yield satisfactory forecasts for 6 12 months belayneh and adamowski 2012 stated that short term drought forecasting is useful for monitoring the effects of drought on agricultural systems and is essential for the management of water resources however long term drought forecasting helps to understand the regional behavior of drought although the both oscillation indexes did not exhibit a notable effect on the prediction intervals whose fluctuation characteristics are thought to be consistent with that of future pdsi values as a matter of fact it did not come to surprise since a number of previous studies have shown the relation between nao and or ao and climate hydrological surface variables in many ways among others kucuk et al 2009 for lake levels sarlak et al 2005 meshram et al 2017 for drought moreover karabork et al 2005 showed that simultaneous and lag cross correlation analyses showed that precipitation stream flow maximum temperature and minimum temperature patterns over turkey have significant negative correlations with the naoi the physical mechanisms behind such teleconnection associated with nao were well documented in the last two decades for example the nao related temperature patterns are essentially controlled by the advection of heat through the anomalous mean flow characterized by the surface wind field trigo et al 2002 who carried out a multivariate analysis of the influence of the nao over the climatology of north atlantic and european sectors using the ncep reanalysis data set introduced an additional mechanism i e the modulation of short wave and long wave radiation by cloud cover variations in connection with the nao in order to explain the patterns of daily maximum and minimum temperatures afterward the performances of the bootstrap methods could be further studied for other drought indices and our approach here can also be used in other meteorological hydrological areas where the prediction is important acknowledgements we thank

7397,as the only connecting term between water balance and energy budget in the earth atmospheric system evapotranspiration et is considered the most excellent indicator for the activity for the water

the hydrological processes and improving water management practices this is particularly true for the tibetan plateau tp one of most sensitive and vulnerable region in response to the environment

evapotranspiration over snow covered area during 1982 2012 the spatial and temporal changes of partitioned three components of et i e soil evaporation es transpiration through the stomata of plant ec and canopy interception ei were investigated in the tp meanwhile how the et components contribute to et changes and respond to the change in environmental factors in the tp was revealed and discussed the results indicate that es dominates et in most areas of the tp with the mean annual ratio of 65 7 except southeastern regions where the vegetation coverage is high although regional average et and three main components all present obvious increase trends during the past decades high spatial heterogeneity for their trends are identified in the tp moreover a mixed changing pattern can be apparently found for es in southeastern area ec and ei in northwestern and southeastern area spatially the et variation are mainly attributed to change in es followed by ec and ei in addition compared with evaporation related meteorological variables precipitation and leaf area index lai provide the more dominated contributions to the changes of et and ei in the tp while lai is overwhelming contribution factor for ec changes as for es changes although precipitation play the important role the effects of other factors are also non negligible keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing grace pml model environmental regulations 1 introduction providing a critical nexus between the terrestrial water carbon and surface energy exchanges evapotranspiration et plays not only an important role in the energy budget in the land atmosphere system but is also an essential element of water balance sheffield et al 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 as the second largest component of hydrological cycle after precipitation trenberth et al 2007 terrestrial et has been estimated to approximately account for two thirds of the total precipitation over the land dai et al 2009 in this context et is considered as the most excellent indicator for the activity of water cycle particularly for the ongoing accelerated hydrological processes under the global and regional climate changes huntington 2006 wang and dickinson 2012 therefore accurately estimating et and identifying its long terms trends is of great importance for diagnosing climate change quantifying water budgets and elucidate the interactions between the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere diak et al 2004 zhang et al 2016b mao and wang 2017 however including evaporation from the soil and surface water transpiration through the stomata of plants and water intercepted by the plant canopy and litter layer kool et al 2014 et perhaps remains the most challenging surface fluxes to measure and simulate due to its complicated involvement in numerous climatological parameters land cover as well as physical soil properties and moisture condition tang et al 2010 especially at large spatial scales first constructed in 1830 the lysimeter is considered the most standard instrument to measure et without any assumption holmes 1984 seneviratne et al 2010 et can be obtained by balancing all other water budget components directly measured by the lysimeter world meteorological organization 2008 however lysimeter measurement of et only has a scale of square meter goss and ehlers 2009 with the larger footprint eddy covariance ec systems wilson et al 2002 and bowen ration energy balance systems cook 2007 become popular for conducting direct measurements of et since the mid 1990s however these two measures are more or less subject to requirement of surface homogeneity limited durations and spatial coverage mao and wang 2017 for larger regional scales or global scales satellite remote sensing exhibits significant advantages in hydrological cycle e g li and shao 2010 hence remote sensing also offers the possibility to derive the et over a heterogeneous land surface due to that remote sensing only provides the estimation of surface biophysical variables affecting et e g albedo vegetation type and density other than directly estimate et a large number of techniques have been developed to estimate et from satellite observations during the past decade wang and dickinson 2012 these satellite retrieval et algorithms can be roughly classified as 1 the empirical models to seek to relate latent heat flux to

lack a solid theoretical basis and rely heavily on calibration zhang et al 2016a as the earliest remote sensing methods to retrieve et the surface energy balance methods can potentially be implemented using inputs derived solely from remote sensing without the need of local calibration however both the one and two source models are only available for clear sky conditions and susceptible to the uncertainty in the estimation of land surface temperature ts and air temperature ta or their differences wang and dickinson 2012 among these satellite et algorithms the pm models is widely applied to map regional or global et e g mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b due to that it is process based and physically sound to estimate et by introducing aerodynamic and surface resistances the key points in applying pm equation to remote sensing retrieval of et is how to parameterize canopy conductance and soil water stress to estimate the latent heat flux cleugh et al 2007 directly related canopy conductance to satellite observed leaf area index lai in the pm equation mu et al 2007 further improved this work by adjusting the canopy conductance on account of environmental controls and estimating canopy e and soil evaporation separately leuning et al 2008 later built a penman monteith remote sensing et model denoted as penman monteith leuning model pml by replacing the earlier empirical models for canopy conductance with a biophysical two parameter model that accounts for sensitivity of stomatal conductance to sunlight and to atmospheric humidity deficit zhang et al 2010 the pml model has been proved to be more physical and rigorous and widely employed in the application of regional et zhang et al 2008 and global et zhang et al 2016b estimation showing favorable performances soil evaporation es transpiration through the stomata of plant ec and canopy interception ei are three components of evapotranspiration lawrence et al 2007 from the perspective of water resources utilization and ecology ec is commonly considered the more desirable component and es is undesirable due that ec is always associated with plant productivity while es does not directly contribute to production van halsema and vincent 2012 the relative importance of ec as a part of et is expected to be more pronounced in regions where the atmospheric demand or soil water availability is high wilcox et al 2003 therefore partitioning of et into es ec and ei can help interpret the hydrological components zhang et al 2016b validate climate scenario predictions newman et al 2006 and improve the water management practices agam et al 2012 particularly for arid and semi arid environments the measurement and modelling methods selections for partitioning et depends on the land cover type study objectives and scale of interest the development of techniques such as micro lysimeters boast and robertson 1982 sap flow technique rana and katerji 2000 and stale isotope technique brunel et al 1995 1997 make robust verification of the individual components possible at a local scale although limitation and errors in et partitioning estimated by these methods still exist herbst et al 1996 williams et al 2004 besides less limited by heterogeneity that always lead to errors when trying to explore a comprehensive system by points measurements remote sensing models provide a way of partitioning et on larger scales with assessing integrally et components kool et al 2014 although ec is generally considered a major component of et how much the ec accounts for the total land et globally remain uncertain coenders gerrits et al 2014 in fact the ratio of ec locally depends on vegetation coverage soil water availability and surface wetness in sparsely vegetated systems with wet surface the es even tends to dominate the total et gong et al 2007 more importantly the responses of et components to changes in environmental conditions are disparate and should thus be specially investigated the tibetan plateau tp famous as the third pole and the roof of the world plays an important role in the asian summer monsoon a weather system affecting more than half of the world s population shen et al 2015 meanwhile as the main source area of several major rivers in asia the tp is also called asian water tower and is thus essential to asia concurrent water energy cycles li et al 2014 the changes in precipitation patterns led by the weaken of indian monsoons and the strengthen of westerlies as well as shrinking glacier at the headwaters of many asian large river yao et al 2012 have exerted the profound influence to the hydrological cycle immerzeel et al 2010 and in turn changed the surface water balance in the tp yang et al 2011 as the only connecting term between energy balance and water balance xu and singh 2005 evapotranspiration in the tp and its change have been of extensive concerned during the past decade e g zhang et al 2007 2009 wang et al 2013 xue et al 2013 li et al 2014 song et al 2017 however many of these previous regional studies concentrated in potential evapotranspiration et p or pan evaporation et pan in the tp which only reflected the atmospheric evaporating capability over a hypothetical reference surface in fact adverse changing direction between annual mean et p et pan and et can be found in certain cases across the tp e g zhang et al 2007 wang et al 2012 2013 indicating that et should be specially focused on for the hydrological interest although et p and pan evaporation can provide a useful clue to the direction of the change in et wang and alimohammadi 2012 although there are a few of et studies reported over the tp in the past decade most of them focused on et at basin scales e g xue et al 2013 site scales e g hu et al 2013b or et products assessment based on regional average series e g li et al 2014 only a few recent studies estimated the regional distribution of et and the temporal variation over the whole tp with the aid of the satellite retrieve algorithms for example using meteorological and satellite remote sensing data song et al 2017 estimated et and investigated its spatial temporal dynamics on the tp at a 1 km resolution based on a modified pm algorithm for the period 2000 2010 however the three components of et in the tp i e vegetation transpiration soil evaporation and vegetation interception have not been quantitatively partitioned and how the components contribute to the spatial and temporal variability of et have thus not been adequately revealed in previous studies which is challenging but important for assessing ecosystem evolution hydrological and climatic dynamics and proposing accurate water management practices under changing environments for the tp furthermore although satellite et retrievals have advantages in the large scale coverage and high spatial resolution the application of retrieval algorithms are highly dependent on ground calibrations wang and dickinson 2012 therefore multiple approaches to evaluate the performance of retrieval models is needed observations obtained from widespread deployed ec systems have been applied for the et validation on the point scale e g xue et al 2013 li et al 2014 song et al 2017 gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite grace a newly launched twin satellite mission to observe the changes of earth s gravity field anomalies can provide information on variations in water distribution tapley et al 2004 based on grace data the traditional water balance equation provides a useful tool for the validation of et on the basin scale over the past decade previous studies have focused on regional quantifications of et considering the terrestrial water storage changes derived from the grace data e g rodell and famiglietti 2002 rodell et al 2004 swenson and wahr 2006 along with developed filtering technique and scaled gridded data adopted the grace data provides an effective way to monitor the terrestrial water storage changes allowing reliable estimation of the water budget and thereby making it possible to use monthly water balance data as another benchmark for verifying satellite retrievals of et although the uncertainties in the grace data are generally much greater because of its coarse spatial resolution therefore in this study with the multi data calibration i e flux cite observation data and monthly et data from the monthly water balance method with involving the terrestrial water storage changes based on grace production the daily et in the whole tp during the period of 1982 2012 was estimated using a modified pml model for considering evapotranspiration over snow covered area meanwhile the three components of et were partitioned and their spatial and temporal patterns were investigated moreover how the et components contribute to et changes and respond to the change in environmental factors in the tp was revealed this study is expected to improve the understanding of the regional hydrological cycle and the responses of water resources to environmental changes in the highest plateau in the world and thus to formulate hydro ecological conservation strategies against the potential menaces of global climate change 2 study regions data and method 2 1 study region ranging from 25 n to 40 n and from 74 e to 104 e fig 1 the tp with a total area of over 2 5 million km2 is the largest geomorphologic unit on the eurasian continent zheng et al 2000 also surrounded by massive mountain ranges the tp is known as the roof of the world with an average elevation of more than 4500 m yang et al 2012b the main soil types are cropland alpine grasslands alpine meadow alpine desert alpine shrubs and forestry accounting for 0 65 27 54 25 8 96 7 56 20 and

the northern hemisphere which is an important part of the snow pack in eurasian chu et al 2017 the most areas of the tp are strongly influenced by the summer indian monsoon and east asian monsoon yao et al 2012 and are classified as arid and semiarid climate with distinct wet and dry seasons due to its complex and changeable climate conditions many studies have investigated the sensitives of the tp to global climate change and suggested that significant warming trends occurred during the last several decades resulting in remarkable changes of environment for instance permafrost melting glacier shrinkage vegetation change and decreasing snow cover days e g zhang et al 1996 su and shi 2002 cheng and wu 2007 et essential component for water and energy balance is significantly influenced by the environmental changing behavior in this study two types of basins on the tp with and without surface runoff flowing out of the basin were selected as study basins inland basins are the first type including the qiangtang plateau the qaidam basin and the qinghai lake basin details see table 1 the other type includes eight gauged catchments determined by the drainage network extracted from the digital elevation model dem and it includes three international rivers details see table 1 location of the basins and gauge stations are shown in fig 1 2 2 data 2 2 1 satellite data data used for this study include 8 day lai 8 day albedo 8 day emissivity and grace data remotely sensed lai albedo and emissivity data at 0 05 spatial resolution from 1982 to 2012 were provided by the global land surface satellite glass dataset http glass product bnu edu cn liang et al 2013 xiao et al 2014 the glass lai product 1982 2012 was derived from red and near infrared surface reflectance of advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis the glass albedo product an important parameter for calculating the energy available for evapotranspiration was produced from both avhrr 1982 1999 and modis 2000 2012 data the glass longwave emissivity product was generated from both avhrr visible and near infrared reflectance ranging from 1982 to 1999 and modis seven black sky albedos ranging from 2000 to 2012 daily outgoing longwave radiation r lo was estimated by the surface emissivity and daily meteorological data details see eqs 12 and 13 of cleugh et al 2007 to guarantee data quality of lai albedo and emissivity quality assessment flags in the database were employed to delete poor quality data and the deleted data were replaced by interpolated values obtained from a piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial zhang and wegehenkel 2006 subsequently the quality controlled data were smoothed by the savitzky golay filtering method for each pixel which is widely used for filtering remote sensing data tsai and philpot 1998 ruffin et al 2008 the grace data was used to calculate the terrestrial water storage changes s the descriptions of grace gravity field solutions were provided by previous studies rodell and famiglietti 1999 tapley et al 2004 swenson and wahr 2006 approximately the spatial resolution of grace data was a few hundred kilometers but a reasonable consistency between grace estimated and site observation has already been demonstrated for basin scale e g rodell and famiglietti 2002 longuevergne et al 2010 landerer and swenson 2012 xue et al 2013 long et al 2014 here the domain averaged changes of terrestrial water storage for the basins on the tp were derived from the extracted terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa gridded data available on the grace tellus website which were processed by the center for space research csr the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the geoforschungszentrum gfz based on the release 5 0 rl05 spherical harmonics a destriping filter and a glacial isostatic adjustment correction were applied to the data to minimize the error swenson and wahr 2006 landerer and swenson 2012 although an agreement with high temporal correlation coefficients and similar standard deviation of the monthly variation was found for twsa products generated by the three centers respectively li et al 2014 there were still differences due to different data processing methods among three products which would induce some uncertainties in estimates of et employing s from twsa products at the basin scale on the tp klees et al 2007 in this study s was thus extracted from the mean value of the three grace products to minimize the impact from individual errors of the three twsa estimates 2 2 2 meteorological data daily meteorology records from 1982 to 2012 used to drive the et algorithms include precipitation prec ta maximum temperature t max minimum temperature t min pressure atmosphere pres water vapor pressure wvp shortwave downward radiation srad and wind speed wind these meteorological records were obtained from two widely used datasets china meteorological forcing data set cmfd he and yang 2011 and the princeton global forcing data pgf sheffield et al 2012 at 0 1 and 0 25 spatial resolution t max and t min obtained from pgf can be found at http hydrology princeton edu data prec ta pres wvp srad and wind obtained from cmfd was produced by merging a variety of data sources and can be downloaded from the cold and arid regions science data center at lanzhou http westdc westgis ac cn it was found that the qualities of the records are comparable to measurements from ground observation networks in previous studies yang et al 2010 he and yang 2011 hu et al 2013a li et al 2014 she et al 2017 therefore the data are considered as reasonable quality for the et estimation all the meteorology records were interpolated into 0 05 to match up with the remote sensing data 2 2 3 runoff data and land cover the geographical distributions of the hydrological stations are shown in fig 1 observed discharge r for hydrological stations obtained from annual hydrological report p r china were used to drive the water balance method to estimate et two hydrological stations in source regions i e tangnaihai and zhimenda can provide the daily observed discharge while other six gauged stations including nuxia gongshan jiuzhou shigu luning and luding can only provide monthly runoff data in addition the accuracy of e c estimation rely heavily on the quality of land cover products consequently west data centre land cover product generated by the chinese academy of sciences westdc was used in our study because of better performance in china compared to the other four land cover products global land cover characteristics for the year 2000 documented by the european commission s joint research centre glc2000 the university of maryland land

academy of science and can be found at http westdc westgis ac cn 2 3 method 2 3 1 surface water balance in this study the traditional water balance method shown in eq 1 is used to estimate actual et hereafter et on a subbasin level by assuming there is no bias in the calculation process hobbins et al 2004 rodell et al 2004 xue et al 2013 li et al 2014 1 et p r δ s where r is the runoff depth mm p is the domain averaged precipitation mm and δs is the variation of terrestrial water storage mm including variations of surface subsurface and ground water usually p and r are obtained from situ observation data and δs is considered to be negligible over a long period generally annual or longer time scale hobbins et al 2004 li and shao 2010 xue et al 2013 li et al 2014 nevertheless δs can t be ignored at the monthly time scale for the inland basins i e qiangtang plateau qaidam basin and qinghai lake basin the runoff depth is zero the traditional water balance equation can thus be simplified as below 2 et p δ s 2 3 2 the modified penman monteith leuning pml algorithm the pml model leuning et al 2008 was used to measure et in this study the model based on the modified classic pm combination equation explicitly separates the contributions of vegetation ec soil es and rainfall interception ei to total evapotranspiration et ec es ei the pml model estimates ec can be written as 3 e c ε a c ρ c p γ d a g a ε 1 g a g c here a c 1 τ a is the net energy absorbed by the vegetation canopy each day where τ exp k a lai k a is the extinction coefficient for net radiation ε s γ where γ is the psychrometric constant and s de dt is the slope of the curve relating saturation water vapor pressure to temperature ρ is the density of air c p is the specific heat of air at constant pressure d a is the water vapor pressure deficit of the air at a reference height above the canopy and g a is the aerodynamic conductance in addition to the above variables the canopy conductance g c is required to calculate ec the biophysical variable was estimated using the following simple model kelliher et al 1995 isaac et al 2004 leuning et al 2008 4 g c g sx k q ln q h q 50 q h exp k q lai q 50 1 1 d a d 50 in which g sx is the apparent maximum stomatal conductance of leaves at the top of the canopy k q is the extinction coefficient for visible radiation and q h is the average flux density of visible radiation at the top of canopy the parameters d 50 and q 50 are the values of q h and d a respectively at which stomatal conductance is half its maximum value obviously g c estimated by eq 4 can change with q h and d a on various time scales and with lai on daily time scales soil evaporation is calculated in flowing equation 5 e s f ε a s ε 1 where a s τ a is the net energy absorbed by soil each day f is a coefficient which varies from f 1 when the soil surface is wet to f 0 when the soil surface is dry due to a lack of seasonally varying soil moisture data in this study the temporal variation in f for each grid cell was calculated by the ratio of total prec to the sum of equilibrium evaporation rate for four periods before and after the current 8 day period zhang et al 2010 in the pioneering work leuning et al 2008 noted that four parameters k q k a q 50 d 50 in pml model was insensitive to et and assigned constant values 0 6 0 6 2 6 mj m 2 d 1 0 7 kpa respectively accordingly only one parameter g sx must be calibrated following zhang et al 2010 we adjusted g sx to force agreement between the multi year averages of et estimated by the fu model e fu and the 31 yr averages of et calculated through the pml model e pml to calibrate g sx separately for each 0 05 pixel used in our study e pml can be estimated at a fine temporal resolution and e fu ensures a balance between the amount of available water and the energy available for evaporation on annual time scales e fu was produced by a variant of the budyko curve developed by fu 1981 combined with the optimized value of α α 2 33 and gridded meteorological dates for each 0 05 grid cell across study area details see zhang et al 2010 an adapted gash rainfall interception model with an assumption that there is no change between storms in the ratio of the wet canopy evaporation rate to the rainfall rate was used to model e i dijk et al 2001 due to the importance of snow pack in water resources and hydrology over the tp we modified the pml algorithm considering the evaporation over snow cover in this study we assumed that canopy transpiration over snow covered plants was negligible because of the stomatal closure at freezing temperature vinukollu et al 2011 and selected a simple equation for estimating snow sublimation 6 e snow f u e s e a where f u is a wind function typically of the form f u 0 26 1 0 54 u penman 1948 jensen 2010 in which u is the wind speed at 2 m above the surface e s e a is the vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa apart from the snow sublimation we also modified the algorithm for calculating the evaporation from water surface in the unfrozen period the penman equation penman 1948 was used to estimate water evaporation and was defined as 7 e water δ δ γ a λ γ δ γ e a where e water is the daily water evaporation mm day 1 e a represents the evaporative component owing to turbulent transport of water vapor through an eddy diffusion process which can be calculated by the form of eq 6 in the frozen period e water will take the sublimation form from the water surface and eq 6 was selected for estimating sublimation the daily t max and t min were used to determine the unfrozen periods ma et al 2016 3 result 3 1 model validation the modeled et was compared against the et observed by the eddy covariance method at the towers for the respective range of footprints the time series comparisons of the modeled et 8 day averaged based on the modified pml method and ground observed et collected from the 2 flux towers dangxiong and haibei ec sites were plotted in fig 2 in general the modeled seasonal curves were in good agreement with the observed ones although the modeled et tends to underestimate the tower observations for dangxiong site marsh wetland during the period days 136 238 for the two validation sites the et simulations using our modified et model showed generally better results in the snow cover period compared with that in the snow free periods for both dangxiong and haibei ec sites the coefficient of determination r2 values were 0 85 and 0 89 respectively the daily biases were 0 00029 mm day 1 and 0 000011 mm day 1 respectively and the root mean square error rmse was 0 013 and 0 006 mm day 1 respectively although the uncertainty of meteorological data is inevitable across different et algorithms zhang et al 2010 jung et al 2010 the small biases high coefficients of determination and low rmse between our simulated and the measured daily et indicated that the satellite based algorithm generally captured the observed daily variation and site to site differences in et besides the ec sites validation we also used the monthly et which is estimated by water balance method on a monthly basis based on the gridded prec values provided by westdc in situ observed r daily and the estimated δs from grace products as the regional averaged reference et in this study based on the regional averaged reference et we examined the modeled et in the three blind drainage basins by eq 2 however for the gauged catchments with only two hydrological stations covering daily reliable data we compared the reference and domain averaged model et in the source regions of yellow river and yangtze river by eq 1 fig 3 the results illustrated that the modified model offered a high accuracy for monthly et in the five basins the regional averaged et using the modified model accounted for 94 of the variation in the monthly reference et with rmse and bias bias of 0 075 mm month 1 and 0 0094 mm month 1 for all five validation basins respectively 3 2 calibration of fu model and regional gsx maps in this study the particle swarm optimization pso gill et al 2006 was used for the single parameter α calibration in the fu model using the mean annual water balance evaporation et across all eleven catchments the calibration result was presented in table 2 along with serval fit statistics such as bias rmse r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the result indicated that e fu estimated by using the optimized value of α 2 33 can explain 94 of the variance in e fu with a bias 9 33 mm year 1 an rmse 18 32 mm year 1 and an nse 0 93 hence at each grid cell the average for many years of et would well be estimated by fu model thereby calibrating the gsx separately the reasonable gsx map was shown in fig 4 a as can be seen there was a gradually decreasing gsx from the south to the north of the tp high values of gsx occurred in the southeast regions of the tp covered by forests and shrublands low values of gsx were mainly located in the west and north regions covered by grasslands and barren fig 4b shows estimates of gsx for different land cover classes for most classes values of gsx fall within the range of 0 003 0 01 m s 1 3 3 spatial and temporal differences in all et components we have applied the modified pml model with the 8 day glass products albedo lai emissivity etc and other meteorological data ta prec etc to estimate the daily et in the tp at a 0 05 spatial resolution from 1982 to 2012 the multiyear 1982 2012 average annual et e s e c and e i are shown in fig 5 which exhibited strong spatial variabilities and latitudinal gradients the et e c and e i showed similar spatial patterns with gradually decreasing et from southeast to northwest of the tp for et e c and e i the annual mean values were highest in the semi humid regions covered by forests and shrublands intermediate in the semiarid grassland regions central tp and the lowest in the arid regions including west and north of the tp covered by barren fig 5a c d however the largest e s occurred in the central and eastern tp followed by the southern tibet valley and western tp a smaller e s occurred in the northwest and northern tp fig 5b the terrestrial average annual et in the tp was 378 1 mm year 1 e s has the highest average value of 248 4 mm year 1 in et components followed by e c 65 2 mm year 1 and e i 32 5 mm year 1 on the whole the estimated terrestrial et in the tp after removal of the mean annual cycle showed a trend toward a small increase on average for the 1982 2012 period but the regional averaged et prec anomaly represented an opposite trend fig 6 a for the three et components the long term trends of anomalies were consistent and exhibited increased e s e c and e i fig 6b c d moreover the magnitude of e s anomaly is similar to e c with both differing from the magnitude of e i which had a smaller anomaly because of differences in the magnitudes of anomalies for et components the ratio anomalies of the components to total et differed substantially the ratio of e i to et showed a lower anomaly than those of e s and e c to et similarly most of trends in et components were increasing fig 7 the range of long term changes in e c and e i were very semblable and less than the range of e s trend hence e s trend had a greater contribution to et trend than other components although the median values for the contribution of e c and e i trend to total et trend were close fig 7 e c trend showed a larger averaged contribution which implies inconsistent magnitude distribution over the study region in terms of spatial pattern the differences between the long term et and three components were found over almost the entire territory of the tp but increasing trends in all of them occupied the largest percentage fig 8 in particular 91 3 of the area was dominated by the positive et trend while the area with negative trends in et was comparatively centralized in the midstream brahmaputra and the south of the tp fig 8a similarly positive trend in e s accounts for approximately 83 3 of the tp differently although 78 3 and 76 3 of regions in the tp exhibited positive trends in e c and e i respectively only about 40 of them showed strong positive trends in addition despite consistent inter annual significantly positive trends located in the central tp in e s e c and e i no consistent trends were found among the three et components in most of the regions in the tp over the north and west of the tp e c and e i indicated negative trends while the opposite trend was found in e s also inconsistent change trends were found in the southern and southeast of the tp with negative e s trend and positive trends indicated in e c and e i fig 8b c d 3 4 the controlling factors of the et components et and its components are regulated by many biological and meteorological factors such as solar radiation vapor pressure deficit air temperature and lai in this study using daily mean values of the et estimates and the meteorological input data for prec ta and the net radiation rn from 1982 to 2012 the spatial distributions of the correlations between et and the three environmental variables were mapped fig 9 a there was a strong correlation between et and water supply over most regions of the tp also a visible correlation between et and prec was found over the west and north of the tp which matches the spatial patterns of dryness as it decreases from northwest to southeast in the tp in addition rn played an important role in the eastern and northwest section of the tp for e s prec and ta played important roles in deriving e s and were the determining input variables as confirmed by fig 9b moreover fig 9b highlighted the importance of rn in the east and southeast area of the tp different from et and e s vegetation i e lai regulates the variability in e c throughout the tp and only in the eastern tp ta was another dominated factor in e c fig 9c relative to the importance of lai in e c estimation lai controlled the e i variations in the entire tp except in the central and southeastern tp where the e i was regulated by prec furthermore e i also strongly correlated with prec and ta in the east of the tp fig 9d in order to quantify the impacts of environmental regulations on the area averaged et the controlling variables were detrended and the difference between the detrended actual et and the re estimated et with original series was identified with the stepwise regressions analysis for illustrative purposes the results of contribution analysis for five major environmental variables were plotted in fig 9e all five major variables can explain 93 of the et trend with prec explaining 61 lai 46 and vpd 13 of the et trend while wind and rn exhibited a negative contribution to the et trend with 7 and 20 respectively the result showed that the et trend in the tp was dominated by prec and lai resemble contribution analyses were carried out for et components i e e s e c and e i and the results are demonstrated in fig 9 f h the overall impression from the contribution of environmental variables is that except for the negative contributions of wind and rn other variables displayed positive contributions to the trends in et components the strong positive contributions of prec to the trends in three et components were found to explain 64 24 and 65 respectively as for wind speed only a lower negative contribution to the trends in e s and e i was shown higher positive contributions of lai to the trends of e c and e i were found to explain 58 and 26 and vpd and rn contributed the least to the trends in e c and e i in addition ta displayed higher positive contribution to the trend of e s 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the modified pml model one advantage offered by the modified pml model in comparison with other complicated et models is that the model builds functional relationships between et and predictor variables considering explicit biophysical mechanisms and multiyear water energy coupling balance concurrently allowing for the evaporation from snow cover landscapes and its effect on other et components is another superiority due that snow sublimation constitutes as one of the most important aspects of water resources and hydrology in the higher altitude macdonald et al 2010 also in consideration of lower values of et encountered when snow covering is high du et al 2004 suggested that snow sublimation should be calculated in monthly and annual time scales for climate studies moreover the input remote sensing variables also exert great influences on the performance of the modified model here the glass products which are of higher quality and accuracy than existing products and highly suitable for various environmental studies with much longer time series were adopted liang et al 2013 liu et al 2013 therefore the daily model et results agreed well with the et observations from the tower sites however there is still differences between the modeled et and the observed et the following limitations associated with the eddy flux validation can effectively account for the differences 1 we used 0 05 glass lai grid cells for eddy flux footprints that change throughout the day and year previous studies have illustrated that the pixel to footprint mismatch makes process based model calibration challenging anderson et al 2003 compared the measured et with the estimated from the 5 5 1 km2 cells and showed that uncertainties may be introduced because of differences in tower footprints due to land surface heterogeneity there are errors in large regional et estimates based on tower measurements mccabe and wood 2006 2 currently large scale et can only be directly validated with ec observations therefore scaling beyond an ec footprint is largely unknown vinukollu et al 2011 whereas energy balance closure at flux sites is imperfect because of complexity in wind variation footprint representation and sampling variability twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 about 10 of the variation can t be explained by the eddy flux sites as such only an r2 of around 0 9 would be achieved with the best model which is generally what our model produces meanwhile for values of gsx the range of 0 003 0 01 m s 1 is physiologically reasonable and consistent with previous study e g kelliher et al 1995 given the large number of grid cells in the two classes the corresponding mean values were reasonable although the median values of gsx for grasslands barren and unclassified were less than 0 003 fig 4b moreover due to the lack of irrigation inputs in the water balance equation gsx for irrigated cropland was underestimated besides previous study has suggested that additional work was required to improve the model calibration and validation except the ec sites chen et al 2014 jung et al 2010 and vinukollu et al 2011 have calculated evapotranspiration by meteorological prec and runoff to investigate model performance without considering the change in terrestrial water storage in this study the monthly estimated results have been compared with the reference et derived from climatological prec monitored basin discharge and grace which is providing earth s gravity field for inferring sufficiently precise regional water mass variations in addition the results show a little underestimation in the regional scale due to the small area of the three basins qinghai lake basin the upper yangtze and upper yellow river basin this result can be explained because changes in the gravity field obtained from grace satellites provide an opportunity to better constrain the water budget equation for deriving twsa at a spatial resolution of 200 000 km2 long et al 2014 4 2 multidecadal trends for et and the contribution of components regional scale et has been estimated and evaluated in many research reports by applying models which integrate mechanistic processes or empirical relationships e g papale and valentini 2003 yang et al 2006 wang et al 2007 fisher et al 2008 yuan et al 2010 but its partitioning is not well known and few researchers have diagnosed even though it is important on land atmosphere interaction and land surface schemes the objective of this paper is to partition et and quantify its components based on the modified pml model in the tp three main et components i e e s e c and e i were included in the estimation our results showed that the highest et occurs in the southeast of the tp and the lowest et occurs in the northwest of the tp fig 5 similar findings on et have also been obtained with the modified pm mu method another retrieval algorithm by song et al 2017 besides compared with et et components ec and ei exhibit similar spatial patterns while with the highest es occurring in the central tp the spatial patterns of es is different in addition e s is the dominant component followed by e c and e i except the semi humid regions located in the southeast tp with high canopy cover although previous analyses have suggested that among the et components vegetation transpiration was the dominated component on the global scale e g brunel et al 1997 kool et al 2014 lawrence et al 2007 demonstrated that e s is a more significant component of et in arid and semiarid regions which has supported our conclusion moreover previous studies suggested that global warming have accelerated the hydrological cycle especially on the tp huntington 2006 yang et al 2011 yin et al 2013 ding et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 showed that green up dates continuously advanced in the tp during the period of 1982 2011 and yang et al 2012a mentioned that the lengthening of the seasonal non frozen period caused by global warming in this study we found that the tp overall became wetter although et and its three main components show positive trends regionally our estimation results demonstrate that there are increasing trends in et and its components over most of the tp fig 8 similarly in the earlier studies by zhang et al 2007 and wang et al 2013 et increased markedly across the tp corresponding to an increase of surface temperature zhang et al 2015 found that the inter annual et increased in the tp with a positive water supply trend based on the global land et trends map furthermore due to the increasing precipitation and the degenerating permafrost in the central north and west tp meng et al 2017 e s shows a positive trend while the decline of e s in the southeast tp can be attributed to the decreasing solar radiation previous analyses indicated that decreasing normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and ta occurred in the northwest tp with vegetation degradation while ndvi and ta tend to increase in the rest of tp associated with climate warming e g chen et al 2014 therefore an similar spatial pattern of long term trends the negative trend in northwest areas and the rise of the trend in the rest of the domain is found in e c and e i 4 3 spatial differences of primary environmental controlling regulations for et and components water and energy have long been considered as the most important factors spatially and temporally driving ecosystem evapotranspiration in the field of both hydrometeorology and agronomy donohue et al 2006 in the present study although strong correlation between et simulation and ta over most of the tp prec has the largest contribution to the high trend over the entire tp followed by lai fig 9 these results are consistent with previous researches for example shen et al 2015 suggested that increased growing season vegetation activity may have enhanced et and cool growing season temperatures over the tp were probably not a strong limitation on et however it should be noted that the actual et would increase with the decline of wind speed in the tp this finding appears to be inconsistent with the previous studies e g chen et al 2014 which quantified the sensitivity of rates of evaporation demand to changes in wind speed and highlighted the contribution of the terrestrial stilling to declining rates of evaporation demand in fact in severely water limited regions et trends are more closely related with trends in available water supply in an earlier study by mcvicar et al 2012 water supply was proved to control the change of et in the tp while wind speed generally exerted smaller direct influence on the et besides the dominant variables for major et components is very different our analyses indicate that prec dominates the variation of e s and e i while the e c variation is controlled by lai fig 9 this may be explained by the strong correlation between prec and soil moisture meng et al 2017 concurrently the magnitudes are similar for the contributions of three environmental variables vpd ta and rn to the trend in es among the three variables both vpd and ta have positive contributions while rn has a negative contribution analogously ta is another important meteorological variable influencing e c because the stomatal conductance can be significantly altered by ta vinukollu et al 2011 however unlike the negative contribution of terrestrial stilling to the trends in et and e s a positive contribution of wind speed to e i can be found this result can be confirmed by the fact that strong winds would damage canopy cover and reduce the canopy interception with the rise of throughfall waterloo 1994 4 4 limitations of the current study although recent studies have tested the good performance of satellite retrieval algorithms in regional et estimation and attributed to the parameterization e g leuning et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b there are still some limitations in the current work of using modified pml model to retrieve et in the tp for example the effects of carbon dioxide co2 and soil moisture on stomatal conductance are not included in the model in addition we have estimated soil heat fluxes using a simple semi empirical method because the mechanisms of soil heat fluxes are still uncertain also large deviation may be induced by key parameters using empirical values besides the uncertainty of the model structure the input data can also cause uncertainty in the model outputs mixed pixels and the changes in land cover may result in a bias in the modeled et furthermore it is necessary to collect et components measurements using some widely recognized methods e g stable isotope and sap flow to examine the accuracy of et sub components 5 conclusions based on our modified pml model this study presented here reveals more precise spatiotemporal dynamics of et and its components on the tp at 8 day scale the validated results manifest that the modeled et can explain between 85 and 95 of the variability in et and indicate that the modified pml model is very reliable in estimating the et on a large regional scale mean annual et estimate is 378 1 mm year 1 which is dominated by e s 248 4 mm year 1 followed by e c 65 2 mm year 1 and e i 32 5 mm year 1 regionally from high to low value a clear southeastern northwestern gradient can be found in the study region for et the patterns of e c and e i distribution are similar with that of et but a lower e s occurs in southeast tp and regions in central and eastern tp have the highest e s furthermore there are substantial differences in the contribution of environmental regulations to the trends in et and its components lai and prec are the dominated variables of et e c and e i whereas e s is controlled by vpd ta rn and prec accompanying with the increment in prec and lai and the lengthening of the seasonal non frozen period regional averaged et and its major components show consistently increasing trends conversely the ratio of et to prec is reduced indicating that the tp become wetter in the past several decades acknowledgments this work

7397,as the only connecting term between water balance and energy budget in the earth atmospheric system evapotranspiration et is considered the most excellent indicator for the activity for the water and energy cycle under the background of global change regional et estimates components partitioning as well as their spatial and temporal patterns recognition are of great importance in understanding the hydrological processes and improving water management practices this is particularly true for the tibetan plateau tp one of most sensitive and vulnerable region in response to the environment change in the earth in this study with flux site observation data and monthly et data from the monthly water balance method incorporating the terrestrial water storage changes from the gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite grace production as the multiple validations the long term daily et in the tp was retrieved by a modified penman monteith leuning pml model with considering evapotranspiration over snow covered area during 1982 2012 the spatial and temporal changes of partitioned three components of et i e soil evaporation es transpiration through the stomata of plant ec and canopy interception ei were investigated in the tp meanwhile how the et components contribute to et changes and respond to the change in environmental factors in the tp was revealed and discussed the results indicate that es dominates et in most areas of the tp with the mean annual ratio of 65 7 except southeastern regions where the vegetation coverage is high although regional average et and three main components all present obvious increase trends during the past decades high spatial heterogeneity for their trends are identified in the tp moreover a mixed changing pattern can be apparently found for es in southeastern area ec and ei in northwestern and southeastern area spatially the et variation are mainly attributed to change in es followed by ec and ei in addition compared with evaporation related meteorological variables precipitation and leaf area index lai provide the more dominated contributions to the changes of et and ei in the tp while lai is overwhelming contribution factor for ec changes as for es changes although precipitation play the important role the effects of other factors are also non negligible keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing grace pml model environmental regulations 1 introduction providing a critical nexus between the terrestrial water carbon and surface energy exchanges evapotranspiration et plays not only an important role in the energy budget in the land atmosphere system but is also an essential element of water balance sheffield et al 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 as the second largest component of hydrological cycle after precipitation trenberth et al 2007 terrestrial et has been estimated to approximately account for two thirds of the total precipitation over the land dai et al 2009 in this context et is considered as the most excellent indicator for the activity of water cycle particularly for the ongoing accelerated hydrological processes under the global and regional climate changes huntington 2006 wang and dickinson 2012 therefore accurately estimating et and identifying its long terms trends is of great importance for diagnosing climate change quantifying water budgets and elucidate the interactions between the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere diak et al 2004 zhang et al 2016b mao and wang 2017 however including evaporation from the soil and surface water transpiration through the stomata of plants and water intercepted by the plant canopy and litter layer kool et al 2014 et perhaps remains the most challenging surface fluxes to measure and simulate due to its complicated involvement in numerous climatological parameters land cover as well as physical soil properties and moisture condition tang et al 2010 especially at large spatial scales first constructed in 1830 the lysimeter is considered the most standard instrument to measure et without any assumption holmes 1984 seneviratne et al 2010 et can be obtained by balancing all other water budget components directly measured by the lysimeter world meteorological organization 2008 however lysimeter measurement of et only has a scale of square meter goss and ehlers 2009 with the larger footprint eddy covariance ec systems wilson et al 2002 and bowen ration energy balance systems cook 2007 become popular for conducting direct measurements of et since the mid 1990s however these two measures are more or less subject to requirement of surface homogeneity limited durations and spatial coverage mao and wang 2017 for larger regional scales or global scales satellite remote sensing exhibits significant advantages in hydrological cycle e g li and shao 2010 hence remote sensing also offers the possibility to derive the et over a heterogeneous land surface due to that remote sensing only provides the estimation of surface biophysical variables affecting et e g albedo vegetation type and density other than directly estimate et a large number of techniques have been developed to estimate et from satellite observations during the past decade wang and dickinson 2012 these satellite retrieval et algorithms can be roughly classified as 1 the empirical models to seek to relate latent heat flux to vegetation parameters and key environmental control factors e g wang et al 2007 anderson and goulden 2009 wang and liang 2008 glenn et al 2010 jung et al 2010 2 surface energy balance methods to combine the surface energy balance expression and land surface flux equations with remotely sensed temperatures including one source models with estimating latent heat flux from the integral surface e

parameterizing canopy conductance and soil water stress e g cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2007 leuning et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 the empirical models are usually simple and convenient to be applied but lack a solid theoretical basis and rely heavily on calibration zhang et al 2016a as the earliest remote sensing methods to retrieve et the surface energy balance methods can potentially be implemented using inputs derived solely from remote sensing without the need of local calibration however both the one and two source models are only available for clear sky conditions and susceptible to the uncertainty in the estimation of land surface temperature ts and air temperature ta or their differences wang and dickinson 2012 among these satellite et algorithms the pm models is widely applied to map regional or global et e g mu et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016b due to that it is process based and physically sound to estimate et by introducing aerodynamic and surface resistances the key points in applying pm equation to remote sensing retrieval of et is how to parameterize canopy conductance and soil water stress to estimate the latent heat flux cleugh et al 2007 directly related canopy conductance to satellite observed leaf area index lai in the pm equation mu et al 2007 further improved this work by adjusting the canopy conductance on account of environmental controls and estimating canopy e and soil evaporation separately leuning et al 2008 later built a penman monteith remote sensing et model denoted as penman monteith leuning model pml by replacing the earlier empirical models for canopy conductance with a biophysical two parameter model that accounts for sensitivity of stomatal conductance to sunlight and to atmospheric humidity deficit zhang et al 2010 the pml model has been proved to be more physical and rigorous and widely employed in the application of regional et zhang et al 2008 and global et zhang et al 2016b estimation showing favorable performances soil evaporation es transpiration through the stomata of plant ec and canopy interception ei are three components of evapotranspiration lawrence et al 2007 from the perspective of water resources utilization and ecology ec is commonly considered the more desirable component and es is undesirable due that ec is always associated with plant productivity while es does not directly contribute to production van halsema and vincent 2012 the relative importance of ec as a part of et is expected to be more pronounced in regions where the atmospheric demand or soil water availability is high wilcox et al 2003 therefore partitioning of et into es ec and ei can help interpret the hydrological components zhang et al 2016b validate climate scenario predictions newman et al 2006 and improve the water management practices agam et al 2012 particularly for arid and semi arid environments the measurement and modelling methods selections for partitioning et depends on the land cover type study objectives and scale of interest the development of techniques such as micro lysimeters boast and robertson 1982 sap flow technique rana and katerji 2000 and stale isotope technique brunel et al 1995 1997 make robust verification of the individual components possible at a local scale although limitation and errors in et partitioning estimated by these methods still exist herbst et al 1996 williams et al 2004 besides less limited by heterogeneity that always lead to errors when trying to explore a comprehensive system by points measurements remote sensing models provide a way of partitioning et on larger scales with assessing integrally et components kool et al 2014 although ec is generally considered a major component of et how much the ec accounts for the total land et globally remain uncertain coenders gerrits et al 2014 in fact the ratio of ec locally depends on vegetation coverage soil water availability and surface wetness in sparsely vegetated systems with wet surface the es even tends to dominate the total et gong et al 2007 more importantly the responses of et components to changes in environmental conditions are disparate and should thus be specially investigated the tibetan plateau tp famous as the third pole and the roof of the world plays an important role in the asian summer monsoon a weather system affecting more than half of the world s population shen et al 2015 meanwhile as the main source area of several major rivers in asia the tp is also called asian water tower and is thus essential to asia concurrent water energy cycles li et al 2014 the changes in precipitation patterns led by the weaken of indian monsoons and the strengthen of westerlies as well as shrinking glacier at the headwaters of many asian large river yao et al 2012 have exerted the profound influence to the hydrological cycle immerzeel et al 2010 and in turn changed the surface water balance in the tp yang et al 2011 as the only connecting term between energy balance and water balance xu and singh 2005 evapotranspiration in the tp and its change have been of extensive concerned during the past decade e g zhang et al 2007 2009 wang et al 2013 xue et al 2013 li et al 2014 song et al 2017 however many of these previous regional studies concentrated in potential evapotranspiration et p or pan evaporation et pan in the tp which only reflected the atmospheric evaporating capability over a hypothetical reference surface in fact adverse changing direction between annual mean et p et pan and et can be found in certain cases across the tp e g zhang et al 2007 wang et al 2012 2013 indicating that et should be specially focused on for the hydrological interest although et p and pan evaporation can provide a useful clue to the direction of the change in et wang and alimohammadi 2012 although there are a few of et studies reported over the tp in the past decade most of them focused on et at basin scales e g xue et al 2013 site scales e g hu et al 2013b or et products assessment based on regional average series e g li et al 2014 only a few recent studies estimated the regional distribution of et and the temporal variation over the whole tp with the aid of the satellite retrieve algorithms for example using meteorological and satellite remote sensing data song et al 2017 estimated et and investigated its spatial temporal dynamics on the tp at a 1 km resolution based on a modified pm algorithm for the period 2000 2010 however the three components of et in the tp i e vegetation transpiration soil evaporation and vegetation interception have not been quantitatively partitioned and how the components contribute to the spatial and temporal variability of et have thus not been adequately revealed in previous studies which is challenging but important for assessing ecosystem evolution hydrological and climatic dynamics and proposing accurate water management practices under changing environments for the tp furthermore although satellite et retrievals have advantages in the large scale coverage and high spatial resolution the application of retrieval algorithms are highly dependent on ground calibrations wang and dickinson 2012 therefore multiple approaches to evaluate the performance of retrieval models is needed observations obtained from widespread deployed ec systems have been applied for the et validation on the point scale e g xue et al 2013 li et al 2014 song et al 2017 gravity recovery and climate experiment satellite grace a newly launched twin satellite mission to observe the changes of earth s gravity field anomalies can provide information on variations in water distribution tapley et al 2004 based on grace data the traditional water balance equation provides a useful tool for the validation of et on the basin scale over the past decade previous studies have focused on regional quantifications of et considering the terrestrial water storage changes derived from the grace data e g rodell and famiglietti 2002 rodell et al 2004 swenson and wahr 2006 along with developed filtering technique and scaled gridded data adopted the grace data provides an effective way to monitor the terrestrial water storage changes allowing reliable estimation of the water budget and thereby making it possible to use monthly water balance data as another benchmark for verifying satellite retrievals of et although the uncertainties in the grace data are generally much greater because of its coarse spatial resolution therefore in this study with the multi data calibration i e flux cite observation data and monthly et data from the monthly water balance method with involving the terrestrial water storage changes based on grace production the daily et in the whole tp during the period of 1982 2012 was estimated using a modified pml model for considering evapotranspiration over snow covered area meanwhile the three components of et were partitioned and their spatial and temporal patterns were investigated moreover how the et components contribute to et changes and respond to the change in environmental factors in the tp was revealed this study is expected to improve the understanding of the regional hydrological cycle and the responses of water resources to environmental changes in the highest plateau in the world and thus to formulate hydro ecological conservation strategies against the potential menaces of global climate change 2 study regions data and method 2 1 study region ranging from 25 n to 40 n and from 74 e to 104 e fig 1 the tp with a total area of

the northern hemisphere which is an important part of the snow pack in eurasian chu et al 2017 the most areas of the tp are strongly influenced by the summer indian monsoon and east asian monsoon yao et al 2012 and are classified as arid and semiarid climate with distinct wet and dry seasons due to its complex and changeable climate conditions many studies have investigated the sensitives of the tp to global climate change and suggested that significant warming trends occurred during the last several decades resulting in remarkable changes of environment for instance permafrost melting glacier shrinkage vegetation change and decreasing snow cover days e g zhang et al 1996 su and shi 2002 cheng and wu 2007 et essential component for water and energy balance is significantly influenced by the environmental changing behavior in this study two types of basins on the tp with and without surface runoff flowing out of the basin were selected as study basins inland basins are

evapotranspiration was produced from both avhrr 1982 1999 and modis 2000 2012 data the glass longwave emissivity product was generated from both avhrr visible and near infrared reflectance ranging from 1982 to 1999 and modis seven black sky albedos ranging from 2000 to 2012 daily outgoing longwave radiation r lo was estimated by the surface emissivity and daily meteorological data details see eqs 12 and 13 of cleugh et al 2007 to guarantee data quality of lai albedo and emissivity quality assessment flags in the database were employed to delete poor quality data and the deleted data were replaced by interpolated values obtained from a piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial zhang and wegehenkel 2006 subsequently the quality controlled data were smoothed by the savitzky golay filtering method for each pixel which is widely used for filtering remote sensing data tsai and philpot 1998 ruffin et al 2008 the grace data was used to calculate the terrestrial water storage changes s the descriptions of grace gravity field solutions were provided by previous studies rodell and famiglietti 1999 tapley et al 2004 swenson and wahr 2006 approximately the spatial resolution of grace data was a few hundred kilometers but a reasonable consistency between grace estimated and site observation has already been demonstrated for basin scale e g rodell and famiglietti 2002 longuevergne et al 2010 landerer and swenson 2012 xue et al 2013 long et al 2014 here the domain averaged changes of terrestrial water storage for the basins on the tp were derived from the extracted terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa gridded data available on the grace tellus website which were processed by the center for space research csr the jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the geoforschungszentrum gfz based on the release 5 0 rl05 spherical harmonics a destriping filter and a glacial isostatic adjustment correction were applied to the data to minimize the error swenson and wahr 2006 landerer and swenson 2012 although an agreement with high temporal correlation coefficients and similar standard deviation of the monthly variation was found for twsa products generated by the three centers respectively li et al 2014 there were still differences due to different data processing methods among three products which would induce some uncertainties in estimates of et employing s from twsa products at the basin scale on the tp klees et al 2007 in this study s was thus extracted from the mean value of the three grace products to minimize the impact from individual errors of the three twsa estimates 2 2 2 meteorological data daily meteorology records from 1982 to 2012 used to drive the et algorithms include precipitation prec ta maximum temperature t max minimum temperature t min pressure atmosphere pres water vapor pressure wvp shortwave downward radiation srad and wind speed wind these meteorological records were obtained from two widely used datasets china meteorological forcing data set cmfd he and yang 2011 and the princeton global forcing data pgf sheffield et al 2012 at 0 1 and 0 25 spatial resolution t max and t min obtained from pgf can be found at http hydrology princeton edu data prec ta pres wvp srad and wind obtained from cmfd was produced by merging a variety of data sources and can be downloaded from the cold and arid regions science data center at lanzhou http westdc westgis ac cn it was found that the qualities of the records are comparable to measurements from ground observation networks in previous studies yang et al 2010 he and yang 2011 hu et al 2013a li et al 2014 she et al 2017 therefore the data are considered as reasonable quality for the et estimation all the meteorology records were interpolated into 0 05 to match up with the remote sensing data 2 2 3 runoff data and land cover the geographical distributions of the hydrological stations are shown in fig 1 observed discharge r for hydrological stations obtained from annual hydrological report p r china were used to drive the water balance method to estimate et two hydrological stations in source regions i e tangnaihai and zhimenda can provide the daily observed discharge while other six gauged stations including nuxia gongshan jiuzhou shigu luning and luding can only provide monthly runoff data in addition the accuracy of e c estimation rely heavily on the quality of land cover products consequently west data centre land cover product generated by the chinese academy of sciences westdc was used in our study because of better performance in china compared to the other four land cover products global land cover characteristics for the year 2000 documented by the european commission s joint research centre glc2000 the university of maryland land

academy of science and can be found at http westdc westgis ac cn 2 3 method 2 3 1 surface water balance in this study the traditional water balance method shown in eq 1 is used to estimate actual et hereafter et on a subbasin level by assuming there is no bias in the calculation process hobbins et al 2004 rodell et al 2004 xue et al 2013 li et al 2014 1 et p r δ s where r is the runoff depth mm p is the domain averaged precipitation mm and δs is the variation of terrestrial water storage mm including variations of surface subsurface and ground water usually p and r are obtained from situ observation data and δs is considered to be negligible over a long period generally annual or longer time scale hobbins et al 2004 li and shao 2010 xue et al 2013 li et al 2014 nevertheless δs can t be ignored at the monthly time scale for the inland basins i e qiangtang plateau qaidam basin and qinghai lake basin the runoff depth is zero the traditional water balance equation can thus be simplified as below 2 et p δ s 2 3 2 the modified penman monteith leuning pml algorithm the pml model leuning et al 2008 was used to measure et in this study the model based on the modified classic pm combination equation explicitly separates the contributions of vegetation ec soil es and rainfall interception ei to total evapotranspiration et ec es ei the pml model estimates ec can be written as 3 e c ε a c ρ c p γ d a g a ε 1 g a g c here a c 1 τ a is the net energy absorbed by the vegetation canopy each day where τ exp k a lai k a is the extinction coefficient for net radiation ε s γ where γ is the psychrometric constant and s de dt is the slope of the curve relating saturation water vapor pressure to temperature ρ is the density of air c p is the specific heat of air at constant pressure d a is the water vapor pressure deficit of the air at a reference height above the canopy and g a is the aerodynamic conductance in addition to the above variables the canopy conductance g c is required to calculate ec the biophysical variable was estimated using the following simple model kelliher et al 1995 isaac et al 2004 leuning et al 2008 4 g c g sx k q ln q h q 50 q h exp k q lai q 50 1 1 d a d 50 in which g sx is the apparent maximum stomatal conductance of leaves at the top of the canopy k q is the extinction coefficient for visible radiation and q h is the average flux density of visible radiation at the top of canopy the parameters d 50 and q 50 are the values of q h and d a respectively at which stomatal conductance is half its maximum value obviously g c estimated by eq 4 can change with q h and d a on various time scales and with lai on daily time scales soil evaporation is calculated in flowing equation 5 e s f ε a s ε 1 where a s τ a is the net energy absorbed by soil each day f is a coefficient which varies from f 1 when the soil surface is wet to f 0 when the soil surface is dry due to a lack of seasonally varying soil moisture data in this study the temporal variation in f for each grid cell was calculated by the ratio of total prec to the sum of equilibrium evaporation rate for four periods before and after the current 8 day period zhang et al 2010 in the pioneering work leuning et al 2008 noted that four parameters k q k a q 50 d 50 in pml model was insensitive to et and assigned constant values 0 6 0 6 2 6 mj m 2 d 1 0 7 kpa respectively accordingly only one parameter g sx must be calibrated following zhang et al 2010 we adjusted g sx to force agreement between the multi year averages of et estimated by the fu model e fu and the 31 yr averages of et calculated through the pml model e pml to calibrate g sx separately for each 0 05 pixel used in our study e pml can be estimated at a fine temporal resolution and e fu ensures a balance between the amount of available water and the energy available for evaporation on annual time scales e fu was produced by a variant of the budyko curve developed by fu 1981 combined with the optimized value of α α 2 33 and gridded meteorological dates for each 0 05 grid cell across study area details see zhang et al 2010 an adapted gash rainfall interception model with an assumption that there is no change between storms in the ratio of the wet canopy evaporation rate to the rainfall rate was used to model e i dijk et al 2001 due to the importance of snow pack in water resources and hydrology over the tp we modified the pml algorithm considering the evaporation over snow cover in this study we assumed that canopy transpiration over snow covered plants was negligible because of the stomatal closure at freezing temperature vinukollu et al 2011 and selected a simple equation for estimating snow sublimation 6 e snow f u e s e a where f u is a wind function typically of the form f u 0 26 1 0 54 u penman 1948 jensen 2010 in which u is the wind speed at 2 m above the surface e s e a is the vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa apart from the snow sublimation we also modified the algorithm for calculating the evaporation from water surface in the unfrozen period the penman equation penman 1948 was used to estimate water evaporation and was defined as 7 e water δ δ γ a λ γ δ γ e a where e water is the daily water evaporation mm day 1 e a represents the evaporative component owing to turbulent transport of water vapor through an eddy diffusion process which can be calculated by the form of eq 6 in the frozen period e water will take the sublimation form from the water surface and eq 6 was selected for estimating sublimation the daily t max and t min were used to determine the unfrozen periods ma et al 2016 3 result 3 1 model validation the modeled et was compared against the et observed by the eddy covariance method at the towers for the respective range of footprints the time series comparisons of the modeled et 8 day averaged based on the modified pml method and ground observed et collected from the 2 flux towers dangxiong and haibei ec sites were plotted in fig 2 in general the modeled seasonal curves were in good agreement with the observed ones although the modeled et tends to underestimate the tower observations for dangxiong site marsh wetland during the period days 136 238 for the two validation sites the et simulations using our modified et model showed generally better results in the snow cover period compared with that in the snow free periods for both dangxiong and haibei ec sites the coefficient of determination r2 values were 0 85 and 0 89 respectively the daily biases were 0 00029 mm day 1 and 0 000011 mm day 1 respectively and the root mean square error rmse was 0 013 and 0 006 mm day 1 respectively although the uncertainty of meteorological data is inevitable across different et algorithms zhang et al 2010 jung et al 2010 the small biases high coefficients of determination and low rmse between our simulated and the measured daily et indicated that the satellite based algorithm generally captured the observed daily variation and site to site differences in et besides the ec sites validation we also used the monthly et which is estimated by water balance method on a monthly basis based on the gridded prec values provided by westdc in situ observed r daily and the estimated δs from grace products as the regional averaged reference et in this study based on the regional averaged reference et we examined the modeled et in the three blind drainage basins by eq 2 however for the gauged catchments with only two hydrological stations covering daily reliable data we compared the reference and domain averaged model et in the source regions of yellow river and yangtze river by eq 1 fig 3 the results illustrated that the modified model offered a high accuracy for monthly et in the five basins the regional averaged et using the modified model accounted for 94 of the variation in the monthly reference et with rmse and bias bias of 0 075 mm month 1 and 0 0094 mm month 1 for all five validation basins respectively 3 2 calibration of fu model and regional gsx maps in this study the particle swarm optimization pso gill et al 2006 was used for the single parameter α calibration in the fu model using the mean annual water balance evaporation et across all eleven catchments the calibration result was presented in table 2 along with serval fit statistics such as bias rmse r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the result indicated that e fu estimated by using the optimized value of α 2 33 can explain 94 of the variance in e fu with a bias 9 33 mm year 1 an rmse 18 32 mm year 1 and an nse 0 93 hence at each grid cell the average for many years of et would well be estimated by fu model thereby calibrating the gsx separately the reasonable gsx map was shown in fig 4 a as can be seen there was a gradually decreasing gsx from the south to the north of the tp high values of gsx occurred in the southeast regions of the tp covered by forests and shrublands low values of gsx were mainly located in the west and north regions covered by grasslands and barren fig 4b shows estimates of gsx for different land cover classes for most classes values of gsx fall within the range of 0 003 0 01 m s 1 3 3 spatial and temporal differences in all et components we have applied the modified pml model with the 8 day glass products albedo lai emissivity etc and other meteorological data ta prec etc to estimate the daily et in the tp at a 0 05 spatial resolution from 1982 to 2012 the multiyear 1982 2012 average annual et e s e c and e i are shown in fig 5 which exhibited strong spatial variabilities and latitudinal gradients the et e c and e i showed similar spatial patterns with gradually decreasing et from southeast to northwest of the tp for et e c and e i the annual mean values were highest in the semi humid regions covered by forests and shrublands intermediate in the semiarid grassland regions central tp and the lowest in the arid regions including west and north of the tp covered by barren fig 5a c d however the largest e s occurred in the central and eastern tp followed by the southern tibet valley and western tp a smaller e s occurred in the northwest and northern tp fig 5b the terrestrial average annual et in the tp was 378 1 mm year 1 e s has the highest average value of 248 4 mm year 1 in et components followed by e c 65 2 mm year 1 and e i 32 5 mm year 1 on the whole the estimated terrestrial et in the tp after removal of the mean annual cycle showed a trend toward a small increase on average for the 1982 2012 period but the regional averaged et prec anomaly represented an opposite trend fig 6 a for the three et components the long term trends of anomalies were consistent and exhibited increased e s e c and e i fig 6b c d moreover the magnitude of e s anomaly is similar to e c with both differing from the magnitude of e i which had a smaller anomaly because of differences in the magnitudes of anomalies for et components the ratio anomalies of the components to total et differed substantially the ratio of e i to et showed a lower anomaly than those of e s and e c to et similarly most of trends in et components were increasing fig 7 the range of long term changes in e c and e i were very semblable and less than the range of e s trend hence e s trend had a greater contribution to et trend than other components although the median values for the contribution of e c and e i trend to total et trend were close fig 7 e c trend showed a larger averaged contribution which implies inconsistent magnitude distribution over the study region in terms of spatial pattern the differences between the long term et and three components were found over almost the entire territory of the tp but increasing trends in all of them occupied the largest percentage fig 8 in particular 91 3 of the area was dominated by the positive et trend while the area with negative trends in et was comparatively centralized in the midstream brahmaputra and the south of the tp fig 8a similarly positive trend in e s accounts for approximately 83 3 of the tp differently although 78 3 and 76 3 of regions in the tp exhibited positive trends in e c and e i respectively only about 40 of them showed strong positive trends in addition despite consistent inter annual significantly positive trends located in the central tp in e s e c and e i no consistent trends were found among the three et components in most of the regions in the tp over the north and west of the tp e c and e i indicated negative trends while the opposite trend was found in e s also inconsistent change trends were found in the southern and southeast of the tp with negative e s trend and positive trends indicated in e c and e i fig 8b c d 3 4 the controlling factors of the et components et and its components are regulated by many biological and meteorological factors such as solar radiation vapor pressure deficit air temperature and lai in this study using daily mean values of the et estimates and the meteorological input data for prec ta and the net radiation rn from 1982 to 2012 the spatial distributions of the correlations between et and the three environmental variables were mapped fig 9 a there was a strong correlation between et and water supply over most regions of the tp also a visible correlation between et and prec was found over the west and north of the tp which matches the spatial patterns of dryness as it decreases from northwest to southeast in the tp in addition rn played an important role in the eastern and northwest section of the tp for e s prec and ta played important roles in deriving e s and were the determining input variables as confirmed by fig 9b moreover fig 9b highlighted the importance of rn in the east and southeast area of the tp different from et and e s vegetation i e lai regulates the variability in e c throughout the tp and only in the eastern tp ta was another dominated factor in e c fig 9c relative to the importance of lai in e c estimation lai controlled the e i variations in the entire tp except in the central and southeastern tp where the e i was regulated by prec furthermore e i also strongly correlated with prec and ta in the east of the tp fig 9d in order to quantify the impacts of environmental regulations on the area averaged et the controlling variables were detrended and the difference between the detrended actual et and the re estimated et with original series was identified with the stepwise regressions analysis for illustrative purposes the results of contribution analysis for five major environmental variables were plotted in fig 9e all five major variables can explain 93 of the et trend with prec explaining 61 lai 46 and vpd 13 of the et trend while wind and rn exhibited a negative contribution to the et trend with 7 and 20 respectively the result showed that the et trend in the tp was dominated by prec and lai resemble contribution analyses were carried out for et components i e e s e c and e i and the results are demonstrated in fig 9 f h the overall impression from the contribution of environmental variables is that except for the negative contributions of wind and rn other variables displayed positive contributions to the trends in et components the strong positive contributions of prec to the trends in three et components were found to explain 64 24 and 65 respectively as for wind speed only a lower negative contribution to the trends in e s and e i was shown higher positive contributions of lai to the trends of e c and e i were found to explain 58 and 26 and vpd and rn contributed the least to the trends in e c and e i in addition ta displayed higher positive contribution to the trend of e s 4 discussion 4 1 performance of the modified pml model one advantage offered by the modified pml model in comparison with other complicated et models is that the model builds functional relationships between et and predictor variables considering explicit biophysical mechanisms and multiyear water energy coupling balance concurrently allowing for the evaporation from snow cover landscapes and its effect on other et components is another superiority due that snow sublimation constitutes as one of the most important aspects of water resources and hydrology in the higher altitude macdonald et al 2010 also in consideration of lower values of et encountered when snow covering is high du et al 2004 suggested that snow sublimation should be calculated in monthly and annual time scales for climate studies moreover the input remote sensing variables also exert great influences on the performance of the modified model here the glass products which are of higher quality and accuracy than existing products and highly suitable for various environmental studies with much longer time series were adopted liang et al 2013 liu et al 2013 therefore the daily model et results agreed well with the et observations from the tower sites however there is still differences between the modeled et and the observed et the following limitations associated with the eddy flux validation can effectively account for the differences 1 we used 0 05 glass lai grid cells for eddy flux footprints that change throughout the day and year previous studies have illustrated that the pixel to footprint mismatch makes process based model calibration challenging anderson et al 2003 compared the measured et with the estimated from the 5 5 1 km2 cells and showed that uncertainties may be introduced because of differences in tower footprints due to land surface heterogeneity there are errors in large regional et estimates based on tower measurements mccabe and wood 2006 2 currently large scale et can only be directly validated with ec observations therefore scaling beyond an ec footprint is largely unknown vinukollu et al 2011 whereas energy balance closure at flux sites is imperfect because of complexity in wind variation footprint representation and sampling variability twine et al 2000 wilson et al 2002 about 10 of the variation can t be explained by the eddy flux sites as such only an r2 of around 0 9 would be achieved with the best model which is generally what our model produces meanwhile for values of gsx the range of 0 003 0 01 m s 1 is physiologically reasonable and consistent with previous study e g kelliher et al 1995 given the large number of grid cells in the two classes the corresponding mean values were reasonable although the median values of gsx for grasslands barren and unclassified were less than 0 003 fig 4b moreover due to the lack of irrigation inputs in the water balance equation gsx for irrigated cropland was underestimated besides previous study has suggested that additional work was required to improve the model calibration and validation except the ec sites chen et al 2014 jung et al 2010 and vinukollu et al 2011 have calculated evapotranspiration by meteorological prec and runoff to investigate model performance without considering the change in terrestrial water storage in this study the monthly estimated results have been compared with the reference et derived from climatological prec monitored basin discharge and grace which is providing earth s gravity field for inferring sufficiently precise regional water mass variations in addition the results show a little underestimation in the regional scale due to the small area of the three basins qinghai lake basin the upper yangtze and upper yellow river basin this result can be explained because changes in the gravity field obtained from grace satellites provide an opportunity to better constrain the water budget equation for deriving twsa at a spatial resolution of 200 000 km2 long et al 2014 4 2 multidecadal trends for et and the contribution of components regional scale et has been estimated and evaluated in many research reports by applying models which integrate mechanistic processes or empirical relationships e g papale and valentini 2003 yang et al 2006 wang et al 2007 fisher et al 2008 yuan et al 2010 but its partitioning is not well known and few researchers have diagnosed even though it is important on land atmosphere interaction and land surface schemes the objective of this paper is to partition et and quantify its components based on the modified pml model in the tp three main et components i e e s e c and e i were included in the estimation our results showed that the highest et occurs in the southeast of the tp and the lowest et occurs in the northwest of the tp fig 5 similar findings on et have also been obtained with the modified pm mu method another retrieval algorithm by song et al 2017 besides compared with et et components ec and ei exhibit similar spatial patterns while with the highest es occurring in the central tp the spatial patterns of es is different in addition e s is the dominant component followed by e c and e i except the semi humid regions located in the southeast tp with high canopy cover although previous analyses have suggested that among the et components vegetation transpiration was the dominated component on the global scale e g brunel et al 1997 kool et al 2014 lawrence et al 2007 demonstrated that e s is a more significant component of et in arid and semiarid regions which has supported our conclusion moreover previous studies suggested that global warming have accelerated the hydrological cycle especially on the tp huntington 2006 yang et al 2011 yin et al 2013 ding et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 showed that green up dates continuously advanced in the tp during the period of 1982 2011 and yang et al 2012a mentioned that the lengthening of the seasonal non frozen period caused by global warming in this study we found that the tp overall became wetter although et and its three main components show positive trends regionally our estimation results demonstrate that there are increasing trends in et and its components over most of the tp fig 8 similarly in the earlier studies by zhang et al 2007 and wang et al 2013 et increased markedly across the tp corresponding to an increase of surface temperature zhang et al 2015 found that the inter annual et increased in the tp with a positive water supply trend based on the global land et trends map furthermore due to the increasing precipitation and the degenerating permafrost in the central north and west tp meng et al 2017 e s shows a positive trend while the decline of e s in the southeast tp can be attributed to the decreasing solar radiation previous analyses indicated that decreasing normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and ta occurred in the northwest tp with vegetation degradation while ndvi and ta tend to increase in the rest of tp associated with climate warming e g chen et al 2014 therefore an similar spatial pattern of long term trends the negative trend in northwest areas and the rise of the trend in the rest of the domain is found in e c and e i 4 3 spatial differences of primary environmental controlling regulations for et and components water and energy have long been considered as the most important factors spatially and temporally driving ecosystem evapotranspiration in the field of both hydrometeorology and agronomy donohue et al 2006 in the present study although strong correlation between et simulation and ta over most of the tp prec has the largest contribution to the high trend over the entire tp followed by lai fig 9 these results are consistent with previous researches for example shen et al 2015 suggested that increased growing season vegetation activity may have enhanced et and cool growing season temperatures over the tp were probably not a strong limitation on et however it should be noted that the actual et would increase with the decline of wind speed in the tp this finding appears to be inconsistent with the previous studies e g chen et al 2014 which quantified the sensitivity of rates of evaporation demand to changes in wind speed and highlighted the contribution of the terrestrial stilling to declining rates of evaporation demand in fact in severely water limited regions et trends are more closely related with trends in available water supply in an earlier study by mcvicar et al 2012 water supply was proved to control the change of et in the tp while wind speed generally exerted smaller direct influence on the et besides the dominant variables for major et components is very different our analyses indicate that prec dominates the variation of e s and e i while the e c variation is controlled by lai fig 9 this may be explained by the strong correlation between prec and soil moisture meng et al 2017 concurrently the magnitudes are similar for the contributions of three environmental variables vpd ta and rn to the trend in es among the three variables both vpd and ta have positive contributions while rn has a negative contribution analogously ta is another important meteorological variable influencing e c because the stomatal conductance can be significantly altered by ta vinukollu et al 2011 however unlike the negative contribution of terrestrial stilling to the trends in et and e s a positive contribution of wind speed to e i can be found this result can be confirmed by the fact that strong winds would damage canopy cover and reduce the canopy interception with the rise of throughfall waterloo 1994 4 4 limitations of the current study although recent studies have tested the good performance of satellite retrieval algorithms in regional et estimation and attributed to the parameterization e g leuning et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 wang et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b there are still some limitations in the current work of using modified pml model to retrieve et in the tp for example the effects of carbon dioxide co2 and soil moisture on stomatal conductance are not included in the model in addition we have estimated soil heat fluxes using a simple semi empirical method because the mechanisms of soil heat fluxes are still uncertain also large deviation may be induced by key parameters using empirical values besides the uncertainty of the model structure the input data can also cause uncertainty in the model outputs mixed pixels and the changes in land cover may result in a bias in the modeled et furthermore it is necessary to collect et components measurements using some widely recognized methods e g stable isotope and sap flow to examine the accuracy of et sub components 5 conclusions based on our modified pml model this study presented here reveals more precise spatiotemporal dynamics of et and its components on the tp at 8 day scale the validated results manifest that the modeled et can explain between 85 and 95 of the variability in et and indicate that the modified pml model is very reliable in estimating the et on a large regional scale mean annual et estimate is 378 1 mm year 1 which is dominated by e s 248 4 mm year 1 followed by e c 65 2 mm year 1 and e i 32 5 mm year 1 regionally from high to low value a clear southeastern northwestern gradient can be found in the study region for et the patterns of e c and e i distribution are similar with that of et but a lower e s occurs in southeast tp and regions in central and eastern tp have the highest e s furthermore there are substantial differences in the contribution of environmental regulations to the trends in et and its components lai and prec are the dominated variables of et e c and e i whereas e s is controlled by vpd ta rn and prec accompanying with the increment in prec and lai and the lengthening of the seasonal non frozen period regional averaged et and its major components show consistently increasing trends conversely the ratio of et to prec is reduced indicating that the tp become wetter in the past several decades acknowledgments this work

7398,mismanagement has caused the overexploitation of one third of the major aquifers in mexico mainly due to excessive water extraction for agricultural irrigation santo domingo baja california sur in northern mexico where agriculture absorbs nearly 80 of water is the only aquifer in the mexico where after a period of overexploitation equality between extraction and recharge rates was achieved although this has not meant the securement of long term water availability this paper offers an analysis of hydrological resilience of a water limited arid ecosystem under future extraction scenarios and changing climate conditions a regional groundwater flow model is proposed using modflow software then different indicators were modeled as outcomes of coupled human water systems to predict water trajectories under different human impacts the aim was to recognize water insecurity scenarios and define appropriate actions to a more sustainable use of this scarce resource in the region thus although runoff derived from extreme floods may favor infiltration the involvement of local stakeholders and decision makers to reverse the adverse impacts of current water management and climate

has caused the overexploitation of 36 of the major aquifers in mexico mainly due to excessive water extraction for agricultural irrigation in the case of coastal aquifers this has led to seawater

agriculture absorbs nearly 80 of water is the only aquifer in the country where equality between where the extraction and recharge rates have been balanced but secure long term water availability is a multi faceted problem that goes beyond mere balancing of supply and demand to include the assessment of resilience to climate change and identification of adaptation measures this assessment depends on a holistic approach to water resource management that involves local stakeholders and decision makers the main objective of this paper is to quantify the hydrological resilience of this water

represents an area of 10 781 km2 using modflow software the database includes information on the irrigated area and typeofcrops water consumption soil texture and chemistry and water quality at 600 ranches in the irrigation district these indicators were modeled as outcomes of coupled human water systems to predict water trajectories under different human impacts in order to recognize water insecurity scenarios and define appropriate actions to a more sustainable use of this scarce resource in the region yet this situation may not occur under natural conditions as future scenarios indicate calling for needed changes in water management and practices thus we present actions to be implemented that allow based on a socio hydrological approach the participation of stakeholders at multiple scales to facilitate improved feedback between the water sector and society 2 socio hydrological resilience as a conceptual framework it is widely accepted that integrated approaches can lead to sustainability sustainability is defined as a requirement of our generation to manage the resource base such that the average quality of life that we ensure ourselves can potentially be shared by all future generations development is sustainable if it involves a non decreasing average quality of life asheim 1994 hence there is wide consensus on the need for multidisciplinary or multidimensional water resources management buytaert et al 2014 and paul et al 2017 argue that water management problems are no longer predominantly addressed as technical issues but have become part of a complex policy process in which different stakeholders and institutions are involved norgaard 1981 walker et al 2004 manson 2008 sandker et al 2010 sustainable growth is only conceivable if accompanied by the satisfaction of those cultural and material needs that are indispensable for all individuals sharma and sharma 2011 jonathan et al 2017 to live with the self esteem to which every individual is entitled sivapalan et al 2012 2014 have foregrounded the human role in the water cycle by establishing socio hydrology as a perspective to understand the complex approach in the hydrological resource management aimed to create resilience in this paper we adopt socio hydrology resilience for understanding and assessing resilience in combined socio hydrological contexts mao et al 2017 and apply it to the case study of santo domingo aquifer resilience is the capacity of individuals ecosystems or human communities to persist in the face of change to continue to develop with ever changing environments folke 2016 as mao et al 2017 recall this concept is understood as a set of systemic absorptive adaptive and transformative capacities in three dimensions persistence for now and response for future contingencies in incremental or in radical ways hydrological resilience is the ability of a catchment to absorb disturbance and maintain or quickly regain hydrologic function it also provides new insights into the clarification and evaluation of different water management challenges mao et al 2017 according to such definition we make reference to three resilience framings for different types of human water systems and subsystems 1 water subsystem the hydrological resilience to anthropogenic impacts 2 human subsystem the social resilience to hydrological hazards and stress and 3 combined human water system which is explored using a strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats approach as a tool to enhance socio hydrological resilience particularly important is the third type that emphasizes the interactions between human and water components within complex systems subject to internal or external disturbances we argue that the combined water human system is the most appropriate tool to design strategies for resilient management of the hydrological resources of santo domingo aquifer climate change or increased human hazards may degrade aquatic ecosystems or propel them to irreversible undesired end states magombeyi et al 2006 prompting a need to consider options for resilient socio hydrological water management folke et al 2010 fernald et al 2015 3 methodology 3 1 santo domingo aquifer as the area of study the valley of santo domingo is located in the middle of the mexican state of baja california sur in the municipality of comondú the climate is characterized by very arid conditions warm climate at the coast to temperate climate in the sierra la giganta mountain range with a temperature interval ranging from an average maximum of 43 3 c to a low of 1 89 c the predominant natural vegetation in the arid and semi arid zone is sarcocaulescent scrubland the average annual rainfall reaches only 150 mm the range of precipitation is between 50 and 300 mm per year of which 30 occurs in the winter and 70 during summer cna 2002 in the summer season runoff is frequently generated from rainfall caused mainly by tropical cyclones the hurricane season begins in mid may and ends in november wurl and martínez gutiérrez 2006 the valley of santo domingo is subdivided into three watersheds santo domingo in the north las bramonas in the middle and the santa cruz watershed in the south fig 1 the uncontrolled extraction of groundwater and especially the over exploitation of the santo domingo aquifer from 1957 onwards has caused modifications to the natural flow system and induced a lateral inflow of seawater from the pacific coast as a result the groundwater quality in the santo domingo irrigation district 0 6 6 is deteriorating the valle de santo domingo represents the most important region for agricultural and livestock in the state where agricultural activities cover an area of 72 409 ha the first wells for agriculture use were installed in the late 1940s two decades later water withdrawals had already reached 250 million m3 per year which significantly exceeds the annual average recharge of 188 million m3 estimated by the mexican national water commission cna 2002 in the 1970s the number of wells was above 500 units and extractions reached about 300 million m3 per year the highest extractions occurred in the late 1980s with withdrawals of up to 450 million m3 per year 2 4 times the annual average recharge over exploitation between 1956 and 2002 meant a deficit of 4753 million m3 of groundwater semarnap 1996 a gradual reduction in the extraction rate began in the 1990s in order to reduce the negative effects of over pumping and to achieve an equal balance between recharge and extraction fig 2 although equilibrium in respect to the medium annual recharge rate was finally achieved in 2003 the extraction rate nearly equaled the estimated recharge rate of 188 million m3 per year in the following years the cone of depression stopped increasing its volume but its size still grews and its center deepenes as a result of a 50 year over exploitation a change in the hydrochemical composition of groundwater has been observed acsa 1969 tmi 1978 desisa 1997 cardona et al 2004 due tu sea water intrusion water returns derived from irrigation and the mobilization of deeper groundwater with higher mineralization semarnap 1996 cardona et al 2004 wurl et al 2008 the recharge of groundwater depends on intense rainfall events which are produced by tropical cyclones characterized by high intensity and short duration storm water enters rapidly into the valley s drainage system ephemeral or intermittent streambeds called arroyos but due to geomorphological conditions subsurface drainage is generally incapable to infiltrate an important part of the runoff which then flows into the pacific ocean geomorphologically valley of santo domingo is divided into two main units the upper parts hills plateaus and hillocks of the sierra la giganta mountains are mainly composed of volcanic rocks tuffaceous sandstones and agglomerates of fine to medium grain with low infiltration capacity the lower parts form a coastal plain of unconsolidated sediments derived from the sierra la giganta that covers sedimentary rocks high infiltration capacities characterize this unit 3 1 1 climate variability and environmental change according to estimates of the ipcc a decrease in the annual rainfall rate in several geographical areas is expected leading to a deficit in available water a lower annual precipitation implies that the aquifers will tend to decrease in recharge and cause a deficit amplifying the imbalance in water systems on the contrary an excess of rainwater may cause negative impacts to the population due to torrential floods that would eventually affect urban areas the two models selected for the comparison of probable climate changes in the near and far future for the study area are the hadgem2 es model and the rea assembly giorgi and mearns 2002 whose adaptation was established in reference to the climatological database of the national meteorological service smn 1961 2000 the rea assembly model for mexico is based on information from 15 mgc details on the methodology and weighting are given by conde et al 2011 the hadgem2 es model for the study area figs 3 and 4 shows notable differences in future estimates of temperature and precipitation with respect to the rea assembly figs 3 and 4 which behaves more discreetly 3 2 groundwater model to understand the hydraulic behavior of seawater intrusion a groundwater model was developed to model different recharge reduction scenarios according to the rea assemblage rcp 8 5 provided by national institute of ecology and climate change inecc 2013 2014 which estimated a rainfall mean reduction up to 37 for the short term future in the manual calibration process the hydraulic conductivity specific yield and specific storage were used in order to achieve the observed hydraulic head levels during the period 1996 2013 modeled scenarios were the years 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 in order to define a critic date when the drawdown cone will reach the coast increasing the inflow of seawater into the aquifer 3 2 1 model design the groundwater model was constructed using modflow 2000 and includes the following two natural boundaries the coastline of the pacific ocean to the west and the fractured aquitard of the sierra de la giganta mountains to the east fig 3 sea level was simulated with specific head conditions at the coastline the starting heads were obtained from semarnap 1996 to the north south and east the model is limited by no flow conditions where an influx can be neglected the finite difference mesh consisted of 221 columns and 197 rows with a size of 500 m per cell so that the model includes 43 537 cells and represents an area of 10 781 km2 the initial conditions of the model were the 1996 water levels provided by conagua the top of the aquifer was recalculated from a digital elevation model with a resolution of 30 m obtained from inegi the thickness of the aquifer was defined from bore logs and based on geologic cross sections and the re interpretation of resistivity soundings documented in semarnap 1996 3 2 2 hydraulic parameters the initial specific yield and specific storage were obtained from semarnap 1996 and introduced cell by cell after the calibration step specific storage and specific yield values are ranging between 0 0008 to 0043 m 1 and 0 07 to 0 26 respectively fig 5 the hydraulic conductivity was calculated from the textural classification data of 554 sediment samples taken in the valley of santo domingo applying the methodology from shiozawa and campbell 1991 the resulting values range from 8 to 58 m d see fig 5 3 2 3 recharge according to conagua 2015 the average annual recharge of the aquifer in the valley of santo domingo is 188 million m3 of which 77 correspond to natural infiltration while the remaining 23 are due to an irrigation return flow conagua 2015 this recharge results from four different processes recharge from direct infiltration of rainfall recharge resulting from the infiltration of surface water in the arroyos after storm events horizontal groundwater flow from the sierra de la giganta aquitard and seawater intrusion from the river mouths of the arroyos santo domingo and las bramonas into the aquifer the recharge package was used to simulate recharge from direct infiltration of rainfall the recharge resulting from the infiltration of surface water in the arroyos after storm events was simulated through the streamflow package str1 which uses darcy s law and assumes a continuous stream flow from the stream surface to the aquifer and calculates its corresponding volume introduced into the aquifer prudic et al 2004 the main drainage system was introduced into the groundwater model and based on the streamflow module results from synthetic hydrographs calculated with the amount of surface water generated in the watershed of the sierra la giganta mountains were calculated with the hec 1 program 1 hec 1990 taken in account different rainfall scenarios the relation between precipitation and total runoff volume was reported from 3 runoff rates introduced to str1 were obtained from synthetic hydrographs calculated with hec 1 hec 1990 and taken different rainfall scenarios the relation between precipitation and total runoff volume was reported from semarnap 1996 horizontal groundwater flow from sierra de la giganta fractured aquifer was simulated with a volume of 40 mm3 per year as influx to the model 3 2 4 extractions and time steps a total of 710 wells and the corresponding extraction rates were introduced into the model taking in account the variations observed between 1996 semarnap 1996 and 2007 from 2008 onwards we assumed near equilibrium conditions as indicated by conagua 2015 for the future scenarios a 23 of the extractions were reduced in order to simulate an irrigation return flow for each year the model includes infiltration caused by runoff calculated based on the maximum the rain events and obtained from the hydrological model during a maximum of 10 days 3 2 5 calibration and prognostic run well head data observed between 1996 and 2007were obtained by the national water commission conagua and the 2013 data were obtained from garcía martínez 2014 to calibrate the model in transient state mode for each year the model includes infiltration caused by runoff calculated based on the maximum the rain events and obtained from the hydrological model during a maximum of 10 days the original hydraulic parameters were calibrated after calibration step the reduction of recharge scenarios due to climate change was simulated the estimation of seawater intrusion for the santo domingo arroyo rivermouth was calculated with the water balance of this specific zone considering an inverse flow of water levels in the manual calibration process the hydraulic conductivity specific yield and specific storage were changed by zones to achieve a concordance between the observed and simulated hydraulic head levels during the period 1996 2013 a total of 119 randomly chosen points were selected for each year of calibration after the model calibration different scenarios were generated maintaining or reducing extraction rates the difference between the calculated and the observed levels at 119 randomly chosen points for the year 2013 is presented in fig 6 3 2 hydrochemical analysis the composition of major ions in ground water permits to determine the relation between the groundwater and intruded seawater in coastal aquifers especially the total mineralization na and cl conagua provided us with the concentrations of the macro constituents in 4375 ground water analyses taken from 710 agriculture wells between 1986 and 2005 which were interpreted with respect to changes in the groundwater composition this interpretation is based on piper ternary diagrams maps of sodium and chloride concentrations in groundwater and the ratio of cl hco3 co3 as an indicator to define seawater intrusion as proposed by bear et al 1999 4 the role of stakeholder engagement in water use assessment and resilience strategies design the term participation typically refers to some aspect of local community involvement in the design implementation and evaluation of a project or plan brown and wyckoff baird 1992 public participation encompasses a range of procedures and methods designed to consult involve and inform the public to allow those that would be potentially affected by a decision or policy to have input into the process the latter is also known as stakeholders iap 2007 public participation or stakeholder s engagement involves both individual and group input carr 2015 krueger et al 2016 stakeholders participation is key to evaluating resilience in any system adaptation is a process by which strategies to moderate cope with and take advantage of the consequences of climatic events are enhanced developed and implemented conde and lohsdale 2005 adaptation occurs through public policy making and decisions made by stakeholders i e individuals groups organizations governmental agencies or non governmental organizations ngos and their networks relevant stakeholders need to be brought together to evaluate the resilience and to identify the most appropriate forms of adaptation jones et al 2001 analysing the capacity of stakeholders to cope with and adapt to climatic events is fundamental to characterizing current and possible future resilience jones 2000 understanding the role of stakeholders in the decision making process will assist in the implementation of adaptation policies in short stakeholders are central to the resilience assessment and adaptation process in order to assess social resilience regarding the water system we used swot strengths weaknesses opportunities threats analysis as part of socio hydrological resiliency planning the main idea of the analysis is to see how to maximize opportunities and efficiently protect against threats according to david 1997 building an assessment matrix allows the formulation of future improvement and development strategies during the process we were seeking and valuing diverse voices making a special effort to hear and understand those who for various reasons may otherwise go unheard the stakeholders were selected by following criteria 1 they represent a particular community or an important subgroup of population of the santo domingo valley 2 they would provide technical knowledge and or essential information to the process 3 to ensure the coherence of the project 4 to ensure the application of the project 5 because they are holders of rights in the project area the following key principles were considered in the implementation of the public participation or stakeholder engagement process ifc 2007 providing meaningful information in a format and language that is readily understandable and tailored to the needs of the target stakeholder group s an accessible slide presentation was delivered to the stakeholders before the meeting providing information in advance of consultation activities and decision making some of the results were shared in advance with ngos and business sector by e mail disseminating information in ways and locations that allow ease of access by stakeholders the main results and related data were uploaded to the website of the university and municipality respect for local traditions languages time frames and decision making processes two way dialogue research team and stakeholders that gives both sides the opportunity to exchange views and information to listen and to have their issues heard and addressed inclusiveness in representation of views including women vulnerable and or minority groups the three last principles were implemented by the following work dynamics the stakeholders were divided in three panels with facilitator after clearly explaining the issue or topic the facilitator asked the participants to write each idea or information element the files of the participants were collected and the information was synthesized on a flipchart eliminating all repetitions then each element of the responses was discussed afterwards each panel proceeded to agree on ideas and discuss possible solutions to the problems detected one of the most common techniques we used was to encourage debate and organize ideas into cards the ideas adopted by each panel as a result of the discussion and complemented by survey results are presented in the peste matrix public participation is important as a mechanism to break down and address complex decisions by different stakeholders who can provide new information views needs and interests this approach offers an opportunity for stakeholders to better understand the range of views on an issue implementation can also be improved with public consent and commitment on the process yielding higher quality decisions and the ability to better allocate scarce resources yee 2010 the generic profile of stakeholders in resilient water management strategies design was categorized into the following types government agencies agriculture representatives research or academic institutions special interest groups local community representatives interest groups or other organizations government agencies 15 agriculture representatives 30 research or academic institutions 10 local communities representatives 30 interest groups or ngos 15 between 2008 and 2010 four consultation forums were held on the recovery plan of the valle de santo domingo aquifer on the event held in ciudad constitución the main population center in the santo domingo valley 85 panelists participated representing communities all municipal state and federal governments and non governmental organizations another three fora were held in small communities with the participation of 15 20 persons at each the objective was to access most of the local population although the type of participants and the work dynamics was very similar the methods to engage with stakeholders and register their public participation were the following public meetings that offered an opportunity for anyone with an interest in the subject of the consultation to express concerns and gain a broader perspective of concerns in a short period of time public meetings started with a technical overview of the situation and process then provided opportunity for members of the public to speak from the floor regarding their concerns or to ask questions of expert panelists surveys were applied to collect information solicit opinions and build a profile of the groups and individuals involved survey data provided information and helped focus the large number of stakeholder views aside from the system s internal resources and factors there are several other macro economic factors that can have a profound impact on the performance of socio hydrological management these factors need to be carefully analyzed in order to determine their role in resilience building success that is why the swot analysis is combined with a pest political economic social technological analysis in this study aguilar 1967 which looks at the broader political economic social and technological factors and provides a macro environmental view pest methodology was developed with the following additions economic factors are complemented by financial considerations and social components are enriched by cultural aspects very specific to our case study we have also included environmental factors due to their importance in assessing socio hydrological resilience therefore the pest analysis in this study becomes a peste political economic social technological environmental analysis 5 results 5 1 principal types of groundwater the analyses were considered reliable applying the rules established in dvwk 1992 where the following two main groundwater types can be distinguished in the first type 89 of the cases chloride represents the main anion the main cation is sodium in 77 calcium 17 magnesium 7 the second group with bicarbonates as main anion represents 33 of the samples seawater intrusion affected samples represents 15 of group 1 the relationships between main cations and anions in groundwater are shown in a piper trilinear diagram see fig 7 5 2 seawater intrusion chemical signature two zones were identified with high concentrations of chlorides and sodium and values of cl hco3 co3 ratio above 2 the first one located in the santo domingo basin on its western side shows values of sodium above 400 mg l chloride from 800 to 1500 mg l and cl hco3 co3 ranging from 3 to 6 the second zone is located in the las bramonas basin on its western side values of sodium range from 400 to 500 mg l chloride from 600 to 1500 mg l and cl hco3 co3 ranging from 3 to 6 in both sites a dispersion plume orientated to the southeast is observed see fig 8 in the santo domingo basin values of electrical conductivity near the coast range from 780 to 8760 µs cm 5 3 estimation of seawater inflow for santo domingo basin the results from likely scenarios on the hydrogeological conditions of the santo domingo aquifer show that the total runoff derived from extreme floods mainly generated by tropical cyclones represents the most important additional source of water as it infiltrates and recharges the aquifer simulations indicate that a reduction of the recharge related to climate change will increase the maximum depth of the drawdown cone from 48 m in 2017 up to 78 m for 2050 and it is expected that the 0 level of the drawdown cone will reach the coast between 2030 and 2040 as seen in fig 9 the amount of seawater being intruded just from the river mouth of santo domingo creek will increase from 0 36 to 1 3 mm3 a year 5 4 results of the swot peste analysis human resilience in the agricultural sector of the santo domingo valley as mentioned before the santo domingo valley is the most important agricultural center in baja california sur its origins go back to the 1940s as the mexican government s attempt to populate a distant and isolated territory with people from other parts of the country as a result 73 agricultural colonies were established with subsidies and financial support from the government land water well perforation machinery seeds trained personnel and social infrastructure were available to settlers the green revolution had a relevant part in the subsequent agricultural boom which was met with a growing demand in the united states however in 1954 only five years after it became fully productive more water well perforation was prohibited as water became scarce and its quality compromised by excessive extraction márquez salaices 2017 currently as in the rest of the peninsula of baja california export oriented agricultural production is on the rise mainly by foreign investment the introduction of high water consuming crops such as oranges wheat tomatoes watermelon and potatoes persist and although there is a high degree of modern irrigation technics greenhouses and technified irrigation water remains scarce and local producers face polluted soils by agrochemicals and fertilizers debt and low productivity renting their land or water concessions has become a means of income but the region has become increasingly depopulated in a context in which agriculture is still the main economic activity local producers need to be persistent adaptive and transformative bennett et al 2014 especially considering climate change producers have to be persistent in their efforts to preserve the economic activity on which their livelihood is based they must adapt to the present and expected impact of climate changes transforming the traditional pathways of farming through implementation of new technologies crop changes and water use optimization table 1 shows the main results of the consultation forums carried out with the participation of stakeholders in the santo domingo valley from the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats political economic sociocultural technological and ecological analysis which recent applied research has confirmed with márquez salaices 2017 6 discussion it is important to highlight that the interdisciplinary work in this article was inspired by the indications of the fifth assessment report ar5 of the ipcc in the ar5 the bureau of the ipcc managed to include several issues that were previously considered outside the scope of research on climate change these topics indicate the need to relate scientific research eg scenarios water resources extreme events to social science topics such are sustainable development ethics equity and human rights including these issues and relating them to the main strands of climate action mitigation and adaptation is of the utmost importance to make decision makers see that climate policies should be an integral part of the broader sustainable development policies and that resources to combat climate change at the same time are addressing socio economic development priorities vulnerable communities food supply creation of green jobs etc ivanova boncheva and pichs 2017 as a result of this collaboration the scenarios for the ar5 are prepared in a combined manner between 1 projections of future emissions 2 projections of future climate change 3 narrative descriptions quantitative and qualitative of socioeconomic conditions and stakeholders opinions which represent challenges to mitigation and adaptation and 4 mitigation and adaptation policies the developed scenarios provide an integrated framework for creating and comparing mitigation adaptation and residual climate impacts at the sectoral and regional levels ibidem even though the mexican government claims that the santo domingo valley aquifer is stabilized in terms of a water mass balance between recharge versus extraction rates this calculation does not exclude the volume of seawater intrusion from the calculated recharge volume the flow model presented here indicates that initial saltwater intrusion has occurred and that water quality of the northern part of the aquifer santo domingo watershed as well as in the central part las bramonas watershed is seriously compromised the amount of seawater intrusion from the santo domingo mouth will be 3 6 times in 2050 the resulting increment of groundwater salinization will lead to soil chemistry and permeability deterioration with adverse consequences for the region s environment economy and population it is likely that more water will be used in order to wash out soil salinity the intrusion of seawater into the santo domingo aquifer dates back to the year 1968 when agricultural production increased in the context of the green revolution causing overexploitation of the aquifer troyo et al 2010 the aquifer of hermosillo in the neighboring state of sonora faced a similar situation and may serve as an example of a worst case scenario given its comparable conditions to the santo domingo aquifer in the hermosillo aquifer a saline water intrusion front started since 1975 at a 0 65 m year velocity rate rangel et al 2003 and until 2008 had formed a 80 km parallel fringe to the shoreline penetrating the aquifer to a depth of 28 km to 32 km with e c values up to 40 000 µs cm szynkiewicz et al 2008 reverting and at least partly restoring the natural condition of the hermosillo aquifer requires decades of time and government investment which in turn implies high social and economic costs rangel medina et al 2004 several initiatives in the santo domingo valley have been put forward for the agriculture activity to continue relying mostly on government subsidies more than 50 of the farms have installed automatized irrigation systems additionally an agricultural experimental research center located in the santo domingo valley suggests farmers options to optimize land use change crop patterns and introduce advanced irrigation methods since the nineties urciaga 1992 farmers can access this information through a consultation system on internet where the environmental characteristics potential areas and technology of crop production are documented for each farm of the valle de santo domingo irrigation district meza and ojeda 2006 in general farmers have followed both strategies and nowadays produce is mostly fruits and vegetables rather than cotton or wheat as before however even using high tech irrigation has not solved water overexploitation this is of concern since climate conditions may be more extreme in the nearer future according to hadgem2 es and rea assembly climatic models giorgi and mearns 2002 conde et al 2011 seasonal rainfall will be reduced which will lead to decreasing water levels this situation will boost extraction and production costs and could imply well abandonment thus affecting the population and economy of the santo domingo valley region which is the largest agricultural area of the state this process will continue if not additional influx of fresh water occurs another factor to consider is the increase of evapotranspiration resulting from an expected increment of 2 4 celsius degrees during the period 2069 2099 a situation that will exacerbate these trends as a result of higher temperatures cyclonic rainfalls could be stronger increasing runoffs however results from peacc 2012 suggest that more runoffs will not necessarily improve infiltration as sediments tend to saturation the above mentioned situation suggests the convenience of building reservoirs and recharge dams in order to storage surface water before it reaches the ocean in a context of water scarcity and expected adverse impacts of climate change the options for adapting agricultural activity and water use were discussed in consultation forums with members of the local communities alongside the santo domingo valley the sessions showed that communities are aware of the impacts of climate change and that the alignment of water and agricultural policies is an essential condition to foster socio hydrological resilience and sustainable agricultural practices this includes changes to legal standards in order to avoid obsolete methods of estimating water availability which otherwise lead to unsupported claims of water abundance further steps can be taken to revert water depletion in the santo domingo valley water saving technologies should be introduced in greater scale based on available technology financing sources to acquire it and the population willingness to use it dams and major storage works can capture superficial water since the amount of water delivered by cyclones will raise in the future captured water volumes could be transferred to smaller recharge dams as proposed by wurl et al 2008 construction of a line of observation wells near the coastline is advisable to recognize the advance of seawater intrusion and as an early warning system crop change is needed accordingly to future climate change scenarios increase of evapotranspiration and water scarcity maleksaeidi et al 2017 reyhani et al 2017 and some important opportunities international demand of organics and the status of a fruit fly free area must be further exploited capacities building in entrepreneurship and advanced technologies use as well as water culture enhancement are very important for socio hydrological resilience overall limits have to be drawn as to how much agriculture can be deployed on sustainable terms in a water overexploited region 7 conclusions the characterization of sociohydrological resilience of the valley of santo domingo a water limited arid ecosystem was achieved through a swot analysis in combination with a pest analysis as well as through future extraction scenarios based on changing climate conditions from this a hydrogeological flow model was advanced to which socially sustainable management practices are crucial in order to restore ecosystems and benefit society the hydraulic model at a regional scale permitted demonstrating that an inflow from seawater into the aquifer is ongoing the salinization in the aquifer is mainly resulting from seawater intrusion due to the development of a huge depression cone caused by the extraction of groundwater in excess in the center of the santo domingo basin future aquifer management will have to focus on the coastal zone where monitoring groundwater heads and quality will be necessary to obtain the information necessary to assess remediation strategies against the saltwater intrusion after the definition of the main hydrological components and future climate change impacts the main topics of the swot analysis were introduced these are based both on field research and surveys and interviews applied to key stakeholders the swot analysis combines the hydrological considerations with the most important peste components this is one of the few studies that propose an interdisciplinary analysis where hydrogeological and socio economic components are linked together this contributes to future scenarios by integrating not only the hydrogeological but also economical dimensions additionally the integration of the community perspective was achieved respecting their points of views and traditional knowledge including them in strategies for resolving the water related problems the acceptance by local actors and their active participation in the design implementation and monitoring of adaptation and remediation measures are crucial strengthening resilience and reducing the impacts of climate change on water resources agricultural activity and consequently improving the living conditions of the population in future studies it will be important to check the effectiveness of actual programs introducing advanced irrigation technics like center pivot irrigation and pattern crops that are better adapted to local conditions rethinking the policy of granting water rights as well as reviewing the system of subsidies to agricultural activity avoiding the stimulation of agricultural practices that worsen the over exploitation of groundwater instead of remedying it will strengthen water conservation this process must be accomplished by monitoring the saltwater intrusion in combination with reliable and more frequent measurement of the water table and the construction of a hydraulic infrastructure for flood control and capturing of surface water after extreme rain events components of the swot analysis show the pathway to enhance the social hydrological resilience in santo domingo v an analysis that can be further developed by the quantification of socio hydrological resilience components acknowledgments this work is partially based on research financed by comisión nacional del agua we are grateful to dr melissa haeffner assistant professor in the environmental science and management department at portland state university for proofreading the article and her

7398,mismanagement has caused the overexploitation of one third of the major aquifers in mexico mainly due to excessive water extraction for agricultural irrigation santo domingo baja california sur in northern mexico where agriculture absorbs nearly 80 of water is the only aquifer in the mexico where after a period of overexploitation equality between extraction and recharge rates was achieved although this has not meant the securement of long term water availability this paper offers an analysis of hydrological resilience of a water limited arid ecosystem under future extraction scenarios and changing climate conditions a regional groundwater flow model is proposed using modflow software then different indicators were modeled as outcomes of coupled human water systems to predict water trajectories under different human impacts the aim was to recognize water insecurity scenarios and define appropriate actions to a more sustainable use of this scarce resource in the region thus although runoff derived from extreme floods may favor infiltration the involvement of local stakeholders and decision makers to reverse the adverse impacts of current water management and climate change is imperative if water availability and better quality are to be secured keywords water security socio hydrological system overexploitation arid ecosystem modflow 1 introduction mismanagement has caused the overexploitation of 36 of the major aquifers in mexico mainly due to excessive water extraction for agricultural irrigation in the case of coastal aquifers this has led to seawater intrusion increasing groundwater mineralization less drinking water and reduced irrigation sources cardona et al 2004 although dealing with complex human impacted water systems aquifer maximum groundwater availability in mexico is defined in terms of a simple water balance concept in this context after 40 years of overexploitation santo domingo baja california sur in northern mexico where agriculture absorbs nearly 80 of water is the only aquifer in the country where equality between where the extraction and recharge rates have been balanced but secure long term water availability is a multi faceted problem that goes beyond mere balancing of supply and demand to include the assessment of resilience to climate change and identification of adaptation measures this assessment depends on a holistic approach to water resource management that involves local stakeholders and decision makers the main objective of this paper is to quantify the hydrological resilience of this water limited arid ecosystem under future extraction scenarios and changing climate conditions through a model that includes socially sustainable management practices this approach is important since in a context of long range predictions the goal should be to provide alternative strategies and plausible and co evolving trajectories of the socio hydrological system a holisticsocio hydrological approach is important for providing alternative strategies and plausible and co evolving trajectories of the socio hydrological system which will indicate cause effect relationships and help stakeholders identify most desirable operating alternatives srinivasanet al 2017 limitations of the model relates to uncertainties linked to human induced changes mao et al 2017 as in case of climate change where there is uncertainty as to where and how the impacts will occur or the severity tye and altamirano 2017 a central part of the methodology is the construction of a regional groundwater flow model which represents an area of 10 781 km2 using modflow software the database includes information on the irrigated area and typeofcrops water consumption soil texture and chemistry and water quality at 600 ranches in the irrigation district these indicators were modeled as outcomes of coupled human water systems to predict water trajectories under different human impacts in order to recognize water insecurity scenarios and define appropriate actions to a more sustainable use of this scarce resource in the region yet this situation may not occur under natural conditions as future scenarios indicate calling for needed changes in water management and practices thus we present actions to be implemented that allow based on a socio hydrological approach the participation of stakeholders at multiple scales to facilitate improved feedback between the water sector and society 2 socio hydrological resilience as a conceptual framework it is widely accepted that integrated approaches can lead to sustainability sustainability is defined as a requirement of our generation to manage the resource base such that the average quality of life that we ensure ourselves can potentially be shared by all future generations development is sustainable if it involves a non decreasing average quality of life asheim 1994 hence there is wide consensus on the need for multidisciplinary or multidimensional water resources management buytaert et al 2014 and paul et al 2017 argue that water management problems are no longer predominantly addressed as technical issues but have become part of a complex policy process in which different stakeholders and institutions are involved norgaard 1981 walker et al 2004 manson 2008 sandker et al 2010 sustainable growth is only conceivable if accompanied by the satisfaction of those cultural and material needs that are indispensable for all individuals sharma and sharma 2011 jonathan et al 2017 to live with the self esteem to which every individual is entitled sivapalan et al 2012 2014 have foregrounded the human role in the water cycle by establishing socio hydrology as a perspective to understand the complex approach in the hydrological resource management aimed to create resilience in this paper we adopt socio hydrology resilience for understanding and assessing resilience in combined socio hydrological contexts mao et al 2017 and apply it to the case study of santo domingo aquifer resilience is the capacity of individuals ecosystems or human communities to persist in the face of change to continue to develop with ever changing environments folke 2016 as mao et al 2017 recall this concept is understood as a set of systemic absorptive adaptive and transformative capacities in three dimensions persistence for now and response for future contingencies in incremental or in radical ways hydrological resilience is the ability of a catchment to absorb disturbance and maintain or quickly regain hydrologic function it also provides new insights into the clarification and evaluation of different water management challenges mao et al 2017 according to such definition we make reference to three resilience framings for different types of human water systems and subsystems 1 water subsystem the hydrological resilience to anthropogenic impacts 2 human subsystem the social resilience to hydrological hazards and stress and 3 combined human water system which is explored using a strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats approach as a tool to enhance socio hydrological resilience particularly important is the third type that emphasizes the interactions between human and water components within complex systems subject to internal or external disturbances we argue that the combined water human system is the most appropriate tool to design strategies for resilient management of the hydrological resources of santo domingo aquifer climate change or increased human hazards may degrade aquatic ecosystems or propel them to irreversible undesired end states magombeyi et al 2006 prompting a need to consider options for resilient socio hydrological water management folke et al 2010 fernald et al 2015 3 methodology 3 1 santo domingo aquifer as the area of study the valley of santo domingo is located in the middle of the mexican state of baja california sur in the municipality of comondú the climate is characterized by very arid conditions warm climate at the coast to temperate climate in the sierra la giganta mountain range with a temperature interval ranging from an average maximum of 43 3 c to a low of 1 89 c the predominant natural vegetation in the arid and semi arid zone is sarcocaulescent scrubland the average annual rainfall reaches only 150 mm the range of precipitation is between 50 and 300 mm per year of which 30 occurs in the winter and 70 during summer cna 2002 in the summer season runoff is frequently generated from rainfall caused mainly by tropical cyclones the hurricane season begins in mid may and ends in november wurl and martínez gutiérrez 2006 the valley of santo domingo is subdivided into three watersheds santo domingo in the north las bramonas in the middle and the santa cruz watershed in the south fig 1 the uncontrolled extraction of groundwater and especially the over exploitation of the santo domingo aquifer from 1957 onwards has caused modifications to the natural flow system and induced a lateral inflow of seawater from the pacific coast as a result the groundwater quality in the santo domingo irrigation district 0 6 6 is deteriorating the valle de santo domingo represents the most important region for agricultural and livestock in the state where agricultural activities cover an area of 72 409 ha the first wells for agriculture use were installed in the late 1940s two decades later water withdrawals had already reached 250 million m3 per year which significantly exceeds the annual average recharge of 188 million m3 estimated by the mexican national water commission cna 2002 in the 1970s the number of wells was above 500 units and extractions reached about 300 million m3 per year the highest extractions occurred in the late 1980s with withdrawals of up to 450 million m3 per year 2 4 times the annual average recharge over exploitation between 1956 and 2002 meant a deficit of 4753 million m3 of groundwater semarnap 1996 a gradual reduction in the extraction rate began in the 1990s in order to reduce the negative effects of over pumping and to achieve an equal balance between recharge and extraction fig 2 although equilibrium in respect to the medium annual recharge rate was finally achieved in 2003 the extraction rate nearly equaled the estimated recharge rate of 188 million m3 per year in the following years the cone of depression stopped increasing its volume but its size still grews and its center deepenes as a result of a 50 year over exploitation a change in the hydrochemical composition of groundwater has been observed acsa 1969 tmi 1978 desisa 1997 cardona et al 2004 due tu sea water intrusion water returns derived from irrigation and the mobilization of deeper groundwater with higher mineralization semarnap 1996 cardona et al 2004 wurl et al 2008 the recharge of groundwater depends on intense rainfall events which are produced by tropical cyclones characterized by high intensity and short duration storm water enters rapidly into the valley s drainage system ephemeral or intermittent streambeds called arroyos but due to geomorphological conditions subsurface drainage is generally incapable to infiltrate an important part of the runoff which then flows into the pacific ocean geomorphologically valley of santo domingo is divided into two main units the upper parts hills plateaus and hillocks of the sierra la giganta mountains are mainly composed of volcanic rocks tuffaceous sandstones and agglomerates of fine to medium grain with low infiltration capacity the lower parts form a coastal plain of unconsolidated sediments derived from the sierra la giganta that covers sedimentary rocks high infiltration capacities characterize this unit 3 1 1 climate variability and environmental change according to estimates of the ipcc a decrease in the annual rainfall rate in several geographical areas is expected leading to a deficit in available water a lower annual precipitation implies that the aquifers will tend to decrease in recharge and cause a deficit amplifying the imbalance in water systems on the contrary an excess of rainwater may cause negative impacts to the population due to torrential floods that would eventually affect urban areas the two models selected for the comparison of probable climate changes in the near and far future for the study area are the hadgem2 es model and the rea assembly giorgi and mearns 2002 whose adaptation was established in reference to the climatological database of the national meteorological service smn 1961 2000 the rea assembly model for mexico is based on information from 15 mgc details on the methodology and weighting are given by conde et al 2011 the hadgem2 es model for the study area figs 3 and 4 shows notable differences in future estimates of temperature and precipitation with respect to the rea assembly figs 3 and 4 which behaves more discreetly 3 2 groundwater model to understand the hydraulic behavior of seawater intrusion a groundwater model was developed to model different recharge reduction scenarios according to the rea assemblage rcp 8 5 provided by national institute of ecology and climate change inecc 2013 2014 which estimated a rainfall mean reduction up to 37 for the short term future in the manual calibration process the hydraulic conductivity specific yield and specific storage were used in order to achieve the observed hydraulic head levels during the period 1996 2013 modeled scenarios were the years 2020 2030 2040 and 2050 in order to define a critic date when the drawdown cone will reach the coast increasing the inflow of seawater into the aquifer 3 2 1 model design the groundwater model was constructed using modflow 2000 and includes the following two natural boundaries the coastline of the pacific ocean to the west and the fractured aquitard of the sierra de la giganta mountains to the east fig 3 sea level was simulated with specific head conditions at the coastline the starting heads were obtained from semarnap 1996 to the north south and east the model is limited by no flow conditions where an influx can be neglected the finite difference mesh consisted of 221 columns and 197 rows with a size of 500 m per cell so that the model includes 43 537 cells and represents an area of 10 781 km2 the initial conditions of the model were the 1996 water levels provided by conagua the top of the aquifer was recalculated from a digital elevation model with a resolution of 30 m obtained from inegi the thickness of the aquifer was defined from bore logs and based on geologic cross sections and the re interpretation of resistivity soundings documented in semarnap 1996 3 2 2 hydraulic parameters the initial specific yield and specific storage were obtained from semarnap 1996 and introduced cell by cell after the calibration step specific storage and specific yield values are ranging between 0 0008 to 0043 m 1 and 0 07 to 0 26 respectively fig 5 the hydraulic conductivity was calculated from the textural classification data of 554 sediment samples taken in the valley of santo domingo applying the methodology from shiozawa and campbell 1991 the resulting values range from 8 to 58 m d see fig 5 3 2 3 recharge according to conagua 2015 the average annual recharge of the aquifer in the valley of santo domingo is 188 million m3 of which 77 correspond to natural infiltration while the remaining 23 are due to an irrigation return flow conagua 2015 this recharge results from four different processes recharge from direct infiltration of rainfall recharge resulting from the infiltration of surface water in the arroyos after storm events horizontal groundwater flow from the sierra de la giganta aquitard and seawater intrusion from the river mouths of the arroyos santo domingo and las bramonas into the aquifer the recharge package was used to simulate recharge from direct infiltration of rainfall the recharge resulting from the infiltration of surface water in the arroyos after storm events was simulated through the streamflow package str1 which uses darcy s law and assumes a continuous stream flow from the stream surface to the aquifer and calculates its corresponding volume introduced into the aquifer prudic et al 2004 the main drainage system was introduced into the groundwater model and based on the streamflow module results from synthetic hydrographs calculated with the amount of surface water generated in the watershed of the sierra la giganta mountains were calculated with the hec 1 program 1 hec 1990 taken in account different rainfall scenarios the relation between precipitation and total runoff volume was reported from 3 runoff rates introduced to str1 were obtained from synthetic hydrographs calculated with hec 1 hec 1990 and taken different rainfall scenarios the relation between precipitation and total runoff volume was reported from semarnap 1996 horizontal groundwater flow from sierra de la giganta fractured aquifer was simulated with a volume of 40 mm3 per year as influx to the model 3 2 4 extractions and time steps a total of 710 wells and the corresponding extraction rates were introduced into the model taking in account the variations observed between 1996 semarnap 1996 and 2007 from 2008 onwards we assumed near equilibrium conditions as indicated by conagua 2015 for the future scenarios a 23 of the extractions were reduced in order to simulate an irrigation return flow for each year the model includes infiltration caused by runoff calculated based on the maximum the rain events and obtained from the hydrological model during a maximum of 10 days 3 2 5 calibration and prognostic run well head data observed between 1996 and 2007were obtained by the national water commission conagua and the 2013 data were obtained from garcía martínez 2014 to calibrate the model in transient state mode for each year the model includes infiltration caused by runoff calculated based on the maximum the rain events and obtained from the hydrological model during a maximum of 10 days the original hydraulic parameters were calibrated after calibration step the reduction of recharge scenarios due to climate change was simulated the estimation of seawater intrusion for the santo domingo arroyo rivermouth was calculated with the water balance of this specific zone considering an inverse flow of water levels in the manual calibration process the hydraulic conductivity specific yield and specific storage were changed by zones to achieve a concordance between the observed and simulated hydraulic head levels during the period 1996 2013 a total of 119 randomly chosen points were selected for each year of calibration after the model calibration different scenarios were generated maintaining or reducing extraction rates the difference between the calculated and the observed levels at 119 randomly chosen points for the year 2013 is presented in fig 6 3 2 hydrochemical analysis the composition of major ions in ground water permits to determine the relation between the groundwater and intruded seawater in coastal aquifers especially the total mineralization na and cl conagua provided us with the concentrations of the macro constituents in 4375 ground water analyses taken from 710 agriculture wells between 1986 and 2005 which were interpreted with respect to changes in the groundwater composition this interpretation is based on piper ternary diagrams maps of sodium and chloride concentrations in groundwater and the ratio of cl hco3 co3 as an indicator to define seawater intrusion as proposed by bear et al 1999 4 the role of stakeholder engagement in water use assessment and resilience strategies design the term participation typically refers to some aspect of local community involvement in the design implementation and evaluation of a project or plan brown and wyckoff baird 1992 public participation encompasses a range of procedures and methods designed to consult involve and inform the public to allow those that would be potentially affected by a decision or policy to have input into the process the latter is also known as stakeholders iap 2007 public participation or stakeholder s engagement involves both individual and group input carr 2015 krueger et al 2016 stakeholders participation is key to evaluating resilience in any system adaptation is a process by which strategies to moderate cope with and take advantage of the consequences of climatic events are enhanced developed and implemented conde and lohsdale 2005 adaptation occurs through public policy making and decisions made by stakeholders i e individuals groups organizations governmental agencies or non governmental organizations ngos and their networks relevant stakeholders need to be brought together to evaluate the resilience and to identify the most appropriate forms of adaptation jones et al 2001 analysing the capacity of stakeholders to cope with and adapt to climatic events is fundamental to characterizing current and possible future resilience jones 2000 understanding the role of stakeholders in the decision making process will assist in the implementation of adaptation policies in short stakeholders are central to the resilience assessment and adaptation process in order to assess social resilience regarding the water system we used swot strengths weaknesses opportunities threats analysis as part of socio hydrological resiliency planning the main idea of the analysis is to see how to maximize opportunities and efficiently protect against threats according to david 1997 building an assessment matrix allows the formulation of future improvement and development strategies during the process we were seeking and valuing diverse voices making a special effort to hear and understand those who for various reasons may otherwise go unheard the stakeholders were selected by following criteria 1 they represent a particular community or an important subgroup of population of the santo domingo valley 2 they would provide technical knowledge and or essential information to the process 3 to ensure the coherence of the project 4 to ensure the application of the project 5 because they are holders of rights in the project area the following key principles were considered in the implementation of the public participation or stakeholder engagement process ifc 2007 providing meaningful information in a format and language that is readily understandable and tailored to the needs of the target stakeholder group s an accessible slide presentation was delivered to the stakeholders before the meeting providing information in advance of consultation activities and decision making some of the results were shared in advance with ngos and business sector by e mail disseminating information in ways and locations that allow ease of access by stakeholders the main results and related data were uploaded to the website of the university and municipality respect for local traditions languages time frames and decision making processes two way dialogue research team and stakeholders that gives both sides the opportunity to exchange views and information to listen and to have their issues heard and addressed inclusiveness in representation of views including women vulnerable and or minority groups the three last principles were implemented by the following work dynamics the stakeholders were divided in three panels with facilitator after clearly explaining the issue or topic the facilitator asked the participants to write each idea or information element the files of the participants were collected and the information was synthesized on a flipchart eliminating all repetitions then each element of the responses was discussed afterwards each panel proceeded to agree on ideas and discuss possible solutions to the problems detected one of the most common techniques we used was to encourage debate and organize ideas into cards the ideas adopted by each panel as a result of the discussion and complemented by survey results are presented in the peste matrix public participation is important as a mechanism to break down and address complex decisions by different stakeholders who can provide new information views needs and interests this approach offers an opportunity for stakeholders to better understand the range of views on an issue implementation can also be improved with public consent and commitment on the process yielding higher quality decisions and the ability to better allocate scarce resources yee 2010 the generic profile of stakeholders in resilient water management strategies design was categorized into the following types government agencies agriculture representatives research or academic institutions special interest groups local community representatives interest groups or other organizations government agencies 15 agriculture representatives 30 research or academic institutions 10 local communities representatives 30 interest groups or ngos 15 between 2008 and 2010 four consultation forums were held on the recovery plan of the valle de santo domingo aquifer on the event held in ciudad constitución the main population center in the santo domingo valley 85 panelists participated representing communities all municipal state and federal governments and non governmental organizations another three fora were held in small communities with the participation of 15 20 persons at each the objective was to access most of the local population although the type of participants and the work dynamics was very similar the methods to engage with stakeholders and register their public participation were the following public meetings that offered an opportunity for anyone with an interest in the subject of the consultation to express concerns and gain a broader perspective of concerns in a short period of time public meetings started with a technical overview of the situation and process then provided opportunity for members of the public to speak from the floor regarding their concerns or to ask questions of expert panelists surveys were applied to collect information solicit opinions and build a profile of the groups and individuals involved survey data provided information and helped focus the large number of stakeholder views aside from the system s internal resources and factors there are several other macro economic factors that can have a profound impact on the performance of socio hydrological management these factors need to be carefully analyzed in order to determine their role in resilience building success that is why the swot analysis is combined with a pest political economic social technological analysis in this study aguilar 1967 which looks at the broader political economic social and technological factors and provides a macro environmental view pest methodology was developed with the following additions economic factors are complemented by financial considerations and social components are enriched by cultural aspects very specific to our case study we have also included environmental factors due to their importance in assessing socio hydrological resilience therefore the pest analysis in this study becomes a peste political economic social technological environmental analysis 5 results 5 1 principal types of groundwater the analyses were considered reliable applying the rules established in dvwk 1992 where the following two main groundwater types can be distinguished in the first type 89 of the cases chloride represents the main anion the main cation is sodium in 77 calcium 17 magnesium 7 the second group with bicarbonates as main anion represents 33 of the samples seawater intrusion affected samples represents 15 of group 1 the relationships between main cations and anions in groundwater are shown in a piper trilinear diagram see fig 7 5 2 seawater intrusion chemical signature two zones were identified with high concentrations of chlorides and sodium and values of cl hco3 co3 ratio above 2 the first one located in the santo domingo basin on its western side shows values of sodium above 400 mg l chloride from 800 to 1500 mg l and cl hco3 co3 ranging from 3 to 6 the second zone is located in the las bramonas basin on its western side values of sodium range from 400 to 500 mg l chloride from 600 to 1500 mg l and cl hco3 co3 ranging from 3 to 6 in both sites a dispersion plume orientated to the southeast is observed see fig 8 in the santo domingo basin values of electrical conductivity near the coast range from 780 to 8760 µs cm 5 3 estimation of seawater inflow for santo domingo basin the results from likely scenarios on the hydrogeological conditions of the santo domingo aquifer show that the total runoff derived from extreme floods mainly generated by tropical cyclones represents the most important additional source of water as it infiltrates and recharges the aquifer simulations indicate that a reduction of the recharge related to climate change will increase the maximum depth of the drawdown cone from 48 m in 2017 up to 78 m for 2050 and it is expected that the 0 level of the drawdown cone will reach the coast between 2030 and 2040 as seen in fig 9 the amount of seawater being intruded just from the river mouth of santo domingo creek will increase from 0 36 to 1 3 mm3 a year 5 4 results of the swot peste analysis human resilience in the agricultural sector of the santo domingo valley as mentioned before the santo domingo valley is the most important agricultural center in baja california sur its origins go back to the 1940s as the mexican government s attempt to populate a distant and isolated territory with people from other parts of the country as a result 73 agricultural colonies were established with subsidies and financial support from the government land water well perforation machinery seeds trained personnel and social infrastructure were available to settlers the green revolution had a relevant part in the subsequent agricultural boom which was met with a growing demand in the united states however in 1954 only five years after it became fully productive more water well perforation was prohibited as water became scarce and its quality compromised by excessive extraction márquez salaices 2017 currently as in the rest of the peninsula of baja california export oriented agricultural production is on the rise mainly by foreign investment the introduction of high water consuming crops such as oranges wheat tomatoes watermelon and potatoes persist and although there is a high degree of modern irrigation technics greenhouses and technified irrigation water remains scarce and local producers face polluted soils by agrochemicals and fertilizers debt and low productivity renting their land or water concessions has become a means of income but the region has become increasingly depopulated in a context in which agriculture is still the main economic activity local producers need to be persistent adaptive and transformative bennett et al 2014 especially considering climate change producers have to be persistent in their efforts to preserve the economic activity on which their livelihood is based they must adapt to the present and expected impact of climate changes transforming the traditional pathways of farming through implementation of new technologies crop changes and water use optimization table 1 shows the main results of the consultation forums carried out with the participation of stakeholders in the santo domingo valley from the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats political economic sociocultural technological and ecological analysis which recent applied research has confirmed with márquez salaices 2017 6 discussion it is important to highlight that the interdisciplinary work in this article was inspired by the indications of the fifth assessment report ar5 of the ipcc in the ar5 the bureau of the ipcc managed to include several issues that were previously considered outside the scope of research on climate change these topics indicate the need to relate scientific research eg scenarios water resources extreme events to social science topics such are sustainable development ethics equity and human rights including these issues and relating them to the main strands of climate action mitigation and adaptation is of the utmost importance to make decision makers see that climate policies should be an integral part of the broader sustainable development policies and that resources to combat climate change at the same time are addressing socio economic development priorities vulnerable communities food supply creation of green jobs etc ivanova boncheva and pichs 2017 as a result of this collaboration the scenarios for the ar5 are prepared in a combined manner between 1 projections of future emissions 2 projections of future climate change 3 narrative descriptions quantitative and qualitative of socioeconomic conditions and stakeholders opinions which represent challenges to mitigation and adaptation and 4 mitigation and adaptation policies the developed scenarios provide an integrated framework for creating and comparing mitigation adaptation and residual climate impacts at the sectoral and regional levels ibidem even though the mexican government claims that the santo domingo valley aquifer is stabilized in terms of a water mass balance between recharge versus extraction rates this calculation does not exclude the volume of seawater intrusion from the calculated recharge volume the flow model presented here indicates that initial saltwater intrusion has occurred and that water quality of the northern part of the aquifer santo domingo watershed as well as in the central part las bramonas watershed is seriously compromised the amount of seawater intrusion from the santo domingo mouth will be 3 6 times in 2050 the resulting increment of groundwater salinization will lead to soil chemistry and permeability deterioration with adverse consequences for the region s environment economy and population it is likely that more water will be used in order to wash out soil salinity the intrusion of seawater into the santo domingo aquifer dates back to the year 1968 when agricultural production increased in the context of the green revolution causing overexploitation of the aquifer troyo et al 2010 the aquifer of hermosillo in the neighboring state of sonora faced a similar situation and may serve as an example of a worst case scenario given its comparable conditions to the santo domingo aquifer in the hermosillo aquifer a saline water intrusion front started since 1975 at a 0 65 m year velocity rate rangel et al 2003 and until 2008 had formed a 80 km parallel fringe to the shoreline penetrating the aquifer to a depth of 28 km to 32 km with e c values up to 40 000 µs cm szynkiewicz et al 2008 reverting and at least partly restoring the natural condition of the hermosillo aquifer requires decades of time and government investment which in turn implies high social and economic costs rangel medina et al 2004 several initiatives in the santo domingo valley have been put forward for the agriculture activity to continue relying mostly on government subsidies more than 50 of the farms have installed automatized irrigation systems additionally an agricultural experimental research center located in the santo domingo valley suggests farmers options to optimize land use change crop patterns and introduce advanced irrigation methods since the nineties urciaga 1992 farmers can access this information through a consultation system on internet where the environmental characteristics potential areas and technology of crop production are documented for each farm of the valle de santo domingo irrigation district meza and ojeda 2006 in general farmers have followed both strategies and nowadays produce is mostly fruits and vegetables rather than cotton or wheat as before however even using high tech irrigation has not solved water overexploitation this is of concern since climate conditions may be more extreme in the nearer future according to hadgem2 es and rea assembly climatic models giorgi and mearns 2002 conde et al 2011 seasonal rainfall will be reduced which will lead to decreasing water levels this situation will boost extraction and production costs and could imply well abandonment thus affecting the population and economy of the santo domingo valley region which is the largest agricultural area of the state this process will continue if not additional influx of fresh water occurs another factor to consider is the increase of evapotranspiration resulting from an expected increment of 2 4 celsius degrees during the period 2069 2099 a situation that will exacerbate these trends as a result of higher temperatures cyclonic rainfalls could be stronger increasing runoffs however results from peacc 2012 suggest that more runoffs will not necessarily improve infiltration as sediments tend to saturation the above mentioned situation suggests the convenience of building reservoirs and recharge dams in order to storage surface water before it reaches the ocean in a context of water scarcity and expected adverse impacts of climate change the options for adapting agricultural activity and water use were discussed in consultation forums with members of the local communities alongside the santo domingo valley the sessions showed that communities are aware of the impacts of climate change and that the alignment of water and agricultural policies is an essential condition to foster socio hydrological resilience and sustainable agricultural practices this includes changes to legal standards in order to avoid obsolete methods of estimating water availability which otherwise lead to unsupported claims of water abundance further steps can be taken to revert water depletion in the santo domingo valley water saving technologies should be introduced in greater scale based on available technology financing sources to acquire it and the population willingness to use it dams and major storage works can capture superficial water since the amount of water delivered by cyclones will raise in the future captured water volumes could be transferred to smaller recharge dams as proposed by wurl et al 2008 construction of a line of observation wells near the coastline is advisable to recognize the advance of seawater intrusion and as an early warning system crop change is needed accordingly to future climate change scenarios increase of evapotranspiration and water scarcity maleksaeidi et al 2017 reyhani et al 2017 and some important opportunities international demand of organics and the status of a fruit fly free area must be further exploited capacities building in entrepreneurship and advanced technologies use as well as water culture enhancement are very important for socio hydrological resilience overall limits have to be drawn as to how much agriculture can be deployed on sustainable terms in a water overexploited region 7 conclusions the characterization of sociohydrological resilience of the valley of santo domingo a water limited arid ecosystem was achieved through a swot analysis in combination with a pest analysis as well as through future extraction scenarios based on changing climate conditions from this a hydrogeological flow model was advanced to which socially sustainable management practices are crucial in order to restore ecosystems and benefit society the hydraulic model at a regional scale permitted demonstrating that an inflow from seawater into the aquifer is ongoing the salinization in the aquifer is mainly resulting from seawater intrusion due to the development of a huge depression cone caused by the extraction of groundwater in excess in the center of the santo domingo basin future aquifer management will have to focus on the coastal zone where monitoring groundwater heads and quality will be necessary to obtain the information necessary to assess remediation strategies against the saltwater intrusion after the definition of the main hydrological components and future climate change impacts the main topics of the swot analysis were introduced these are based both on field research and surveys and interviews applied to key stakeholders the swot analysis combines the hydrological considerations with the most important peste components this is one of the few studies that propose an interdisciplinary analysis where hydrogeological and socio economic components are linked together this contributes to future scenarios by integrating not only the hydrogeological but also economical dimensions additionally the integration of the community perspective was achieved respecting their points of views and traditional knowledge including them in strategies for resolving the water related problems the acceptance by local actors and their active participation in the design implementation and monitoring of adaptation and remediation measures are crucial strengthening resilience and reducing the impacts of climate change on water resources agricultural activity and consequently improving the living conditions of the population in future studies it will be important to check the effectiveness of actual programs introducing advanced irrigation technics like center pivot irrigation and pattern crops that are better adapted to local conditions rethinking the policy of granting water rights as well as reviewing the system of subsidies to agricultural activity avoiding the stimulation of agricultural practices that worsen the over exploitation of groundwater instead of remedying it will strengthen water conservation this process must be accomplished by monitoring the saltwater intrusion in combination with reliable and more frequent measurement of the water table and the construction of a hydraulic infrastructure for flood control and capturing of surface water after extreme rain events components of the swot analysis show the pathway to enhance the social hydrological resilience in santo domingo v an analysis that can be further developed by the quantification of socio hydrological resilience components acknowledgments this work is partially based on research financed by comisión

modelling dissolved oxygen least square support vector machine multivariate adaptive regression splines m5 model tree 1 introduction monitoring and control of water quality parameters in river stream and lakes has become of great importance this is due to the fact that the major parameters measured in situ are used to identify and quantify the pollution of water in the course of measuring water quality parameters some of them were extremely important than others dissolved oxygen concentration do is the most important water quality parameter and mainly adopted as indicators of pollution in river mohan and pavan kumar 2016 to assess the trophic state of rivers canals and lakes for calculation of the water quality index and has been integrated as a part of some water quality models gikas 2014 chamoglou et al 2014 mellios et al 2015 despite his great importance much effort has been devoted to understand the variation of do over the space and time hence in this subject some important variables are identified to be directly affecting the concentration of do although the direct variation of do is difficult to discern cox 2003a b much effort has been devoted to establishing the impact of changing do in response to the change of other water quality variables this is the important underlying motivations for developing a models for predicting do using water quality variables over the last few years the developments of data driven paradigm has led to the development of many successful model for do worldwide in depth literature review encompassing all applied models for do demonstrate that at least five type of models are mainly adopted by researchers these models can be classified into artificial neural networks fuzzy logic and neural fuzzy evolutionary models support vector machines svm and wavelet decomposition based models artificial neural networks are the most applied data driven models and generally fourth categories are always applied for modelling do among them the most widely used is the multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn sometime referred to feedforward neural network ffnn ranković et al 2010 najah et al 2014 radial basis function neural network rbfnn has the second largest application in the subject ay and kisi 2012 the generalized regression neural network grnn heddam 2014a antanasijević et al 2014 took in third place the fourth and last place is taken by others neural network models seldom selected as a model for predicting do that are the cascade correlation artificial neural networks ccann diamantopoulou et al 2007 the elman neural networks elnn liu et al 2012 and finally the recurrent neural network rnn wang et al 2011 ranković et al 2010 investigated the capabilities of ffnn for predicting do using several water quality variables they found that water temperature and ph are the variables that most affect do najah et al 2014 developed a mlpnn for predicting do at johor malaysian at monthly time step and demonstrated that i water ph is the input variables with the lowest effect on the performances of the proposed model and ii the limitations of the mlpnn in predicting the extreme do values by using data from two usgs stations ay and kisi 2012 have tried to estimate do at the upstream using data from the downstream and vice versa and reported very promising results by comparing the mlpnn and the rbfnn models the authors demonstrated that rbfnn was found to be the best model for estimating the do concentration antanasijević et al 2014 applied grnn model with the monte carlo simulation mcs technique for modelling do in the danube river north serbia heddam 2014a compared grnn with mlr models for predicting do using four inputs variables those are water temperature ph specific conductance and sensor depth finally the ccann elnn and rnn very rarely occupied by the researchers this category of ann models have unfortunately been underused and often underestimated various fuzzy logic and neural fuzzy models are developed to predict do concentration these models are classified and referred as the fuzzy logic fl altunkaynak et al 2005 fuzzy pattern recognition giusti and marsili libelli 2009 and the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis heddam 2014b ay and kisi 2016 altunkaynak et al 2005 applied the takagi sugeno fuzzy logic for forecasting do in the golden horn in istanbul turkey giusti and marsili libelli 2009 used fuzzy pattern recognition for modelling the do dynamics in orbetello lagoon italy anfis was applied for do worldwide and the results reported were very promising heddam 2014b and ay and kisi 2016 compared two anfis models namely i grid partition based fuzzy inference system named anfis grid and ii subtractive clustering based fuzzy inference system named anfis sub for estimating do at hourly and monthly time steps respectively at hourly time step heddam 2014b demonstrated that do can be predicted very well using only water temperature as input variable at monthly time step ay and kisi 2016 demonstrated that do can be estimated with high accuracy using anfis sub compared to the anfis grid since a few years a new type of models quite promising has seen significant growth the evolutionary models these models have been applied successfully for modelling do among them gene expression programming gep kisi et al 2013 dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference system denfis heddam 2014c and the evolving fuzzy neural network efunn heddam 2016a kisi et al 2013 applied gene expression programming gep for predicting daily do concentration at south platte river at englewood colorado usa heddam 2014c compared two dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference systems denfis namely i offline based system named denfis of and ii online based system named denfis on many other models have been developed to predict do concentration recently heddam 2016a compared efunn and mlr for predicting hourly do and demonstrated that efunn is more accurate than the mlr model models based on the combination of wavelet decomposition artificial neural and regression models have been proposed and various applications appear in the literature xu and liu 2013 alizadeh and kavianpour 2015 evrendilek and karakaya 2014 svm models have been successfully applied for modelling do concentration liu et al 2014 tarmizi et al 2014 malek et al 2014 khotimah 2014 yu et al 2016 liu et al 2014 applied lssvm optimized particle swarm optimization pso for predicting do content in river crab culture ponds china the authors demonstrated that the proposed hybrid model based on lssvm and pso has higher efficiency than other two models rbfnn and lssvm with a coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 97 in the testing phase tarmizi et al 2014 applied svm for predicting do using five water quality variables collected from the terengganu river malaysia the authors reported that svm is a powerful tool for predicting do concentration and the model yielded higher efficiency with an r2 equal to 0 94 in another study malek et al 2014 examined the potential of svm for predicting do concentration in chini and bera lake malaysia using eleven water quality variables as inputs using a forward selection method the authors find that water temperature ph and electrical conductivity were the most important input variables for predicting do khotimah 2014 applied smooth support vector machine ssvm for predicting do in river surabaya indonesia using the root mean square error rmse as evaluation criteria the authors have obtained an rmse equal to 0 027 mg l yu et al 2016 compared lssvm and rbfnn for predicting do in crab ponds china the proposed model worked reasonably well in comparison with the rbfnn model more recently a new type of models called optimally pruned extreme learning machine op elm has been proposed and applied for forecasting do concentration heddam 2016b according to the results obtained the proposed op elm outperformed the mlpnn for forecasting do for a period greater than 168 h 7 days in advance with an r2 equal to 0 83 and 0 82 for op elm and mlpnn respectively hence this paper presents a comparative study between three types of artificial intelligence techniques models namely mars m5t and lssvm for the prediction of daily do concentration in river using data from three usgs stations the results are presented and compared separately for each station for the first two models this is the first study in the literature that attempts to predict do at daily time step using water quality variables as inputs 2 methods 2 1 study area and data used water quality variables and do concentration from three stations operated by the united states geological survey usgs were used in this study the three study stations were respectively located in i the fanno creek at durham road washington county oregon usgs 14206950 ii on the east canyon creek near jeremy ranch summit county utah usgs 10133800 and iii in delaware river at trenton mercer county new jersey usgs 01463500 for the three study stations data are available at the usgs website usgs 2017 a comparison of the different three rivers regarding the drainage area showed a significant difference drainage areas range from 31 5 square miles mi2 to 6780 square miles for the three sites the fanno creek at durham road has a drainage area of approximately 31 5 square miles 57 2 squaremiles for the east canyon creek near jeremy ranch finally the delaware river at trenton has a drainage area of 6780 mi2 the site in the delaware river at trenton usgs 01463500 is located in the state of pennsylvania new jersey nj and new york ny that drains to trenton nj and is the most downstream streamgage on the main stem with a length approximately equal to 200 miles goode et al 2010 the naturel drainage area of the delaware river basin crosses many man made boundaries the river is fed by 216 substantial tributaries and serves as ecological and recreational resources usace 2010 according to limbeck and smith 2007 delaware river generally possesses a diatom community characteristic of high water quality and high biological integrity limbeck and smith 2007 brightbill et al 2010 the average annual temperature in the delaware river basin ranges from about 45 degrees fahrenheit f in the northern part of the basin to 56 f in the southern part average annual precipitation within the region is approximately 45 inches per year usace 2015 stuckey 2016 east canyon creek river begins as mcleod creek the streambed is composed of mud sand gravel and cobbles along most of its reach and the stream banks are vegetated mainly with grasses and willows wilkowske 2005 according to ames et al 2005 the east canyon reservoir in northern utah is characterized by exceeded phosphorus concentration this led to an increased algal growth and subsequent eutrophication with low levels of do concentration the climate is typical of the semiarid central and northern mountainous regions of utah the precipitation falls predominantly during the winter months of april to september predominantly in the form of snow and the snowmelt runoff constitute the primary source of water in the reservoir utah deq 2010 the do concentration in the east canyon creek is directly and indirectly influenced by several water quality variables and physical characteristics of a river in order to identify the linkages between do and water quality parameters such as organic matter nutrients and physical river habitat characteristics a model has been developed and tested over several scenarios sbwrd 2008 the results obtained demonstrated that i an association between reduced diurnal do swings and reduced sunlight ii mean do concentration change significantly with the physical characteristics of the rivers such as width and depth iii an increase of do in response to an increase of the upstream flow iv increased stream shading contribute significantly to an increase in do concentration and v the density of the riparian vegetation is poor sbwrd 2008 utah deq 2010 fanno creek at durham oregon is a highly urbanized land and has a relatively rapid response to storm runoff anderson and rounds 2010 dominated by urban land use keith et al 2014 with an urban intensity index uii equal to 96 with 84 percent as urban and 1 percent as agriculture the climate is typical of the pacific northwest regions waite et al 2008 although the origin of organic matter om found in the fanno creek has not been defined accurately keith et al 2014 in their recently published study sobieszczyk et al 2014 demonstrated that low level of do concentration is mainly related to the presence of organic matter om in the fanno creek the riparian corridors are composed of wetlands parks residential neighborhoods golf courses businesses and small forested areas goldman et al 2014 detailed descriptions of the data set with the period of records are reported in table 1 for each station we use the daily data from january 2002 to december 2016 except that for the usgs 14206950 station due to lack of available data the data start only from january 2003 in the present study we split the data into three set namely the training set the validation set and the test set for each station we use three successive periods training validation and test hence a total of fifteen years were used except for the for the usgs 14206950 station we have only fourteen years we selected the years 2002 to 2010 as the training period 2011 to 2013 as the validation period and 2014 to 2016 as the test period for the usgs 14206950 station as reported above the training period was shortened to only eight years from 2003 to 2010 table 1 the water quality data used in this study consisted of daily measured of water temperature te c discharge di cfs ph std unit specific conductance sc μs cm and do mg l the dataset selected have different lengths and the patterns with inadequate data were removed table 1 the data of the four water quality variables do te sc di were expressed as mean value unless the ph values were expressed as median the stations were equipped with water quality monitors the monitors provided daily measurements throughout the year of te ph di sc and do for the present study we have selected the four water quality variables as inputs ph te sc di that are available at the usgs national water information system nwis for the three selected sites although water turbidity tu variable is available at two sites usgs 14206950 and 01463500 and can be used as input variable tu is not available at the usgs 10133800 and is excluded from the pattern it is important to select the same inputs variables for an appropriate comparison of the results for the three stations finally it is important to highlight that no other water quality variable are available in the selected sites table 2 represents the daily statistic parameters of water quality variables in the study area for the three stations in the table the terms xmean xmax xmin sx cv and r denote the mean maximum minimum standard deviation coefficient of variation and the coefficient of correlation between the variable and the do respectively pearson correlation coefficients as shown in table 3 finally in the present study before applying the three models all the four input variables and the do were normalized to contain the same scale with mean equal to 0 and standard deviation equal 1 using the z score method by eq 16 using the z score method the performance of the developed models has substantially improved olden and jackson 2002 16 x ni k x i k m k sd k where xni k is the normalized value m k and sd k are the mean value and standard deviation of the variable k several combination of the water quality variables were selected and in total six scenarios were compared those are table 4 i te ph sc and di ii te ph and sc iii te sc and di iv te and sc v te and ph vi te and di the selection of the six combinations is mainly based on the coefficient of correlation te which has the highest correlation with do were included in all input combinations 2 2 least squares support vector machine lssvm least squares support vector machine lssvm is a modified version of the original support vector machines svm proposed by suykens and vandewalle 1999 the original svm is based on solving a set of quadratic programming problem qp while the proposed lssvm is based on solving a set of linear equation using a linear programming lp approach thereby further improving the reliability and efficiency of the lssvm approach and overcome several limitations encountered in the original svm suykens et al 2002 the lssvm algorithm is presented briefly below using the lssvm any model based on nonlinear mapping function can be presented as suykens et al 2002 1 f x w t φ x b where φ represents the nonlinear function applied to maps the input variables water quality variables into a higher dimensional feature space w is a weight vector of the same dimension as the feature space and b is the bias term in the original version of the svm w and b were calculated by minimizing the cost function cf suykens et al 2002 2 cf 1 2 w t w 1 2 γ i 1 n e i 2 the achievement of this cost function is subject to following constraints 3 y i w t φ x i b e i i 1 2 n γ is a regularization parameter n corresponds to the number of data points xi and yi corresponds to the input and output data point for the correspond ith pattern data which in our study are water temperature specific conductance ph the sensor depth do concentration respectively and e e 1 en is the residual vector or the training error for xi eqs 2 and 3 lead to a typical problem of convex optimization which can be solved by using the lagrange multipliers method suykens et al 2002 as follows 4 l w b e α 1 2 w t w 1 2 γ i 1 n e i 2 i 1 n α i w t φ x i b e i y i where α i is the lagrange multipliers and φ is a nonlinear mapping function defined in eq 1 by finding the partial derivative of formula 4 with respect to w b αi and ei we obtained the following equation hu et al 2015 5 y i 1 n α i φ x φ x i b i 1 n α i φ x φ

function 7 y i 1 n α i k x x i b any approximation function using lssvm can be achieved using several types of kernel functions in the present study we only focused on the radial basis function rbf kernel function represented as follow 8 k x x i exp x x i 2 2 σ 2 since it has been proposed lssvm has been applied in many areas kisi 2012 2013 2015 2016 kisi and parmar 2016 in the present study to implement the lssvm model we used the matlab toolbox ls svmlab pelckmans et al 2002 2 3 multivariate adaptive regression splines multivariate adaptive regression splines mars was introduced by friedman 1991 is a nonparametric model generally used to build a nonlinear model between a set of input variables or predictors and dependent variables friedman 1991 mars belong in the category of stepwise linear regression and work by the construction of the linear basis functions to determine the number of basic functions as well as the parameters associated with each one no prior knowledge required and the bfs are automatically determined by the training data friedman 1991 by subdividing the inputs variables into regions mars fits a linear regression equation to each of them the intervals are usually called basis functions bfs whereas the break values are called knots conoscenti et al 2016 any function approximation using mars can be presented as follow 9 y f x ψ 0 m 1 m ψ m

each formed by a coefficient ψm x x1 x2 xn is the vector of input variables in the present study equal to four mars is being implemented in two stages commencing with a forward stage and ending by a backward stage the forward is a selection process starting only with the intercept ψ0 while the backward is a pruning process liu and cheng 2016 during the forward selection process the model selects all possible basis functions and corresponding knots williams and gomez 2016 this lead to a construction a very complex model with irrelevant functions in the backward phase the redundant basis functions that have the smallest contribution to the model are removed using the generalized cross validation gcv conoscenti et al 2016 liu and cheng 2016 williams and gomez 2016 gcv is written as 10 gcv m 1 n i 1 n y i f x i 2 1 c m n 2 where m is the number of basis functions y i is the true value at xi f xi is the predictive value at xi n is the number of data m is the number of term in the model and c is the complexity function expressed as c m is a complexity penalty that increases with the number of basis functions in the model garcia nieto et al 2011 and defined by conoscenti et al 2016 liu and cheng 2016 williams and gomez 2016 11 c m m d 2 1 1 in the eq 11 d is a penalizing factor for each basis function included into the model the gcv is not used only to penalize the basis function the knots are also penalized friedman 1991 in the present study to implement the mars model we used the matlab toolbox areslab jekabsons 2010a 2 4 m5 model tree m5 model tree m5t or cubist model mccandless et al 2015 is a data driven model proposed by quinlan 1992 and mainly used in the area of water science kisi and kilic 2015 kisi 2016 kisi and parmar 2016 rahimikhoob et al 2013 rahimikhoob 2014 the m5t model has a place in the category of piecewise linear model in the m5t model the minimization of standard deviation sd in the values of intra subset class is utilized as the splitting criteria hashmi et al 2015 and the m5t produce linear models in their leaves abolfathi et al 2016 m5t is used to map a set of inputs to an output and generally are built in two separate stages quinlan 1992 solomatine and xue 2004 the tree growth step and the tree pruning step in the first stage also called the splitting step the input space is divided into several classes using linear regression models and minimizing the errors between the measured and predicted values hence using the information obtained a decision tree is created the standard deviation of the class value reached at a node is used for splitting criterion solomatine and xue 2004 second the tree is pruned back from each leaf behnood et al 2015 the formula to compute the standard deviation reduction sdr is 12 sdr sd t t i t sd t i where t presents a set of examples in the data set that reach the node ti denotes the subsets of examples that have the ith outcome of the potential set and sd represents the standard deviation wang and witten 1997 rahimikhoob et al 2013 rahimikhoob 2014 splitting procedure stops only if the sdr values for linear model are smaller or equal to the expected error for that sub tree behnood et al 2015 abolfathi et al 2016 in the present study to implement the m5t model we used the matlab toolbox m5primelab jekabsons 2010b 2 5 performance assessment of the models in the present study we used three performance indices in order to evaluate performance and compare the developed models these three indices are the coefficient of correlation r the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae calculated as follow 13 r 1 n o i o m p i p m 1 n i 1 n o i o m 2 1 n i 1 n p i p m 2 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 15 mae 1 n i 1 n o i p i where n is the number of data points o i is the measured value and p i is the corresponding model prediction o m and p m are the average values of o i and p i 3 results and discussion the results are presented separately for the three study stations firstly during the training process the lssvm mars and m5t models are trained to obtain optimal set of parameters for each model using only the training subset the generalization ability and the quantifications of the models performances are investigated using the validation and test subset the optimum parameters of the lssvm model were selected by trial and error firstly the parameters were arbitrarily chosen for the first iteration secondly by checking the results obtained a new set of parameters values is obtained while adding to the previous parameters a small value and continue like this until the best performances are reached the two parameters are the regularization constant parameter gam and the squared kernel parameter sig2 for the gaussian rbf respectively more details about the selection of the lssvm parameters including sig2 and gam can be found in tien bui et al 2016a b for the six scenarios the two parameters vary depending on the inputs combinations for the mars model we run the model with a maximum number of basis functions bfs equal to 150 however after the pruning backward phase the number of bfs decreases and varies depending on the inputs combinations finally for the m5t we run the model using the following parameters that are jekabsons 2010b i model tree instead regression tree ii the minimum number of training observations one node may represent equals to two iii built a model with pruning the tree iv smoothing coefficient equals to 15 and v the split threshold equals to 0 05 according to wang and witten 1997 splitting the node is not necessary if the sd of the values of output variable at the node is less than split threshold of the sd of output variable for the entire training data details results are reported in the following sections daily do of the usgs 14206950 station was predicted using various combinations of te ph sc and di inputs results in training validation and test phases for the lssvm mars and m5t models are reported in table 5 according to table 5 the three models are good with high levels of accuracy also it is apparent that all the models provide different accuracies for different inputs combinations in the training phase it is clear from the table 5 that the rmse values range 0 518 0 647 0 480 0 645 0 350 0 617 mg l for the lssvm mars and m5t respectively it is clear from the results that the lowest value of the rmse 0 350 mg l was obtained using the m5t1 however the maximum rmse value was found to be 0 647 mg l for the lssvm5 model according to table 5 the mae values range 0 388 0 487 0 360 0 494 0 243 0 458 mg l for the lssvm mars and m5t respectively the lowest value of the mae 0 243 mg l was obtained using the m5t1 nevertheless as reported in table 5 the m5t1 with te ph sc and di yielded higher efficiency than all the other models for the usgs 14206950 station and it performed better in estimating do in comparison finally the maximum r was found to be 0 967 0 971 and 0 985 for the lssvm3 mars1 and m5t1 respectively the minimum r was found to be 0 947 for the lssvm5 model however when comparing the results between the three models taking into account the input variables included using scenario 1 2 and 3 the m5t is always the best the mars rank in the second order followed by the lssvm models in the third place where only the models included at least two input variables the results are quite different when only te and sc were used as inputs the m5t4 performed the best with an r equal to 0 961 and rmse equal to 0 558 mg l followed by the mars4 with an r equal to 0 949 and rmse equal to 0 637 mg l and the lssvm4 took in third place with an r and rmse equal to 0 948 and 0 645 mg l respectively however between the three scenarios proposed when the models have included only two inputs the m5t6 with te and di as inputs variables is the best model with an r equal to 0 970 rmse equal to 0 491 mg l and mae equal to 0 359 mg l the performances of the three models in validation and test phases are reported in table 5 according to table 5 it is clear that all models provided good accuracy and the scenario 4 is the worst with the maximum rmse and mae and the low r in the validation phase the maximum values of the rmse were found to be 0 757 0 641 and 0 722 mg l for the lssvm4 mars4 and m5t4 respectively similarly the maximum values of the mae were found to be 0 563 0 483 and 0 516 mg l for the lssvm4 mars4 and m5t4 respectively finally the maximum values of the r were found to be 0 963 0 965 and 0 950 for the lssvm1 mars1 and m5t6 respectively in the validation phase the mars1 is the best model with the maximum r 0 965 and the minimum rmse and mae values of 0 547 and 0 386 mg l respectively followed by the lssvm1 and the m5t6 respectively the r values were 0 963 and 0 950 respectively nevertheless regarding the values of the rmse and mae it is clear that the mars1 is the best over the other in the test phase as shown in table 5 the performances of the mars1 is better than the lssvm1 and the m5t1 however the mars1 and lssvm1 models will lead almost the same accuracy the mars1 yielded high correlations between the measured and model predicted values of do the r value was 0 957 and the rmse and mae were 0 613 and 0 426 mg l respectively always in the table 5 scenario 4 is the worst the value of r rmse and mae range 0 921 0 934 0 749 0 822 mg l and 0 533 0 544 mg l respectively among the two input models the lssvm4 mars4 and m5t4 models comprising te and sc inputs have the lowest accuracy even though ph has a lower correlation see table 3 with do in relative to di and sc variables the models including te and ph inputs has a better accuracy than the models with te and sc inputs in test phase while the models with te and di inputs are the best model among the three scenarios having only two inputs variables this indicates the nonlinear relationship in the investigated phenomenon and r cannot show this in some cases specifically a high r coefficient between do and water quality variables does not necessarily lead to a model with high accuracy however adding di variable into the input combinations significantly increase models accuracies from input ii to input i or from input vi to input iii for example the lssvm1 decreased the rmse and mae of the lssvm2 model by 15 84 and 16 80 and the accuracy of the lssvm4 in respect of rmse and mae were increased by 12 38 and 12 using the lssvm3 in the test phase respectively the scatterplot of observed and calculated do values for the bests models the lssvm1 mars1 and m5t6 in the test phase are shown in fig 1 it is evident from the figure that the lssvm1 and mars1 models have less scattered estimates than the m5t6 models daily do of the usgs 10133800 station was predicted in this section using same input combinations the r rmse and mae statistics in the training validation and test phase for all models developed are given in table 6 from the results we shall highlight some important points first the lssvm5 mars5 and m5t5 were the best models among all the developed scenarios second the three models provided less accuracy in the training phase compared to the results in the validation and test phases thirdly and finally the high level of accuracy of the three models is certainly due to the fact that te and ph have a high correlation coefficient with do concentration as stated in table 3 in the training phase as reported in table 6 for the lssvm models the values of r rmse and mae statistics ranged from 0 889 to 0 917 0 562 mg l to 0 644 mg l and 0 424 mg l to 0 478 mg l respectively the best results were obtained from the lssvm2 similarly for the mars models the values of r rmse and mae statistics ranged from 0 887 to 0 913 0 576 mg l to 0 651 mg l and 0 438 mg l to 0 486 mg l respectively whereas for the m5t models the values of r rmse and mae statistics ranged from 0 914 to 0 968 0 355 mg l to 0 571 mg l and 0 239 mg l to 0 417 mg l respectively when comparing the different scenarios having different inputs combinations the six m5t models were found to be the best in comparison to the lssvm and the mars models finally one can conclude that overall using only two inputs variables te and ph as inputs the m5t5 is the best model among all developed models in table 6 results are given in validation and test phases using the three developed models the lssvm mars and m5t it is apparent that all three models are good and agree closely with measured do data from the table 6 it appears that i according to all three performances indices r rmse and mae the lssvm5 is the best model and out performs the other models during the validation and test phases ii the mars5 ranked on second place and m5t5 is the third best model having both a lower mae and rmse iii in the validation phase from the six developed scenarios scenario 3 4 and 3 were the worst for the lssvm mars and m5t respectively with the maximum rmse and mae and the low r iv in the test phase as seen in table 6 scenario 3 6 and 6 were the worst for the lssvm mars and m5t respectively it can be observed from table 6 that the lssvm5 have high performance in comparison to the mars5 and m5t5 in the validation phase with values of r rmse and mae equal to 0 979 0 323 mg l and 0 254 mg l respectively in the test phase as reported in table 6 the lssvm5 give the best model with values of r rmse and mae equal to 0 968 0 373 mg l and 0 304 mg l respectively the mars5 model possesses the second highest level of accuracy with values of r rmse and mae equal to 0 962 0 354 mg l and 0 282 mg l respectively finally the m5t5 model ranks third with values of r rmse and mae equal to 0 947 0 419 mg l and 0 317 mg l respectively in the test phase the best accuracy of the three models was obtained from the fifth input combination involving te and ph variables comparison of two input models apparently show that the 5th models involving te and ph perform superior to the 6th te and di inputs and 4th models te and sc in the test phase these results are confirmed by the r values given in table 6 it is clear from the table 6 adding di variable into the input combinations considerably increase or decrease models performances even though it has very low correlation 0 075 with do variable in the validation phase lssvm1 decreased the rmse and mae of lssvm2 model by 9 06 and 7 09 and the accuracy of the lssvm2 in respect of rmse and mae was increased by 20 and 18 56 using lssvm1 in the test phase respectively this result must always relate to the individual case study and for a particular model and cannot be generalized and the above statement is not valid for the mars and m5t models according to table 6 adding di variable into the input combinations considerably decrease mars and m5t models performances in the validation phase mars2 decreased the rmse and mae of mars1 model by 24 50 and 11 65 and the accuracy of the mars1 in respect of rmse and mae was increased by 77 32 and 62 80 using mars2 in the test phase respectively finally the m5t2 model decreased the rmse and mae of m5t1 model by 8 35 and 7 77 and the accuracy of the m5t1 in respect of rmse and mae was increased by 14 46 and 19 01 using m5t2 in the test phase respectively the scatterplot of observed and calculated do values for the bests models lssvm5 mars5 and m5t5 are shown in fig 2 here also the estimates of the lssvm5 model comprising only two inputs te and ph variables closer to the corresponding observed do values than those of the mars5 and m5t5 models lssvm5 model has highly scattered estimates the training validation and test performances of the lssvm mars and m5t models for the usgs 01463500 are reported in table 7 in the training phase as seen in table 7 the m5t1 is the best model followed by the lssvm2 and the mars5 ranked in the third place the r rmse and mae for the m5t1 were 0 988 0 364 mg l and 0 257 mg l respectively the comparison of the six scenarios developed reveals that the lssvm6 mars6 and m5t4 performed the worst it is clear from the table 7 that in the validation phase the r values range 0 947 0 972 0 952 0 978 and 0 945 0 970 for the lssvm mars and m5t respectively even if one considers the rmse mae and the r values the mars1 is the best model and performs better than all the other models followed by the lssvm5 and the m5t5 in the third place during the test phase as seen from table 7 the difference between the three models is significantly clear and the mars1 performs better than the lssvm5 and m5t5 in respect to r rmse and mae performance indices with values equal to 0 979 0 418 mg l and 0 311 mg l respectively the high value of r together with the low rmse and mae values confirm the superiority of the mars1 in the test phase the relative rmse and mae differences between the mars1 and lssvm5 models are 42 and 41 in the test phase respectively in addition the relative rmse and mae differences between the mars1 and m5t5 models are 19 and 21 in the test phase respectively the effect of the di variable on performance of the models is investigated adding di variable into the input combinations significantly increase lssvm models accuracies for example lssvm1 decreased the rmse and mae of lssvm2 model by 14 11 and 14 12 in the validation phase respectively in the test phase lssvm1 decreased the rmse and mae of lssvm2 model by 9 58 and 10 57 respectively contrary to the lssvm models the inclusions of the di variable into the m5t models do not improve the performances of the models quite the contrary the performances of the models have decreased significantly in the validation phase the m5t2 decreased the rmse and mae of m5t1 model by 2 and 0 5 and the accuracy of the m5t1 in respect of rmse and mae was increased by 18 45 and 7 87 using the m5t2 in the test phase respectively finally the effect of the di variable on performance of the mars models is investigated in the validation phase as seen in table 7 the mars1 improved the mars2 model of about 8 93 and 6 reduction in rmse and mae respectively similarly in the test phase as seen in table 7 the mars1 improved the mars2 model of about 16 56 and 11 64 reduction in rmse and mae respectively similar to the lssvm models including di input considerably increase mars models accuracies finally using only two input variables te and ph the mars5 model outperforms the lssvm5 and m5t5 in the validation and test phases using only these two variables the mars5 has an r rmse and mae equal to 0 976 0 494 mg l and 0 340 mg l in the validation phase respectively similarly in the test phase the mars5 is the best model with r rmse and mae values of 0 978 0 451 mg l and 0 336 mg l respectively the scatterplot of observed and calculated do values for the bests models lssvm5 mars1 and m5t5 are shown in fig 3 4 conclusions in this study lssvm m5t and mars models were compared for predicting daily do concentration using water quality variables from three stations in usa six different scenarios having different input combinations have been developed and compared including i te ph sc and di ii te ph and sc iii te sc and di iv te and sc v te and ph vi te and di in the light of the results obtained so far we can draw the following general conclusions firstly the three proposed models should be considered as a powerful tool for predicting do concentration using water quality variables as inputs secondly the achieved numerical results showed that the accuracies of the models vary from one station to another knowing that the three models were applied for three different rivers for the usgs 14206950 station mars model were higher than lssvm and m5t and mars1 using te ph sc and di as input was the best among all other developed models in both validation and test phases in the validation phase the mars1 is the best model and outperforms both lssvm1 and m5t1 with an improvement regarding the rmse and mae values of about 8 22 11 05 and 23 50 25 05 respectively for the test phase the two models mars1 and lssvm1 were quite similar and the improvement regarding the rmse and mae value is relatively small with values of about 0 5 and 2 3 respectively however the difference is significant between mars1 and m5t6 and the improvement regarding the rmse and mae value is relatively high with values of about 8 91 and 15 00 respectively similarly for the usgs 01463500 station mars model were higher than lssvm and m5t and mars5 using te and ph as input was the best among all other developed models in both validation and test phases unlike in the previous two study stations for the usgs 10133800 station lssvm model were higher than mars and m5t and lssvm5 using te and ph as input was the best among all other developed models in both validation and test phases thirdly the effect of the di variable on performance of the models varies depending on the models and on the station and now general conclusion can be drawn fourthly and finally according to the results obtained it was found that do can be estimated very well using only te and ph acknowledgments

of hydrology for their invaluable comments and suggestions on the contents of the manuscript which significantly improved the quality of the paper

modelling dissolved oxygen least square support vector machine multivariate adaptive regression splines m5 model tree 1 introduction monitoring and control of water quality parameters in river stream and lakes has become of great importance this is due to the fact that the major parameters measured in situ are used to identify and quantify the pollution of water in the course of measuring water quality parameters some of them were extremely important than others dissolved oxygen concentration do is the most important water quality parameter and mainly adopted as indicators of pollution in river mohan and pavan kumar 2016 to assess the trophic state of rivers canals and lakes for calculation of the water quality index and has been integrated as a part of some water quality models gikas 2014 chamoglou et al 2014 mellios et al 2015 despite his great importance much effort has been devoted to understand the variation of do over the space and time hence in this subject some important variables are identified to be directly affecting the concentration of do although the direct variation of do is difficult to discern cox 2003a b much effort has been devoted to establishing the impact of changing do in response to the change of other water quality variables this is the important underlying motivations for developing a models for predicting do using water quality variables over the last few years the developments of data driven paradigm has led to the development of many successful model for do worldwide in depth literature review encompassing all applied models for do demonstrate that at least five type of models are mainly adopted by researchers these models can be classified into artificial neural networks fuzzy logic and neural fuzzy evolutionary models support vector machines svm and wavelet decomposition based models artificial neural networks are the most applied data driven models and generally fourth categories are always applied for modelling do among them the most widely used is the multilayer perceptron neural network mlpnn sometime referred to feedforward neural network ffnn ranković et al 2010 najah et al 2014 radial basis function neural network rbfnn has the second largest application in the subject ay and kisi 2012 the generalized regression neural network grnn heddam 2014a antanasijević et al 2014 took in third place the fourth and last place is taken by others neural network models seldom selected as a model for predicting do that are the cascade correlation artificial neural networks ccann diamantopoulou et al 2007 the elman neural networks elnn liu et al 2012 and finally the recurrent neural network rnn wang et al 2011 ranković et al 2010 investigated the capabilities of ffnn for predicting do using several water quality variables they found that water temperature and ph are the variables that most affect do najah et al 2014 developed a mlpnn for predicting do at johor malaysian at monthly time step and demonstrated that i water ph is the input variables with the lowest effect on the performances of the proposed model and ii the limitations of the mlpnn in predicting the extreme do values by using data from two usgs stations ay and kisi 2012 have tried to estimate do at the upstream using data from the downstream and vice versa and reported very promising results by comparing the mlpnn and the rbfnn models the authors demonstrated that rbfnn was found to be the best model for estimating the do concentration antanasijević et al 2014 applied grnn model with the monte carlo simulation mcs technique for modelling do in the danube river north serbia heddam 2014a compared grnn with mlr models for predicting do using four inputs variables those are water temperature ph specific conductance and sensor depth finally the ccann elnn and rnn very rarely occupied by the researchers this category of ann models have unfortunately been underused and often underestimated various fuzzy logic and neural fuzzy models are developed to predict do concentration these models are classified and referred as the fuzzy logic fl altunkaynak et al 2005 fuzzy pattern recognition giusti and marsili libelli 2009 and the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis heddam 2014b ay and kisi 2016 altunkaynak et al 2005 applied the takagi sugeno fuzzy logic for forecasting do in the golden horn in istanbul turkey giusti and marsili libelli 2009 used fuzzy pattern recognition for modelling the do dynamics in orbetello lagoon italy anfis was applied for do worldwide and the results reported were very promising heddam 2014b and ay and kisi 2016 compared two anfis models namely i grid partition based fuzzy inference system named anfis grid and ii subtractive clustering based fuzzy inference system named anfis sub for estimating do at hourly and monthly time steps respectively at hourly time step heddam 2014b demonstrated that do can be predicted very well using only water temperature as input variable at monthly time step ay and kisi 2016 demonstrated that do can be estimated with high accuracy using anfis sub compared to the anfis grid since a few years a new type of models quite promising has seen significant growth the evolutionary models these models have been applied successfully for modelling do among them gene expression programming gep kisi et al 2013 dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference system denfis heddam 2014c and the evolving fuzzy neural network efunn heddam 2016a kisi et al 2013 applied gene expression programming gep for predicting daily do concentration at south platte river at englewood colorado usa heddam 2014c compared two dynamic evolving neural fuzzy inference systems denfis namely i offline based system named denfis of and ii online based system named denfis on many other models have been developed to predict do concentration recently heddam 2016a compared efunn and mlr for predicting hourly do and demonstrated that efunn is more accurate than the mlr model models based on the combination of wavelet decomposition artificial neural and regression models have been proposed and various applications appear in the literature xu and liu 2013 alizadeh and kavianpour 2015 evrendilek and karakaya 2014 svm models have been successfully applied for modelling do concentration liu et al 2014 tarmizi et al 2014 malek et al 2014 khotimah 2014 yu et al 2016 liu et al 2014 applied lssvm optimized particle swarm optimization pso for predicting do content in river crab culture ponds china the authors demonstrated that the proposed hybrid model based on lssvm and pso has higher efficiency than other two models rbfnn and lssvm with a coefficient of determination r2 equal to 0 97 in the testing phase tarmizi et al 2014 applied svm for predicting do using five water quality variables collected from the terengganu river malaysia the authors reported that svm is a powerful tool for predicting do concentration and the model yielded higher efficiency with an r2 equal to 0 94 in another study malek et al 2014 examined the potential of svm for predicting do concentration in chini and bera lake malaysia using eleven water quality variables as inputs using a forward selection method the authors find that water temperature ph and electrical conductivity were the most important input variables for predicting do khotimah 2014 applied smooth support vector machine ssvm for predicting do in river surabaya indonesia using the root mean square error rmse as evaluation criteria the authors have obtained an rmse equal to 0 027 mg l yu et al 2016 compared lssvm and rbfnn for predicting do in crab ponds china the proposed model worked reasonably well in comparison with the rbfnn model more recently a new type of models called optimally pruned extreme learning machine op elm has been proposed and applied for forecasting do concentration heddam 2016b according to the results obtained the proposed op elm outperformed the mlpnn for forecasting do for a period greater than 168 h 7 days in advance with an r2 equal to 0 83 and 0 82 for op elm and mlpnn respectively hence this paper presents a comparative study between three types of artificial intelligence techniques models namely mars m5t and lssvm for the prediction of daily do concentration in river using data from three usgs stations the results are presented and compared separately for each station for the first two models this is the first study in the literature that attempts to predict do at daily time step using water quality variables as inputs 2 methods 2 1 study area and data used water quality variables and do concentration from three stations operated by the united states geological survey usgs were used in this study the three study stations were respectively located in i the fanno creek at durham road washington county oregon usgs 14206950 ii on the east canyon creek near jeremy ranch summit county utah usgs 10133800 and iii in delaware river at trenton mercer county new jersey usgs 01463500 for the three study stations data are available at the usgs website usgs 2017 a comparison of the different three rivers regarding the drainage area showed a significant difference drainage areas range from 31 5 square miles mi2 to 6780 square miles for the three sites the fanno creek at durham road has a drainage area of approximately 31 5 square miles 57 2 squaremiles for the east canyon creek near jeremy ranch finally the delaware river at trenton has a drainage area of 6780 mi2 the site in the delaware river at trenton usgs 01463500 is located in the state of pennsylvania new jersey nj and new york ny that drains to trenton nj and is the most downstream streamgage on the main stem with a length approximately equal to 200 miles goode et al 2010 the naturel drainage area of the delaware river basin crosses many man made boundaries the river is fed by 216 substantial tributaries and serves as ecological and recreational resources usace 2010 according to limbeck and smith 2007 delaware river generally possesses a diatom community characteristic of high water quality and high biological integrity limbeck and smith 2007 brightbill et al 2010 the average annual temperature in the delaware river basin ranges from about 45 degrees fahrenheit f in the northern part of the basin to 56 f in the southern part average annual precipitation within the region is approximately 45 inches per year usace 2015 stuckey 2016 east canyon creek river begins as mcleod creek the streambed is composed of mud sand gravel and cobbles along most of its reach and the stream banks are vegetated mainly with grasses and willows wilkowske 2005 according to ames et al 2005 the east canyon reservoir in northern utah is characterized by exceeded phosphorus concentration this led to an increased algal growth and subsequent eutrophication with low levels of do concentration the climate is typical of the semiarid central and northern mountainous regions of utah the precipitation falls predominantly during the winter months of april to september predominantly in the form of snow and the snowmelt runoff constitute the primary source of water in the reservoir utah deq 2010 the do concentration in the east canyon creek is directly and indirectly influenced by several water quality variables and physical characteristics of a river in order to identify the linkages between do and water quality parameters such as organic matter nutrients and physical river habitat characteristics a model has been developed and tested over several scenarios sbwrd 2008 the results obtained demonstrated that i an association between reduced diurnal do swings and reduced sunlight ii mean do concentration change significantly with the physical characteristics of the rivers such as width and depth iii an increase of do in response to an increase of the upstream flow iv increased stream shading contribute significantly to an increase in do concentration and v the density of the riparian vegetation is poor sbwrd 2008 utah deq 2010 fanno creek at durham oregon is a highly urbanized land and has a relatively rapid response to storm runoff anderson and rounds 2010 dominated by urban land use keith et al 2014 with an urban intensity index uii equal to 96 with 84 percent as urban and 1 percent as agriculture the climate is typical of the pacific northwest regions waite et al 2008 although the origin of organic matter om found in the fanno creek has not been defined accurately keith et al 2014 in their recently published study sobieszczyk et al 2014 demonstrated that low level of do concentration is mainly related to the presence of organic matter om in the fanno creek the riparian corridors are composed of wetlands parks residential neighborhoods golf courses businesses and small forested areas goldman et al 2014 detailed descriptions of the data set with the period of records are reported in table 1 for each station we use the daily data from january 2002 to december 2016 except that for the usgs 14206950 station due to lack of available data the data start only from january 2003 in the present study we split the data into three set namely the training set the validation set and the test set for each station we use three successive periods training validation and test hence a total of fifteen years were used except for the for the usgs 14206950 station we have only fourteen years we selected the years 2002 to 2010 as the training period 2011 to 2013 as the validation period and 2014 to 2016 as the test period for the usgs 14206950 station as reported above the training period was shortened to only eight years from 2003 to 2010 table 1 the water quality data used in this study consisted of daily measured of water temperature te c discharge di cfs ph std unit specific conductance sc μs cm and do mg l the dataset selected have different lengths and the patterns with inadequate data were removed table 1 the data of the four water quality variables do te sc di were expressed as mean value unless the ph values were expressed as median the stations were equipped with water quality monitors the monitors provided daily measurements throughout the year of te ph di sc and do for the present study we have selected the four water quality variables as inputs ph te sc di that are available at the usgs national water information system nwis for the three selected sites although water turbidity tu variable is available at two sites usgs 14206950 and 01463500 and can be used as input variable tu is not available at the usgs 10133800 and is excluded from the pattern it is important to select the same inputs variables for an appropriate comparison of the results for the three stations finally it is important to highlight that no other water quality variable are available in the selected sites table 2 represents the daily statistic parameters of water quality variables in the study area for the three stations in the table the terms xmean xmax xmin sx cv and r denote the mean maximum minimum standard deviation coefficient of variation and the coefficient of correlation between the variable and the do respectively pearson correlation coefficients as shown in table 3 finally in the present study before applying the three models all the four input variables and the do were normalized to contain the same scale with mean equal to 0 and standard deviation equal 1 using the z score method by eq 16 using the z score method the performance of the developed models has substantially improved olden and jackson 2002 16 x ni k x i k m k sd k where xni k is the normalized value m k and sd k are the mean value and standard deviation of the variable k several combination of the water quality variables were selected and in total six scenarios were compared those are table 4 i te ph sc and di ii te ph and sc iii te sc and di iv te and sc v te and ph vi te and di the selection of the six combinations is mainly based on the coefficient of correlation te which has the highest correlation with do were included in all input combinations 2 2 least squares support vector machine lssvm least squares support vector machine lssvm is a modified version of the original support vector machines svm proposed by suykens and vandewalle 1999 the original svm is based on solving a set of quadratic programming problem qp while the proposed lssvm is based on solving a set of linear equation using a linear programming lp approach thereby further improving the reliability and efficiency of the lssvm approach and overcome several limitations encountered in the original svm suykens et al 2002 the lssvm algorithm is presented briefly below using the lssvm any model based on nonlinear mapping function can be presented as suykens et al 2002 1 f x w t φ x b where φ represents the nonlinear function applied to maps the input variables water quality variables into a higher dimensional feature space w is a weight vector of the same dimension as the feature space and b is the bias term in the original version of the svm w and b were calculated by minimizing the cost function cf suykens et al 2002 2 cf 1 2 w t w 1 2 γ i 1 n e i 2 the achievement of this cost function is subject to following constraints 3 y i w t φ x i b e i i 1 2 n γ is a regularization parameter n corresponds to the number of data points xi and yi corresponds to the input and output data point for the correspond ith pattern data which in our study are water temperature specific conductance ph

using the lagrange multipliers method suykens et al 2002 as follows 4 l w b e α 1 2 w t w 1 2 γ i 1 n e i 2 i 1 n α i w t φ x i b e i y i where α i is the lagrange multipliers and φ is a nonlinear mapping function defined in eq 1 by finding the partial derivative of formula 4 with respect to w b αi and ei we obtained the following equation hu et al 2015 5 y i 1 n α i φ x φ x i b i 1 n α i φ x φ

implement the lssvm model we used the matlab toolbox ls svmlab pelckmans et al 2002 2 3 multivariate adaptive regression splines multivariate adaptive regression splines mars was introduced by friedman 1991 is a nonparametric model generally used to build a nonlinear model between a set of input variables or predictors and dependent variables friedman 1991 mars belong in the category of stepwise linear regression and work by the construction of the linear basis functions to determine the number of basic functions as well as the parameters associated with each one no prior knowledge required and the bfs are automatically determined by the training data friedman 1991 by subdividing the inputs variables into regions mars fits a linear regression equation to each of them the intervals are usually called basis functions bfs whereas the break values are called knots conoscenti et al 2016 any function approximation using mars can be presented as follow 9 y f x ψ 0 m 1 m ψ m

each formed by a coefficient ψm x x1 x2 xn is the vector of input variables in the present study equal to four mars is being implemented in two stages commencing with a forward stage and ending by a backward stage the forward is a selection process starting only with the intercept ψ0 while the backward is a pruning process liu and cheng 2016 during the forward selection process the model selects all possible basis functions and corresponding knots williams and gomez 2016 this lead to a construction a very complex model with irrelevant functions in the backward phase the redundant basis functions that have the smallest contribution to the model are removed using the generalized cross validation gcv conoscenti et al 2016 liu and cheng 2016 williams and gomez 2016 gcv is written as 10

model and c is the complexity function expressed as c m is a complexity penalty that increases with the number of basis functions in the model garcia nieto et al 2011 and defined by conoscenti et al 2016 liu and cheng 2016 williams and gomez 2016 11 c m m d 2 1 1 in the eq 11 d is a penalizing factor for each basis function included into the model the gcv is not used only to penalize the basis function the knots are also penalized friedman 1991 in the present study to implement the mars model we used the matlab toolbox areslab jekabsons 2010a 2 4 m5 model tree m5 model tree m5t or cubist model mccandless et al 2015 is a data driven model proposed by quinlan 1992 and mainly used in the area of water science kisi and kilic 2015 kisi 2016 kisi and parmar 2016 rahimikhoob et al 2013 rahimikhoob 2014 the m5t model has a place in the category of piecewise linear model in the m5t model the minimization of standard deviation sd in the values of intra subset class is utilized as the splitting criteria hashmi et al 2015 and the m5t produce linear models in their leaves abolfathi et al 2016 m5t is used to map a set of inputs to an output and generally are built in two separate stages quinlan 1992 solomatine and xue 2004 the tree growth step and the tree pruning step in the first stage also called the splitting step the input space is divided into several classes using linear regression models and minimizing the errors between the measured and predicted values hence using the information obtained a decision tree is created the standard deviation of the class value reached at a node is used for splitting criterion solomatine and xue 2004 second the tree is pruned back from each leaf behnood et al 2015 the formula to compute the standard deviation reduction sdr is 12 sdr sd t t i t sd t i where t presents a set of examples in the data set that reach the node ti denotes the subsets of examples that have the ith outcome of the potential set and sd represents the standard deviation wang and witten 1997 rahimikhoob et al 2013 rahimikhoob 2014 splitting procedure stops only if the sdr values for linear model are smaller or equal to the expected error for that sub tree behnood et al 2015 abolfathi et al 2016 in the present study to implement the m5t model we used the matlab toolbox m5primelab jekabsons 2010b 2 5 performance assessment of the models in the present study we used three performance indices in order to evaluate performance and compare the developed models these three indices are the coefficient of correlation r the root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae calculated as follow 13 r 1 n o i o m p i p m 1 n i 1 n o i o m 2 1 n i 1 n p i p m 2 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i p i 2 15 mae 1 n i 1 n o i p i where n is the number of data points o i is the measured value and p i is the corresponding model prediction o m and p m are the average values of o i and p i 3 results and discussion the results are presented separately for the three study stations firstly during the training process the lssvm mars and m5t models are trained to obtain optimal set of parameters for each model using only the training subset the generalization ability and the quantifications of the models performances are investigated using the validation and test subset the optimum parameters of the lssvm model were selected by trial and error firstly the parameters were arbitrarily chosen for the first iteration secondly by checking the results obtained a new set of parameters values is obtained while adding to the previous parameters a small value and continue like this until the best performances are reached the two parameters are the regularization constant parameter gam and the squared kernel parameter sig2 for the gaussian rbf respectively more details about the selection of the lssvm parameters including sig2 and gam can be found in tien bui et al 2016a b for the six scenarios the two parameters vary depending on the inputs combinations for the mars model we run the model with a maximum number of basis functions bfs equal to 150 however after the pruning backward phase the number of bfs decreases and varies depending on the inputs combinations finally for the m5t we run the model using the following parameters that are jekabsons 2010b i model tree instead regression tree ii the minimum number of training observations one node may represent equals to two iii built a model with pruning the tree iv smoothing coefficient equals to 15 and v the split threshold equals to 0 05 according to wang and witten 1997 splitting the node is not necessary if the sd of the values of output variable at the node is less than split threshold of the sd of output variable for the entire training data details results are reported in the following sections daily do of the usgs 14206950 station was predicted using various combinations of te ph sc and di inputs results in training validation and test phases for the lssvm mars and m5t models are reported in table 5 according to table 5 the three models are good with high levels of accuracy also it is apparent that all the models provide different accuracies for different inputs combinations in the training phase it is clear from the table 5 that the rmse values range 0 518 0 647 0 480 0 645 0 350 0 617 mg l for the lssvm mars and m5t respectively it is clear from the results that the lowest value of the rmse 0 350 mg l was obtained using the m5t1 however the maximum rmse value was found to be 0 647 mg l for the lssvm5 model according to table 5 the mae values range 0 388 0 487 0 360 0 494 0 243 0 458 mg l for the lssvm mars and m5t respectively the lowest value of the mae 0 243 mg l was obtained using the m5t1 nevertheless as reported in table 5 the m5t1 with te ph sc and di yielded higher efficiency than all the other models for the usgs 14206950 station and it performed better in estimating do in comparison finally the maximum r was found to be 0 967 0 971 and 0 985 for the lssvm3 mars1 and m5t1 respectively the minimum r was found to be 0 947 for the lssvm5 model however when comparing the results between the three models taking into account the input variables included using scenario 1 2 and 3 the m5t is always the best the mars rank in the second order followed by the lssvm models in the third place where only the models included at least two input variables the results are quite different when only te and sc were used as inputs the m5t4 performed the best with an r equal to 0 961 and rmse equal to 0 558 mg l followed by the mars4 with an r equal to 0 949 and rmse equal to 0 637 mg l and the lssvm4 took in third place with an r and rmse equal to 0 948 and 0 645 mg l respectively however between the three scenarios proposed when the models have included only two inputs the m5t6 with te and di as inputs variables is the best model with an r equal to 0 970 rmse equal to 0 491 mg l and mae equal to 0 359 mg l the performances of the three models in validation and test phases are reported in table 5 according to table 5 it is clear that all models provided good accuracy and the scenario 4 is the worst with the maximum rmse and mae and the low r in the validation phase the maximum values of the rmse were found to be 0 757 0 641 and 0 722 mg l for the lssvm4 mars4 and m5t4 respectively similarly the maximum values of the mae were found to be 0 563 0 483 and 0 516 mg l for the lssvm4 mars4 and m5t4 respectively finally the maximum values of the r were found to be 0 963 0 965 and 0 950 for the lssvm1 mars1 and m5t6 respectively in the validation phase the mars1 is the best model with the maximum r 0 965 and the minimum rmse and mae values of 0 547 and 0 386 mg l respectively followed by the lssvm1 and the m5t6 respectively the r values were 0 963 and 0 950 respectively nevertheless regarding the values of the rmse and mae it is clear that the mars1 is the best over the other in the test phase as shown in table 5 the performances of the mars1 is better than the lssvm1 and the m5t1 however the mars1 and lssvm1 models will lead almost the same accuracy the mars1 yielded high correlations between the measured and model predicted values of do the r value was 0 957 and the rmse and mae were 0 613 and 0 426 mg l respectively always in the table 5 scenario 4 is the worst the value of r rmse and mae range 0 921 0 934 0 749 0 822 mg l and 0 533 0 544 mg l respectively among the two input models the lssvm4 mars4 and m5t4 models comprising te and sc inputs have the lowest accuracy even though ph has a lower correlation see table 3 with do in relative to di and sc variables the models including te and ph inputs has a better accuracy than the models with te and sc inputs in test phase while the models with te and di inputs are the best model among the three scenarios having only two inputs variables this indicates the nonlinear relationship in the investigated phenomenon and r cannot show this in some cases specifically a high r coefficient between do and water quality variables does not necessarily lead to a model with high accuracy however adding di variable into the input combinations significantly increase models accuracies from input ii to input i or from input vi to input iii for example the lssvm1 decreased the rmse and mae of the lssvm2 model by 15 84 and 16 80 and the accuracy of the lssvm4 in respect of rmse and mae were increased by 12 38 and 12 using the lssvm3 in the test phase respectively the scatterplot of observed and calculated do values for the bests models the lssvm1 mars1 and m5t6 in the test phase are shown in fig 1 it is evident from the figure that the lssvm1 and mars1 models have less scattered estimates than the m5t6 models daily do of the usgs 10133800 station was predicted in this section using same input combinations the r rmse and mae statistics in the training validation and test phase for all models developed are given in table 6 from the results we shall highlight some important points first the lssvm5 mars5 and m5t5 were the best models among all the developed scenarios second the three models provided less accuracy in the training phase compared to the results in the validation and test phases thirdly and finally the high level of accuracy of the three models is certainly due to the fact that te and ph have a high correlation coefficient with do concentration as stated in table 3 in the training phase as reported in table 6 for the lssvm models the values of r rmse and mae statistics ranged from 0 889 to 0 917 0 562 mg l to 0 644 mg l and 0 424 mg l to 0 478 mg l respectively the best results were obtained from the lssvm2 similarly for the mars models the values of r rmse and mae statistics ranged from 0 887 to 0 913 0 576 mg l to 0 651 mg l and 0 438 mg l to 0 486 mg l respectively whereas for the m5t models the values of r rmse and mae statistics ranged from 0 914 to 0 968 0 355 mg l to 0 571 mg l and 0 239 mg l to 0 417 mg l respectively when comparing the different scenarios having different inputs combinations the six m5t models were found to be the best in comparison to the lssvm and the mars models finally one can conclude that overall using only two inputs variables te and ph as inputs the m5t5 is the best model among all developed models in table 6 results are given in validation and test phases using the three developed models the lssvm mars and m5t it is apparent that all three models are good and agree closely with measured do data from the table 6 it appears that i according to all three performances indices r rmse and mae the lssvm5 is the best model and out performs the other models during the validation and test phases ii the mars5 ranked on second place and m5t5 is the third best model having both a lower mae and rmse iii in the validation phase from the six developed scenarios scenario 3 4 and 3 were the worst for the lssvm mars and m5t respectively with the maximum rmse and mae and the low r iv in the test phase as seen in table 6 scenario 3 6 and 6 were the worst for the lssvm mars and m5t respectively it can be observed from table 6 that the lssvm5 have high performance in comparison to the mars5 and m5t5 in the validation phase with values of r rmse and mae equal to 0 979 0 323 mg l and 0 254 mg l respectively in the test phase as reported in table 6 the lssvm5 give the best model with values of r rmse and mae equal to 0 968 0 373 mg l and 0 304 mg l respectively the mars5 model possesses the second highest level of accuracy with values of r rmse and mae equal to 0 962 0 354 mg l and 0 282 mg l respectively finally the m5t5 model ranks third with values of r rmse and mae equal to 0 947 0 419 mg l and 0 317 mg l respectively in the test phase the best accuracy of the three models was obtained from the fifth input combination involving te and ph variables comparison of two input models apparently show that the 5th models involving te and ph perform superior to the 6th te and di inputs and 4th models te and sc in the test phase these results are confirmed by the r values given in table 6 it is clear from the table 6 adding di variable into the input combinations considerably increase or decrease models performances even though it has very low correlation 0 075 with do variable in the validation phase lssvm1 decreased the rmse and mae of lssvm2 model by 9 06 and 7 09 and the accuracy of the lssvm2 in respect of rmse and mae was increased by 20 and 18 56 using lssvm1 in the test phase respectively this result must always relate to the individual case study and for a particular model and cannot be generalized and the above statement is not valid for the mars and m5t models according to table 6 adding di variable into the input combinations considerably decrease mars and m5t models performances in the validation phase mars2 decreased the rmse and mae of mars1 model by 24 50 and 11 65 and the accuracy of the mars1 in respect of rmse and mae was increased by 77 32 and 62 80 using mars2 in the test phase respectively finally the m5t2 model decreased the rmse and mae of m5t1 model by 8 35 and 7 77 and the accuracy of the m5t1 in respect of rmse and mae was increased by 14 46 and 19 01 using m5t2 in the test phase respectively the scatterplot of observed and calculated do values for the bests models lssvm5 mars5 and m5t5 are shown in fig 2 here also the estimates of the lssvm5 model comprising only two inputs te and ph variables closer to the corresponding observed do values than those of the mars5 and m5t5 models lssvm5 model has highly scattered estimates the training validation and test performances of the lssvm mars and m5t models for the usgs 01463500 are reported in table 7 in the training phase as seen in table 7 the m5t1 is the best model followed by the lssvm2 and the mars5 ranked in the third place the r rmse and mae for the m5t1 were 0 988 0 364 mg l and 0 257 mg l respectively the comparison of the six scenarios developed reveals that the lssvm6 mars6 and m5t4 performed the worst it is clear from the table 7 that in the validation phase the r values range 0 947 0 972 0 952 0 978 and 0 945 0 970 for the lssvm mars and m5t respectively even if one considers the rmse mae and the r values the mars1 is the best model and performs better than all the other models followed by the lssvm5 and the m5t5 in the third place during the test phase as seen from table 7 the difference between the three models is significantly clear and the mars1 performs better than the lssvm5 and m5t5 in respect to r rmse and mae performance indices with values equal to 0 979 0 418 mg l and 0 311 mg l respectively the high value of r together with the low rmse and mae values confirm the superiority of the mars1 in the test phase the relative rmse and mae differences between the mars1 and lssvm5 models are 42 and 41 in the test phase respectively in addition the relative rmse and mae differences between the mars1 and m5t5 models are 19 and 21 in the test phase respectively the effect of the di variable on performance of the models is investigated adding di variable into the input combinations significantly increase lssvm models accuracies for example lssvm1 decreased the rmse and mae of lssvm2 model by 14 11 and 14 12 in the validation phase respectively in the test phase lssvm1 decreased the rmse and mae of lssvm2 model by 9 58 and 10 57 respectively contrary to the lssvm models the inclusions of the di variable into the m5t models do not improve the performances of the models quite the contrary the performances of the models have decreased significantly in the validation phase the m5t2 decreased the rmse and mae of m5t1 model by 2 and 0 5 and the accuracy of the m5t1 in respect of rmse and mae was increased by 18 45 and 7 87 using the m5t2 in the test phase respectively finally the effect of the di variable on performance of the mars models is investigated in the validation phase as seen in table 7 the mars1 improved the mars2 model of about 8 93 and 6 reduction in rmse and mae respectively similarly in the test phase as seen in table 7 the mars1 improved the mars2 model of about 16 56 and 11 64 reduction in rmse and mae respectively similar to the lssvm models including di input considerably increase mars models accuracies finally using only two input variables te and ph the mars5 model outperforms the lssvm5 and m5t5 in the validation and test phases using only these two variables the mars5 has an r rmse and mae equal to 0 976 0 494 mg l and 0 340 mg l in the validation phase respectively similarly in the test phase the mars5 is the best model with r rmse and mae values of 0 978 0 451 mg l and 0 336 mg l respectively the scatterplot of observed and calculated do values for the bests models lssvm5 mars1 and m5t5 are shown in fig 3 4 conclusions in this study lssvm m5t and mars models were compared for predicting daily do concentration using water quality variables from three stations in usa six different scenarios having different input combinations have been developed and compared including i te ph sc and di ii te ph and sc iii te sc and di iv te and sc v te and ph vi te and di in the light of the results obtained so far we can draw the following general conclusions firstly the three proposed models should be considered as a powerful tool for predicting do concentration using water quality variables as inputs secondly the achieved numerical results showed that the accuracies of the models vary from one station to another knowing that the three models were applied for three different rivers for the usgs 14206950 station mars model were higher than lssvm and m5t and mars1 using te ph sc and di as input was the best among all other developed models in both validation and test phases in the validation phase the mars1 is the best model and outperforms both lssvm1 and m5t1 with an improvement regarding the rmse and mae values of about 8 22 11 05 and 23 50 25 05 respectively for the test phase the two models mars1 and lssvm1 were quite similar and the improvement regarding the rmse and mae value is relatively small with values of about 0 5 and 2 3 respectively however the difference is significant between mars1 and m5t6 and the improvement regarding the rmse and mae value is relatively high with values of about 8 91 and 15 00 respectively similarly for the usgs 01463500 station mars model were higher than lssvm and m5t and mars5 using te and ph as input was the best among all other developed models in both validation and test phases unlike in the previous two study stations for the usgs 10133800 station lssvm model were higher than mars and m5t and lssvm5 using te and ph as input was the best among all other developed models in both validation and test phases thirdly the effect of the di variable on performance of the models varies depending on the models and on the station and now general conclusion can be drawn fourthly and finally according to the results obtained it was found that do can be estimated very well using only te and ph acknowledgments
