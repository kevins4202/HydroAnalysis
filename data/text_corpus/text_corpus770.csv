3850,recession analysis of dq dt q is popularly used for determining catchment storage discharge relationship estimating the aquifer hydraulic properties and predicting low flow processes however there are uncertainties arising from the numerical approximation of dq dt by the finite difference δq δt for individual recession and the fitting cloud like data of dq dt q for many recession events in a catchment in this study we proposed an improved variable time step increment method ivts to minimize the effects of the noisy observations on estimating dq dt and a fitting method in terms of the binning average of dq dt q data points to determine the basin synthetic recession parameters the proposed methods are validated by using numerical generation of recessions with different noises and recession behaviors and the observed hydrographs from twenty catchments in huai river basin in china the results from our proposed method are compared with those from the other popularly used methods the ivts method is proven to be robust for approximation of dq dt which can significantly reduce errors of the estimated dq dt and the recession slope b combining with the ivts method the fitting method in terms of the binning average by splitting range of dq dt instead of q could overcome the shortage of traditional recession analysis methods that underestimate the recession slope our study indicates that the more accurate and reliable calculation of dq dt q data and estimation of basin synthetic recession parameters could increase the objectivity in interpretation of recession behaviors and accuracy in perdition of low flow processes keywords recession analysis numerical derivative dq dt observation noise parameter estimation basin scale 1 introduction the streamflow recession analysis of rate of change in streamflow d q d t vs streamflow q from observational data has been widely applied in hydrology particularly for characterizing low flow processes and catchment storage dynamics delforge et al 2020 gao et al 2017 kirchner 2009 lin et al 2020 smakhtin 2001 tallaksen 1995 tashie et al 2020a tashie et al 2020b nevertheless there are uncertainties in determining the recession function by fitting l o g d q d t l o g q from observational data these uncertainties arise from the numerical approximation of d q d t by the finite difference δ q δ t for individual recessions and the fitting of cloud like data of d q d t q for many recession events in a catchment stoelzle et al 2013 thomas et al 2015 thus improvements in the numerical approximation of d q d t and the fitting method are needed for streamflow recession analysis streamflow recession analysis proposed by brutsaert and nieber 1977 describes the recession process by the power law function 1 d q d t 1 a q b where a and b are recession parameters and q is discharge the relationship is equivalent to the storage s and discharge q relationship s α q β where α a 2 b and β 2 b both the relationships of d q d t q and s q are linear if b 1 and nonlinear if b 1 when b 1 the analytical solution of eq 1 is 2 q t q 0 e x p t a when b 1 the streamflow recession is 3 q t q 0 1 b 1 q 0 b 1 a t 1 1 b where q 0 is the initial discharge the recession parameters can be estimated by the plotting of d q d t q in log log space in terms of observed recession hydrographs the fitted line of the l o g d q d t l o g q determines the recession function in this procedure the time derivative of streamflow d q d t should be discretized for approximations of d q d t from hydrological records the approximation scheme is of prime importance for a reliable description of catchment scale recession behaviors thomas et al 2015 the numerical approximation of d q d t by the finite difference δ q δ t in a recession time interval can be generally expressed as 4 d q d t δ q δ t q i q i m i t i t i m i where q i and q i m i are discharges at time t i and t i m i respectively m i is time step that represents the length of the recession interval the d q d t estimation scheme such as step forward backward or centered approaches depends on the selection of the time increment m i which could dramatically alter the ability to characterize the behavior of hydrograph recessions thomas et al 2015 meanwhile the approximation of the discharge q in the time interval i i m i in the right term of eq 1 is 5 q 1 m i 1 i i m i q i if m i remains constant for the finite difference δ q δ t in the entire recession period the approximation of the time derivative is called as the constant time step cts method if m i 1 d q d t is discretized using neighboring flow data which has been widely applied since brutsaert and nieber 1977 the main drawback of cts is low accuracy at the earliest and late stages of the recession rupp and selker 2006 and vulnerable to data noise chen and krajewski 2016 because the observed recession rate d q d t is one to two orders less than streamflow q numerical discretization and observation errors on the d q d t q plot may result in large error and uncertainty of the estimated recession parameters the error and uncertainty of the finite difference δ q δ t could be reduced by selection of an appropriate time increment δ t according to numerical differentiation for d q d t the larger the time increment δ t the step size is the greater the calculation error is chapra and canale 2005 the finite difference δ q δ t should be sufficiently small to meet a first order taylor expansion fiorotto and caroni 2013 however there is noise and uncertainty in the data used for the calculation of the finite difference δ q δ t owning to the impact of observation error rating curve uncertainty and other disturbances in discharge recession hydrographs usually do not decrease smoothly and often encounter oscillated segments with discharge rising over some time intervals thus a small increment δ t results in a large ratio of signal error and great uncertainty in δ q δ t approximation particularly in the late recession as the rate of change of d q d t becomes smaller extending the increment is a practical option to reduce the effect of observational errors in the computation of δ q δ t westerberg and mcmillan 2015 there are several methods to extend the increment rupp and selker 2006 suggested use of the variable time step vts method or the scaled δ t method for vts the time step m i should guarantee change of discharge in the time increment δ q exceeding the observation error table 1 the observation error in vts should be defined by users to reduce the estimated errors of δ q δ t from observations roques et al 2017 proposed the exponential time step ets method in the ets method the time steps m i exponentially increase as time lapses since the rate of change of d q d t becomes smaller as the recession proceeds in time table 1 the m i in ets is easily determined for each observation in time as the recession parameter a is calibrated by fitting the exponential function with the entire recession roques et al 2017 however the determined m i may not guarantee the observed drop in discharge δ q for all the observed recession hydrographs meanwhile the exponential decay of hydrograph recessions follows the power law function of eq 1 for b 1 but does not meet the recession function for b 1 the recession parameters a and b in eqs 2 and 3 are estimated by fitting d q d t q in terms of the recession data the recession parameters have been proven to be dependent on recession events chen and krajewski 2016 jachens et al 2020 the highly variable parameters from individual events make it difficult to estimate representative recession parameters reflecting the synthetic recession characteristics of basin shaw and riha 2012 another choice is to plot d q d t q for adequate recession events from a basin since the plot of d q d t q represents a cloud like form several methods have been proposed to estimate the basin synthetic recession parameters brutsaert and nieber 1977 suggested a lower envelope line to fit the parameter a with a pre specified recession slope b 1 5 or 1 assuming that the lower envelope represents the most delayed flow component vogel and kroll 1992 adopted a linear model to best fit all recession data in order to capture the average recession behavior of catchments further thomas et al 2015 introduced the quantile regression to fit recession data which provides an estimate of the conditional mean of hydrograph recession parameters in order to reduce the influence by highly uncertain in data points kirchner 2009 suggested a binning average method to fit recession data that are divided into different segments which takes the advantage in averaging out scatter in d q d t especially at low flows and is relatively insensitive to observation noise in streamflow karlsen et al 2019 however these different fitting approaches obtain different recession parameters in a catchment stoelzle et al 2013 it retains limitations to the comparability of recession behavior among basins further recent studies demonstrated that these methods including the binning average method underestimate the recession slope b compared to the fitted values from individual recessions shaw and riha 2012 santos et al 2019 jachens et al 2020 tashie et al 2020a indicating these parameterization methods could not reflect the real trend of data points in individual recessions jachens et al 2020 thus how to estimate the basin synthetic recession parameters properly from the cloud like data of d q d t q remains as a question the main objective of this study is to improve the calculation of the rate of change of streamflow d q d t by combining the advantages of both vts and ets methods and to modify the binning method for estimation of basin synthetic recession parameters the recession functions given by eqs 2 and 3 are first used to determine the preliminary time steps m i then to guarantee that change of streamflow in the time increment δ q exceeds observation error the preliminary m i used for each observation in time is further adjusted to match the observed drop in discharge δ q the synthetic recession parameters are estimated by the modified binning method for fitting the cloud like d q d t q data points the performance of the improved method is tested using numerically generated recessions with noise and observed recession hydrographs in twenty catchments of the huai river basin china 2 methodology 2 1 calculation of the rate of change of streamflow 2 1 1 variable time step method and improvement in the variable time step vts method rupp and selker 2006 suggested that the selected time step m i should guarantee that change of discharge in the time increment δ q should exceed the observation error i e 6 δ q q i q i m i c e δ q i where c e is a parameter greater than 1 and δ q is the observation error of discharge q i in vts c e is a user defined error limitation parameter in a range that guarantees the observed drop in discharge δ q for each observation in time to coordinate the conflict of the time increment being sufficiently small in numerical computation of δ q δ t and large for avoiding the observation errors in computation of δ q δ t the time steps m i can be adopted by meeting the minimum requirement of excluding the errors from the log d q d t l o g q plot i e 7 q i q i m i c e δ q since recession hydrographs follow the eq 2 for b 1 and eq 3 for b 1 inserting the two equations into eq 7 and obtain explicit expressions of time steps m i 8 m i a i n 1 1 c e δ q q i a i n 1 1 c e δ q q 0 e x p i a f o r b 1 9 m i a b 1 q i c e δ q 1 b q 0 1 b i f o r b 1 from eq 8 i e b 1 for the linear recession m i increases with the time step i roques et al 2017 suggests that the time step m i increases exponentially as time lapses to guarantee δ q exceeding any specific observation error nevertheless eqs 8 and 9 express that the time step m i is a function of the recession parameter a and b observation error δ q c e and discharge following the procedures proposed by roques et al 2017 the recession parameters of a and b are firstly determined by fitting eqs 2 and 3 for a recession segment using a nonlinear fitting procedure then given observation error δ q and user defined error limitation parameter c e the time steps m i can be calculated for the discretization of the time derivative d q d t finally m i is reselected for each of the observed recession segments meeting q i q i m i c e δ q 2 1 2 determining the observation error from the river stage discharge relationship the discharge in a catchment is mostly estimated by the relationship between stage h discharge q according to the measured river flow stage particularly in the low flow period the relationship between h and q in low flow period can be expressed as kennedy 1984 10 q b c h 2 where bc m s is a given constant for any specific channel in a catchment and h m is depth of water in the channel according to eq 10 the observation error of discharge δ q m3 s arises from the observation error of water stage δ h m which can be estimated by appendix a 11 δ q i 2 b c 1 2 δ h q i 1 2 in daily scale δ q mm d can be expressed as 12 δ q i 2 δ h b c c r 1 2 q i c r 1 2 where c r 86 4 a r and ar km2 is catchment area in any specific catchment if the observation error δ h is known the c e δ q in eq 6 is derived by 13 c e δ q i 2 c e δ h b c c r 1 2 q i c r 1 2 if δ h and thus δ q are unknown c e δ q can be estimated by 14 c e δ q i c obs q i c r 1 2 where c obs 2 c e δ h b c c r 1 2 is a parameter which can be obtained by calibration 2 1 3 approximation of the finite difference δ q δ t in order to optimize d q d t approximation by the local discretization q i q i m i in the time interval i i m i roques et al 2017 proposed a least square linear regression function to fit the local recession 15 q i α i β where α is the local slope coefficient of the linear regression function and β is the intercept of the fitted line thus the time derivative of eq 4 gives 16 d q d t α where q is the average discharge in the interval α represents the average rate of change of the smoothed streamflow in time interval i i m i the average discharge q in time interval i i m i is estimated by eq 5 2 2 the fitting methods for estimation of recession parameters for any individual recession the recession parameters a and b can be determined by directly fitting a recession hydrograph with eq 3 in the form of q t then the synthetic recession slope b ind is represented by the median value of b for all recession events tallaksen 1995 the recession intercept a is then re calculated using b ind to estimate the values of each recession event shaw and riha 2012 the median value of re calculated recession intercept represented as a ind is viewed as the synthetic recession intercept of basin the recession parameters a and b can also be determined by fitting the data points of l o g d q d t l o g q using least squares linear regression 17 l o g d q d t log 1 a b l o g q since plot of log d q d t l o g q from many individual recessions produces a cloud like data set several aggregated methods are applied to fit the data set for determining synthetic recession parameters of basin one method is the quantile regression that estimates the conditional median or other quantiles of the linear relationship of log d q d t l o g q thomas et al 2015 the quantile regression estimates the parameter b p at percentile of p though minimizing a weighted sum of the positive and negative error terms r p below 18 r p p y i y i log d q i d t b p l o g q i l o g 1 a p 1 p y i y i log d q i d t b p l o g q i l o g 1 a p where the p value is set as 0 5 in this study which means a central line for log d q d t l o g q data points y i and y i represent calculated log d q i d t values from observed recessions and fitted curve respectively another method is to fit the binning average of log d q d t and l o g q the binning average method proposed by kirchner 2009 is calculated by dividing recessions into different segments in terms of the range of l o g q named as bq method in this study the fitting of average values of l o g d q d t l o g q within all bins determines the synthetic recession parameters b h and a h the binning procedure takes the advantage in averaging out scatter in d q d t at low flows and relatively insensitive to observation noise in streamflow karlsen et al 2019 in the plot of log d q d t l o g q l o g d q d t usually spans a much larger range than l o g q the highly variable l o g d q d t could lead to uncertainty in determination of the recession parameters thus the binning procedure can be modified by using the binning average from dividing by l o g d q d t named bdq method in this study instead of l o g q then the fitting of the average values of l o g d q d t l o g q within all bins determines the synthetic recession parameters b v and a v using eq 17 by least squares linear regression in practice the range of l o g q or l o g d q d t is divided into segments that span 1 of the range in l o g q or l o g d q d t these segments would expand within the next 1 of the logarithmic range if the number of points in the segment is less than 10 2 3 criteria for accuracy evaluation of estimated d q d t and recession slope b the root mean square logarithmic error rmsle bekele and nicklow 2007 is used to evaluate the estimated values of d q d t 19 r m s l e 1 n i 1 n l o g d q i d t l o g d q ref i d t 2 1 2 where d q ref i d t is the derivative of eq 1 in the time interval i i m i where the parameters a and b are given preliminarily or fitted from an entire observed recession by using eq 2 or 3 d q t d t is the estimated δ q δ t from the observed recession segments δ q in the time intervals determined by the ivts method and n is the number of data points of d q d t for individual recession the rmsle reflects the degree of scatter of estimated d q d t data points larger rmsle means greater deviations of the estimated d q d t from the derivative of eq 1 for each recession hydrograph the accuracy of the estimated recession parameters such as recession exponent b in eq 1 is evaluated by the absolute value of relative error of b re b 20 re b b b ref b ref where b ref is the referenced value that is preliminarily given or fitted from an entire observed recession by using eq 3 b is the value estimated from a log log linear regression of lo g d q d t vs l o g q in terms of the observed recession data the mean or median value of re b values is used to represent the mean error in estimated b values for all recession segments in a numerical scenario or a specific catchment 3 observed recessions in the huai river basin 3 1 study area the observed hydrographs in twenty headwater catchments are selected in the upper and middle regions of the huai river basin hrb upstream of the bengbu floodgate in the eastern china fig 1 as shown in table 2 the catchments have areas ranging from 18 to 3090 km2 and average slopes from 4 8 to 18 4 hrb is in the transient zone from temperate to subtropical climate the mean annual precipitation and mean annual runoff vary greatly in space the mean annual precipitation changes from 755 to 1560 mm and the mean annual runoff changes from 250 to 1084 mm for the twenty catchments table 2 daily streamflow during 1960 s 1980 s is adopted for these twenty catchments as there is minor inference from human activities during this period 3 2 selection of observed recession hydrographs to capture recession characteristics from streamflow records the extracted recession hydrographs should be long enough and concave up dralle et al 2017 in this study long recession hydrographs are selected after rainfall ceases the first n days in the recession hydrographs determined by n d 0 84 ar 0 2 linsley et al 1975 are excluded for eliminating the influence of direct and surface flow the remaining lengths of recession hydrograph greater than 5 days are selected we eliminate the convex and unreasonable oscillated recession hydrographs that 1 have a slower recession rate for the early half compared to the late half and 2 have an increase of discharge with magnitude larger than δ q i calculated by eq 12 the number of individual recessions meeting these conditions is 37 to 120 for the twenty catchments table 2 the real values of recession parameters a and b and d q d t values for the observed hydrographs in each catchment are unknown the popular way to estimate them is to obtain the recession parameters a and b through fitting eq 3 to the entire recession for each of the selected hydrographs chen and krajewski 2016 dralle et al 2017 these recession parameter values and the time derivative from eqs 3 and 1 are referenced as accurate estimations finally as the recession parameters of a and b change among different recession hydrographs recession timescale τ defined as the τ a q b 1 kirchner 2009 is estimated to measure the recession rates of individual recessions the mean values of estimated recession timescales among these catchments range from 3 32 10 66 days table 2 4 results 4 1 validation of ivts method with generated noisy recession hydrographs to test the accuracy of d q d t and b estimation by the improved ivts daily numerical recession processes are firstly generated based on eq 3 where a certain recession parameter b is set as 2 the initial recession discharge q 0 in eq 3 is set as 2 mm d and recession length is 50 days the recession parameter a is set to 10 and 30 mm where large a corresponds to slow recession scenario and vice versa meanwhile the observed errors in discharge are added to the smoothing hydrograph the user defined error limitation parameter ce is set to 2 and 5 based on the generated recessions fig 2 shows the comparison between the approximated values of d q d t by ivts method and the derived values from eq 3 the estimations of d q d t by ivts are mostly concentrated around the 1 1 line it indicates the that ivts method estimates d q d t in high accuracy increase of ce significantly improves accuracy of the calculated d q d t q for the recession hydrographs with different recession rates specifically five scenarios of 5 10 20 30 and 40 mm and observation errors specifically three scenarios of 0 005 0 01 and 0 015 m the root mean square logarithmic error of d q d t rmsle is smaller than 0 2 rmsle generally decreases with increases of ce fig 3 a marked decreases of rmsle with ce can be found for small ce for example ce less than 3 rmsle from ivts method is nearly independent of the recession parameter a fig 3a it indicates that the ivts method is robust for any recession hydrographs with different recession rate it is expected that rmsle is large for large observation errors the rmsle of ivts is less affected by the observation errors fig 3b thus the ivts method can effectively overcome effects of observation errors on estimations of dq dt the parameter b is estimated from the log log linear regression of l o g d q d t vs l o g q fig 3c d shows the mean of absolute relative error re b between the estimated and given b 2 for the hydrographs with different recession rates and errors errors of the estimated b re b are small for fast recessions for example a 10 mm in fig 3c but the errors become large for slow recession rates for example a 20 mm in fig 3c the large ce does not obviously reduce the error of b when ce is greater than 2 the errors of the estimated b re b increase with the observation errors δh when ce greater than 2 fig 3d the effects of ce on reducing observation errors on the estimated b are reduced as the observation errors increase thus the accuracy of estimated d q d t is mainly determined by the use defined parameter ce while accuracy of estimated b mostly depends on the recession rate and observation error 4 2 estimation of synthetic recession parameters from generated cloud like data points observed hydrographs contain batches of individual recessions with different recession characteristics a scenario is set as an example where 100 individual recessions lasting 50 days are generated with random initial flows q 0 of 0 5 3 0 mm d recession parameters b of 1 5 3 0 a of 5 30 m m b 1 d b 2 and other parameters of δh 0 01 m and ce 2 to calculate d q d t fig 4 a the mean of recession hydrographs q t is used as the reference recession the calculated data points of d q d t q by ivts method are shown in fig 4b where the estimated error of d q d t is low with a rmsle of 0 101 and re b of 0 098 the 100 generated recessions show cloud like data points in the l o g d q d t l o g q plot fig 4b the fitting curves by different methods are not overlapped the fitted synthetic recession parameters a and b are compared with those from directly fitting the reference recession hydrograph q t i e the mean of individual hydrographs the recession slope b v from the bdq method is 2 16 close to the value from the reference recession of 2 33 while b h 1 61 and b p 1 69 from the bq and the quantile regression methods respectively are much smaller than that of the reference recession similarly recession intercept a v is 14 03 m m b 1 d b 2 close to that from the reference recession 14 24 m m b 1 d b 2 while a h 18 01 m m b 1 d b 2 and a p 19 68 m m b 1 d b 2 from the bq and the quantile regression methods respectively are much smaller than the value from the reference recession using the fitted parameter values from the three methods and the mean of initial flow from 100 generations eq 3 generates three recession curves which are not overlapped comparatively the recession curve from the bdq best fits with the reference recession with rmsle of 0 016 by contrast the recession curves from the bq and quantile regression methods markedly deviate from the reference recession with rmsle of 0 049 and 0 051 respectively it indicates that the bdq method performs best on estimation of synthetic recession parameters from the cloud like data points of d q d t q 4 3 application of the ivts method in the huai river basin 4 3 1 the referenced values of the recession parameters for each of the selected recession events for the catchments in hrb recession parameters a and b are obtained from fitting eq 3 with the individual recessions q t these fitted parameters a and b are used as the reference values for comparison which change greatly among the individual recessions and catchments b is seldomly equal to 1 table 2 and 3 it indicates the nonlinear recession type should be used to define the time step m i based on eq 9 for ivst 4 3 2 the estimated d q d t and recession parameters from observed hydrographs for the ivst method the observation error of discharge δ q i used to determine recession time steps m i eq 12 should be estimated for the twenty catchments in hrb the relationship of observed q h is fitted as shown in fig 5 for four typical hydrological stations with different observed q h relationship where hwh corresponds to gentle slope for q h nld corresponds to steep slope and hnz and tjh represent the intermediate state fig 5 the observed q h is used to estimate the parameter b c which varies in a large range from 4 1 to 143 5 m s table 2 due to differences of river channel cross sections and gradients in terms of the observation accuracy of the water gauge in these hydrological stations the observation error of river stage δ h is set at 0 01 m and the observation error of discharge δ q i can be determined by eq 12 given b c the remaining parameter c e in eqs 8 and 9 is then calibrated larger c e for example greater than 2 gives larger time steps m i which reduces rmsle for d q d t estimations but has relatively less effect on re b as shown in fig 6 the median value of rmsle for all the selected recessions in a catchment decreases with the increase of c e the median value of re b for the recessions fluctuates even though it tends to decrease with c e the results demonstrate that larger time steps m i increase the accuracy of d q d t estimation but less data used to fit the recession parameters a and b could result in uncertainty especially for short recessions in order to obtain a comparable number of data points in all catchments we selected c e 2 in eq 9 to derive m i for the ivts the calculated c obs value eq 14 from c e in each catchment is listed in table 2 fig 7 shows the estimated values of d q d t by ivts correlated to the reference values from the fitted recessions q t for all selected recessions in each of the four typical catchments hwh hnz nld and tjh with different recession timescales τ table 2 where hwh represents catchment with slow recession rate tjh represents catchment with fast recession rate and hnz and nld represent the intermediate state the ivts estimation of d q d t is close to the reference values as these data points are concentrated around the 1 1 line fig 7 for the twenty catchments the median values of rmsle of the estimated d q d t range from 0 050 to 0 137 table 2 smallest in ph and largest in yz the ranges of rmsle from individual recessions in each catchment are relatively small most values are smaller than 0 3 except for some outliers fig 8 the parameter b is fitted from d q d t q for all the selected recessions in each of the catchments and is compared to the reference value the median values of re b of individual recessions for the twenty catchments range from 0 045 to 0 156 smallest in ph and largest in zc however errors of the estimated b values by the ivts method are relatively larger for some individual recessions as evidenced by a large range of the 25th 75th percentiles for the box plot of re b values in each catchment fig 8 and large re b values for the outliers these large re b values are mostly produced by short recession hydrographs for example 3 5 data points according to the derived m i with high noise 4 4 estimation of synthetic recession parameters from cloud like data points of catchments the cloud like data points of d q d t q for all selected recessions in catchments can be seen in fig 9 it shows that the binning average of d q d t q in terms of the splitting log d q d t or l o g q are not overlapped the quantile regression of the observed data points could not best fit the binning average points of d q d t q as well thus the fitted lines from the three methods can differ greatly and thus obtain different parameter values for the twenty catchments the recession parameter bv estimated from our proposed binning average of l o g d q d t the bdq method ranges from 1 44 to 2 83 with the mean value of 1 96 table 3 this mean value is close to the mean of the reference values 1 95 for bind from individual recession events fitted by eq 3 fig 10 a the mean of absolute relative error between bv and bind reb for all catchments is only 0 072 by contrast bh estimated from the binning average of l o g q the bq method and bp estimated from quantile regression are significantly underestimated compared with the reference value bind in each of the catchments the mean value of bh is 1 53 ranging from 1 27 to 1 94 and the mean of bp is 1 52 ranging from 1 25 to 1 94 the mean values of absolute relative error reb between bind and bp is 0 206 and 0 212 between bind and bp much greater than reb between bv and bind the estimated recession av from our proposed binning average of d q d t has a mean value of 5 27 m m b 1 d b 2 ranging from 2 35 to 21 74 m m b 1 d b 2 in the twenty catchments this mean value of av is close to the mean of aind 5 26 m m b 1 d b 2 from fitting individual recession events the mean of absolute relative error between av and aind is 0 095 m m b 1 d b 2 for the twenty catchments much smaller than the means of absolute relative error between ah and aind 0 242 and between ap and aind 0 445 fig 10b this indicates that our proposed recession parameter estimation method i e the binning average method with the splitting the range of l o g d q d t can improve the estimation of basin synthetic recession parameters a and b 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of the d q d t approximation with other methods approximations of the rate of change of streamflow d q d t are vital for recession analysis and characterization of hydrological behaviors however the observational uncertainties and errors in hydrographs reduce the reliability of the applications substantially westerberg and mcmillan 2015 even for a specific recession event different approximation approaches can result in a large range of estimated parameters and hence uncertainty stoelzle et al 2013 thomas et al 2015 to reduce approximation uncertainty we derived a new time variable step determination method used for approximations of d q d t and the recession parameter b the derived method ivts inherits the advantages of determination of the time increment directly expressed from exponential decay of the recession function the ets method by roques et al 2017 and for observed recessions that guarantee the drop in discharge δ q the vts method by rupp and selker 2006 the proposed ivts method is compared with vts and ets methods based on observed hydrographs from twenty catchments in huai river basin in china the parameter ndt in the ets method table 1 is set as the maximum length of selected recession segments and the parameters in the vts method are set the same value as the ivts method given c e 2 δ h 0 01 m and b c for each catchment listed in table 2 compared to the ivts method the vts method gives larger errors in d q d t larger values of rmsle in all the catchments and the ets method gives larger errors of d q d t in 16 of the 20 catchments in terms of the median value of individual recessions table 4 the mean of rmsle values for the time derivative d q d t in these twenty catchments from ivts is 31 0 smaller than that from vts and 18 4 smaller than that from ets as to the estimated errors in recession slope b of individual recessions the vts method generates larger errors large re b while the ets method generates smaller errors smaller re b compared to ivts methods in terms of the median value of individual recessions of each catchment table 4 but the standard deviation of re b values of individual recessions for these catchments is 0 28 for ets in terms of the mean value much larger than 0 17 from ivts furthermore the estimation accuracy by ivts method can be improved by selecting a large c e for example c e 3 in table 4 and fig 6 thus the ivts method could provide more accurate and robust estimation of d q d t and recession parameter of individual recessions compared to ets and vts methods the accurate estimated d q d t q data points from ivts method are more helpful in demonstrate the variation of d q d t with q for individual recessions and reflect the overall distribution of all the recessions 5 2 comparison of estimation methods for basin synthetic recession parameters several studies demonstrated that the median value of recession slopes fitted from individual recession events is greater than that from the point cloud fitting biswal and nagesh kumar 2014 shaw and riha 2012 tashie et al 2020a it may be attribute to that the nonlinearity of observed recession events tends to increase with time generating a convex recession curve tashie et al 2020a in high flow part the differences among individual recessions are limited in log log space in d q d t q form while the differences enlarge in the low flow part in the low flow part data points of d q d t q for individual recession events tend to decline rapidly larger change d q d t in relation to q fig 9a c however the binning average points of d q d t by the splitting q the bq method tend to decline slowly both the bq and quantile regression methods overestimates d q d t values in the low flow part as shown in fig 4b and fig 9 and proven by jachens et al 2020 which results in underestimation of the recession slope especially for catchments with large recession slopes fig 10a our proposed method that binning recession data points by the splitting of l o g d q d t bdq method improves the binning method by splitting of l o g q bq method and the quantile regression method the binning average points of the bdq method well capture the average data points of d q d t q for individual recession events in the low flow period thus the bdq method improves the accuracy of estimation of basin synthetic recession parameters fig 10 5 3 limitations in this study the approximation of d q d t accounts for the flow recession fluctuations due to observation errors however other interference factors like evaporation and groundwater pumping also result in fluctuation in river stage and thus discharge particularly for low stages and during a rainless period these can result in the recession processes being much more complex than the expression in eq 3 which may reduce the accuracy and stability in the estimation of recession rate d q d t thomas et al 2015 wang and cai 2009 wang and cai 2010 estimation of the observation errors in terms of the discharge q and stage h relationship is vital for application of the ivts method the rating curve for discharge q and stage h is relatively steady for mountain rivers however the rating curve can be altered by floods for many rivers mansanarez et al 2019 this means that the parameter bc is a variable instead of a constant when applying the ivts method the recession slope b is assumed to be a constant value in a catchment in this study but several catchments show that the recession slopes tend to increase from high to low flow parts for example hnz and nld in fig 9b c the phenomenon is also found by other several studies ghosh et al 2016 gao et al 2017 tashie et al 2020a thus further study should put more attention on the variation of recession slope with magnitude of flow 6 conclusions in the study a new d q d t calculation method ivts is proposed to minimize the effects of the noisy observations on streamflow recession analysis the proposed ivts method ensures the increment of discharge δ q to calculate d q d t exceeding the observation error of discharge and the adaptation of changes of recession rate the accuracy of ivts method is validated by numerically generated and observed hydrographs results show that the relative errors of both calculated d q d t and the estimated recession slope b by the ivts method are low the relative errors of calculated d q d t are generally reduced with the enlargement of the discharge increment c e δ q but are less influenced by recession rate and observation errors however slow recessions with large observation error can reduce the accuracy of estimated recession parameter b in addition to the d q d t calculation the synthetic recession parameter estimations depend on the fitting methods of d q d t q data points from many individual recessions in this study we proposed the binning average of d q d t q by splitting the range of d q d t instead of q our proposed method the bdq method is proven to overcome the underestimation of recession slope by the traditional methods this study indicates that the ivts method combining with the bdq method improve calculation of d q d t q for the recession data with noise and estimation of synthetic recession parameters at basin scale these could increase the objectivity in interpretation of recession behaviors and accuracy in perdition of low flow processes further research may also be needed to test its extensive applicability to catchments with diverse climate landscape environments and its implementation for better understanding of catchment storage discharge

3850,recession analysis of dq dt q is popularly used for determining catchment storage discharge relationship estimating the aquifer hydraulic properties and predicting low flow processes however there are uncertainties arising from the numerical approximation of dq dt by the finite difference δq δt for individual recession and the fitting cloud like data of dq dt q for many recession events in a catchment in this study we proposed an improved variable time step increment method ivts to minimize the effects of the noisy observations on estimating dq dt and a fitting method in terms of the binning average of dq dt q data points to determine the basin synthetic recession parameters the proposed methods are validated by using numerical generation of recessions with different noises and recession behaviors and the observed hydrographs from twenty catchments in huai river basin in china the results from our proposed method are compared with those from the other popularly used methods the ivts method is proven to be robust for approximation of dq dt which can significantly reduce errors of the estimated dq dt and the recession slope b combining with the ivts method the fitting method in terms of the binning average by splitting range of dq dt instead of q could overcome the shortage of traditional recession analysis methods that underestimate the recession slope our study indicates that the more accurate and reliable calculation of dq dt q data and estimation of basin synthetic recession parameters could increase the objectivity in interpretation of recession behaviors and accuracy in perdition of low flow processes keywords recession analysis numerical derivative dq dt observation noise parameter estimation basin scale 1 introduction the streamflow recession analysis of rate of change in streamflow d q d t vs streamflow q from observational data has been widely applied in hydrology particularly for characterizing low flow processes and catchment storage dynamics delforge et al 2020 gao et al 2017 kirchner 2009 lin et al 2020 smakhtin 2001 tallaksen 1995 tashie et al 2020a tashie et al 2020b nevertheless there are uncertainties in determining the recession function by fitting l o g d q d t l o g q from observational data these uncertainties arise from the numerical approximation of d q d t by the finite difference δ q δ t for individual recessions and the fitting of cloud like data of d q d t q for many recession events in a catchment stoelzle et al 2013 thomas et al 2015 thus improvements in the numerical approximation of d q d t and the fitting method are needed for streamflow recession analysis streamflow recession analysis proposed by brutsaert and nieber 1977 describes the recession process by the power law function 1 d q d t 1 a q b where a and b are recession parameters and q is discharge the relationship is equivalent to the storage s and discharge q relationship s α q β where α a 2 b and β 2 b both the relationships of d q d t q and s q are linear if b 1 and nonlinear if b 1 when b 1 the analytical solution of eq 1 is 2 q t q 0 e x p t a when b 1 the streamflow recession is 3 q t q 0 1 b 1 q 0 b 1 a t 1 1 b where q 0 is the initial discharge the recession parameters can be estimated by the plotting of d q d t q in log log space in terms of observed recession hydrographs the fitted line of the l o g d q d t l o g q determines the recession function in this procedure the time derivative of streamflow d q d t should be discretized for approximations of d q d t from hydrological records the approximation scheme is of prime importance for a reliable description of catchment scale recession behaviors thomas et al 2015 the numerical approximation of d q d t by the finite difference δ q δ t in a recession time interval can be generally expressed as 4 d q d t δ q δ t q i q i m i t i t i m i where q i and q i m i are discharges at time t i and t i m i respectively m i is time step that represents the length of the recession interval the d q d t estimation scheme such as step forward backward or centered approaches depends on the selection of the time increment m i which could dramatically alter the ability to characterize the behavior of hydrograph recessions thomas et al 2015 meanwhile the approximation of the discharge q in the time interval i i m i in the right term of eq 1 is 5 q 1 m i 1 i i m i q i if m i remains constant for the finite difference δ q δ t in the entire recession period the approximation of the time derivative is called as the constant time step cts method if m i 1 d q d t is discretized using neighboring flow data which has been widely applied since brutsaert and nieber 1977 the main drawback of cts is low accuracy at the earliest and late stages of the recession rupp and selker 2006 and vulnerable to data noise chen and krajewski 2016 because the observed recession rate d q d t is one to two orders less than streamflow q numerical discretization and observation errors on the d q d t q plot may result in large error and uncertainty of the estimated recession parameters the error and uncertainty of the finite difference δ q δ t could be reduced by selection of an appropriate time increment δ t according to numerical differentiation for d q d t the larger the time increment δ t the step size is the greater the calculation error is chapra and canale 2005 the finite difference δ q δ t should be sufficiently small to meet a first order taylor expansion fiorotto and caroni 2013 however there is noise and uncertainty in the data used for the calculation of the finite difference δ q δ t owning to the impact of observation error rating curve uncertainty and other disturbances in discharge recession hydrographs usually do not decrease smoothly and often encounter oscillated segments with discharge rising over some time intervals thus a small increment δ t results in a large ratio of signal error and great uncertainty in δ q δ t approximation particularly in the late recession as the rate of change of d q d t becomes smaller extending the increment is a practical option to reduce the effect of observational errors in the computation of δ q δ t westerberg and mcmillan 2015 there are several methods to extend the increment rupp and selker 2006 suggested use of the variable time step vts method or the scaled δ t method for vts the time step m i should guarantee change of discharge in the time increment δ q exceeding the observation error table 1 the observation error in vts should be defined by users to reduce the estimated errors of δ q δ t from observations roques et al 2017 proposed the exponential time step ets method in the ets method the time steps m i exponentially increase as time lapses since the rate of change of d q d t becomes smaller as the recession proceeds in time table 1 the m i in ets is easily determined for each observation in time as the recession parameter a is calibrated by fitting the exponential function with the entire recession roques et al 2017 however the determined m i may not guarantee the observed drop in discharge δ q for all the observed recession hydrographs meanwhile the exponential decay of hydrograph recessions follows the power law function of eq 1 for b 1 but does not meet the recession function for b 1 the recession parameters a and b in eqs 2 and 3 are estimated by fitting d q d t q in terms of the recession data the recession parameters have been proven to be dependent on recession events chen and krajewski 2016 jachens et al 2020 the highly variable parameters from individual events make it difficult to estimate representative recession parameters reflecting the synthetic recession characteristics of basin shaw and riha 2012 another choice is to plot d q d t q for adequate recession events from a basin since the plot of d q d t q represents a cloud like form several methods have been proposed to estimate the basin synthetic recession parameters brutsaert and nieber 1977 suggested a lower envelope line to fit the parameter a with a pre specified recession slope b 1 5 or 1 assuming that the lower envelope represents the most delayed flow component vogel and kroll 1992 adopted a linear model to best fit all recession data in order to capture the average recession behavior of catchments further thomas et al 2015 introduced the quantile regression to fit recession data which provides an estimate of the conditional mean of hydrograph recession parameters in order to reduce the influence by highly uncertain in data points kirchner 2009 suggested a binning average method to fit recession data that are divided into different segments which takes the advantage in averaging out scatter in d q d t especially at low flows and is relatively insensitive to observation noise in streamflow karlsen et al 2019 however these different fitting approaches obtain different recession parameters in a catchment stoelzle et al 2013 it retains limitations to the comparability of recession behavior among basins further recent studies demonstrated that these methods including the binning average method underestimate the recession slope b compared to the fitted values from individual recessions shaw and riha 2012 santos et al 2019 jachens et al 2020 tashie et al 2020a indicating these parameterization methods could not reflect the real trend of data points in individual recessions jachens et al 2020 thus how to estimate the basin synthetic recession parameters properly from the cloud like data of d q d t q remains as a question the main objective of this study is to improve the calculation of the rate of change of streamflow d q d t by combining the advantages of both vts and ets methods and to modify the binning method for estimation of basin synthetic recession parameters the recession functions given by eqs 2 and 3 are first used to determine the preliminary time steps m i then to guarantee that change of streamflow in the time increment δ q exceeds observation error the preliminary m i used for each observation in time is further adjusted to match the observed drop in discharge δ q the synthetic recession parameters are estimated by the modified binning method for fitting the cloud like d q d t q data points the performance of the improved method is tested using numerically generated recessions with noise and observed recession hydrographs in twenty catchments of the huai river basin china 2 methodology 2 1 calculation of the rate of change of streamflow 2 1 1 variable time step method and improvement in the variable time step vts method rupp and selker 2006 suggested that the selected time step m i should guarantee that change of discharge in the time increment δ q should exceed the observation error i e 6 δ q q i q i m i c e δ q i where c e is a parameter greater than 1 and δ q is the observation error of discharge q i in vts c e is a user defined error limitation parameter in a range that guarantees the observed drop in discharge δ q for each observation in time to coordinate the conflict of the time increment being sufficiently small in numerical computation of δ q δ t and large for avoiding the observation errors in computation of δ q δ t the time steps m i can be adopted by meeting the minimum requirement of excluding the errors from the log d q d t l o g q plot i e 7 q i q i m i c e δ q since recession hydrographs follow the eq 2 for b 1 and eq 3 for b 1 inserting the two equations into eq 7 and obtain explicit expressions of time steps m i 8 m i a i n 1 1 c e δ q q i a i n 1 1 c e δ q q 0 e x p i a f o r b 1 9 m i a b 1 q i c e δ q 1 b q 0 1 b i f o r b 1 from eq 8 i e b 1 for the linear recession m i increases with the time step i roques et al 2017 suggests that the time step m i increases exponentially as time lapses to guarantee δ q exceeding any specific observation error nevertheless eqs 8 and 9 express that the time step m i is a function of the recession parameter a and b observation error δ q c e and discharge following the procedures proposed by roques et al 2017 the recession parameters of a and b are firstly determined by fitting eqs 2 and 3 for a recession segment using a nonlinear fitting procedure then given observation error δ q and user defined error limitation parameter c e the time steps m i can be calculated for the discretization of the time derivative d q d t finally m i is reselected for each of the observed recession segments meeting q i q i m i c e δ q 2 1 2 determining the observation error from the river stage discharge relationship the discharge in a catchment is mostly estimated by the relationship between stage h discharge q according to the measured river flow stage particularly in the low flow period the relationship between h and q in low flow period can be expressed as kennedy 1984 10 q b c h 2 where bc m s is a given constant for any specific channel in a catchment and h m is depth of water in the channel according to eq 10 the observation error of discharge δ q m3 s arises from the observation error of water stage δ h m which can be estimated by appendix a 11 δ q i 2 b c 1 2 δ h q i 1 2 in daily scale δ q mm d can be expressed as 12 δ q i 2 δ h b c c r 1 2 q i c r 1 2 where c r 86 4 a r and ar km2 is catchment area in any specific catchment if the observation error δ h is known the c e δ q in eq 6 is derived by 13 c e δ q i 2 c e δ h b c c r 1 2 q i c r 1 2 if δ h and thus δ q are unknown c e δ q can be estimated by 14 c e δ q i c obs q i c r 1 2 where c obs 2 c e δ h b c c r 1 2 is a parameter which can be obtained by calibration 2 1 3 approximation of the finite difference δ q δ t in order to optimize d q d t approximation by the local discretization q i q i m i in the time interval i i m i roques et al 2017 proposed a least square linear regression function to fit the local recession 15 q i α i β where α is the local slope coefficient of the linear regression function and β is the intercept of the fitted line thus the time derivative of eq 4 gives 16 d q d t α where q is the average discharge in the interval α represents the average rate of change of the smoothed streamflow in time interval i i m i the average discharge q in time interval i i m i is estimated by eq 5 2 2 the fitting methods for estimation of recession parameters for any individual recession the recession parameters a and b can be determined by directly fitting a recession hydrograph with eq 3 in the form of q t then the synthetic recession slope b ind is represented by the median value of b for all recession events tallaksen 1995 the recession intercept a is then re calculated using b ind to estimate the values of each recession event shaw and riha 2012 the median value of re calculated recession intercept represented as a ind is viewed as the synthetic recession intercept of basin the recession parameters a and b can also be determined by fitting the data points of l o g d q d t l o g q using least squares linear regression 17 l o g d q d t log 1 a b l o g q since plot of log d q d t l o g q from many individual recessions produces a cloud like data set several aggregated methods are applied to fit the data set for determining synthetic recession parameters of basin one method is the quantile regression that estimates the conditional median or other quantiles of the linear relationship of log d q d t l o g q thomas et al 2015 the quantile regression estimates the parameter b p at percentile of p though minimizing a weighted sum of the positive and negative error terms r p below 18 r p p y i y i log d q i d t b p l o g q i l o g 1 a p 1 p y i y i log d q i d t b p l o g q i l o g 1 a p where the p value is set as 0 5 in this study which means a central line for log d q d t l o g q data points y i and y i represent calculated log d q i d t values from observed recessions and fitted curve respectively another method is to fit the binning average of log d q d t and l o g q the binning average method proposed by kirchner 2009 is calculated by dividing recessions into different segments in terms of the range of l o g q named as bq method in this study the fitting of average values of l o g d q d t l o g q within all bins determines the synthetic recession parameters b h and a h the binning procedure takes the advantage in averaging out scatter in d q d t at low flows and relatively insensitive to observation noise in streamflow karlsen et al 2019 in the plot of log d q d t l o g q l o g d q d t usually spans a much larger range than l o g q the highly variable l o g d q d t could lead to uncertainty in determination of the recession parameters thus the binning procedure can be modified by using the binning average from dividing by l o g d q d t named bdq method in this study instead of l o g q then the fitting of the average values of l o g d q d t l o g q within all bins determines the synthetic recession parameters b v and a v using eq 17 by least squares linear regression in practice the range of l o g q or l o g d q d t is divided into segments that span 1 of the range in l o g q or l o g d q d t these segments would expand within the next 1 of the logarithmic range if the number of points in the segment is less than 10 2 3 criteria for accuracy evaluation of estimated d q d t and recession slope b the root mean square logarithmic error rmsle bekele and nicklow 2007 is used to evaluate the estimated values of d q d t 19 r m s l e 1 n i 1 n l o g d q i d t l o g d q ref i d t 2 1 2 where d q ref i d t is the derivative of eq 1 in the time interval i i m i where the parameters a and b are given preliminarily or fitted from an entire observed recession by using eq 2 or 3 d q t d t is the estimated δ q δ t from the observed recession segments δ q in the time intervals determined by the ivts method and n is the number of data points of d q d t for individual recession the rmsle reflects the degree of scatter of estimated d q d t data points larger rmsle means greater deviations of the estimated d q d t from the derivative of eq 1 for each recession hydrograph the accuracy of the estimated recession parameters such as recession exponent b in eq 1 is evaluated by the absolute value of relative error of b re b 20 re b b b ref b ref where b ref is the referenced value that is preliminarily given or fitted from an entire observed recession by using eq 3 b is the value estimated from a log log linear regression of lo g d q d t vs l o g q in terms of the observed recession data the mean or median value of re b values is used to represent the mean error in estimated b values for all recession segments in a numerical scenario or a specific catchment 3 observed recessions in the huai river basin 3 1 study area the observed hydrographs in twenty headwater catchments are selected in the upper and middle regions of the huai river basin hrb upstream of the bengbu floodgate in the eastern china fig 1 as shown in table 2 the catchments have areas ranging from 18 to 3090 km2 and average slopes from 4 8 to 18 4 hrb is in the transient zone from temperate to subtropical climate the mean annual precipitation and mean annual runoff vary greatly in space the mean annual precipitation changes from 755 to 1560 mm and the mean annual runoff changes from 250 to 1084 mm for the twenty catchments table 2 daily streamflow during 1960 s 1980 s is adopted for these twenty catchments as there is minor inference from human activities during this period 3 2 selection of observed recession hydrographs to capture recession characteristics from streamflow records the extracted recession hydrographs should be long enough and concave up dralle et al 2017 in this study long recession hydrographs are selected after rainfall ceases the first n days in the recession hydrographs determined by n d 0 84 ar 0 2 linsley et al 1975 are excluded for eliminating the influence of direct and surface flow the remaining lengths of recession hydrograph greater than 5 days are selected we eliminate the convex and unreasonable oscillated recession hydrographs that 1 have a slower recession rate for the early half compared to the late half and 2 have an increase of discharge with magnitude larger than δ q i calculated by eq 12 the number of individual recessions meeting these conditions is 37 to 120 for the twenty catchments table 2 the real values of recession parameters a and b and d q d t values for the observed hydrographs in each catchment are unknown the popular way to estimate them is to obtain the recession parameters a and b through fitting eq 3 to the entire recession for each of the selected hydrographs chen and krajewski 2016 dralle et al 2017 these recession parameter values and the time derivative from eqs 3 and 1 are referenced as accurate estimations finally as the recession parameters of a and b change among different recession hydrographs recession timescale τ defined as the τ a q b 1 kirchner 2009 is estimated to measure the recession rates of individual recessions the mean values of estimated recession timescales among these catchments range from 3 32 10 66 days table 2 4 results 4 1 validation of ivts method with generated noisy recession hydrographs to test the accuracy of d q d t and b estimation by the improved ivts daily numerical recession processes are firstly generated based on eq 3 where a certain recession parameter b is set as 2 the initial recession discharge q 0 in eq 3 is set as 2 mm d and recession length is 50 days the recession parameter a is set to 10 and 30 mm where large a corresponds to slow recession scenario and vice versa meanwhile the observed errors in discharge are added to the smoothing hydrograph the user defined error limitation parameter ce is set to 2 and 5 based on the generated recessions fig 2 shows the comparison between the approximated values of d q d t by ivts method and the derived values from eq 3 the estimations of d q d t by ivts are mostly concentrated around the 1 1 line it indicates the that ivts method estimates d q d t in high accuracy increase of ce significantly improves accuracy of the calculated d q d t q for the recession hydrographs with different recession rates specifically five scenarios of 5 10 20 30 and 40 mm and observation errors specifically three scenarios of 0 005 0 01 and 0 015 m the root mean square logarithmic error of d q d t rmsle is smaller than 0 2 rmsle generally decreases with increases of ce fig 3 a marked decreases of rmsle with ce can be found for small ce for example ce less than 3 rmsle from ivts method is nearly independent of the recession parameter a fig 3a it indicates that the ivts method is robust for any recession hydrographs with different recession rate it is expected that rmsle is large for large observation errors the rmsle of ivts is less affected by the observation errors fig 3b thus the ivts method can effectively overcome effects of observation errors on estimations of dq dt the parameter b is estimated from the log log linear regression of l o g d q d t vs l o g q fig 3c d shows the mean of absolute relative error re b between the estimated and given b 2 for the hydrographs with different recession rates and errors errors of the estimated b re b are small for fast recessions for example a 10 mm in fig 3c but the errors become large for slow recession rates for example a 20 mm in fig 3c the large ce does not obviously reduce the error of b when ce is greater than 2 the errors of the estimated b re b increase with the observation errors δh when ce greater than 2 fig 3d the effects of ce on reducing observation errors on the estimated b are reduced as the observation errors increase thus the accuracy of estimated d q d t is mainly determined by the use defined parameter ce while accuracy of estimated b mostly depends on the recession rate and observation error 4 2 estimation of synthetic recession parameters from generated cloud like data points observed hydrographs contain batches of individual recessions with different recession characteristics a scenario is set as an example where 100 individual recessions lasting 50 days are generated with random initial flows q 0 of 0 5 3 0 mm d recession parameters b of 1 5 3 0 a of 5 30 m m b 1 d b 2 and other parameters of δh 0 01 m and ce 2 to calculate d q d t fig 4 a the mean of recession hydrographs q t is used as the reference recession the calculated data points of d q d t q by ivts method are shown in fig 4b where the estimated error of d q d t is low with a rmsle of 0 101 and re b of 0 098 the 100 generated recessions show cloud like data points in the l o g d q d t l o g q plot fig 4b the fitting curves by different methods are not overlapped the fitted synthetic recession parameters a and b are compared with those from directly fitting the reference recession hydrograph q t i e the mean of individual hydrographs the recession slope b v from the bdq method is 2 16 close to the value from the reference recession of 2 33 while b h 1 61 and b p 1 69 from the bq and the quantile regression methods respectively are much smaller than that of the reference recession similarly recession intercept a v is 14 03 m m b 1 d b 2 close to that from the reference recession 14 24 m m b 1 d b 2 while a h 18 01 m m b 1 d b 2 and a p 19 68 m m b 1 d b 2 from the bq and the quantile regression methods respectively are much smaller than the value from the reference recession using the fitted parameter values from the three methods and the mean of initial flow from 100 generations eq 3 generates three recession curves which are not overlapped comparatively the recession curve from the bdq best fits with the reference recession with rmsle of 0 016 by contrast the recession curves from the bq and quantile regression methods markedly deviate from the reference recession with rmsle of 0 049 and 0 051 respectively it indicates that the bdq method performs best on estimation of synthetic recession parameters from the cloud like data points of d q d t q 4 3 application of the ivts method in the huai river basin 4 3 1 the referenced values of the recession parameters for each of the selected recession events for the catchments in hrb recession parameters a and b are obtained from fitting eq 3 with the individual recessions q t these fitted parameters a and b are used as the reference values for comparison which change greatly among the individual recessions and catchments b is seldomly equal to 1 table 2 and 3 it indicates the nonlinear recession type should be used to define the time step m i based on eq 9 for ivst 4 3 2 the estimated d q d t and recession parameters from observed hydrographs for the ivst method the observation error of discharge δ q i used to determine recession time steps m i eq 12 should be estimated for the twenty catchments in hrb the relationship of observed q h is fitted as shown in fig 5 for four typical hydrological stations with different observed q h relationship where hwh corresponds to gentle slope for q h nld corresponds to steep slope and hnz and tjh represent the intermediate state fig 5 the observed q h is used to estimate the parameter b c which varies in a large range from 4 1 to 143 5 m s table 2 due to differences of river channel cross sections and gradients in terms of the observation accuracy of the water gauge in these hydrological stations the observation error of river stage δ h is set at 0 01 m and the observation error of discharge δ q i can be determined by eq 12 given b c the remaining parameter c e in eqs 8 and 9 is then calibrated larger c e for example greater than 2 gives larger time steps m i which reduces rmsle for d q d t estimations but has relatively less effect on re b as shown in fig 6 the median value of rmsle for all the selected recessions in a catchment decreases with the increase of c e the median value of re b for the recessions fluctuates even though it tends to decrease with c e the results demonstrate that larger time steps m i increase the accuracy of d q d t estimation but less data used to fit the recession parameters a and b could result in uncertainty especially for short recessions in order to obtain a comparable number of data points in all catchments we selected c e 2 in eq 9 to derive m i for the ivts the calculated c obs value eq 14 from c e in each catchment is listed in table 2 fig 7 shows the estimated values of d q d t by ivts correlated to the reference values from the fitted recessions q t for all selected recessions in each of the four typical catchments hwh hnz nld and tjh with different recession timescales τ table 2 where hwh represents catchment with slow recession rate tjh represents catchment with fast recession rate and hnz and nld represent the intermediate state the ivts estimation of d q d t is close to the reference values as these data points are concentrated around the 1 1 line fig 7 for the twenty catchments the median values of rmsle of the estimated d q d t range from 0 050 to 0 137 table 2 smallest in ph and largest in yz the ranges of rmsle from individual recessions in each catchment are relatively small most values are smaller than 0 3 except for some outliers fig 8 the parameter b is fitted from d q d t q for all the selected recessions in each of the catchments and is compared to the reference value the median values of re b of individual recessions for the twenty catchments range from 0 045 to 0 156 smallest in ph and largest in zc however errors of the estimated b values by the ivts method are relatively larger for some individual recessions as evidenced by a large range of the 25th 75th percentiles for the box plot of re b values in each catchment fig 8 and large re b values for the outliers these large re b values are mostly produced by short recession hydrographs for example 3 5 data points according to the derived m i with high noise 4 4 estimation of synthetic recession parameters from cloud like data points of catchments the cloud like data points of d q d t q for all selected recessions in catchments can be seen in fig 9 it shows that the binning average of d q d t q in terms of the splitting log d q d t or l o g q are not overlapped the quantile regression of the observed data points could not best fit the binning average points of d q d t q as well thus the fitted lines from the three methods can differ greatly and thus obtain different parameter values for the twenty catchments the recession parameter bv estimated from our proposed binning average of l o g d q d t the bdq method ranges from 1 44 to 2 83 with the mean value of 1 96 table 3 this mean value is close to the mean of the reference values 1 95 for bind from individual recession events fitted by eq 3 fig 10 a the mean of absolute relative error between bv and bind reb for all catchments is only 0 072 by contrast bh estimated from the binning average of l o g q the bq method and bp estimated from quantile regression are significantly underestimated compared with the reference value bind in each of the catchments the mean value of bh is 1 53 ranging from 1 27 to 1 94 and the mean of bp is 1 52 ranging from 1 25 to 1 94 the mean values of absolute relative error reb between bind and bp is 0 206 and 0 212 between bind and bp much greater than reb between bv and bind the estimated recession av from our proposed binning average of d q d t has a mean value of 5 27 m m b 1 d b 2 ranging from 2 35 to 21 74 m m b 1 d b 2 in the twenty catchments this mean value of av is close to the mean of aind 5 26 m m b 1 d b 2 from fitting individual recession events the mean of absolute relative error between av and aind is 0 095 m m b 1 d b 2 for the twenty catchments much smaller than the means of absolute relative error between ah and aind 0 242 and between ap and aind 0 445 fig 10b this indicates that our proposed recession parameter estimation method i e the binning average method with the splitting the range of l o g d q d t can improve the estimation of basin synthetic recession parameters a and b 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of the d q d t approximation with other methods approximations of the rate of change of streamflow d q d t are vital for recession analysis and characterization of hydrological behaviors however the observational uncertainties and errors in hydrographs reduce the reliability of the applications substantially westerberg and mcmillan 2015 even for a specific recession event different approximation approaches can result in a large range of estimated parameters and hence uncertainty stoelzle et al 2013 thomas et al 2015 to reduce approximation uncertainty we derived a new time variable step determination method used for approximations of d q d t and the recession parameter b the derived method ivts inherits the advantages of determination of the time increment directly expressed from exponential decay of the recession function the ets method by roques et al 2017 and for observed recessions that guarantee the drop in discharge δ q the vts method by rupp and selker 2006 the proposed ivts method is compared with vts and ets methods based on observed hydrographs from twenty catchments in huai river basin in china the parameter ndt in the ets method table 1 is set as the maximum length of selected recession segments and the parameters in the vts method are set the same value as the ivts method given c e 2 δ h 0 01 m and b c for each catchment listed in table 2 compared to the ivts method the vts method gives larger errors in d q d t larger values of rmsle in all the catchments and the ets method gives larger errors of d q d t in 16 of the 20 catchments in terms of the median value of individual recessions table 4 the mean of rmsle values for the time derivative d q d t in these twenty catchments from ivts is 31 0 smaller than that from vts and 18 4 smaller than that from ets as to the estimated errors in recession slope b of individual recessions the vts method generates larger errors large re b while the ets method generates smaller errors smaller re b compared to ivts methods in terms of the median value of individual recessions of each catchment table 4 but the standard deviation of re b values of individual recessions for these catchments is 0 28 for ets in terms of the mean value much larger than 0 17 from ivts furthermore the estimation accuracy by ivts method can be improved by selecting a large c e for example c e 3 in table 4 and fig 6 thus the ivts method could provide more accurate and robust estimation of d q d t and recession parameter of individual recessions compared to ets and vts methods the accurate estimated d q d t q data points from ivts method are more helpful in demonstrate the variation of d q d t with q for individual recessions and reflect the overall distribution of all the recessions 5 2 comparison of estimation methods for basin synthetic recession parameters several studies demonstrated that the median value of recession slopes fitted from individual recession events is greater than that from the point cloud fitting biswal and nagesh kumar 2014 shaw and riha 2012 tashie et al 2020a it may be attribute to that the nonlinearity of observed recession events tends to increase with time generating a convex recession curve tashie et al 2020a in high flow part the differences among individual recessions are limited in log log space in d q d t q form while the differences enlarge in the low flow part in the low flow part data points of d q d t q for individual recession events tend to decline rapidly larger change d q d t in relation to q fig 9a c however the binning average points of d q d t by the splitting q the bq method tend to decline slowly both the bq and quantile regression methods overestimates d q d t values in the low flow part as shown in fig 4b and fig 9 and proven by jachens et al 2020 which results in underestimation of the recession slope especially for catchments with large recession slopes fig 10a our proposed method that binning recession data points by the splitting of l o g d q d t bdq method improves the binning method by splitting of l o g q bq method and the quantile regression method the binning average points of the bdq method well capture the average data points of d q d t q for individual recession events in the low flow period thus the bdq method improves the accuracy of estimation of basin synthetic recession parameters fig 10 5 3 limitations in this study the approximation of d q d t accounts for the flow recession fluctuations due to observation errors however other interference factors like evaporation and groundwater pumping also result in fluctuation in river stage and thus discharge particularly for low stages and during a rainless period these can result in the recession processes being much more complex than the expression in eq 3 which may reduce the accuracy and stability in the estimation of recession rate d q d t thomas et al 2015 wang and cai 2009 wang and cai 2010 estimation of the observation errors in terms of the discharge q and stage h relationship is vital for application of the ivts method the rating curve for discharge q and stage h is relatively steady for mountain rivers however the rating curve can be altered by floods for many rivers mansanarez et al 2019 this means that the parameter bc is a variable instead of a constant when applying the ivts method the recession slope b is assumed to be a constant value in a catchment in this study but several catchments show that the recession slopes tend to increase from high to low flow parts for example hnz and nld in fig 9b c the phenomenon is also found by other several studies ghosh et al 2016 gao et al 2017 tashie et al 2020a thus further study should put more attention on the variation of recession slope with magnitude of flow 6 conclusions in the study a new d q d t calculation method ivts is proposed to minimize the effects of the noisy observations on streamflow recession analysis the proposed ivts method ensures the increment of discharge δ q to calculate d q d t exceeding the observation error of discharge and the adaptation of changes of recession rate the accuracy of ivts method is validated by numerically generated and observed hydrographs results show that the relative errors of both calculated d q d t and the estimated recession slope b by the ivts method are low the relative errors of calculated d q d t are generally reduced with the enlargement of the discharge increment c e δ q but are less influenced by recession rate and observation errors however slow recessions with large observation error can reduce the accuracy of estimated recession parameter b in addition to the d q d t calculation the synthetic recession parameter estimations depend on the fitting methods of d q d t q data points from many individual recessions in this study we proposed the binning average of d q d t q by splitting the range of d q d t instead of q our proposed method the bdq method is proven to overcome the underestimation of recession slope by the traditional methods this study indicates that the ivts method combining with the bdq method improve calculation of d q d t q for the recession data with noise and estimation of synthetic recession parameters at basin scale these could increase the objectivity in interpretation of recession behaviors and accuracy in perdition of low flow processes further research may also be needed to test its extensive applicability to catchments with diverse climate landscape environments and its implementation for better understanding of catchment storage discharge

3851,satellite remote sensing is essential for monitoring surface water dynamics on earth space borne altimeter observations have become an important data source to supplement in situ measurements of water levels the applications of satellite radar altimetry in monitoring reservoirs at global or regional scales have been well demonstrated in many previous studies however studies on medium and small sized reservoirs are limited due to the coarser footprints and relatively low vertical accuracy in anticipation of new satellite laser altimetry missions we aim to demonstrate the coverage performance of icesat 2 for global reservoirs and to further explore its application potential in monitoring the long term changes in water level and storage of reservoirs by integrating landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery datasets in the first 18 months of the icesat 2 mission we find that icesat 2 observations can cover 6231 out of 7250 reservoirs worldwide inventoried in the grand database with a size ranging from 0 1 km2 to 67166 2 km2 which accounts for nearly 86 in count and about 99 in area and capacity for the whole of grand inventoried reservoir we then select 40 reservoirs of different sizes and shapes located in different continents to establish the hypsometric curves most of these reservoirs show robust fitting in the hypsometric curves with the r2 values ranging from 0 60 to 0 99 and the rmse values from 0 37 m to 1 01 m as a new global satellite altimetry dataset icesat 2 shows excellent potential in reconstructing long term water levels with the hypsometric curve method for various reservoirs we also find that the icesat 2 atl13 product misses a small proportion of reservoirs for various reasons including their small size latitudinal narrow shape and data inconsistency between the hydrolakes as water mask of the icesat 2 atl13 product and the updated grand data sets with the continued observation of icesat 2 and possibly updated inland water body mask for the atl13 product in the future many reservoirs can be routinely monitored with high accuracy our findings confirm the powerful capacity of icesat 2 and are expected to enhance our understanding of reservoir behavior in global hydrological processes and water resource management keywords reservoirs icesat 2 landsat 8 sentinel 2 grand water level 1 introduction reservoirs and dams have been built for thousands of years due to their various benefits including irrigation hydroelectricity water supply flood control and fisheries lehner et al 2011 thus far more than one million reservoirs and dams have been constructed to deal with the water and energy costs of global change in recent decades zarfl et al 2015 timpe and kaplan 2017 as a result global observations on the characteristics of reservoirs are required to address the issues related to hydrological processes and human water demands many previous studies have reported that reservoir impoundments and regulations are important in the terrestrial water cycle solander et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 reservoirs have elicited increasing attention because of their relevance to climate change sea level rise carbon emission and other global environment issues chao et al 2008 schneider and hook 2010 barros et al 2011 wu et al 2018 lu et al 2020 monitoring the water level dynamics of reservoirs is essential in mastering and managing reservoir water resources gao et al 2012 rodrigues et al 2012 avisse et al 2017 however no historical in situ networks are shared at large scales especially for remote and less developed regions where gauge data are absent or difficult to access biancamaria et al 2016 ryan et al 2020 therefore many researchers have attempted and successfully monitored the hydrological variables of reservoirs such as water inundation area water level and storage by using multi source remote sensing measurements zhang et al 2014 crétaux et al 2016 busker et al 2019 deng et al 2020 thakur et al 2021 an increasing number of space borne altimeters are being used to survey the dynamics of reservoirs furthermore different open access databases such as the hydroweb database established by the laboratory of studies in space geophysics and oceanography crétaux et al 2011 the database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti schwatke et al 2015 and the global reservoir and lake monitoring datasets from the u s department of agriculture birkett et al 2011 were established based on these radar altimeter measurements and have made outstanding contributions to the field of global reservoir monitoring however due to the coarse sizes of altimetry footprints water level measurements for small reservoirs are still unavailable in these datasets moreover researchers have focused on deriving bathymetry datasets for reservoirs which requires accurate knowledge on reservoirs li et al 2020 liu et al 2020 ma et al 2020 xu et al 2020 this situation means that fine resolution satellite altimetry data should be used to determine reservoir water levels the ice cloud and land elevation satellite 2 icesat 2 was recently launched on september 15 2018 by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa of the united states with a 91 day repeat cycle the advanced topographic laser altimeter system atlas installed on icesat 2 has a high repetition rate three beam pairs and a small footprint diameter of 17 m and it provides a high precision vertical height and dense coverage of the earth s surface markus et al 2017 neumann et al 2019 icesat 2 is initiating a new wave of surface height estimation to monitor sea ice vegetation water and other features for example several prior studies have confirmed the feasibility and precision of measuring the variations in sea ice ocean wave and snow cover based on icesat 2 observations farrell et al 2020 horvat et al 2020 klotz et al 2020 kwok et al 2020 neuenschwander et al 2020 and duncanson et al 2020 used icesat 2 data to verify the canopy heights in boreal forests and estimate the biomass in sonoma county in california respectively ma et al 2020 used a new approach to derive high resolution bathymetry in two shallow lagoons by combining icesat 2 and sentinel 2 imagery datasets recent studies have attempted to apply icesat 2 altimetry to monitor lake surface height in several crucial areas zhang et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 in addition a few studies on inland water body on a global scale using icesat 2 measurements has attracted more attention in the last year for example ryan et al 2020 and cooley et al 2021 employed the icesat 2 satellite laser altimeter to characterizing the influence of humans on global surface water level and storage change respectively xu et al 2021 extracted the monthly water levels for 13 843 lakes and reservoirs 0 1 km2 globally and evaluated the data accuracy of monitoring water level changes based on icesat 2 atl13 products the above studies laid a very important foundation for the feasibility of icesat 2 on reservoir water level monitoring yet the current studies focused on the water level changes of inland water bodies obtained with limited icesat 2 data these studies were rarely predicted the potential of using limited icesat 2 data to extrapolate long time series variation of water level for the inland water bodies worldwide therefore this study mainly aims to illustrate the inner annual and long term variation of global reservoirs based on icesat 2 altimetry through spatial coverage analysis and construction of hypsometric curves which will answer the following questions can icesat 2 based water levels be successfully applied to measure reservoir dynamics simultaneously with inundation area changes derived from optical images how can the limited number of icesat 2 observations be used to reconstruct long term changes in reservoirs before answering the questions we first provide a comprehensive investigation on how many reservoirs in the global dam inventory can be covered by icesat 2 observations second the icesat 2 inland surface water height product atl13 sentinel 2 and landsat 8 imagery were utilized to establish the hypsometric curve of 40 reservoir cases with different sizes and morphological characteristics in different continents lastly we reconstructed long term water levels based on the established hypsometric curves and historical optical imagery and cross evaluated the simulation results of long term water levels based on other water level data sources 2 study data and processing 2 1 global reservoir and dam database the global reservoir and dam grand database provides the characteristics and geographical distributions of global reservoirs and dams lehner et al 2011 we used grand v1 3 to confirm the shape and location of global reservoirs the latest grand v1 3 includes 7250 global reservoirs with geographical boundaries with a storage capacity 0 1 km3 the attribute information for each dam and reservoir including reservoir surface area maximum capacity main function length of dam and height of dam was compiled and cross referenced using multiple sources to verify the veracity and identify conflicts lehner et al 2019 the majority of new reservoir polygons added in the updated grand database were delineated from surface water maps produced by the joint research center of the european commission from landsat imagery at 30 m resolution for the period 1984 2015 pekel et al 2016 2 2 reservoir water level extraction from the icesat 2 altimetry dataset 2 2 1 icesat 2 altimetry dataset the icesat 2 inland surface water height product atl13 https nsidc org data atl13 data from october 14 2018 to march 30 2020 was collected to generate the water levels of study reservoirs the atl13 product provides the along track water surface height for each atlas beam from version 2 of atl13 the water mask was derived from the shape files of the hydrolakes database messager et al 2016 therefore the water bodies of atl13 products are inland water bodies that include lakes and reservoirs 0 1 km2 jasinski et al 2020a the algorithm theoretical basis document atbd for atl13 provides abundant details on the product algorithm jasinski et al 2020b 2 2 2 reservoir water level extraction we first used the reservoir mask of the grand database http globaldamwatch org grand to extract all icesat 2 atl13 along track water surface heights of different observation dates for each reservoir second a normalized median absolute deviation method was applied to remove the height outliers höhle and höhle 2009 to further reduce the uncertainty we excluded observation dates with fewer than 10 footprints over the reservoir inundation area lastly we used the median value of all footprint heights within the same observation date as the reservoir water level 2 3 mapping the reservoir inundation area from landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery 2 3 1 landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery datasets in this study we combined two optical imagery data sources to extract the surface area of reservoirs the first one is the atmospherically corrected surface reflectance dataset level 1 data products from the landsat 8 operational land imager oli sensor from april 11 2013 to june 1 2020 which were provided in the google earth engine gee platform with a 16 day repeat cycle the images contain five visible and near infrared bands two short wave infrared bands processed to orthorectified surface reflectance and two thermal infrared bands the oli images were acquired from 2013 with a 30 m spatial resolution 15 m for the panchromatic band roy et al 2014 vermote et al 2016 the other dataset is the level 1 data products from the sentinel 2 mission from june 23 2015 to june 1 2020 which were provided in gee sentinel 2 is a wide swath high resolution multi spectral imaging mission that can provide landsat type optical image data given its two identical satellites sentinel 2 has a high revisit time of five days and high spatial resolution 10 m for visible bands drusch et al 2012 in terms of avoiding the effect of clouds shadows and other data quality reasons on images the two image datasets were processed in removing the clouds by setting the value range of the quality assessment bands in gee in addition when processing the image data of two sensors we exported the ratio of valid pixels and cloud cover pixels and image data sources only with the over 90 valid pixels could be used to extract the water inundation area of the reservoir meanwhile the landsat 8 images with the corresponding dates to icesat 2 observations were preferentially selected and then supplemented with the sentinel 2 images the information of the number of images sensor selection and time for each reservoir that participated in mapping the inundation area are shown in table s1 2 3 2 mapping the reservoir inundation area this study calculated the normalized difference water index ndwi by utilizing the green and near infrared bands of landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery datasets mcfeeters 1996 du et al 2014 du et al 2016 after extracting the ndwi images we used the otsu method to map the inundation areas of the study reservoirs the otsu method can automatically find an optimal segmentation threshold from the bi modal histogram distribution derived from ndwi imagery otsu 1979 previous studies have confirmed that the otsu method can generate a robust threshold for extracting accurate surface water information from sar data markert et al 2020 and optical images yang et al 2020 recently the otsu method was developed as a tool on the gee platform to assess the global change in surface water donchyts et al 2016 we applied the otsu method to reservoir water area extraction by using sentinel 2 and landsat 8 imagery on the gee platform meanwhile we verified the accuracy of water extraction based on landsat 8 and sentinel 2 images using randomly generated sampling points on high resolution google maps for example the water extraction results of lake mead on october 23 2019 were taken and 380 verification sampling points 200 water body pixels and 180 non water body pixels were randomly generated fig s1 the classification confusion matrix created by these verification points was then used to evaluate the extraction accuracy of water bodies through human computer interaction fig s1 the average classification accuracy and the kappa coefficient are over 96 58 and 0 93 respectively according to randomly selected dates moreover a dynamic threshold segmentation method based on otsu was also adopted to mapping the inundation areas of the study reservoirs to avoid the images that do not satisfy the bi modal condition 3 results and analyses 3 1 evaluation of icesat 2 coverage over global reservoirs among the 7250 reservoirs in the grand database we found that 6231 reservoirs 86 can be observed by icesat 2 as shown in fig 1 the observed reservoirs cover an area of nearly 99 42 and have 98 91 volume capacity of the grand inventoried reservoirs the majority of the reservoirs observed by icesat 2 are located in north america asia and europe fig 1 table 1 the observed reservoirs have different surface areas ranging from 0 1 km2 to 67166 2 km2 the smallest and largest reservoir observed by icesat 2 is the ishiba reservoir in japan and the lake victoria regulated by dams in uganda respectively a total of 1 019 reservoirs are missing in the icesat 2 atl13 dataset about half of the missed reservoirs are located in asia and 523 of them are distributed in china and japan south america has the fewest number 20 of missed reservoirs the missed reservoirs in other continents include 161 in north america 119 in europe 160 in africa and 36 in oceania fig 2 shows the characteristics of the observed reservoirs by continent small and medium reservoirs constitute the largest classes in the proportion of different sized reservoirs with the surface area ranging from 1 km2 to 100 km2 in the six continents fig 2a for the class of large reservoirs exceeding 500 km2 south america ranks as the highest proportion 6 5 among all continents north america has the largest number of reservoirs 2124 with a net area of 147 002 km2 the maximum storage capacity of reservoirs up to 2301 5 km3 is observed in asia the number of observed reservoirs area and storage capacity is the smallest in oceania compared with the other continents we also compare the coverage performances of the studied reservoirs of four different typical functions fig 2b the top three functions hydroelectricity irrigation water supply and flood control of the observed reservoirs in different continents are summarized in table 1 the statistics on the number and area of all the observed reservoirs with different numbers of icesat 2 measurements are illustrated in fig 3 it is clear to see that the number of observed reservoirs decreases with the increase in the number of observations and the observation number increases with the increasing size area of observed reservoirs the reservoirs with surface areas ranging from 1 km2 to 10 km2 have the largest number of reservoirs in the different icesat 2 observations fig 3 and the number of observations ranges from 1 to 4 we found that 5479 reservoirs have at least four observations by icesat 2 in the study period accounting for 76 of the grand database reservoirs in number the large reservoirs tend to have more icesat 2 observations compared with the small ones during our study period the reservoirs with an area between 1 and 10 km2 received 1 to 2 observations and reservoirs with an area above 1000 km2 receive 100 to 200 observations the majority of the reservoirs whose surface areas are between 1 and 100 km2 could receive 3 to 8 observations in a year and a half of the icesat 2 mission in total there are 280 reservoirs with an average area of 1292 8 km2 that are observed 18 times by icesat 2 meaning at least one observation per month referring to the first 18 months of the mission 3 2 comparison of the coverage performance of icesat 2 and other altimetry missions another three satellite altimetry missions namely jason 1 2 3 topex poseidon tp envisat saral and sentinel 3 were analyzed fig 4 a d to compare their coverage performance with that of icesat 2 the four altimetry missions exhibit different coverage performances including the number and size of observable reservoirs due to their resolution and track density by referring to the grand data the numbers of observed reservoirs are respectively 814 by jason 1 2 3 topex poseidon 1711 by envisat saral 2557 by sentinel 3 and 6231 by icesat 2 atl13 table 2 fig 5 illustrated the area distribution of reservoirs observed by icesat 2 and another three satellite altimetry missions the majority of reservoir area has been observed by icesat 2 is between 1 and 10 km2 which is much finer than other traditional altimetry satellites considering their observed reservoir areas are concentrated in 10 100 km2 therefore icesat 2 has more advantages in observing medium and small sized reservoirs compared with other altimetry missions the global reservoir coverage performance of icesat 2 is superior to the other major altimeter measurements fig 4 and fig 5 the excellent global coverage performance of icesat 2 which is due to the orbit design and the advanced sensor atlas installed on icesat 2 is presented in table 2 and fig 4 atlas has six laser beams and it provides dense land surface coverage worldwide it also has a small footprint diameter of 17 m thus offering the possibility of observing smaller lakes and reservoirs worldwide compared with other altimetry missions 3 3 evaluation of reservoir water levels derived from icesat 2 by comparing with inundation area changes forty reservoirs were selected to establish the hypsometric curve figs s3 and s4 for further evaluating the global reservoir coverage performance of icesat 2 the hypsometric curves derived from remote sensing measurements are summarized in table 3 the inundation areas of the selected reservoirs were derived from landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery datasets the icesat 2 mission could provide the water level of the selected reservoirs to make a compromise between the limited availability of icesat 2 and optical image data and the representativeness of the reservoirs on a global scale we selected 40 reservoirs with diverse sizes and morphologic features randomly distributed worldwide to establish the hypsometric curve based on the following criteria intersected by icesat 2 footprints located in different continents endowed with multiple functions have the different number of observations and considers the diversity of areas and shapes table 3 and fig s2 in this manner 40 reservoirs worldwide were examined moreover eight examples of hypsometric curves for the 40 reservoirs in different continents are demonstrated in fig 6 the reservoir area involved in establishing the hypsometric curve ranges from 10 2 km2 to 1698 89 km2 and the number of icesat 2 observations ranges from 5 to 34 table 3 the r2 values of the hypsometric curves shown in table 3 could reflect the quality of the hypsometric curve in several cases most of the reservoirs have high r2 values of over 0 80 indicating strong correlations between the surface areas and water levels of these reservoirs the number of icesat 2 observations could influence the quality of the hypsometric curve the larger the number of icesat 2 observations is the more satellite altimetry data can be applied to establish the robust hypsometric curve however the number of icesat 2 observations cannot fully represent the quality of the hypsometric curve for example millwood lake in north america has only seven icesat 2 observations but its r2 value reaches 0 93 the shulbinsk reservoir located in asia has 20 icesat 2 observations but its r2 value is only 0 77 this result can be attributed to the shape of reservoirs which affects the fitting of the hypsometric curve another possible reason is that low water level fluctuations make it difficult to capture seasonal changes in reservoirs 3 4 evaluation of the icesat 2 capacity for reconstructing the long term water level and storage changes of reservoirs the accuracy of the hypsometric curve is the basis for estimating reservoir water storage changes we have demonstrated the good quality of the constructed hypsometric curves for most reservoirs in section 3 3 further evidence is needed to support the potential of using icesat 2 altimetry data in creating hypsometric curves some sample reservoirs from table 3 were selected to simulate the long term series of historical water levels then the potential of using icesat 2 altimetry satellite data in creating hypsometric curves was analyzed by comparing the simulated historical water level with the time series of reservoir water levels derived from in situ measurements as shown in fig 7 the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were utilized as evaluation indicators to compare the simulation result with the in situ water level as shown in fig 7 the simulated historical water level of the five reservoirs shows good consistency with the values from in situ measurements the evaluation results indicate that all the nse values are closer to 1 although the nse of the livingston reservoir is below 0 fig 7c the rmse values of the surface water level vary from 0 23 m to 1 23 m the nse value of livingston reservoir is 0 15 which means that the simulated history water level could not capture the water level variation characteristics well however the rmse value of livingston reservoir is 0 23 m due to its small changes in water levels throughout the year for the perspective of limited in situ water level the water levels derived from other remote sensing observations offered by dahiti were employed to build the hypsometric curves fig s5 and table s2 the results show that water levels derived from icesat 2 have a strong correlation with the water levels from dahiti yet the a e relationships of hypsometric curves derived from dahiti are poor than that from icesat 2 table s2 therefore the icesat 2 laser altimetry has a better potential than other radar altimeter satellites in establishing hypsometric curves as the number of icesat 2 observations increases the number of routinely observed reservoirs also increases therefore the icesat 2 mission can further improve its global coverage performance for reservoirs 4 discussions 4 1 characteristics of reservoirs missed in the icesat 2 atl13 product the icesat 2 atl13 product uses the water bodies from the hydrolakes database as a water mask that can cover all transected lakes and reservoirs 0 1 km2 however the atl13 product still fails to cover all reservoirs for multiple different reasons we summarized three major cases of reservoirs missed by icesat 2 atl13 products fig 8 in case 1 reservoirs are included in the grand database but not in the hydrolakes database in this case the missed reservoirs are covered by icesat 2 ground track s but icesat 2 observations are not collected in the atl13 product data fig 8a therefore this category of reservoirs should be added to the situation covered by icesat 2 table 4 table 4 shows the supplementation of different size reservoirs missed by atl13 in case 1 in case 2 the reservoirs are too small to be measured by icesat 2 these reservoirs are not passed by icesat 2 ground tracks with no atl13 footprints and having an area of fewer than 1 km2 such as the small size reservoirs located in japan fig 8b in case 3 certain reservoirs are missed by icesat 2 atl13 due to their unique shape and distribution such types of reservoirs are distributed near parallelly with the icesat 2 ground track and extend along the north south direction fig 8c 4 2 uncertainty analysis of establishing reservoir hypsometric curves using icesat 2 here we discussed the uncertainty of establishing hypsometric curves from remote sensing measurements that originates from the following aspects water area extraction based on optical imagery water level extraction from icesat 2 data and the number of observations in this study landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery datasets were used to extract the water area of reservoirs the sentinel 2 image with a high temporal resolution can supplement the landsat 8 datasets however we could not obtain a complete image for mapping the water body in a few cases due to the night condition and hinderance of clouds in these few cases we calculated the percentage of incomplete images in the image of an intact water body in an adjacent period and derived the water area at this time we determined the water surface elevation for each reservoir by computing the median of icesat 2 along track retrievals to reduce uncertainty further footprints in high water occurrence were used in the water level extraction two typical examples of uncertainty analysis are shown in fig 9 in the upper panel of fig 8 we compared the hypsometric curves in which the water surface elevation was derived from the median value fig 9a or mean value fig 9b of icesat 2 along track retrievals in the example of ukal reservoir the two hypsometric curves exhibited a slight difference the fitting result of the hypsometric curve in fig 8a was slightly better than the result in fig 9b we applied the median value because it could eliminate the abnormal value caused by the wrongly classified water body in the reservoir boundary we removed the outliers when we extracted the water surface elevation as described in section 2 2 2 therefore the deviation between the two hypsometric curves in fig 8a and b was relatively small the uncertainty difference in establishing the hypsometric curve due to the selection of footprints was evident fig 9c and d we obtained the hypsometric curve with a good fitting result when we selected only the main reservoir area s footprints highlighted in the bottom panel of fig 9 to participate in the calculation of surface water elevation fig 9c the uncertainty caused by calculating the water surface elevation based on all the footprints in the whole reservoir area and then establishing the hypsometric curve was highly complicated it contained the complex uncertainty caused by the difference between upstream and downstream water levels water frequency water level bias in a dam or reservoir area and other factors using a higher frequency and more satellite monitoring data could reveal these variations in addition the observations required to build a hypsometric curve statistically cannot be neglected to explore and compare the sensitivity of the observations of icesat 2 on building a hypsometric curve a correlogram between r2 of a e relationship and the number of icesat 2 observations was employed based on 40 study reservoir samples fig 10 fig 10 shows that with the increase of the number of icesat 2 observation the r2 of the hypsometric curve based on a e relationship are getting better and closer to 1 it indicates that the increase in the number of observations will doubtlessly enhance the robustness of the hypsometric curve besides the average number of observations for the better fitting result r2 80 was 14 and 5 observations were the minimum number of observations for the good fitting result r2 60 5 conclusions this study explored the icesat 2 coverage performance of observing reservoir and its potential for monitoring reservoir hydrological dynamics we used the icesat 2 atl13 product landsat 8 optical imagery and sentinel 2 optical imagery to demonstrate the global reservoir coverage performance of icesat 2 and its capacity of establishing the hypsometric curve and reconstructing long term water level and storage variations of global reservoirs in the first 18 months of the icesat 2 observation mission we found that the altimetry observations covered 6231 global reservoirs whose sizes ranged from 0 1 km2 to 67166 2 km2 accounting for nearly 86 in number and about 99 in area and volume capacity for the grand inventoried reservoirs however the remaining 14 reservoirs could not be captured by icesat 2 atl13 for different reasons including their size shape distribution or whether they are included in the atl13 water mask furthermore 40 representative reservoirs were selected to establish the hypsometric curve derived by combining icesat 2 altimetry data with landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery data most of the reservoirs shows robust fitting in the hypsometric curves our findings demonstrate the great potential of using icesat 2 based surface water level in establishing the hypsometric curve of global reservoirs with r2 values ranging from 0 60 to 0 99 and rmse values ranging from 0 37 m to 1 01 m over the studied reservoirs these robust hypsometric curves can be used to reconstruct the water storage variations of global reservoirs over long periods our study presents an extensive assessment of global reservoir coverage performance based on icesat 2 atl13 laser altimeter data icesat 2 shows excellent potential in establishing the hypsometric curve of reservoirs although it currently has a limited number of observations the number of observed reservoirs is expected to increase as the number of icesat 2 observations increases and the inland water body mask utilized in the atl13 product is continuously updated therefore the icesat 2 mission can further improve its coverage performance in global reservoirs looking forward future studies on the icesat 2 mission can enhance our understanding of global

3851,satellite remote sensing is essential for monitoring surface water dynamics on earth space borne altimeter observations have become an important data source to supplement in situ measurements of water levels the applications of satellite radar altimetry in monitoring reservoirs at global or regional scales have been well demonstrated in many previous studies however studies on medium and small sized reservoirs are limited due to the coarser footprints and relatively low vertical accuracy in anticipation of new satellite laser altimetry missions we aim to demonstrate the coverage performance of icesat 2 for global reservoirs and to further explore its application potential in monitoring the long term changes in water level and storage of reservoirs by integrating landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery datasets in the first 18 months of the icesat 2 mission we find that icesat 2 observations can cover 6231 out of 7250 reservoirs worldwide inventoried in the grand database with a size ranging from 0 1 km2 to 67166 2 km2 which accounts for nearly 86 in count and about 99 in area and capacity for the whole of grand inventoried reservoir we then select 40 reservoirs of different sizes and shapes located in different continents to establish the hypsometric curves most of these reservoirs show robust fitting in the hypsometric curves with the r2 values ranging from 0 60 to 0 99 and the rmse values from 0 37 m to 1 01 m as a new global satellite altimetry dataset icesat 2 shows excellent potential in reconstructing long term water levels with the hypsometric curve method for various reservoirs we also find that the icesat 2 atl13 product misses a small proportion of reservoirs for various reasons including their small size latitudinal narrow shape and data inconsistency between the hydrolakes as water mask of the icesat 2 atl13 product and the updated grand data sets with the continued observation of icesat 2 and possibly updated inland water body mask for the atl13 product in the future many reservoirs can be routinely monitored with high accuracy our findings confirm the powerful capacity of icesat 2 and are expected to enhance our understanding of reservoir behavior in global hydrological processes and water resource management keywords reservoirs icesat 2 landsat 8 sentinel 2 grand water level 1 introduction reservoirs and dams have been built for thousands of years due to their various benefits including irrigation hydroelectricity water supply flood control and fisheries lehner et al 2011 thus far more than one million reservoirs and dams have been constructed to deal with the water and energy costs of global change in recent decades zarfl et al 2015 timpe and kaplan 2017 as a result global observations on the characteristics of reservoirs are required to address the issues related to hydrological processes and human water demands many previous studies have reported that reservoir impoundments and regulations are important in the terrestrial water cycle solander et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 reservoirs have elicited increasing attention because of their relevance to climate change sea level rise carbon emission and other global environment issues chao et al 2008 schneider and hook 2010 barros et al 2011 wu et al 2018 lu et al 2020 monitoring the water level dynamics of reservoirs is essential in mastering and managing reservoir water resources gao et al 2012 rodrigues et al 2012 avisse et al 2017 however no historical in situ networks are shared at large scales especially for remote and less developed regions where gauge data are absent or difficult to access biancamaria et al 2016 ryan et al 2020 therefore many researchers have attempted and successfully monitored the hydrological variables of reservoirs such as water inundation area water level and storage by using multi source remote sensing measurements zhang et al 2014 crétaux et al 2016 busker et al 2019 deng et al 2020 thakur et al 2021 an increasing number of space borne altimeters are being used to survey the dynamics of reservoirs furthermore different open access databases such as the hydroweb database established by the laboratory of studies in space geophysics and oceanography crétaux et al 2011 the database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti schwatke et al 2015 and the global reservoir and lake monitoring datasets from the u s department of agriculture birkett et al 2011 were established based on these radar altimeter measurements and have made outstanding contributions to the field of global reservoir monitoring however due to the coarse sizes of altimetry footprints water level measurements for small reservoirs are still unavailable in these datasets moreover researchers have focused on deriving bathymetry datasets for reservoirs which requires accurate knowledge on reservoirs li et al 2020 liu et al 2020 ma et al 2020 xu et al 2020 this situation means that fine resolution satellite altimetry data should be used to determine reservoir water levels the ice cloud and land elevation satellite 2 icesat 2 was recently launched on september 15 2018 by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa of the united states with a 91 day repeat cycle the advanced topographic laser altimeter system atlas installed on icesat 2 has a high repetition rate three beam pairs and a small footprint diameter of 17 m and it provides a high precision vertical height and dense coverage of the earth s surface markus et al 2017 neumann et al 2019 icesat 2 is initiating a new wave of surface height estimation to monitor sea ice vegetation water and other features for example several prior studies have confirmed the feasibility and precision of measuring the variations in sea ice ocean wave and snow cover based on icesat 2 observations farrell et al 2020 horvat et al 2020 klotz et al 2020 kwok et al 2020 neuenschwander et al 2020 and duncanson et al 2020 used icesat 2 data to verify the canopy heights in boreal forests and estimate the biomass in sonoma county in california respectively ma et al 2020 used a new approach to derive high resolution bathymetry in two shallow lagoons by combining icesat 2 and sentinel 2 imagery datasets recent studies have attempted to apply icesat 2 altimetry to monitor lake surface height in several crucial areas zhang et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 in addition a few studies on inland water body on a global scale using icesat 2 measurements has attracted more attention in the last year for example ryan et al 2020 and cooley et al 2021 employed the icesat 2 satellite laser altimeter to characterizing the influence of humans on global surface water level and storage change respectively xu et al 2021 extracted the monthly water levels for 13 843 lakes and reservoirs 0 1 km2 globally and evaluated the data accuracy of monitoring water level changes based on icesat 2 atl13 products the above studies laid a very important foundation for the feasibility of icesat 2 on reservoir water level monitoring yet the current studies focused on the water level changes of inland water bodies obtained with limited icesat 2 data these studies were rarely predicted the potential of using limited icesat 2 data to extrapolate long time series variation of water level for the inland water bodies worldwide therefore this study mainly aims to illustrate the inner annual and long term variation of global reservoirs based on icesat 2 altimetry through spatial coverage analysis and construction of hypsometric curves which will answer the following questions can icesat 2 based water levels be successfully applied to measure reservoir dynamics simultaneously with inundation area changes derived from optical images how can the limited number of icesat 2 observations be used to reconstruct long term changes in reservoirs before answering the questions we first provide a comprehensive investigation on how many reservoirs in the global dam inventory can be covered by icesat 2 observations second the icesat 2 inland surface water height product atl13 sentinel 2 and landsat 8 imagery were utilized to establish the hypsometric curve of 40 reservoir cases with different sizes and morphological characteristics in different continents lastly we reconstructed long term water levels based on the established hypsometric curves and historical optical imagery and cross evaluated the simulation results of long term water levels based on other water level data sources 2 study data and processing 2 1 global reservoir and dam database the global reservoir and dam grand database provides the characteristics and geographical distributions of global reservoirs and dams lehner et al 2011 we used grand v1 3 to confirm the shape and location of global reservoirs the latest grand v1 3 includes 7250 global reservoirs with geographical boundaries with a storage capacity 0 1 km3 the attribute information for each dam and reservoir including reservoir surface area maximum capacity main function length of dam and height of dam was compiled and cross referenced using multiple sources to verify the veracity and identify conflicts lehner et al 2019 the majority of new reservoir polygons added in the updated grand database were delineated from surface water maps produced by the joint research center of the european commission from landsat imagery at 30 m resolution for the period 1984 2015 pekel et al 2016 2 2 reservoir water level extraction from the icesat 2 altimetry dataset 2 2 1 icesat 2 altimetry dataset the icesat 2 inland surface water height product atl13 https nsidc org data atl13 data from october 14 2018 to march 30 2020 was collected to generate the water levels of study reservoirs the atl13 product provides the along track water surface height for each atlas beam from version 2 of atl13 the water mask was derived from the shape files of the hydrolakes database messager et al 2016 therefore the water bodies of atl13 products are inland water bodies that include lakes and reservoirs 0 1 km2 jasinski et al 2020a the algorithm theoretical basis document atbd for atl13 provides abundant details on the product algorithm jasinski et al 2020b 2 2 2 reservoir water level extraction we first used the reservoir mask of the grand database http globaldamwatch org grand to extract all icesat 2 atl13 along track water surface heights of different observation dates for each reservoir second a normalized median absolute deviation method was applied to remove the height outliers höhle and höhle 2009 to further reduce the uncertainty we excluded observation dates with fewer than 10 footprints over the reservoir inundation area lastly we used the median value of all footprint heights within the same observation date as the reservoir water level 2 3 mapping the reservoir inundation area from landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery 2 3 1 landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery datasets in this study we combined two optical imagery data sources to extract the surface area of reservoirs the first one is the atmospherically corrected surface reflectance dataset level 1 data products from the landsat 8 operational land imager oli sensor from april 11 2013 to june 1 2020 which were provided in the google earth engine gee platform with a 16 day repeat cycle the images contain five visible and near infrared bands two short wave infrared bands processed to orthorectified surface reflectance and two thermal infrared bands the oli images were acquired from 2013 with a 30 m spatial resolution 15 m for the panchromatic band roy et al 2014 vermote et al 2016 the other dataset is the level 1 data products from the sentinel 2 mission from june 23 2015 to june 1 2020 which were provided in gee sentinel 2 is a wide swath high resolution multi spectral imaging mission that can provide landsat type optical image data given its two identical satellites sentinel 2 has a high revisit time of five days and high spatial resolution 10 m for visible bands drusch et al 2012 in terms of avoiding the effect of clouds shadows and other data quality reasons on images the two image datasets were processed in removing the clouds by setting the value range of the quality assessment bands in gee in addition when processing the image data of two sensors we exported the ratio of valid pixels and cloud cover pixels and image data sources only with the over 90 valid pixels could be used to extract the water inundation area of the reservoir meanwhile the landsat 8 images with the corresponding dates to icesat 2 observations were preferentially selected and then supplemented with the sentinel 2 images the information of the number of images sensor selection and time for each reservoir that participated in mapping the inundation area are shown in table s1 2 3 2 mapping the reservoir inundation area this study calculated the normalized difference water index ndwi by utilizing the green and near infrared bands of landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery datasets mcfeeters 1996 du et al 2014 du et al 2016 after extracting the ndwi images we used the otsu method to map the inundation areas of the study reservoirs the otsu method can automatically find an optimal segmentation threshold from the bi modal histogram distribution derived from ndwi imagery otsu 1979 previous studies have confirmed that the otsu method can generate a robust threshold for extracting accurate surface water information from sar data markert et al 2020 and optical images yang et al 2020 recently the otsu method was developed as a tool on the gee platform to assess the global change in surface water donchyts et al 2016 we applied the otsu method to reservoir water area extraction by using sentinel 2 and landsat 8 imagery on the gee platform meanwhile we verified the accuracy of water extraction based on landsat 8 and sentinel 2 images using randomly generated sampling points on high resolution google maps for example the water extraction results of lake mead on october 23 2019 were taken and 380 verification sampling points 200 water body pixels and 180 non water body pixels were randomly generated fig s1 the classification confusion matrix created by these verification points was then used to evaluate the extraction accuracy of water bodies through human computer interaction fig s1 the average classification accuracy and the kappa coefficient are over 96 58 and 0 93 respectively according to randomly selected dates moreover a dynamic threshold segmentation method based on otsu was also adopted to mapping the inundation areas of the study reservoirs to avoid the images that do not satisfy the bi modal condition 3 results and analyses 3 1 evaluation of icesat 2 coverage over global reservoirs among the 7250 reservoirs in the grand database we found that 6231 reservoirs 86 can be observed by icesat 2 as shown in fig 1 the observed reservoirs cover an area of nearly 99 42 and have 98 91 volume capacity of the grand inventoried reservoirs the majority of the reservoirs observed by icesat 2 are located in north america asia and europe fig 1 table 1 the observed reservoirs have different surface areas ranging from 0 1 km2 to 67166 2 km2 the smallest and largest reservoir observed by icesat 2 is the ishiba reservoir in japan and the lake victoria regulated by dams in uganda respectively a total of 1 019 reservoirs are missing in the icesat 2 atl13 dataset about half of the missed reservoirs are located in asia and 523 of them are distributed in china and japan south america has the fewest number 20 of missed reservoirs the missed reservoirs in other continents include 161 in north america 119 in europe 160 in africa and 36 in oceania fig 2 shows the characteristics of the observed reservoirs by continent small and medium reservoirs constitute the largest classes in the proportion of different sized reservoirs with the surface area ranging from 1 km2 to 100 km2 in the six continents fig 2a for the class of large reservoirs exceeding 500 km2 south america ranks as the highest proportion 6 5 among all continents north america has the largest number of reservoirs 2124 with a net area of 147 002 km2 the maximum storage capacity of reservoirs up to 2301 5 km3 is observed in asia the number of observed reservoirs area and storage capacity is the smallest in oceania compared with the other continents we also compare the coverage performances of the studied reservoirs of four different typical functions fig 2b the top three functions hydroelectricity irrigation water supply and flood control of the observed reservoirs in different continents are summarized in table 1 the statistics on the number and area of all the observed reservoirs with different numbers of icesat 2 measurements are illustrated in fig 3 it is clear to see that the number of observed reservoirs decreases with the increase in the number of observations and the observation number increases with the increasing size area of observed reservoirs the reservoirs with surface areas ranging from 1 km2 to 10 km2 have the largest number of reservoirs in the different icesat 2 observations fig 3 and the number of observations ranges from 1 to 4 we found that 5479 reservoirs have at least four observations by icesat 2 in the study period accounting for 76 of the grand database reservoirs in number the large reservoirs tend to have more icesat 2 observations compared with the small ones during our study period the reservoirs with an area between 1 and 10 km2 received 1 to 2 observations and reservoirs with an area above 1000 km2 receive 100 to 200 observations the majority of the reservoirs whose surface areas are between 1 and 100 km2 could receive 3 to 8 observations in a year and a half of the icesat 2 mission in total there are 280 reservoirs with an average area of 1292 8 km2 that are observed 18 times by icesat 2 meaning at least one observation per month referring to the first 18 months of the mission 3 2 comparison of the coverage performance of icesat 2 and other altimetry missions another three satellite altimetry missions namely jason 1 2 3 topex poseidon tp envisat saral and sentinel 3 were analyzed fig 4 a d to compare their coverage performance with that of icesat 2 the four altimetry missions exhibit different coverage performances including the number and size of observable reservoirs due to their resolution and track density by referring to the grand data the numbers of observed reservoirs are respectively 814 by jason 1 2 3 topex poseidon 1711 by envisat saral 2557 by sentinel 3 and 6231 by icesat 2 atl13 table 2 fig 5 illustrated the area distribution of reservoirs observed by icesat 2 and another three satellite altimetry missions the majority of reservoir area has been observed by icesat 2 is between 1 and 10 km2 which is much finer than other traditional altimetry satellites considering their observed reservoir areas are concentrated in 10 100 km2 therefore icesat 2 has more advantages in observing medium and small sized reservoirs compared with other altimetry missions the global reservoir coverage performance of icesat 2 is superior to the other major altimeter measurements fig 4 and fig 5 the excellent global coverage performance of icesat 2 which is due to the orbit design and the advanced sensor atlas installed on icesat 2 is presented in table 2 and fig 4 atlas has six laser beams and it provides dense land surface coverage worldwide it also has a small footprint diameter of 17 m thus offering the possibility of observing smaller lakes and reservoirs worldwide compared with other altimetry missions 3 3 evaluation of reservoir water levels derived from icesat 2 by comparing with inundation area changes forty reservoirs were selected to establish the hypsometric curve figs s3 and s4 for further evaluating the global reservoir coverage performance of icesat 2 the hypsometric curves derived from remote sensing measurements are summarized in table 3 the inundation areas of the selected reservoirs were derived from landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery datasets the icesat 2 mission could provide the water level of the selected reservoirs to make a compromise between the limited availability of icesat 2 and optical image data and the representativeness of the reservoirs on a global scale we selected 40 reservoirs with diverse sizes and morphologic features randomly distributed worldwide to establish the hypsometric curve based on the following criteria intersected by icesat 2 footprints located in different continents endowed with multiple functions have the different number of observations and considers the diversity of areas and shapes table 3 and fig s2 in this manner 40 reservoirs worldwide were examined moreover eight examples of hypsometric curves for the 40 reservoirs in different continents are demonstrated in fig 6 the reservoir area involved in establishing the hypsometric curve ranges from 10 2 km2 to 1698 89 km2 and the number of icesat 2 observations ranges from 5 to 34 table 3 the r2 values of the hypsometric curves shown in table 3 could reflect the quality of the hypsometric curve in several cases most of the reservoirs have high r2 values of over 0 80 indicating strong correlations between the surface areas and water levels of these reservoirs the number of icesat 2 observations could influence the quality of the hypsometric curve the larger the number of icesat 2 observations is the more satellite altimetry data can be applied to establish the robust hypsometric curve however the number of icesat 2 observations cannot fully represent the quality of the hypsometric curve for example millwood lake in north america has only seven icesat 2 observations but its r2 value reaches 0 93 the shulbinsk reservoir located in asia has 20 icesat 2 observations but its r2 value is only 0 77 this result can be attributed to the shape of reservoirs which affects the fitting of the hypsometric curve another possible reason is that low water level fluctuations make it difficult to capture seasonal changes in reservoirs 3 4 evaluation of the icesat 2 capacity for reconstructing the long term water level and storage changes of reservoirs the accuracy of the hypsometric curve is the basis for estimating reservoir water storage changes we have demonstrated the good quality of the constructed hypsometric curves for most reservoirs in section 3 3 further evidence is needed to support the potential of using icesat 2 altimetry data in creating hypsometric curves some sample reservoirs from table 3 were selected to simulate the long term series of historical water levels then the potential of using icesat 2 altimetry satellite data in creating hypsometric curves was analyzed by comparing the simulated historical water level with the time series of reservoir water levels derived from in situ measurements as shown in fig 7 the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were utilized as evaluation indicators to compare the simulation result with the in situ water level as shown in fig 7 the simulated historical water level of the five reservoirs shows good consistency with the values from in situ measurements the evaluation results indicate that all the nse values are closer to 1 although the nse of the livingston reservoir is below 0 fig 7c the rmse values of the surface water level vary from 0 23 m to 1 23 m the nse value of livingston reservoir is 0 15 which means that the simulated history water level could not capture the water level variation characteristics well however the rmse value of livingston reservoir is 0 23 m due to its small changes in water levels throughout the year for the perspective of limited in situ water level the water levels derived from other remote sensing observations offered by dahiti were employed to build the hypsometric curves fig s5 and table s2 the results show that water levels derived from icesat 2 have a strong correlation with the water levels from dahiti yet the a e relationships of hypsometric curves derived from dahiti are poor than that from icesat 2 table s2 therefore the icesat 2 laser altimetry has a better potential than other radar altimeter satellites in establishing hypsometric curves as the number of icesat 2 observations increases the number of routinely observed reservoirs also increases therefore the icesat 2 mission can further improve its global coverage performance for reservoirs 4 discussions 4 1 characteristics of reservoirs missed in the icesat 2 atl13 product the icesat 2 atl13 product uses the water bodies from the hydrolakes database as a water mask that can cover all transected lakes and reservoirs 0 1 km2 however the atl13 product still fails to cover all reservoirs for multiple different reasons we summarized three major cases of reservoirs missed by icesat 2 atl13 products fig 8 in case 1 reservoirs are included in the grand database but not in the hydrolakes database in this case the missed reservoirs are covered by icesat 2 ground track s but icesat 2 observations are not collected in the atl13 product data fig 8a therefore this category of reservoirs should be added to the situation covered by icesat 2 table 4 table 4 shows the supplementation of different size reservoirs missed by atl13 in case 1 in case 2 the reservoirs are too small to be measured by icesat 2 these reservoirs are not passed by icesat 2 ground tracks with no atl13 footprints and having an area of fewer than 1 km2 such as the small size reservoirs located in japan fig 8b in case 3 certain reservoirs are missed by icesat 2 atl13 due to their unique shape and distribution such types of reservoirs are distributed near parallelly with the icesat 2 ground track and extend along the north south direction fig 8c 4 2 uncertainty analysis of establishing reservoir hypsometric curves using icesat 2 here we discussed the uncertainty of establishing hypsometric curves from remote sensing measurements that originates from the following aspects water area extraction based on optical imagery water level extraction from icesat 2 data and the number of observations in this study landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery datasets were used to extract the water area of reservoirs the sentinel 2 image with a high temporal resolution can supplement the landsat 8 datasets however we could not obtain a complete image for mapping the water body in a few cases due to the night condition and hinderance of clouds in these few cases we calculated the percentage of incomplete images in the image of an intact water body in an adjacent period and derived the water area at this time we determined the water surface elevation for each reservoir by computing the median of icesat 2 along track retrievals to reduce uncertainty further footprints in high water occurrence were used in the water level extraction two typical examples of uncertainty analysis are shown in fig 9 in the upper panel of fig 8 we compared the hypsometric curves in which the water surface elevation was derived from the median value fig 9a or mean value fig 9b of icesat 2 along track retrievals in the example of ukal reservoir the two hypsometric curves exhibited a slight difference the fitting result of the hypsometric curve in fig 8a was slightly better than the result in fig 9b we applied the median value because it could eliminate the abnormal value caused by the wrongly classified water body in the reservoir boundary we removed the outliers when we extracted the water surface elevation as described in section 2 2 2 therefore the deviation between the two hypsometric curves in fig 8a and b was relatively small the uncertainty difference in establishing the hypsometric curve due to the selection of footprints was evident fig 9c and d we obtained the hypsometric curve with a good fitting result when we selected only the main reservoir area s footprints highlighted in the bottom panel of fig 9 to participate in the calculation of surface water elevation fig 9c the uncertainty caused by calculating the water surface elevation based on all the footprints in the whole reservoir area and then establishing the hypsometric curve was highly complicated it contained the complex uncertainty caused by the difference between upstream and downstream water levels water frequency water level bias in a dam or reservoir area and other factors using a higher frequency and more satellite monitoring data could reveal these variations in addition the observations required to build a hypsometric curve statistically cannot be neglected to explore and compare the sensitivity of the observations of icesat 2 on building a hypsometric curve a correlogram between r2 of a e relationship and the number of icesat 2 observations was employed based on 40 study reservoir samples fig 10 fig 10 shows that with the increase of the number of icesat 2 observation the r2 of the hypsometric curve based on a e relationship are getting better and closer to 1 it indicates that the increase in the number of observations will doubtlessly enhance the robustness of the hypsometric curve besides the average number of observations for the better fitting result r2 80 was 14 and 5 observations were the minimum number of observations for the good fitting result r2 60 5 conclusions this study explored the icesat 2 coverage performance of observing reservoir and its potential for monitoring reservoir hydrological dynamics we used the icesat 2 atl13 product landsat 8 optical imagery and sentinel 2 optical imagery to demonstrate the global reservoir coverage performance of icesat 2 and its capacity of establishing the hypsometric curve and reconstructing long term water level and storage variations of global reservoirs in the first 18 months of the icesat 2 observation mission we found that the altimetry observations covered 6231 global reservoirs whose sizes ranged from 0 1 km2 to 67166 2 km2 accounting for nearly 86 in number and about 99 in area and volume capacity for the grand inventoried reservoirs however the remaining 14 reservoirs could not be captured by icesat 2 atl13 for different reasons including their size shape distribution or whether they are included in the atl13 water mask furthermore 40 representative reservoirs were selected to establish the hypsometric curve derived by combining icesat 2 altimetry data with landsat 8 and sentinel 2 imagery data most of the reservoirs shows robust fitting in the hypsometric curves our findings demonstrate the great potential of using icesat 2 based surface water level in establishing the hypsometric curve of global reservoirs with r2 values ranging from 0 60 to 0 99 and rmse values ranging from 0 37 m to 1 01 m over the studied reservoirs these robust hypsometric curves can be used to reconstruct the water storage variations of global reservoirs over long periods our study presents an extensive assessment of global reservoir coverage performance based on icesat 2 atl13 laser altimeter data icesat 2 shows excellent potential in establishing the hypsometric curve of reservoirs although it currently has a limited number of observations the number of observed reservoirs is expected to increase as the number of icesat 2 observations increases and the inland water body mask utilized in the atl13 product is continuously updated therefore the icesat 2 mission can further improve its coverage performance in global reservoirs looking forward future studies on the icesat 2 mission can enhance our understanding of global

3852,understanding stream runoff generation processes requires distributed stream runoff estimates however the acquisition of such estimates remains challenging in hydrology especially in remote areas in regions with a high spatial density of small reservoirs those reservoirs could be employed to gauge stream runoff liebe et al 2009 using a water balance approach the stream runoff flowing into a reservoir from a drainage catchment could be estimated accordingly this work aims to address the following two questions i what is the error in the estimated stream runoff and ii what are the main estimation uncertainty factors based on a case study of the kamech catchment tunisia stream runoff was estimated at different temporal resolutions 1 32 days and a global sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the contributions of the reservoir water balance terms evaporation rainfall percolation reservoir water level and level area volume relations to the estimated stream runoff uncertainty the results reveal that stream runoff can be reliably estimated based on small reservoirs using a mass balance approach the error and global stream runoff estimation uncertainties decrease as the temporal resolution increases the bathymetric relationships level area and level volume relations constitute a strong factor of uncertainty for all temporal resolutions and even the dominant factor for temporal resolutions ranging from 4 to 23 days the estimation uncertainty for the shortest temporal resolutions 1 8 days mainly originates from reservoir level uncertainty as the temporal resolution increases the contribution of percolation uncertainty increases the general not site specific conclusions of this study are that stream runoff gauging based on small reservoirs requires the determination of the bathymetric relations and that small reservoirs could be used as reliable stream runoff gauges at short temporal resolutions if the reservoir level is measured with limited uncertainty and at long temporal resolutions as long as the percolation rate from the reservoir is known with limited uncertainty keywords gauging stream runoff reservoir water balance uncertainty global sensitivity analysis 1 introduction stream runoff time series constitute basic and critical data in hydrology that are needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the variability and generation of stream runoff and are essential for quantifying the status of water resources and planning and implementing management operations stream runoff data are important for hydrological modelling performed for both scientific and operational objectives these time series are also necessary for understanding the biogeochemical cycles and ecological functioning of streams however acquiring either local at a point or spatially distributed stream runoff time series data remains a real challenge in hydrology this challenge is particularly acute in remote areas such areas in arid and semi arid environments small reservoirs have been erected in arid and semi arid locales for supplying water often for agriculture and preventing downstream flooding despite the lack of a formal definition a small reservoir is commonly characterised by a storage capacity smaller than 1 mm3 habets et al 2018 a small reservoir often consists of a small dam built across a valley to intercept and store stream runoff for decades small reservoirs have been increasingly constructed in many countries consequently in some catchments such as those in australia schreider et al 2002 nathan and lowe 2012 and in south africa hughes mantel 2010 the density can exceed 1 reservoir km2 the idea to use small reservoirs as stream gauges has already been examined albergel rejeb 1997 mekki et al 2006 liebe et al 2009 liebe et al 2009 used a simple hydrological model coupled with the remote monitoring of a small reservoir to simulate daily stream runoff time series for a catchment in ghana furthermore using the water balance approach the water levels in small reservoirs have been continuously monitored to estimate stream runoff for instance in tunisia by albergel and rejeb 1997 and mekki et al 2006 the technological development of automatic water level sensors and remote data transmission and the development of community based approaches starkey et al 2017 could enhance the availability of data for the evaluation of the water balance and thus improve the use of small reservoirs as stream runoff gauges the objective of this study is to examine the relevance of regarding small reservoirs as stream gauges based on the water balance approach this study relies on the kamech catchment tunisia which is a research catchment draining into a small reservoir we followed a two step approach in the first step the stream runoff was estimated at different temporal resolutions based on the reservoir water balance then the estimated time series data were compared with stream runoff measurements obtained from a classic stream gauge station to evaluate the adding value of the reservoir method we also estimated as a comparison stream runoff based on a more straightforward method used in engineering hydrology which is the runoff coefficient in the second step a global sensitivity analysis was performed to identify and quantify the main sources of uncertainty in the stream runoff estimated using the reservoir water balance approach based on these results the feasibility of considering small reservoirs as stream gauges is discussed 2 study catchment and data the kamech catchment is a small catchment 2 63 km2 located in northern tunisia the kamech catchment is one of the two catchments in france and tunisia of the observatory omere an acronym for mediterranean observatory of rural environment and water or observatoire méditerranéen de l environnement rural et de l eau in french molénat et al 2018 the catchment also belongs to the french network of critical zone observatories called ozcar gaillardet et al 2018 the catchment characteristics equipment and monitoring are extensively described in molénat et al 2018 climatically the region is semi arid to sub humid and the 25 year mean annual rainfall and reference evaporation are 645 mm and 1366 mm respectively in 1992 a dam was built across the wadi at the catchment outlet to prevent siltation in a large downstream dam the reservoir has a capacity of 135 000 m3 fig 1 the reservoir intercepts runoff from the wadi and lateral surface runoff along its banks the water within the reservoir may be withdrawn for irrigation in spring and summer and water can also be released when the reservoir reaches its capacity to ensure the safety of the dam s infrastructure in the present study we chose the water year 2011 2012 during which releases and withdrawals were either null or negligible hereafter we present the available data and give an estimate of the relative or absolute errors in each measurement as these errors are particularly important for the global sensitivity analysis performed in this work rainfall in the catchment is measured using a tipping bucket gauge located on the dam in this work the hourly mean rainfall rate is used the relative error in a rainfall measurement acquired by a tipping bucket depends on many factors such as the rainfall intensity and volumes of the compartments within the bucket consequently the relative errors vary considerably in the literature habib et al 2001 wang et al 2008 in this work we assumed a relative error of 20 in the rainfall measurements corresponding to the highest values of an hourly time step reported in previous studies wang et al 2008 pan evaporation is measured daily using a pan located on a bank of the reservoir near the dam the hourly evaporation rate was derived from daily records considering a sinusoidal hourly variation each day evaporation from the reservoir water free surface efs in the reservoir was derived from pan evaporation epan considering a pan coefficient k of 0 65 bouteffeha et al 2015 according to efs k epan in general the k factor can vary across reservoirs and within a given reservoir over time regarding lake or reservoir evaporation k is generally found to be lower than 1 0 with wide variations ranging from 0 5 to 1 2 e g fu et al 2004 martínez alvarez et al 2007 in this work we considered both the error associated with pan evaporation measurements epan and the error associated with the determination of the pan coefficient k by applying a logarithmic transform of the latter relation and then deriving we can deduce that defs efs dk k depan epan where defs dk and depan are the derivatives of efs k and epan respectively that are assimilated in the absolute error thus the relative error in efs defs efs is the sum of the relative errors in epan and k following winter 1981 the relative errors in the pan evaporation and pan coefficient estimation were considered to be 20 and 10 respectively yielding to a relative error of 30 in the reservoir water evaporation estimation the reservoir water level is measured every 5 min by a continuous pressure probe compensating for atmospheric pressure fluctuations the absolute error in the water level measurement was estimated at 20 mm independent of the level this error includes the error due to the sensor considered as independent of the level according to the manufacturer and the error resulting from wind induced variations which was considered empirically at approximately 15 mm and independent of the level the reservoir water volume can be derived from the relations between the water volume and level and between the water area and level hereafter named the level volume l v and level area l a relations respectively these relations were determined based on a bathymetric survey performed in august 2008 the bathymetric survey produced bipoints of li vi and li ai the relations l v and a v were fitted on the bi points as v alb and a cld error in the relations are derived from different sources as follows data source error derived from the topographic survey of the reservoir bed elevation error in measurement sampling interval and dem building and error in the volume and area calculations for each bi point i e li vi or li ai we considered that the volume vi or area ai was estimated with a relative error of 20 the percolation from the reservoir was estimated according to bouteffeha et al 2015 who estimated the percolation rates at some reservoir water levels a linear regression was performed allowing us to estimate the percolation rate at each reservoir water level thus the relation between the percolation rate and water level hereafter named the percolation relation was based on different data than those used in the present study to estimate stream runoff the error in the percolation estimation was fixed from the 99 confidence interval in a linear regression the confidence interval depends on the value of the regressor and is not theoretically constant in our case the errors in the percolation rates within the range of reservoir water levels varied between 2 18 and 2 19 mm day consequently the error in the percolation rate estimation was assumed to be constant at 2 185 mm day in the kamech catchment the wadi runoff is monitored with a gauging station located upstream of the reservoir mouth wadi station in fig 1 the station is located sufficiently upstream of the reservoir mouth to avoid or minimize backwater effects fig 1 the station is equipped with a u shaped concrete flume the water level in the flume is measured once per minute by a pressure transducer sensor and recorded in a data logger then a stage discharge relationship is used to estimate stream runoff based on the water level a set of ten stage discharge values was used to establish the stage discharge relationship for every stage discharge value the discharge was estimated by the velocity area method velocity in the wet section was measured with a velocimeter every 2 cm of depth and at lateral intervals proportional to water level hourly runoff averages were used in this work and the total runoff entering the reservoir was calculated as the area scaled specific runoff measured in the wadi 3 estimated stream runoff and associated error and uncertainty 3 1 estimation of stream runoff the small reservoir considered here captures the stream runoff draining from an upstream catchment fig 2 hence the temporal variations in the reservoir water volume depend on the upstream stream runoff and other inflows rainfall directly impacting the surface water and outflows evaporation from the surface water and seepage through the reservoir bed and dam here water abstraction is assumed to be null or negligible the variation in the reservoir water volume at a temporal resolution of δt t can be expressed based on the water balance as follows 1 δ v δ t q a c e r s p where δv is the variation in the reservoir water volume l3 over the given time step δt q is the catchment specific runoff l t flowing into the reservoir over the given time step e is the evaporation flux l3 t from the reservoir surface water over the given time step r is the mean rainfall flux l3 t at the reservoir surface water over the given time step sp is the mean percolation flux l3 t from the reservoir water surface as infiltration occurs through the reservoir bottom or wall dams and ac is the catchment area l2 drained by the reservoir from equation 1 the specific stream runoff over a given time step δti is estimated as 2 q i est 1 a c v i fin v i ini δ t i r i e i s p i where vi fin l3 and vi ini l3 are the final and initial water volumes in the reservoir respectively at the end and the beginning of the given time step and qest i ei ri and spi are the estimated specific stream runoff l t rainfall flux l3 t evaporation flux l3 t and percolation flux l3 t respectively over the given time step δti the percolation was calculated based on a linear regression of the reservoir water level and percolation rate at each time step of a given temporal resolution the evaporation rainfall and percolation fluxes were estimated as the product of the water surface area of the reservoir and the cumulative evaporation rainfall and percolation respectively over the time step the surface area and volume of water in the reservoir were calculated based on the water level measurements and the l a and l v relations respectively the average surface area over a given time step was considered to be the mean of the initial and final surface areas of the time step the specific stream runoff in one hydrologic year ranging from 01 september 2010 to 31 august 2011 was calculated the stream runoff times series were calculated for 32 temporal resolutions δt ranging from 1 day to 32 days with a one day increment the length of the stream runoff time series ranged from 365 steps at the 1 day resolution to 11 steps at the 32 days resolution the interest of using the small reservoir method to estimate stream runoff was analysed based both on performance criteria of estimation see the following section and on a comparison with a simple method the runoff coefficient method was used as the simple method since it is particularly relevant to hortonian runoff catchments such as kamech catchment hingray et al 2014 according to this method the stream runoff is estimated at a constant fraction of the rainfall we explored the values of runoff coefficient ranging from 0 01 to 0 5 for every value and at every time resolution 1 to 32 days the nash and sutcliffe efficiency was calculated from the observed and estimated stream runoff we retained the value of 0 09 as runoff coefficient which provided the highest efficiency mean calculated from the efficiencies of all the time resolutions 3 2 estimation error uncertainty and performance the following two types of uncertainty sources were considered in the analysis of uncertainty in the stream runoff estimation based on equation 2 the measurement uncertainty and the derived data uncertainty mcmillan et al 2018 the measurement uncertainty was associated with errors in the direct and local measurements of the pan evaporation rainfall rate by rain gauging and reservoir water level by a pressure sensor the derived data uncertainty in the reservoir water volume and area the evaporation flux and the percolation flux was considered the derived data uncertainty in the water volume and area vi and ai in equation 2 was assumed to result from the uncertainty in the l v and l a relations the uncertainty in the percolation rate spi in equation 2 was assumed to mainly originate from the uncertainty in the percolation relation at least the derived data uncertainty associated with the evaporation flux ei in equation 2 was assumed to originate from the uncertainty in the pan coefficient each uncertainty was assumed to vary from time step to time step when applying equation 2 as a consequence of the measurement uncertainty and the derived data uncertainty each variable in equation 2 was considered a random variable characterised by a probability density function pdf the range of values defined by the pdf of a given term corresponds to the range of possible values due to the errors potentially occurring in the estimation of that term the stream runoff at each δti was also considered a random variable with possible values therefore for each time step δti during a given simulation period e g a water year we defined the following qest i a possible value of the stream runoff during δti q i est the estimated stream runoff during δti as the mean of all possible values and uqi the uncertainty in the estimated stream runoff at δti where the true value qi is in the interval q i est u qi q i est u qi with a certain level of confidence with the 99 level of confidence we chose the uncertainty is equal to 3 0 σqi n where σqi is the standard deviation of n possible values the error in the estimation εqi was considered the difference between the mean estimated stream runoff q i est and the unknown true stream runoff qcatch i then the mean error me and the mean uncertainty mu of the catchment stream runoff over the given simulation period are the averages of the errors εqi and uncertainties uqi respectively where i ranges from 1 to n with n being the total time step considered during the given period the nash sutcliffe efficiency was calculated as the estimation performance criterion considering the stream runoff nse and the square root of the stream runoff nsesqrt the motivation to consider the square root transform is to reduce the weights of the high stream runoff values in the analysis of the stream runoff estimates 3 3 global sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis gsa was performed based on sobol s method which is a variance based method sobol 2001 the output of a model with a discrete time step can be expressed as follows 3 y f x θ where y is the output variable of the model x is the input variable and θ is the parameter set the variables y and x and the parameter θ can be scalar or vectors sobol s method evaluates the variance of y caused by changes in the input x and the parameter set θ therefore both the input variables and the parameters can be factors in the sensitivity analysis typically the direct model output y is replaced by a model performance measure of the stream runoff prediction tang et al 2007 thus a sensitivity analysis applies a measure of the error between the observed and simulated values in the present work the root mean square error rmse between the observed and estimated stream runoff was chosen as the performance measure considering y a random variable described by a pdf y the total variance of y can be decomposed as follows 4 v a r y i p va r i i j 1 p va r ij i j k 1 p va r ijk v a r 1 2 p where var y is the total variance of the output variable y due to p factors p is the number of factors and vari is the variance attributable to the principal effect of factor i while the factors are the input variables x and or parameters θ and the other terms corresponding to the fraction of the total variance attributable to the interaction effects between the factors the interaction reflects how the factors intensify cancel or compensate for the effects of the other factors in the model outputs razavi and gupta 2015 based on the variance decomposition of y the following two indices are defined 5 s i va r i v a r y and 6 s ti 1 va r i v a r y where si and sti are the first order sobol index and total sobol index respectively and var i is the variance attributable to all factors except for i the gsa aims to study the sensitivity of the model simulation to various factors in contrast to the usual gsa where the model parameters are the factors e g tang et al 2007 in our study the factors are the variables used in equation 2 to simulate stream runoff actually each variable used in equation 2 corresponds to a vector i e a time series therefore the sobol indices were calculated from a large number of simulations of stream runoff time series and each simulation was performed with a sampled time series of each variable in equation 2 in practice considering a given temporal resolution δt a large number of sampled time series of the initial water level at the beginning of each time step the final water level at the end of each time step the rain the evaporation and the percolation were generated furthermore for each simulated time series of stream runoff we considered a possible l a relation and a possible l v relation see the following section ultimately the following six factors were considered in the gsa i initial water level ii final water level iii rain iv evaporation v percolation and vi bathymetric relations l a and l v relations 3 4 implementation of estimations for each temporal resolution δt we estimated n 10 000 possible time series of stream runoff as a result we obtained n estimations of the stream runoff qest i for each given time step δti each possible time series of runoff was obtained with all possible time series of all terms on the right side of equation 2 to generate a possible time series for each term on the right side we proceeded as follows for each variable or derived variable used in equation 2 and associated with uncertainty a possible value at each time step was drawn from a pdf we assigned a pdf to each variable associated with measurement uncertainty and derived data uncertainty a given pdf characterised by a mean and a standard deviation was considered at each time step for each term following previous studies horner et al 2018 the error associated with water level measurement was assumed to follow a gaussian distribution the mean was considered the measured value and the standard deviation was fixed at the absolute error in the measurement the percolation rate was also assumed to follow a gaussian distribution with a mean equal to the value derived from the percolation relation and a standard deviation corresponding to the prediction error at the 99 confidence interval in the linear regression used as the percolation relation regarding the other terms rainfall and evaporation due to lack of real distribution or tangible evidence of the shape of the pdf we chose a uniform distribution this choice leads to maximizing the uncertainty compared to that of other distributions at each time step the mean was considered the measured value and the standard deviation was derived from the relative error associated with the rainfall measurement and evaporation estimation the relative errors were fixed at 20 for rainfall and 30 for the evaporation rate see section 1 to estimate n possible time series of stream runoff n possible l v and l a relations were also established randomly by considering the uncertainty in these relations to establish each possible relation we considered that each vi and ai measurement used to fit the l v and l a relations is characterised by a specific uniform pdf with a mean corresponding to the measured value and a standard deviation derived from the standard error in the measurement section 1 to estimate each possible time series of stream runoff we first randomly drew each vi and ai and then fitted the possible l v and l a relation to the generated li vi and li ai bipoints then the estimated stream runoff at a given time step was calculated as the mean of all 10 000 simulated possible values the uncertainty in the estimated stream runoff was calculated based on the standard deviation of the 10 000 simulated possible values then the error in the simulated stream runoff at a given time step corresponded to the absolute difference between the observed value and the simulated mean value in each temporal resolution the mean error and mean uncertainty were calculated corresponding to the means of the errors and uncertainties respectively of each simulated stream runoff in the time series the nash sutcliffe efficiency metrics nse and nsesqrt were also calculated based on the observed values and simulated mean values 4 results 4 1 error and total uncertainty considering the simulation performance stream runoff is fairly well estimated based on the water balance approach regardless of the temporal resolution considered fig 3 the nash sutcliffe criteria are greater than 0 87 at all temporal resolutions and greater than 0 91 at δt 27 days the rmse decreases as the temporal resolution increases up to 6 days and then the rmse slightly decreases the largest rmse at a temporal resolution of 1 day is 1 88 10 4 m day while the smallest rmse is 5 8 10 5 m day at a temporal resolution of 32 days the nsesqrt criteria are more variable than the common nse depending on the temporal resolution nsesqrt increases from 0 12 to 0 88 as the resolution increases from 1 day to 32 days implying that low stream runoff is globally simulated the worst at the finest temporal resolution a comparison of the simulated and observed stream runoff values at varying temporal resolutions fig 4 confirms these results a large discrepancy is observed in the lowest stream runoff values smaller than 5 0 10 4 m day at fine temporal resolutions 1 day and 2 days regarding larger temporal resolutions greater than 8 days the discrepancy in the same range of stream runoff values is much smaller the mean uncertainty exhibits a strong decreasing trend at temporal resolutions between 1 day and 8 days but remains relatively constant at resolutions longer than 8 days the relative mean uncertainty was calculated for each estimated stream runoff as the quotient of the mean of the estimated values over the standard deviation of the estimated values then we derived the mean relative uncertainty corresponding to the mean of all relative uncertainty values during the simulation period the mean relative uncertainty decreases from 1 16 to 0 51 as the temporal resolution increases from 1 day to 32 days furthermore the relative uncertainty of low stream runoff seems to be greater than for that of the highest stream runoff as illustrated by the spread of the grey squares in fig 4 to quantify the visual interpretation of fig 4 the mean relative uncertainty was also calculated considering the following two classes of stream runoff values one class corresponding to stream runoff values smaller than the threshold of 5 10 4 m day i e low stream runoff and one class corresponding to stream runoff values larger than this threshold i e values considered representative of medium to high stream runoff at all temporal resolutions the mean relative uncertainty of the low stream runoff class is much greater than that for the medium high stream runoff class in both classes the mean relative uncertainty decreases as the temporal resolution increases the mean relative uncertainty of the low stream runoff class is 1 21 121 and 0 55 55 at temporal resolutions of 1 day and 32 days respectively regarding the high stream runoff values the mean relative uncertainty is 0 67 67 and 0 12 12 for temporal resolutions of 1 day and 32 days respectively the stream runoff was also estimated using the coefficient runoff method the best performance in the estimation was obtained with a runoff coefficient of 0 09 based on this value the nse ranged from 0 27 found at 1 day temporal resolution to 0 54 found at 24 days the variation in the nsesqrt with the temporal resolution followed the same pattern as that observed using the small reservoir method however the values obtained using the coefficient runoff method were lower than those obtained using of the small reservoir method ranging from 0 06 at the 1 day temporal resolution to 0 5 0 7 at temporal resolutions greater than 9 days the discrepancy between observations and simulations with the runoff coefficient method was found for the full range of values at all time steps fig 4 unlike the reservoir method the runoff coefficient method tended to overestimate the medium flow values ranging from 5 0 10 5 to 5 0 10 4 m day the reservoir method simulated also better than the coefficient runoff method the highest values larger than 5 0 10 4 m day 4 2 global sensitivity analysis regarding the lowest time resolution the st of the initial and final volumes are especially large with values exceeding 0 55 fig 5 the other factors namely bathymetric relations evaporation rainfall and percolation rates have very low to almost null st regarding the highest time resolution as illustrated by the plot at the temporal resolution of 32 days in fig 5 the percolation rate is the dominant factor in the estimation with st greater than 0 50 the bathymetric relation is a factor with a large st 0 3 for temporal resolution greater than 2 days this is even the dominant factor for resolutions between 4 and 23 days the evaporation and rainfall rates have very low st lower than 0 02 for all resolutions the variation shows a progressive decrease in the st for the initial and final water levels as the temporal resolution increases fig 6 this decrease is particularly sharp up to a temporal resolution of 10 days and then the decreasing trend is slow regarding the percolation the increase in st is sharp up to 10 days after which the rate of increase is slow notably the cumulative st of each of the six factors is lower than 1 1 at the temporal resolutions greater than 2 days thus the interactions between the factors are particularly weak at these temporal resolutions 5 discussion the relevance of using small reservoirs as stream gauges is analysed in this study the analysis is developed based on a specific case study of the kamech small reservoir which drains a 2 64 km2 catchment in northern tunisia nevertheless general rather than only site specific outputs can be drawn and emphasized based on the results 5 1 using small reservoirs to gauge stream runoff using small reservoirs as stream gauges leads to globally reliable estimations of stream runoff at each time step as illustrated by the estimation performance however the reliability must be nuanced according to the temporal resolution and stream runoff range the reliability increases as the temporal resolution increases as reflected by the variations in the mean errors and nash efficiencies with the resolution furthermore regarding the lowest temporal resolutions 1 8 days the highest stream runoff values are estimated better than the lowest values as indicated by the low nsesqrt fig 3 and the differences between the observed and estimated stream runoff values lower than 5 10 4 m day fig 4 two explanations can be offered for this phenomenon the first explanation is provided by the uncertainty analysis indeed we showed that the relative estimation uncertainty due to the uncertainties in the mass balance terms equation 2 is higher in low stream runoff than high stream runoff e g up to 116 at a 1 day temporal resolution the second reason is that the observed stream runoff is also affected by errors in the kamech catchment the stream runoff is derived from water level measurements performed in a channel at the outlet gauge station fig 1 low water levels a few millimetres in the kamech gauge station may be affected by errors furthermore water level measurements are performed with a pressure sensor whose error is absolute and not relative consequently the error in the water level measurement is higher at low water levels than high water levels as stream runoff is estimated more reliably in large stream runoff than small stream runoff using small reservoirs as stream gauges appears particularly relevant in arid and semi arid environments in environments such as the mediterranean excess infiltration overland flow hortonian flow is recognized as the main mechanism responsible for stream runoff ribolzi et al 2000 ribolzi et al 2007 ludwig et al 1999 the stream runoff in these environments is very intermittent furthermore storm flow usually constitutes the predominant fraction of stream runoff while the baseflow fraction is small and even null in some areas in the kamech catchment the baseflow was estimated to account for 11 to 28 of the total stream runoff depending on the year raclot et al 2010 accordingly our results show that the implementation of small reservoir water monitoring as a stream gauging network could be particularly suitable for this type of hydrological function encountered in arid and semi arid environments such as the mediterranean where the volume of stream runoff is mainly due to large storm events in contrast estimating stream runoff based on small reservoir monitoring during low flow periods is associated with relatively large uncertainties and errors and appears much less appropriate in the kamech catchment this situation is clearly illustrated by the low values of nsesqrt at the shortest temporal resolutions 8 days fig 3 interestingly the stream runoff was better estimated with the small reservoir method compared to a simpler method namely the runoff coefficient the runoff coefficient method which is a simple method used to estimate stream runoff appears to be particularly appropriate for arid and semi arid catchments where hortonian runoff is often the dominant process as in kamech catchment hingray et al 2014 therefore the difference in the performance criteria values between the two methods shows the added value that could be provided by the small reservoir method automatic devices such as those employed in the kamech catchment are valid methods for obtaining water level measurements to estimate stream runoff however in remote areas the financial cost of such devices and the maintenance needs and long term reliability of the equipment are real concerns crowdsourcing has been developing in recent years in hydrology to produce new data through the involvement of citizens lowry et al 2019 strobl et al 2020 as a part of the development of crowdsourcing in hydrology collaborative and community based approaches could be an efficient way to obtain reliable measurements while strengthening the relationships with the local populace in the kamech catchment for instance along with automatic measurements a villager performs daily manual measurements of pan evaporation rainfall and water levels in the reservoir 5 2 uncertainty in the stream runoff estimation the conditions that must be met to obtain reliable stream runoff estimations differ depending on the temporal resolution at short temporal resolutions the main uncertainty in stream runoff estimations is caused by uncertainty in the water level measurements decreasing the uncertainty in the estimated stream runoff could imply decreasing uncertainty in reservoir water level measurements in the present study the water level measurement error was fixed at 20 mm to incorporate equipment errors the error due to the pressure sensor as given by the manufacturer and errors arising from environmental conditions mainly due to small wind generated water waves reducing the error due to in situ sensors may be accomplished in the future by improving the measurement technology moreover the errors due to wind induced waves could be reduced by performing high frequency measurements once every minute or less to provide an estimate of the magnitude and filtering high frequency variations in water level measurements such filtering could be achieved by applying a moving average with a window of a few minutes at large temporal resolutions longer than 23 days in the present case the percolation estimation is the main source of uncertainty in many small reservoir water balance approaches percolation is often neglected mainly because it is difficult to estimate oblinger et al 2010 nevertheless we show that percolation estimations appear crucial for using small reservoirs as stream gauges at decadal or longer temporal resolutions regarding the percolation issue the kamech catchment is likely representative of many small reservoirs in arid and semi arid regions in dams built to enhance groundwater recharge the percolation rate indeed represents a major flux in the reservoir water dynamics as this enhancement is the aim of the reservoir in contrast the engineering of other reservoirs does not prevent unwanted percolation due to leaking dam walls or permeable reservoir beds to resolve this issue pragmatic approaches have been proposed and applied in previous studies to estimate the percolation under small reservoirs oblinger et al 2010 fowe et al 2015 the most straightforward method is to quantify percolation from the reservoir water balance on many non rainy days and non flowing days i e days when the runoff entering the reservoir is null or negligible and by considering the evaporation sharda et al 2006 under such conditions the percolation volume can be estimated as the reservoir volume decrease minus the evaporation volume a relation with these estimations and corresponding water levels can often be developed and employed to estimate the percolation rate as a function of the reservoir water level bathymetric relations l a and l v constitute a strong factor of uncertainty at all temporal resolutions and may even serve as the dominant factor at temporal resolutions ranging from 4 to 23 days bathymetric relations are involved in the estimation of nearly all terms in equation 2 used for the runoff estimation evaporation rainfall and percolation volumes are area dependent and thus dependent on the l a relations the estimation of the initial and final volumes is directly related to the l v relations in this study the relations were established based on an in situ topographic survey of the reservoir bed performing a topographic survey for several reservoirs would not be trivial and would be a major constraint in deploying the methods to many reservoirs in a region however the different avenues currently explored could at term overcome this constraint and provide information necessary for the estimation of the bathymetric relations the use of a geomorphic predictor such as that used by sobek et al 2014 to estimate lake water capacity and depth could be such an avenue developments in methodological procedures based on remote sensing and image analysis techniques at fine spatial resolutions represent another avenue satellite image analyses have been used to detect and estimate the water storage and surface area of small water bodies such as reservoirs mialhe et al 2008 eilander et al 2014 ogilvie et al 2018 the analysis of digital elevation models could be another avenue in a context of the increasing availability of fine spatial resolution dem as conducted by alcântara et al 2010 at a large reservoir integrating historical and shuttle radar topography mission srtm topographic data prior to the reservoir construction could allow the establishment of bathymetric relations in small recent reservoirs many studies investigating the hydrology and water balance of small reservoirs have focused on and emphasized the importance of direct evaporation from the reservoir water surface and the need to obtain reliable estimates of such flux as evaporation is a form of water loss knowing and preventing evaporation are indeed major concerns in the water management of small reservoirs however with the objective of estimating stream runoff estimating evaporation is less crucial because it is far from a major source of uncertainty hence the weight assigned to the percolation rate in the water dynamics and water balance of the kamech reservoir in relation with water levels or bathymetric relations can justify the small sensitivity of the stream runoff estimation to the evaporation estimation uncertainty 6 conclusion we analysed the relevance of using small reservoirs to gauge stream runoff the estimations of high stream runoff are more reliable than those of low stream runoff and the performance of estimation improves as the temporal resolution increases from 1 to 32 days using a small reservoir to gauge stream runoff appears appropriate for arid and semi arid environments in which stream runoff mainly comprises high magnitudes of infrequent storm runoff due to excess infiltration runoff in addition the uncertainty factors change depending on the temporal resolution the main source of uncertainty is the reservoir water level at the shortest temporal resolutions while at the longest temporal resolutions the uncertainty in the percolation rate is the major source of uncertainty in the stream runoff estimation the l a and l v relations constitute a major factor of uncertainty at temporal resolutions greater than 1 day therefore using reservoirs to gauge stream runoff requires determining these relations which currently appears to be a strong constraint in the perspective of deploying this method over a large area with a large number of reservoirs recent and on going developments in procedures based on remote sensing and image analysis techniques could help liminate this constraint an obvious limitation of this study is that it is based on only one catchment the same analysis could be conducted in other catchments with a wealth of data comparable to that of the kamech catchment at least using small reservoirs to gauge stream runoff requires water level rain and evaporation measurements acquiring such measurements can be a real challenge especially in remote areas due to financial costs and the maintenance and long term reliability of monitoring infrastructures crowdsourcing by local villagers of these hydrological data could be a way to address this challenge and to involve the public in water resource evaluations credit

3852,understanding stream runoff generation processes requires distributed stream runoff estimates however the acquisition of such estimates remains challenging in hydrology especially in remote areas in regions with a high spatial density of small reservoirs those reservoirs could be employed to gauge stream runoff liebe et al 2009 using a water balance approach the stream runoff flowing into a reservoir from a drainage catchment could be estimated accordingly this work aims to address the following two questions i what is the error in the estimated stream runoff and ii what are the main estimation uncertainty factors based on a case study of the kamech catchment tunisia stream runoff was estimated at different temporal resolutions 1 32 days and a global sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate the contributions of the reservoir water balance terms evaporation rainfall percolation reservoir water level and level area volume relations to the estimated stream runoff uncertainty the results reveal that stream runoff can be reliably estimated based on small reservoirs using a mass balance approach the error and global stream runoff estimation uncertainties decrease as the temporal resolution increases the bathymetric relationships level area and level volume relations constitute a strong factor of uncertainty for all temporal resolutions and even the dominant factor for temporal resolutions ranging from 4 to 23 days the estimation uncertainty for the shortest temporal resolutions 1 8 days mainly originates from reservoir level uncertainty as the temporal resolution increases the contribution of percolation uncertainty increases the general not site specific conclusions of this study are that stream runoff gauging based on small reservoirs requires the determination of the bathymetric relations and that small reservoirs could be used as reliable stream runoff gauges at short temporal resolutions if the reservoir level is measured with limited uncertainty and at long temporal resolutions as long as the percolation rate from the reservoir is known with limited uncertainty keywords gauging stream runoff reservoir water balance uncertainty global sensitivity analysis 1 introduction stream runoff time series constitute basic and critical data in hydrology that are needed to better understand the mechanisms underlying the variability and generation of stream runoff and are essential for quantifying the status of water resources and planning and implementing management operations stream runoff data are important for hydrological modelling performed for both scientific and operational objectives these time series are also necessary for understanding the biogeochemical cycles and ecological functioning of streams however acquiring either local at a point or spatially distributed stream runoff time series data remains a real challenge in hydrology this challenge is particularly acute in remote areas such areas in arid and semi arid environments small reservoirs have been erected in arid and semi arid locales for supplying water often for agriculture and preventing downstream flooding despite the lack of a formal definition a small reservoir is commonly characterised by a storage capacity smaller than 1 mm3 habets et al 2018 a small reservoir often consists of a small dam built across a valley to intercept and store stream runoff for decades small reservoirs have been increasingly constructed in many countries consequently in some catchments such as those in australia schreider et al 2002 nathan and lowe 2012 and in south africa hughes mantel 2010 the density can exceed 1 reservoir km2 the idea to use small reservoirs as stream gauges has already been examined albergel rejeb 1997 mekki et al 2006 liebe et al 2009 liebe et al 2009 used a simple hydrological model coupled with the remote monitoring of a small reservoir to simulate daily stream runoff time series for a catchment in ghana furthermore using the water balance approach the water levels in small reservoirs have been continuously monitored to estimate stream runoff for instance in tunisia by albergel and rejeb 1997 and mekki et al 2006 the technological development of automatic water level sensors and remote data transmission and the development of community based approaches starkey et al 2017 could enhance the availability of data for the evaluation of the water balance and thus improve the use of small reservoirs as stream runoff gauges the objective of this study is to examine the relevance of regarding small reservoirs as stream gauges based on the water balance approach this study relies on the kamech catchment tunisia which is a research catchment draining into a small reservoir we followed a two step approach in the first step the stream runoff was estimated at different temporal resolutions based on the reservoir water balance then the estimated time series data were compared with stream runoff measurements obtained from a classic stream gauge station to evaluate the adding value of the reservoir method we also estimated as a comparison stream runoff based on a more straightforward method used in engineering hydrology which is the runoff coefficient in the second step a global sensitivity analysis was performed to identify and quantify the main sources of uncertainty in the stream runoff estimated using the reservoir water balance approach based on these results the feasibility of considering small reservoirs as stream gauges is discussed 2 study catchment and data the kamech catchment is a small catchment 2 63 km2 located in northern tunisia the kamech catchment is one of the two catchments in france and tunisia of the observatory omere an acronym for mediterranean observatory of rural environment and water or observatoire méditerranéen de l environnement rural et de l eau in french molénat et al 2018 the catchment also belongs to the french network of critical zone observatories called ozcar gaillardet et al 2018 the catchment characteristics equipment and monitoring are extensively described in molénat et al 2018 climatically the region is semi arid to sub humid and the 25 year mean annual rainfall and reference evaporation are 645 mm and 1366 mm respectively in 1992 a dam was built across the wadi at the catchment outlet to prevent siltation in a large downstream dam the reservoir has a capacity of 135 000 m3 fig 1 the reservoir intercepts runoff from the wadi and lateral surface runoff along its banks the water within the reservoir may be withdrawn for irrigation in spring and summer and water can also be released when the reservoir reaches its capacity to ensure the safety of the dam s infrastructure in the present study we chose the water year 2011 2012 during which releases and withdrawals were either null or negligible hereafter we present the available data and give an estimate of the relative or absolute errors in each measurement as these errors are particularly important for the global sensitivity analysis performed in this work rainfall in the catchment is measured using a tipping bucket gauge located on the dam in this work the hourly mean rainfall rate is used the relative error in a rainfall measurement acquired by a tipping bucket depends on many factors such as the rainfall intensity and volumes of the compartments within the bucket consequently the relative errors vary considerably in the literature habib et al 2001 wang et al 2008 in this work we assumed a relative error of 20 in the rainfall measurements corresponding to the highest values of an hourly time step reported in previous studies wang et al 2008 pan evaporation is measured daily using a pan located on a bank of the reservoir near the dam the hourly evaporation rate was derived from daily records considering a sinusoidal hourly variation each day evaporation from the reservoir water free surface efs in the reservoir was derived from pan evaporation epan considering a pan coefficient k of 0 65 bouteffeha et al 2015 according to efs k epan in general the k factor can vary across reservoirs and within a given reservoir over time regarding lake or reservoir evaporation k is generally found to be lower than 1 0 with wide variations ranging from 0 5 to 1 2 e g fu et al 2004 martínez alvarez et al 2007 in this work we considered both the error associated with pan evaporation measurements epan and the error associated with the determination of the pan coefficient k by applying a logarithmic transform of the latter relation and then deriving we can deduce that defs efs dk k depan epan where defs dk and depan are the derivatives of efs k and epan respectively that are assimilated in the absolute error thus the relative error in efs defs efs is the sum of the relative errors in epan and k following winter 1981 the relative errors in the pan evaporation and pan coefficient estimation were considered to be 20 and 10 respectively yielding to a relative error of 30 in the reservoir water evaporation estimation the reservoir water level is measured every 5 min by a continuous pressure probe compensating for atmospheric pressure fluctuations the absolute error in the water level measurement was estimated at 20 mm independent of the level this error includes the error due to the sensor considered as independent of the level according to the manufacturer and the error resulting from wind induced variations which was considered empirically at approximately 15 mm and independent of the level the reservoir water volume can be derived from the relations between the water volume and level and between the water area and level hereafter named the level volume l v and level area l a relations respectively these relations were determined based on a bathymetric survey performed in august 2008 the bathymetric survey produced bipoints of li vi and li ai the relations l v and a v were fitted on the bi points as v alb and a cld error in the relations are derived from different sources as follows data source error derived from the topographic survey of the reservoir bed elevation error in measurement sampling interval and dem building and error in the volume and area calculations for each bi point i e li vi or li ai we considered that the volume vi or area ai was estimated with a relative error of 20 the percolation from the reservoir was estimated according to bouteffeha et al 2015 who estimated the percolation rates at some reservoir water levels a linear regression was performed allowing us to estimate the percolation rate at each reservoir water level thus the relation between the percolation rate and water level hereafter named the percolation relation was based on different data than those used in the present study to estimate stream runoff the error in the percolation estimation was fixed from the 99 confidence interval in a linear regression the confidence interval depends on the value of the regressor and is not theoretically constant in our case the errors in the percolation rates within the range of reservoir water levels varied between 2 18 and 2 19 mm day consequently the error in the percolation rate estimation was assumed to be constant at 2 185 mm day in the kamech catchment the wadi runoff is monitored with a gauging station located upstream of the reservoir mouth wadi station in fig 1 the station is located sufficiently upstream of the reservoir mouth to avoid or minimize backwater effects fig 1 the station is equipped with a u shaped concrete flume the water level in the flume is measured once per minute by a pressure transducer sensor and recorded in a data logger then a stage discharge relationship is used to estimate stream runoff based on the water level a set of ten stage discharge values was used to establish the stage discharge relationship for every stage discharge value the discharge was estimated by the velocity area method velocity in the wet section was measured with a velocimeter every 2 cm of depth and at lateral intervals proportional to water level hourly runoff averages were used in this work and the total runoff entering the reservoir was calculated as the area scaled specific runoff measured in the wadi 3 estimated stream runoff and associated error and uncertainty 3 1 estimation of stream runoff the small reservoir considered here captures the stream runoff draining from an upstream catchment fig 2 hence the temporal variations in the reservoir water volume depend on the upstream stream runoff and other inflows rainfall directly impacting the surface water and outflows evaporation from the surface water and seepage through the reservoir bed and dam here water abstraction is assumed to be null or negligible the variation in the reservoir water volume at a temporal resolution of δt t can be expressed based on the water balance as follows 1 δ v δ t q a c e r s p where δv is the variation in the reservoir water volume l3 over the given time step δt q is the catchment specific runoff l t flowing into the reservoir over the given time step e is the evaporation flux l3 t from the reservoir surface water over the given time step r is the mean rainfall flux l3 t at the reservoir surface water over the given time step sp is the mean percolation flux l3 t from the reservoir water surface as infiltration occurs through the reservoir bottom or wall dams and ac is the catchment area l2 drained by the reservoir from equation 1 the specific stream runoff over a given time step δti is estimated as 2 q i est 1 a c v i fin v i ini δ t i r i e i s p i where vi fin l3 and vi ini l3 are the final and initial water volumes in the reservoir respectively at the end and the beginning of the given time step and qest i ei ri and spi are the estimated specific stream runoff l t rainfall flux l3 t evaporation flux l3 t and percolation flux l3 t respectively over the given time step δti the percolation was calculated based on a linear regression of the reservoir water level and percolation rate at each time step of a given temporal resolution the evaporation rainfall and percolation fluxes were estimated as the product of the water surface area of the reservoir and the cumulative evaporation rainfall and percolation respectively over the time step the surface area and volume of water in the reservoir were calculated based on the water level measurements and the l a and l v relations respectively the average surface area over a given time step was considered to be the mean of the initial and final surface areas of the time step the specific stream runoff in one hydrologic year ranging from 01 september 2010 to 31 august 2011 was calculated the stream runoff times series were calculated for 32 temporal resolutions δt ranging from 1 day to 32 days with a one day increment the length of the stream runoff time series ranged from 365 steps at the 1 day resolution to 11 steps at the 32 days resolution the interest of using the small reservoir method to estimate stream runoff was analysed based both on performance criteria of estimation see the following section and on a comparison with a simple method the runoff coefficient method was used as the simple method since it is particularly relevant to hortonian runoff catchments such as kamech catchment hingray et al 2014 according to this method the stream runoff is estimated at a constant fraction of the rainfall we explored the values of runoff coefficient ranging from 0 01 to 0 5 for every value and at every time resolution 1 to 32 days the nash and sutcliffe efficiency was calculated from the observed and estimated stream runoff we retained the value of 0 09 as runoff coefficient which provided the highest efficiency mean calculated from the efficiencies of all the time resolutions 3 2 estimation error uncertainty and performance the following two types of uncertainty sources were considered in the analysis of uncertainty in the stream runoff estimation based on equation 2 the measurement uncertainty and the derived data uncertainty mcmillan et al 2018 the measurement uncertainty was associated with errors in the direct and local measurements of the pan evaporation rainfall rate by rain gauging and reservoir water level by a pressure sensor the derived data uncertainty in the reservoir water volume and area the evaporation flux and the percolation flux was considered the derived data uncertainty in the water volume and area vi and ai in equation 2 was assumed to result from the uncertainty in the l v and l a relations the uncertainty in the percolation rate spi in equation 2 was assumed to mainly originate from the uncertainty in the percolation relation at least the derived data uncertainty associated with the evaporation flux ei in equation 2 was assumed to originate from the uncertainty in the pan coefficient each uncertainty was assumed to vary from time step to time step when applying equation 2 as a consequence of the measurement uncertainty and the derived data uncertainty each variable in equation 2 was considered a random variable characterised by a probability density function pdf the range of values defined by the pdf of a given term corresponds to the range of possible values due to the errors potentially occurring in the estimation of that term the stream runoff at each δti was also considered a random variable with possible values therefore for each time step δti during a given simulation period e g a water year we defined the following qest i a possible value of the stream runoff during δti q i est the estimated stream runoff during δti as the mean of all possible values and uqi the uncertainty in the estimated stream runoff at δti where the true value qi is in the interval q i est u qi q i est u qi with a certain level of confidence with the 99 level of confidence we chose the uncertainty is equal to 3 0 σqi n where σqi is the standard deviation of n possible values the error in the estimation εqi was considered the difference between the mean estimated stream runoff q i est and the unknown true stream runoff qcatch i then the mean error me and the mean uncertainty mu of the catchment stream runoff over the given simulation period are the averages of the errors εqi and uncertainties uqi respectively where i ranges from 1 to n with n being the total time step considered during the given period the nash sutcliffe efficiency was calculated as the estimation performance criterion considering the stream runoff nse and the square root of the stream runoff nsesqrt the motivation to consider the square root transform is to reduce the weights of the high stream runoff values in the analysis of the stream runoff estimates 3 3 global sensitivity analysis a global sensitivity analysis gsa was performed based on sobol s method which is a variance based method sobol 2001 the output of a model with a discrete time step can be expressed as follows 3 y f x θ where y is the output variable of the model x is the input variable and θ is the parameter set the variables y and x and the parameter θ can be scalar or vectors sobol s method evaluates the variance of y caused by changes in the input x and the parameter set θ therefore both the input variables and the parameters can be factors in the sensitivity analysis typically the direct model output y is replaced by a model performance measure of the stream runoff prediction tang et al 2007 thus a sensitivity analysis applies a measure of the error between the observed and simulated values in the present work the root mean square error rmse between the observed and estimated stream runoff was chosen as the performance measure considering y a random variable described by a pdf y the total variance of y can be decomposed as follows 4 v a r y i p va r i i j 1 p va r ij i j k 1 p va r ijk v a r 1 2 p where var y is the total variance of the output variable y due to p factors p is the number of factors and vari is the variance attributable to the principal effect of factor i while the factors are the input variables x and or parameters θ and the other terms corresponding to the fraction of the total variance attributable to the interaction effects between the factors the interaction reflects how the factors intensify cancel or compensate for the effects of the other factors in the model outputs razavi and gupta 2015 based on the variance decomposition of y the following two indices are defined 5 s i va r i v a r y and 6 s ti 1 va r i v a r y where si and sti are the first order sobol index and total sobol index respectively and var i is the variance attributable to all factors except for i the gsa aims to study the sensitivity of the model simulation to various factors in contrast to the usual gsa where the model parameters are the factors e g tang et al 2007 in our study the factors are the variables used in equation 2 to simulate stream runoff actually each variable used in equation 2 corresponds to a vector i e a time series therefore the sobol indices were calculated from a large number of simulations of stream runoff time series and each simulation was performed with a sampled time series of each variable in equation 2 in practice considering a given temporal resolution δt a large number of sampled time series of the initial water level at the beginning of each time step the final water level at the end of each time step the rain the evaporation and the percolation were generated furthermore for each simulated time series of stream runoff we considered a possible l a relation and a possible l v relation see the following section ultimately the following six factors were considered in the gsa i initial water level ii final water level iii rain iv evaporation v percolation and vi bathymetric relations l a and l v relations 3 4 implementation of estimations for each temporal resolution δt we estimated n 10 000 possible time series of stream runoff as a result we obtained n estimations of the stream runoff qest i for each given time step δti each possible time series of runoff was obtained with all possible time series of all terms on the right side of equation 2 to generate a possible time series for each term on the right side we proceeded as follows for each variable or derived variable used in equation 2 and associated with uncertainty a possible value at each time step was drawn from a pdf we assigned a pdf to each variable associated with measurement uncertainty and derived data uncertainty a given pdf characterised by a mean and a standard deviation was considered at each time step for each term following previous studies horner et al 2018 the error associated with water level measurement was assumed to follow a gaussian distribution the mean was considered the measured value and the standard deviation was fixed at the absolute error in the measurement the percolation rate was also assumed to follow a gaussian distribution with a mean equal to the value derived from the percolation relation and a standard deviation corresponding to the prediction error at the 99 confidence interval in the linear regression used as the percolation relation regarding the other terms rainfall and evaporation due to lack of real distribution or tangible evidence of the shape of the pdf we chose a uniform distribution this choice leads to maximizing the uncertainty compared to that of other distributions at each time step the mean was considered the measured value and the standard deviation was derived from the relative error associated with the rainfall measurement and evaporation estimation the relative errors were fixed at 20 for rainfall and 30 for the evaporation rate see section 1 to estimate n possible time series of stream runoff n possible l v and l a relations were also established randomly by considering the uncertainty in these relations to establish each possible relation we considered that each vi and ai measurement used to fit the l v and l a relations is characterised by a specific uniform pdf with a mean corresponding to the measured value and a standard deviation derived from the standard error in the measurement section 1 to estimate each possible time series of stream runoff we first randomly drew each vi and ai and then fitted the possible l v and l a relation to the generated li vi and li ai bipoints then the estimated stream runoff at a given time step was calculated as the mean of all 10 000 simulated possible values the uncertainty in the estimated stream runoff was calculated based on the standard deviation of the 10 000 simulated possible values then the error in the simulated stream runoff at a given time step corresponded to the absolute difference between the observed value and the simulated mean value in each temporal resolution the mean error and mean uncertainty were calculated corresponding to the means of the errors and uncertainties respectively of each simulated stream runoff in the time series the nash sutcliffe efficiency metrics nse and nsesqrt were also calculated based on the observed values and simulated mean values 4 results 4 1 error and total uncertainty considering the simulation performance stream runoff is fairly well estimated based on the water balance approach regardless of the temporal resolution considered fig 3 the nash sutcliffe criteria are greater than 0 87 at all temporal resolutions and greater than 0 91 at δt 27 days the rmse decreases as the temporal resolution increases up to 6 days and then the rmse slightly decreases the largest rmse at a temporal resolution of 1 day is 1 88 10 4 m day while the smallest rmse is 5 8 10 5 m day at a temporal resolution of 32 days the nsesqrt criteria are more variable than the common nse depending on the temporal resolution nsesqrt increases from 0 12 to 0 88 as the resolution increases from 1 day to 32 days implying that low stream runoff is globally simulated the worst at the finest temporal resolution a comparison of the simulated and observed stream runoff values at varying temporal resolutions fig 4 confirms these results a large discrepancy is observed in the lowest stream runoff values smaller than 5 0 10 4 m day at fine temporal resolutions 1 day and 2 days regarding larger temporal resolutions greater than 8 days the discrepancy in the same range of stream runoff values is much smaller the mean uncertainty exhibits a strong decreasing trend at temporal resolutions between 1 day and 8 days but remains relatively constant at resolutions longer than 8 days the relative mean uncertainty was calculated for each estimated stream runoff as the quotient of the mean of the estimated values over the standard deviation of the estimated values then we derived the mean relative uncertainty corresponding to the mean of all relative uncertainty values during the simulation period the mean relative uncertainty decreases from 1 16 to 0 51 as the temporal resolution increases from 1 day to 32 days furthermore the relative uncertainty of low stream runoff seems to be greater than for that of the highest stream runoff as illustrated by the spread of the grey squares in fig 4 to quantify the visual interpretation of fig 4 the mean relative uncertainty was also calculated considering the following two classes of stream runoff values one class corresponding to stream runoff values smaller than the threshold of 5 10 4 m day i e low stream runoff and one class corresponding to stream runoff values larger than this threshold i e values considered representative of medium to high stream runoff at all temporal resolutions the mean relative uncertainty of the low stream runoff class is much greater than that for the medium high stream runoff class in both classes the mean relative uncertainty decreases as the temporal resolution increases the mean relative uncertainty of the low stream runoff class is 1 21 121 and 0 55 55 at temporal resolutions of 1 day and 32 days respectively regarding the high stream runoff values the mean relative uncertainty is 0 67 67 and 0 12 12 for temporal resolutions of 1 day and 32 days respectively the stream runoff was also estimated using the coefficient runoff method the best performance in the estimation was obtained with a runoff coefficient of 0 09 based on this value the nse ranged from 0 27 found at 1 day temporal resolution to 0 54 found at 24 days the variation in the nsesqrt with the temporal resolution followed the same pattern as that observed using the small reservoir method however the values obtained using the coefficient runoff method were lower than those obtained using of the small reservoir method ranging from 0 06 at the 1 day temporal resolution to 0 5 0 7 at temporal resolutions greater than 9 days the discrepancy between observations and simulations with the runoff coefficient method was found for the full range of values at all time steps fig 4 unlike the reservoir method the runoff coefficient method tended to overestimate the medium flow values ranging from 5 0 10 5 to 5 0 10 4 m day the reservoir method simulated also better than the coefficient runoff method the highest values larger than 5 0 10 4 m day 4 2 global sensitivity analysis regarding the lowest time resolution the st of the initial and final volumes are especially large with values exceeding 0 55 fig 5 the other factors namely bathymetric relations evaporation rainfall and percolation rates have very low to almost null st regarding the highest time resolution as illustrated by the plot at the temporal resolution of 32 days in fig 5 the percolation rate is the dominant factor in the estimation with st greater than 0 50 the bathymetric relation is a factor with a large st 0 3 for temporal resolution greater than 2 days this is even the dominant factor for resolutions between 4 and 23 days the evaporation and rainfall rates have very low st lower than 0 02 for all resolutions the variation shows a progressive decrease in the st for the initial and final water levels as the temporal resolution increases fig 6 this decrease is particularly sharp up to a temporal resolution of 10 days and then the decreasing trend is slow regarding the percolation the increase in st is sharp up to 10 days after which the rate of increase is slow notably the cumulative st of each of the six factors is lower than 1 1 at the temporal resolutions greater than 2 days thus the interactions between the factors are particularly weak at these temporal resolutions 5 discussion the relevance of using small reservoirs as stream gauges is analysed in this study the analysis is developed based on a specific case study of the kamech small reservoir which drains a 2 64 km2 catchment in northern tunisia nevertheless general rather than only site specific outputs can be drawn and emphasized based on the results 5 1 using small reservoirs to gauge stream runoff using small reservoirs as stream gauges leads to globally reliable estimations of stream runoff at each time step as illustrated by the estimation performance however the reliability must be nuanced according to the temporal resolution and stream runoff range the reliability increases as the temporal resolution increases as reflected by the variations in the mean errors and nash efficiencies with the resolution furthermore regarding the lowest temporal resolutions 1 8 days the highest stream runoff values are estimated better than the lowest values as indicated by the low nsesqrt fig 3 and the differences between the observed and estimated stream runoff values lower than 5 10 4 m day fig 4 two explanations can be offered for this phenomenon the first explanation is provided by the uncertainty analysis indeed we showed that the relative estimation uncertainty due to the uncertainties in the mass balance terms equation 2 is higher in low stream runoff than high stream runoff e g up to 116 at a 1 day temporal resolution the second reason is that the observed stream runoff is also affected by errors in the kamech catchment the stream runoff is derived from water level measurements performed in a channel at the outlet gauge station fig 1 low water levels a few millimetres in the kamech gauge station may be affected by errors furthermore water level measurements are performed with a pressure sensor whose error is absolute and not relative consequently the error in the water level measurement is higher at low water levels than high water levels as stream runoff is estimated more reliably in large stream runoff than small stream runoff using small reservoirs as stream gauges appears particularly relevant in arid and semi arid environments in environments such as the mediterranean excess infiltration overland flow hortonian flow is recognized as the main mechanism responsible for stream runoff ribolzi et al 2000 ribolzi et al 2007 ludwig et al 1999 the stream runoff in these environments is very intermittent furthermore storm flow usually constitutes the predominant fraction of stream runoff while the baseflow fraction is small and even null in some areas in the kamech catchment the baseflow was estimated to account for 11 to 28 of the total stream runoff depending on the year raclot et al 2010 accordingly our results show that the implementation of small reservoir water monitoring as a stream gauging network could be particularly suitable for this type of hydrological function encountered in arid and semi arid environments such as the mediterranean where the volume of stream runoff is mainly due to large storm events in contrast estimating stream runoff based on small reservoir monitoring during low flow periods is associated with relatively large uncertainties and errors and appears much less appropriate in the kamech catchment this situation is clearly illustrated by the low values of nsesqrt at the shortest temporal resolutions 8 days fig 3 interestingly the stream runoff was better estimated with the small reservoir method compared to a simpler method namely the runoff coefficient the runoff coefficient method which is a simple method used to estimate stream runoff appears to be particularly appropriate for arid and semi arid catchments where hortonian runoff is often the dominant process as in kamech catchment hingray et al 2014 therefore the difference in the performance criteria values between the two methods shows the added value that could be provided by the small reservoir method automatic devices such as those employed in the kamech catchment are valid methods for obtaining water level measurements to estimate stream runoff however in remote areas the financial cost of such devices and the maintenance needs and long term reliability of the equipment are real concerns crowdsourcing has been developing in recent years in hydrology to produce new data through the involvement of citizens lowry et al 2019 strobl et al 2020 as a part of the development of crowdsourcing in hydrology collaborative and community based approaches could be an efficient way to obtain reliable measurements while strengthening the relationships with the local populace in the kamech catchment for instance along with automatic measurements a villager performs daily manual measurements of pan evaporation rainfall and water levels in the reservoir 5 2 uncertainty in the stream runoff estimation the conditions that must be met to obtain reliable stream runoff estimations differ depending on the temporal resolution at short temporal resolutions the main uncertainty in stream runoff estimations is caused by uncertainty in the water level measurements decreasing the uncertainty in the estimated stream runoff could imply decreasing uncertainty in reservoir water level measurements in the present study the water level measurement error was fixed at 20 mm to incorporate equipment errors the error due to the pressure sensor as given by the manufacturer and errors arising from environmental conditions mainly due to small wind generated water waves reducing the error due to in situ sensors may be accomplished in the future by improving the measurement technology moreover the errors due to wind induced waves could be reduced by performing high frequency measurements once every minute or less to provide an estimate of the magnitude and filtering high frequency variations in water level measurements such filtering could be achieved by applying a moving average with a window of a few minutes at large temporal resolutions longer than 23 days in the present case the percolation estimation is the main source of uncertainty in many small reservoir water balance approaches percolation is often neglected mainly because it is difficult to estimate oblinger et al 2010 nevertheless we show that percolation estimations appear crucial for using small reservoirs as stream gauges at decadal or longer temporal resolutions regarding the percolation issue the kamech catchment is likely representative of many small reservoirs in arid and semi arid regions in dams built to enhance groundwater recharge the percolation rate indeed represents a major flux in the reservoir water dynamics as this enhancement is the aim of the reservoir in contrast the engineering of other reservoirs does not prevent unwanted percolation due to leaking dam walls or permeable reservoir beds to resolve this issue pragmatic approaches have been proposed and applied in previous studies to estimate the percolation under small reservoirs oblinger et al 2010 fowe et al 2015 the most straightforward method is to quantify percolation from the reservoir water balance on many non rainy days and non flowing days i e days when the runoff entering the reservoir is null or negligible and by considering the evaporation sharda et al 2006 under such conditions the percolation volume can be estimated as the reservoir volume decrease minus the evaporation volume a relation with these estimations and corresponding water levels can often be developed and employed to estimate the percolation rate as a function of the reservoir water level bathymetric relations l a and l v constitute a strong factor of uncertainty at all temporal resolutions and may even serve as the dominant factor at temporal resolutions ranging from 4 to 23 days bathymetric relations are involved in the estimation of nearly all terms in equation 2 used for the runoff estimation evaporation rainfall and percolation volumes are area dependent and thus dependent on the l a relations the estimation of the initial and final volumes is directly related to the l v relations in this study the relations were established based on an in situ topographic survey of the reservoir bed performing a topographic survey for several reservoirs would not be trivial and would be a major constraint in deploying the methods to many reservoirs in a region however the different avenues currently explored could at term overcome this constraint and provide information necessary for the estimation of the bathymetric relations the use of a geomorphic predictor such as that used by sobek et al 2014 to estimate lake water capacity and depth could be such an avenue developments in methodological procedures based on remote sensing and image analysis techniques at fine spatial resolutions represent another avenue satellite image analyses have been used to detect and estimate the water storage and surface area of small water bodies such as reservoirs mialhe et al 2008 eilander et al 2014 ogilvie et al 2018 the analysis of digital elevation models could be another avenue in a context of the increasing availability of fine spatial resolution dem as conducted by alcântara et al 2010 at a large reservoir integrating historical and shuttle radar topography mission srtm topographic data prior to the reservoir construction could allow the establishment of bathymetric relations in small recent reservoirs many studies investigating the hydrology and water balance of small reservoirs have focused on and emphasized the importance of direct evaporation from the reservoir water surface and the need to obtain reliable estimates of such flux as evaporation is a form of water loss knowing and preventing evaporation are indeed major concerns in the water management of small reservoirs however with the objective of estimating stream runoff estimating evaporation is less crucial because it is far from a major source of uncertainty hence the weight assigned to the percolation rate in the water dynamics and water balance of the kamech reservoir in relation with water levels or bathymetric relations can justify the small sensitivity of the stream runoff estimation to the evaporation estimation uncertainty 6 conclusion we analysed the relevance of using small reservoirs to gauge stream runoff the estimations of high stream runoff are more reliable than those of low stream runoff and the performance of estimation improves as the temporal resolution increases from 1 to 32 days using a small reservoir to gauge stream runoff appears appropriate for arid and semi arid environments in which stream runoff mainly comprises high magnitudes of infrequent storm runoff due to excess infiltration runoff in addition the uncertainty factors change depending on the temporal resolution the main source of uncertainty is the reservoir water level at the shortest temporal resolutions while at the longest temporal resolutions the uncertainty in the percolation rate is the major source of uncertainty in the stream runoff estimation the l a and l v relations constitute a major factor of uncertainty at temporal resolutions greater than 1 day therefore using reservoirs to gauge stream runoff requires determining these relations which currently appears to be a strong constraint in the perspective of deploying this method over a large area with a large number of reservoirs recent and on going developments in procedures based on remote sensing and image analysis techniques could help liminate this constraint an obvious limitation of this study is that it is based on only one catchment the same analysis could be conducted in other catchments with a wealth of data comparable to that of the kamech catchment at least using small reservoirs to gauge stream runoff requires water level rain and evaporation measurements acquiring such measurements can be a real challenge especially in remote areas due to financial costs and the maintenance and long term reliability of monitoring infrastructures crowdsourcing by local villagers of these hydrological data could be a way to address this challenge and to involve the public in water resource evaluations credit

3853,the frequent use of light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls in cold regions creates serious risks of soil and groundwater contamination however the subsurface remobilization behaviors of lnapl in freezing and thawing unsaturated porous media are not well understood the light transmission visualization ltv technique which be previously used in two phase system water air or water napl is modified to quantify lnapl in three water air lnapl or four phase water ice air lnapl systems during freezing and thawing the pattern of lnapl remobilization was observed in a two dimensional flow chamber filled with unsaturated porous media subject to freeze thaw cycles ftcs using the modified ltv technique it is shown that lnapl remobilization mainly occurs in the direction of the freezing front and horizontal with the number of ftcs meanwhile lnapl in the area below the freezing front is promoted to remigrate downward during freezing and the opposite direction during thawing the analysis suggests that lnapl remobilization is caused by a combination of freezing induced pressure and changes in capillary pressure controlled by water migration rather than through microcracks in the frozen porous media the proposed modified ltv technique shows great promise for investigating lnapl transport and distribution in freezing unfreezing unsaturated porous media that is non destructive the study offers a scientific basis for the prediction of the subsurface behavior of lnapl at contaminated sites in widely distributed cold regions keywords modified light transmission visualization flow chamber porous media freeze thaw cycles lnapl remobilization 1 introduction subsurface contamination by light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls due to the exploitation refining storage and transportation of petroleum is a significant problem worldwide li et al 2018 sheng et al 2018 tsai et al 2020 in recent decades in cold regions where the soils and groundwater undergo diurnal or seasonal freeze thaw cycles ftcs depending on the temperature gradient lundberg et al 2016 the subsurface behavior of petroleum pollutants in ice containing soils with a dynamic four phase system water ice air lnapl has received an increased amount of attention singh and niven 2013 zhao et al 2014 wagner et al 2019 potapowicz et al 2019 ji et al 2019 muir and galarneau 2021 li et al 2021 understanding the subsurface fate and behavior of lnapl in frozen soil is of great significance for assessing and protecting the soil and groundwater environments in cold regions several studies have focused on the behavior of spilled fuel in permafrost environments studies have determined that permafrost might not be an effective barrier to migration of lnapl biggar et al 1998 chuvilin et al 2001a mccarthy et al 2004 and that the infiltration of lnapls into frozen soils is controlled by ice saturation or initial soil moisture content in soil and soil type barnes and filler 2003 barnes and wolfe 2008 chuvilin et al 2001a wiggert et al 1997 some laboratory tests quantified the effect of ftcs on the physico mechanical properties of soil chen et al 2019 roman and zhang 2010 and the relative permeability of lnapls in frozen soil with different ice saturations mccauley et al 2002 wiggert et al 1997 lnapls in frozen soil are transported mainly through soil pores that are not saturated with ice by unfrozen water films on the surface of mineral particles and ice at temperatures below 0 c because of the presence of a pressure gradient in the soil biggar et al 1998 or micro cracks in ice saturated soils chuvilin et al 1999 chuvilin and miklyaeva 2003 in recent years however laboratory studies found that lnapls could be remobilized in the active layer of seasonally frozen soil and permafrost regions undergoing ftcs which may result in further downward infiltration of lnapls a laboratory phenomenon called cryogenic expulsion observed increasing lnapl content at the leading edge of a freezing front with the number of ftcs whether in saturated or unsaturated porous media barnes and chuvilin 2009 iwakun et al 2010 biggar and neufeld 1996 observed that after several top down ftcs on the soil column diesel fuel gradually migrated downward to uncontaminated soil they speculated that diesel fuel may have migrated down through micro fissures created by freezing as micro fissures were observed in the ice formed inside the freezing cell under prolonged freezing such micro fissures formed by freezing have been observed in two dimensional glass bead cells by iwakun et al 2010 a similar remigration phenomenon was observed for different types of soils sand silt and clay by chuvilin et al 2001a and chuvilin et al 2001b they suggested that the cause of this phenomenon is that frozen ice in soil displaces oil from the pores to the freezing front however for silt or clay they believe that advances in dissolved phase petroleum hydrocarbons phcs are most likely the main cause of oil migration downward barnes et al 2004 illustrated the mechanism responsible for the increased phc concentration at the freezing front using a mass balance model the increase in the concentration of phcs at the freezing front is attributed to the exclusion of more mobile components from phcs from the crystalline ice structure significant lnapl remobilization in the direction of the freezing front was also observed in two dimensional cells micromodels at the pore scale niven and singh 2008 and three dimensional visual models singh et al 2011 theoretical calculations by niven and singh 2008 suggest that the lnapl remobilization and rupture of lnapl ganglia at the pore scale are caused by freezing induced pressure gradients which are much higher than the water lnapl capillary pressure singh et al 2011 also proposed two mechanisms for lnapl mobilization in a three dimensional model a freezing induced expulsion mechanism and a freezing induced cutoff mechanism both caused by the expansion of water during freezing however most of the above studies were performed using a saturated three phase system water air lnapl and quantitative observations and investigations of the processes at a two dimensional scale in unsaturated three phase systems water ice air lnapl are still lacking owing to the difficulties in setting an experimental temperature consistent with natural conditions and the lack of suitable non destructive imaging methods for quantifying lnapl saturation the law of the remobilization of lnapl subject to ftcs and its mechanisms are not well understood the light transmission visualization ltv technique has been widely applied to quantitatively measure fluid water and dnapl saturation in 2 d flow chambers as a noninvasive nondestructive and intuitive laboratory tool for the investigation of immiscible fluid movement alazaiza et al 2020 alazaiza et al 2019 alaziaza et al 2017 ye et al 2009 zheng et al 2015 visible light transmission based on the lambert beer law and fresnel s law was first used quantitatively by hoa 1981 to measure the water saturation within a sand filled slab chamber this method has been improved to make it more effective and feasible by tidwell and glass 1994 and niemet and selker 2001 bob et al 2008 modified the light transmission visualization ltv method to enable it to quantitatively measure the saturation of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl in porous media with a two phase system water dnapl zhang et al 2020 developed light intensity saturation models lisms with two parameters to determine fluid saturation in three phase system napl water gas based on an earlier light transmission technique but it hasn t yet been used in research nevertheless to the best of the authors knowledge no studies have reported the application of the ltv method in a four phase system water ice air napl the aim of this study was to experimentally characterize lnapl remobilization in a two dimensional porous medium with a four phase system water ice air napl to replicate the subsurface behavior of lnapl in cold regions subject to controlled ftcs a modified ltv method with only one parameter was proposed to quantitatively measure the saturation of lnapl in unsaturated porous media of three or four phase systems during freezing and thawing moreover the mechanism of lnapl remobilization is discussed these findings have important implications for the prediction of the subsurface behavior of lnapl at contaminated sites in widely distributed cold regions 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials a 2 d flow chamber with a porous medium allowing lnapl to migrate within it was designed the overall size was 30 wide 45 high 2 cm thick composed of two pieces of tempered glass with a thickness of 10 mm and two stainless steel frames fixed externally rubber strips and glass glue were used to seal the glass and frames eight temperature data logger onset hobo usa probes were evenly arranged every 4 cm from top to bottom on the right side of the 2d flow chamber to monitor the temperature every 10 s in order to to capture trend features of temperature change a porous medium consisting of translucent silica sand 99 8 sio2 mackiln reagent china with a size of 20 40 sand was used to fill the flow chamber the silica sands were cleaned repeatedly with distilled water before the experiment until the light absorption coefficient of the last cleaning solution was the same as that of the last test and then the clean sands were placed in a drying oven to desiccate since sands became discolored when dried at higher temperatures it should not be dried at higher than 45 c dodecane c12h26 sigma aldrich usa was chosen as the ideal lnapl because of its low water solubility solubility in water 3 7 µg l low volatility boiling point 214 216 c and low freezing point freezing point 12 c niven 2008 the dodecane was dyed with an organic soluble oil red o dye sigma aldrich usa at a concentration of 0 1 g l to make the lnapl more visible hence improve the accuracy of the ltv technique oostrom et al 2007 2 2 temperature control system the experimental setup consisted of a temperature control system fig 1 a and a light transmission visualization system fig 1b to simulate the natural conditions of meteorologically driven temperature changes a temperature control system was used to implement unidirectional downward freezing thawing of the flow chamber filled with a porous medium the system included a temperature controlled cabinet xutemp inc hangzhou china with an internal volume of 60 wide 60 depth 70 high cm which had a fast response time allowing for the steady control of the temperature gradient of the box 0 5 c and a thermostatic top plate connecting the refrigerated circulators fig 1a 2 3 light transmission visualization system a light transmission visualization system was established within the temperature controlled cabinet which included a 2 d flow chamber a light box and a digital camera fig 1b as the only light source of the 2 d flow chamber the light box was fixed behind the 2 d flow chamber it consisted of 48 led lights panasonic japan and the uniformity of the light source was guaranteed after passing through the light diffuser panasonic japan two boards were placed on both sides of the light box and the 2 d flow chamber to ensure that only light passing through the 2 d flow chamber from the light source was captured by the camera digital images were captured using a nikon eos m2 digital camera nikon malaysia which was maintained at the 45 cm distance in front of 2 d flow chamber during each experiment the number of pixels produced by the camera was 720 480 pixels resulting in a spatial resolution of 0 035 cm2 per pixel the dynamic range of the camera is 12 bit that results in 4096 gy levels the camera was connected to a laptop and the image capture was controlled by the nikon camera control pro software all images were captured with two 10 nm band pass filters at the center wavelengths of 515 and 575 nm attached to a 52 mm lens nikon 18 55 mm f 3 5 5 6g according to previous research simiao 2017 an analogous customized electronic filter wheel zwo inc suzhou china was used to accommodate the two chosen filters to capture photos in two specific spectrum bands fig 1c all images were taken at a fixed aperture of f 5 6 with an exposure time of 1 20 s during the experiment the temperature controlled cabinet was sealed and opaque 2 4 methodology 2 4 1 experimental procedures the 2 d flow chamber was dry packed with the silica sand the sand was gently mixed to minimize layering after the addition of each 2 cm height of sand increment the sand was compacted prior to the addition of the subsequent sand increment after mounting the flow chamber filled with porous media on the light box and collecting the image of the dry sand air saturated i a the flow chamber was slowly purged with approximately ten pore volumes of co2 gas to remove entrapped air bubbles in the flow chamber niven and singh 2008 distilled water was then used to slowly saturate the porous media in the flow chamber upward from the bottom to the top at a flow rate of about 150 ml min with a peristaltic pump after saturating the porous media in the flow chamber with water for approximately 4 h the image of the water saturated i w was acquired and the water was allowed to drain creating an initial situation of water distribution that is unsaturated above and saturated below alazaiza et al 2018 according the previous research schroth et al 1998 the period of water drainage is approximately 12 h before releasing the lnapl into the porous media the camera captured an image for the flow chamber which was named i d two experiments were carried out using the modified ltv technique to calculate lnapl saturation in the flow chamber to verify the availability of the modified ltv technique and to observe the migration characteristics of lnapl subject to ftcs under different cooling rates and freezing times first several aliquots of dyed lnapl were added using a syringe through the top of the sand tank resulting in final cumulative lnapl volumes within the chamber of 4 0 ml images under two selected light filters were captured to calculate lnapl saturation 1 h after each injection to evaluate the error analysis using the modified ltv technique then after 4 ml of lnapl was released into the flow chamber each experiment was divided into two stages the details of the temperature and duration of the two stages are shown in table 1 the first stage was under natural temperature conditions in which the temperature controlled cabinet was maintained at 25 c in this stage lnapl migrated sufficiently to reach a stable state at a natural temperature so that the confusion of lnapl distribution caused by natural migration and remobilization caused by ftcs was avoided in the second stage two experiments were conducted with 10 ftcs under different temperature control conditions in the first experiment experiment a the flow chamber was frozen for 2 5 h by setting the temperature controlled cabinet to 5 c and a thermostatic top plate at 40 c the flow chamber was thawed for 2 5 h by setting the cabinet to 10 c and top plate at 40 c this temperature setting is the result of many attempts to achieve a top down freezing gradient most similar to natural conditions while not freezing the saturated zone in the second experiment experiment b the flow chamber was frozen for 10 h by setting the cabinet to 10 c and the top plate at 40 similarly the flow chamber was thawed for 2 5 h by setting the cabinet to 10 c and top plate at 40 c the temperature setting in experiment b resulted in a greater top down cooling rate and the saturated area was frozen late during the freezing period 2 4 2 image acquisition and analysis in each set of experiments images were acquired after every freezing thawing cycle the ftc and photographic capturing were repeated for a total of ten cycles before analyzing the image the nikon camera official capture nx 2 software was used to correct the barrel distortion caused by the wide angle lens all images were processed using image pro plus software then the image was converted from the red green and blue rgb system to grayscale to extract the light intensity all strength values were exported to ms excel to calculate saturation using the modified ltv technique finally the same area of interest aoi within which all analyses were carried out was demarcated for all images a region with a width of 50 pixels on the right inside the aoi that is not polluted by lnapl was selected as the water saturation calculation region after each ftc to correct for temporal variation in light intensity a correction area in i d was identified and the average light intensity of this correction area was calculated to correct a particular image light intensities from all images were multiplied by the ratio of the average light intensity of the correction area for i d and the average light intensity of the correction area for the images to be corrected alazaiza et al 2017 2021 2 5 modified ltv technique 2 5 1 water saturation calculation the water saturation of the light filter in two different wavebands in 2d flow chamber systems containing translucent porous media was calculated using the model proposed by niemet and selker 2001 and the final water saturation was obtained by averaging them 1 s w i i a i a i w where i is the emergent light intensity sw is the fraction of pores that are water filled water saturation i w is the light intensity at each pixel when the flow chamber is fully saturated with water and i a is the light intensity at each pixel when the flow chamber is fully saturated with air 2 5 2 lnapl saturation calculation using modified ltv technique the lnapl saturation calculation in porous media within three phases water air and oil was derived from equations developed by bob et al 2008 when the visible light absorption by air and water is neglected the emergent light intensity i after incident light intensity i in passes through the flow chamber can be calculated as 2 i i in τ ws 2 k τ wn 2 k s n τ wa 2 k s a exp α s d p k α n d o k n when the visible light absorption by air water and ice is neglected based on fresnel s law assuming that four phases water ice air and oil are present in the chamber we use the following equation 3 i i in τ ws 2 k τ wn 2 k s n τ wa 2 k s a τ wi 2 k s i exp α s d p k α n d o k n where i in is the incident light intensity τ ws is the transmission factor at the water sand particle interface τ wn is the transmission factor at the water napl interface τ wa is the transmission factor at the sand water air interface τwi is the transmission factor at the sand water ice interface s n is the fraction of pores that are napl filled napl saturation s a is the fraction of pores that are air filled air saturation s i is the fraction of pores that are ice filled ice saturation k is the number of particles or pores across the thickness of the 2d chamber k n is the number of pores that are napl filled k n k s n α s is the sand particle absorption coefficient α n is the dyed lnapl absorption coefficient d p is the diameter of sand particles and d o is the average pore diameter because only two phases were present in the chamber water napl sa 0 in eq 2 and the calculation formula for s n can be derived directly however when three or four phases were present in our experiments there were two or three unknown variables in eqs 2 and 3 s n sa or s n sa si respectively therefore with a set of two equations that can be achieved by applying two band pass filters with different center wavelengths during the monitoring the equations can be solved in three phase systems 4 i i i in τ ws 2 k τ

575 nm in our experiments respectively a 10 nm band pass filters at the center wavelengths of 515nm was used in our experiments to quantify dyed dodecane since absorption measurements showed that near peak absorption of dyed dodecane was at a wavelength of 515 nm the high absorption coefficient of dyed dodecane at 575 nm is in contrast with the low absorption coefficient at 515 nm which makes the calculated lnapl saturation more accurate when the chamber is completely saturated with air the emergent light intensity i a under different light filters can be determined using eq 2 or eq 3 as 8 i a x i in τ sa 2 k exp α s x d p k where x is the different wavelengths of the two light filters and τ sa is the transmission factor at the sand sand particles air interface similarly when the chamber is completely saturated with water the emergent light intensity i w can be determined as 9 i w x i in τ ws 2 k exp α s x d p k when the drainage is finished emergent light intensity i d can be determined as 10 i d x i in τ ws 2 k τ wa 2 k s a exp α s x d p k taking the natural log of i i and i j then subtracting one from the other yields the same result is obtained for three or four phases systems 11 ln i i ln i j s n d o k α n j α n i d p k α s j α s i the difference between the absorption coefficients of the dyed lnapl at different wavelengths is needed for eq 11 which can be set to parameter α d 12 α d α n j α n i the second half of eq 11 can be obtained by taking the natural log of eq 8 eq 9 or eq 10 for different wavelengths and subtracting them 13 ln i s i ln i s j d p k p α s j α s i 14 ln i w i ln i w j d p k p α s j α s i 15 ln i d i ln i d j d p k p α s j α s i theoretically eqs 13 14 and 15 should yield the same values but in practice they do not this is because the water saturation of each pixel in i s i w and i d is different and the tiny light absorption coefficient of water is ignored in the in eqs 2 and 3 and eq 15 was adopted because it resulted in the smallest error by substituting eqs 12 and 15 into eq 11 and rearranging an expression for s n lnapl saturation at each pixel can be derived as follows 16 s n ln i i ln i j ln i d i ln i d j d o k α d in eq 16 d o k is the pore volume of a pixel that is the thickness of the flow chamber multiplied by the porosity 17 s n ln i i ln i j ln i d i ln i d j dn α d where d is the thickness of the flow chamber which is 2 cm in our experiment and n is the porosity obtained by measuring the volume of water required for saturation two methods can be used to obtain parameter α d the first method is direct determination using a spectrophotometer the second method is using a single point calibration step similar to that proposed by bob et al 2008 in the image collected after the first lnapl addition 1 0 ml napl image the α d value was adjusted when calculating the volume to get the correct mass balance and that αd value was used in all subsequent analyses the second method was applied in our normal temperature experiment because it results in a smaller error it should be noted that the absorption coefficient of lnapl changed after every ftc therefore in order to correctly calculate lnapl saturation after every ftc α d was calibrated to the same calculated lnapl volume 4 ml after every freezing or thawing 2 5 3 quantification of lnapl saturation two experiments were carried out using the modified ltv technique to quantify dyed lnapl saturation in a three phase system water air napl in experiment a with a porosity of 0 439 five aliquots of dyed lnapl were added through the top of the sand tank using a syringe resulting in cumulative lnapl volumes of 1 0 1 5 2 5 3 0 and 4 0 ml in the chamber in experiment b with a porosity of 0 446 six aliquots of dyed lnapl were added resulting in cumulative lnapl volumes of 1 0 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 and 4 0 ml the per pixel lnapl saturation and bulk volume in the flow chamber after 1 h of each injection were calculated using the modified ltv technique subsequently different aois were delineated in two experiments the values of α d obtained for lnapl saturation calculation and the sizes of aoi in experiments a and b are shown in table 2 in all images the distribution of 1 and 3 ml lnapl saturation in experiment a were selected at random and are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the areas impacted by lnapl are consistent with the areas of lnapl saturation calculated by the modified ltv technique as can be seen in these figures the lnapl saturation ranged from 0 02 this lower limit is controlled by experimental conditions and porous media to 0 42 depending on the volume of lnapl added the total volume of lnapl vc in a two dimensional flow chamber calculated by image analysis is calculated by the following formula 18 v c i 1 x s n i a d n where a is the actual area of the pixel sn i is the lnapl saturation of the i th pixel x is the total number of pixels in aoi the volume of lnapl added to experiments a and b was plotted against the volume of the lnapl calculated from image analysis and these data are shown in fig 3 there was a strong correlation between the added and calculated amounts of lnapl in experiments a r2 0 999 and b r2 0 996 the results show that the modified ltv technique has high calculation accuracy the difference between the absorption coefficients α d is the difference between the absorbance coefficients of the 515 nm and 575 nm band filters 2 5 4 error analysis to further assess errors in the calculation of saturation histograms showing the distribution of false lnapl saturation in an aoi that was not impacted by lnapl were plotted for 1 ml and 3 ml lnapl images in experiment a the symmetry and goodness normal distribution fit of data in the histograms of experiment a r2 0 9919 and experiment b r2 0 9178 are shown in fig 4 this suggests that the errors in light intensity measurements are mainly due to unavoidable camera noise rather than human factors as in the studies of tidwell and glass 1994 and niemet and selker 2001 there were errors in the calculation of saturation due to the noise in the camera signal as well as from variations in the source light intensity that are not uniformly distributed the stability of the light source can be improved by reducing the number of open and closed times of the light source to further reduce the error by using the modified light transmission visualization technique high precision results of the lnapl saturation calculation were obtained at room temperature after the ftcs the parameters of the absorption coefficient α d must be adjusted based on the actual lnapl volume injected to obtain the correct lnapl saturation distribution the changes in α d with the number of ftcs are shown in fig 5 the parameter α d decreases with an increase in the number of ftcs moreover the decrease was greater in experiment b with higher freezing intensity which indicated that the ftcs had a greater impact on the ltv this is because the ftcs increase the absorption coefficient of the dyed dodecane in the nir band of the optical spectrum arabul reported a similar phenomenon after several ftcs on polyvinyl alcohol gels arabul et al 2014 increasing the number of ftcs boosts the cross linking of molecules resulting in a higher rate of scattering of light ultimately leading to a higher absorption coefficient arabul et al 2015 hence it is important to note the effect of temperature when the ltv method is used 3 results 3 1 temperature variation in porous medium during fcts two typical sets of recorded temperature profiles in experiments a and b are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively every freeze thaw cycle is divided into freezing and thawing periods the overall trend of freezing from the upward base was observed during the freezing period in all cycles the rates of cooling in experiments a and b were initially 22 1 and 26 0 h at top of the flow chamber respectively and diminished as the temperature fell below 0 the top temperatures before the thawing period were 7 5 and 10 7 respectively in experiment a a gradient with a gradually increasing temperature from top to bottom was formed above probe 3 fig 6 a the temperature of probes 4 8 was basically synchronized and kept above 0 in experiment b the temperature of probes 1 4 in the unsaturated medium decreased gradually and finally achieved stability the temperature change of probes 6 8 in the saturated area was basically synchronous fig 6b after 10 h the entire flow chamber was frozen moreover with the increase in water saturation the temperature experienced a longer slower cooling period owing to the nucleation of water into ice this phenomenon is more clearly observed in the temperature data of probes 6 8 in the saturated water aquifer as shown in fig 6c the pore water in saturated flows through the cooling period then an abrupt spike in temperature was measured by probes 6 8 within the chamber corresponding to the nucleation of the ice the temperature was maintained for a period to attain equilibrium ice formation this period was called ice nucleating which is closer to the water saturation of probes 7 and 8 during the melting period the temperature of the probe in the unsaturated aquifer rose steadily and the probe in the saturated aquifer probes 6 8 went through a temperature stagnation period when it reached 0 c which corresponds to the melting of ice and then continued to rise 3 2 effect of ftcs on water migration the water saturations of all pixels in a row of the 2 d flow chamber after each ftc was averaged to obtain the characteristics of water transport in experiments a and b obvious zero flux planes zfp where the water flux at a certain depth is zero in the soil profile were distinguished in fig 7 a1 and b1 respectively it is obvious that a higher cooling rate and lower temperature result in a deeper zfp in the area above the zfp the average water saturation per row increased after each ftc this trend is reversed in the unfrozen zone this indicates that after the ftcs the water migrated from the unfrozen area to the frozen area in experiment a similarly in experiment b after the ftcs the water moved from the low negative temperature zone at the bottom to the high negative temperature zone at the top of the flow chamber the total water volume in the water increase zone light blue background was calculated as shown in fig 7a2 and b2 to further analyze the moisture changes it can be seen that in the first six ftcs the water volume at the area above the zfp increased after each cycle after the 6th ftc the water migrations were stable in both experiments after the 10th ftc in experiment a the average water saturation in the water increase zone increased from 0 18 to 0 25 a 37 5 increase and in experiment b it increased from 0 20 to 0 32 a 58 3 increase zero flux plane zfp can be easily distinguished by image analysis a1 b1 the area with a light blue background above the zfp represents the increase in water saturation the area with light gray background below the zfp represents the decrease in water saturation the dark gray area is affected by lnapl migration and the total water volume in the water increase area versus the number of ftcs in a2 experiment a and b2 experiment b 3 3 effect of ftcs on lnapl migration in experiments a and b lnapl of the same volume was added to the same injection site and stage 1 under normal temperature control was carried out the variation in lnapl saturation over time is shown in the first row of fig 8 a and b for experiments a and b respectively the first images in fig 8a and b represent the distribution of saturation 1 h after the injection of 4 ml lnapl when lnapl is released into the flow chamber its migration followed by release typically entails vertical transport under the influence of gravity accompanied by lateral diffusion due to capillary forces the spread of pollution bodies was different in experiments a and b because of the difference in water saturation and heterogeneity of porous media the migration ceased within the unsaturated zone above the water table as lnapl was immobilized within pores due to retentive capillary forces in experiment a however in experiment b the lnapl migrated downward toward the underlying water table this is because in certain locations where preferential pores exist sufficient gravity can overcome capillary forces once in contact with the saturated zone lnapl begins to spread laterally at the capillary fringe and the vertical migration of the lnapl continues until the pressure head is balanced by the upward forces of buoyancy and capillary pressure after lnapl saturation was calculated the space matrix method christ et al 2005 freyberg 1986 lemke et al 2004 was used to calculate the horizontal centroid x c and vertical centroid y c of the pollution body in matlab software to quantitatively describe the impact of ftcs on lnapl mobilization according to the results of the centroid calculated in fig 9 after 10 h both the horizontal x c and vertical y c centroids in experiments a and b show no obvious change this indicates that lnapl migration stabilized in stage 1 of the experiment after stage 1 the flow chambers within the stable lnapl of experiments a and b were subjected to ftcs with different cooling rates and temperatures respectively the images after each ftc are shown in the last two lines of fig 8a and b in experiments a and b after each ftc the pixels with high lnapl in red or green gradually decreased and the distribution of lnapl saturation became more uniform these results show that ftc promoted the diffusion of lnapl in unsaturated porous media after 10 ftcs the horizontal centroids x c in experiment a and b shifted 2 44 and 13 64 mm to the left respectively and the vertical centroid y c shifted 17 64 and 30 59 mm downward respectively the changes mainly occurred before the 6th ftc it follows that ftcs can cause remobilization of lnapl which has reached a stable migration state mainly in the vertical direction the remobilization is more significant in experiment b with a higher cooling rate and lower freezing temperature fig 10 a1 b1 show the variations of per row of lnapl total volume subject to ftcs in experiment a and b based on the upward or downward trend of lnapl volume per row in the flow chamber four zones with different migration trends were divided for analysis with more detail in experiments a and b respectively the variation of total lnapl in different zones in experiments a and b was calculated as shown in fig 10a2 b2 in experiment a with the increased of number of ftcs lnapl volume in zone i decreased from 1 13 to 1 02 ml after 10 ftcs the volume of lnapl in zone ⅱ decreased from 2 31 to 1 87 ml the volume of lnapl in zone iii increased from 0 55 to 1 10 ml this indicates that the vertical downward remobilization of lnapl caused by ftcs does not come from the frozen zone zone i but is caused by the downward migration of lnapl in the unfrozen intermediate zone with temperature close to 0 zone ⅱ meanwhile lnapl almost never appeared in zone ⅳ in experiment b with the increasing number of ftcs the volume of lnapl in zone i decreased successively from 1 85 to 1 15 ml the volume of lnapl in zone ⅱ experienced a fluctuation from rising to falling and finally stabilizing finally after 10 ftcs the volume of lnapl in the zone ⅱ increased by 0 055 ml by contrast the volume of lnapl in zone iii experienced a process from falling to rising and finally stabilizing the volume of lnapl in zone iii was almost the same as before the ftcs the volume of lnapl in zone ⅳ increased successively with increasing number of ftcs from 0 14 to 0 42 ml 3 4 lnapl remobilization in freezing and thawing to further observe the characteristics of lnapl remobilization during freezing and thawing the distributions of lnapl saturation fig 11 a1 a2 total volume per row fig 11b1 b2 and total volume in every zone fig 11c1 c2 before freezing when frozen and post thawing were calculated separately in experiment a after freezing the volume of lnapl decreased slightly in zone i above the freezing front lnapl in zone ⅱ migrated to zone iii below the freezing front and the migration reversed post thawing the amount of migration during thawing was less than that during freezing ultimately the volume of lnapl in zone ii increased and that of lnapl in zone iii decreased in experiment b in zone i where the temperature dropped gradually the volume of lnapl decreased after freezing it is evident that the volume expansion caused by the freezing of water in the saturated zone pushed the lnapl above the water table to migrate up and down simultaneously lnapls migrated to the saturated area and were captured by the aquifer in the form of ganglia consequently the volume of lnapl in zones ii iii and iv increased during thawing pressure release caused lnapl to migrate in reverse under the influence of gravity and capillarity these effects were quite pronounced after 10 ftcs but changes were evident even after the first cycle fig 10b1 b2 4 discussion 4 1 water remobilization under ftcs from the experimental results section 3 3 with ftcs the phenomenon of upward migration of water was observed and the variations in water were different in the two experiments under different cooling rates and freezing temperatures studies have shown that the decrease in soil matrix potential increase in suction near the freezing front is the main driving force for water migration from the unfrozen zone to the frozen zone zhang et al 2014 in the unfrozen zone the difference in soil water potential between two points in the soil is the driving force of water migration the unfrozen water in the frozen soil and the pore water in the unfrozen soil together constitute the source of water migration matrix potential can be calculated by the clausius clapeyron equation in negative temperature frozen porous media kurylyk and watanabe 2013 19 ψ l f v ln t t m where l f is the latent heat of fusion for water v is the specific volume and t m is the melting temperature of the bulk water the matrix potential at freezing was calculated in experiments a and b respectively the results are shown in fig 12 a3 b3 three linear fittings of matrix potential versus distance were completed on the upper part of zfp in experiment a and the upper and lower parts of zfp in experiment b meanwhile the slope of the fitted curve was calculated as the matrix potential gradient gradψ referring to the change of matrix potential per unit distance the matrix potential gradient above zfp in experiment a was 4 780 kpa mm which is 7 99 times that below zfp it follows that the main driving force of water remobilization subject to ftcs is the change in the matrix potential caused by freezing the matrix potential gradient controls the direction and characteristics of water migration water migrates from regions with a small matrix potential gradient to regions with a large matrix potential the matrix potential gradient above zfp in experiment a was 9 325 kpa mm which is 1 95 times that of experiment b however the water remigration in experiment a was less than that in experiment b in experiment a the lowest matrix potential at probe 3 near the zfp decreased to 92 kpa before thawing in experiment b the matrix potential at probe 4 near the zfp was 721 kpa therefore greater matric suction results in greater water migration 4 2 lnapl remobilization under ftcs according to the experimental results and analysis directional freezing with a different controlled temperature gradient caused the following changes in water and lnapl in the 2d micromodel 1 a greater cooling rate and lower freezing temperature resulted in zfp propagating deeper the matrix potential and its gradient controlled by temperature lead to different amounts of water remobilization in experiments a and b 2 lnapl remobilized in the direction of the freezing front caused by ftcs top downward in our experiments in contaminated freezing soils this phenomenon is consistent with previous observations in saturated or unsaturated porous media by ftcs biggar and neufeld 1996 chuvilin et al 2001a b konrad and seto 1991 niven and singh 2008 singh et al 2011 furthermore the horizontal remobilization of lnapl was also observed in experiment b with a high cooling rate and lower freezing temperature 3 lnapl in the area below the freezing front with a temperature above 0 c was promoted to remigrate downward during freezing in experiment a with a lower cooling rate and temperature 4 the remobilization direction of lnapl during thawing was opposite to that during freezing 4 2 1 freezing induced pressure freezing induced pressure associated with volumetric expansion of pore water on lnapl is considered an important driving force for lnapl remobilization in three phase water lnapl ice or four phase systems water air lnapl ice a schematic diagram of the volume changes of the four phases after ftcs in the pores is shown in fig 13 when only two phases exist in the pores fig 13a the volumetric expansion of water lead to an increase in pore volume of vw and intense freezing induced pressure on the incompressible lnapl niven and singh 2008 calculated that freezing induced pressure was about 350 500 mpa in experiments conducted on dodecane at residual saturation 21 26 in a two dimensional water saturated glass bead cell subject to controlled ftcs which was much larger than the capillary pressure thus leading to the remobilization of lnapl however in the unsaturated four phase system fig 12b in the case of progressive freezing pore water occupies the position of air after freezing and the freeze induced pressure will be greatly weakened even if there are no pores in a four phase system the freezing induced pressure is controlled by both water saturation and lnapl saturation lnapl oil at very low saturations does not redistribute during freezing chuvilin et al 1999 chuvilin et al 2001a therefore the lower lnapl saturation mean maximum value 0 16 and water saturation mean maximum value 0 24 in zone i of experiment a partly explains the minimal lnapl remobilization another important factor controlling the redistribution of lnapl is the artificially set cooling rate and freezing temperature the cooling rate is a significant parameter for ice lens formation konrad 1988 and the low cooling rate and freezing temperature in experiment a resulted in a shallower depth of frost front and a smaller scope of freezing induced pressure which ultimately resulted in minimal redistribution of lnapl 4 2 2 capillary pressure lnapl is held in the pores by capillary forces that arise from the pressure drop across the curved interface between two immiscible fluids the pressure drop is defined as the capillary pressure pc with the threshold capillary pressure for lnapl to enter the wetting fluid water as follows 20 p c p l p w 2 σ lw cos θ r where pl is the pressure in the lnapl pw is the pressure in the water phase σlw is the interfacial tension between the lnapl and water θ is the contact angle and r is the pore throat radius the migration of lnapl reaches a stable state when it is balanced by gravity and capillary pressure upon freezing this equilibrium will be upset because of the occurrence of freezing induced pressure and change in capillary pressure due to water migration in the case of saturation the change in capillary force is much lower than that of freezing induced pressure and can be ignored however in the unsaturated case the effect of capillary pressure cannot be ignored in experiment a which had low water content and freezing intensity the top down ftcs promoted lower remobilization of lnapl in the upper frozen zone and instead caused further downward migration of lnapl in the unfrozen zone above the freezing point to the surface of the saturated zone this is due to the upward migration of water in the unfrozen zone during freezing resulting in a decrease in the water content in the pores which caused r to increase the capillary pressure on lnapl to decrease thus downward migration of lnapl was promoted during the thawing process the ice melts leading to the release of pressure and causing lnapl to migrate in the opposite direction from freezing under the action of buoyancy and capillary forces 4 2 3 effect of the number of ftcs on water and lnapl remobilization we conclude that after the 6th ftc the variation in the physical properties of the porous media and the remobilization of lnapl have reached a steady state this is because the structure and physical and mechanical properties of porous media are changed in a certain direction subject to ftcs which makes the variation range of the matrix potential smaller and smaller with the increase in the number of ftcs zhang et al 2014 coincidentally the influence of ftcs on lnapl remobilization mainly occurred before 6 ftcs which was consistent with the characteristics of water redistribution this suggests that the change in the physical properties of porous media by freezing is an important mechanism controlling the remobilization of lnapl according to a previous report singh et al 2011 after ten ftcs the porosity significantly increased to approximately 37 with successive ftcs the variation amplitude of porosity decreased therefore in our experiment after the 6th ftc the physical properties of the porous media and the redistribution of lnapl reached stable states 4 3 implications micro model investigations of dynamic processes are instructive for our understanding of lnapl migration in porous media subject to ftcs and is also a prerequisite for mechanistic studies at the pore scale simulating the natural temperature conditions of cold regions in the laboratory has always been a difficult problem that has restricted research at the same time a non destructive non intrusive tool to quantify lnapl saturation is urgently needed in this study we combined a temperature control system and an ltv system to measure lnapl saturation in a three or four phase system under the control of ftcs it should be noted that the setting of the temperature control system must be adjusted under different model scales and properties of porous media the results indicate that the factors affecting the remobilization of lnapl are the cooling rate freezing temperature water saturation and lnapl saturation lnapl remobilization is mainly controlled by the freezing induced pressure and capillary force however the quantification of these two pressures on lnapl during freezing in unsaturated porous media requires further study some laboratory results and site investigations have also observed vertical migration of soil in permafrost biggar et al 1998 and chuvilin and miklyaeva 2003 suggested that microcracks formed in the freezing medium are a potential route for lnapl diffusion in the freezing medium similar to the experiment reported by iwakun et al 2010 micro cracks caused by freezing were observed in experiment b as shown in fig 14 however although microcracks were observed although a microcrack was observed above the water table after the 4th ftc no obvious migration of lnapl along the microcracks was observed therefore this mechanism requires further verification it is very difficult to conduct site investigations in cold regions and laboratory experiments are a more suitable simulation method the modified ltv technique proposed in this paper is of great reference value for the study of petroleum pollutants in frozen unsaturated porous media for contaminated areas in cold regions site investigations of permafrost have shown that frozen soil does is not considered as an impermeable barrier to contaminants the migration of lnapl in frozen soil may be deeper than we have previously understood especially in seasonal frozen regions that undergo seasonal freeze thaw cycles the prevention and treatment of pollutants in frozen soil should consider the remobilization of pollutants this study provides a good starting point for discussion and further research nevertheless some limitations of this research deserve attention first the 2 d micromodel did not perfectly reproduce the 3 d porous media structure furthermore whether lnapl contaminated porous media of silts and clay exhibit such dramatic changes with ftcs warrants further investigation 5 conclusion in this study a previous ltv technique for calculating fluid saturation in two phase systems was modified to calculate lnapl saturation in a three phase water air lnapl or four phase system water ice air lnapl strong correlation was found between the injected lnapl amounts into the 2 d flow chamber and the calculated lnapl amounts indicating that modified ltv technique can provide high resolution data for lnapl saturation measurements the remobilization characteristics of lnapl were revealed in unsaturated porous media subjected to ftcs using modified ltv technique the results showed that with the number of ftcs lnapl increasingly remobilized in the freezing front and horizontal directions in unsaturated pores meanwhile lnapl in the area below the freezing front is also promoted to remigrate downward during freezing lnapl migrated in the opposite direction during thawing further analysis suggests that lnapl remobilization is caused by a combination of freezing induced pressure and changes in capillary pressure affected by water migration rather than through microcracks in the frozen porous media this study has important implications for understanding and remediating lnapls in seasonally frozen soils and polar regions moreover the experimental method proposed in this paper is of great reference

3853,the frequent use of light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls in cold regions creates serious risks of soil and groundwater contamination however the subsurface remobilization behaviors of lnapl in freezing and thawing unsaturated porous media are not well understood the light transmission visualization ltv technique which be previously used in two phase system water air or water napl is modified to quantify lnapl in three water air lnapl or four phase water ice air lnapl systems during freezing and thawing the pattern of lnapl remobilization was observed in a two dimensional flow chamber filled with unsaturated porous media subject to freeze thaw cycles ftcs using the modified ltv technique it is shown that lnapl remobilization mainly occurs in the direction of the freezing front and horizontal with the number of ftcs meanwhile lnapl in the area below the freezing front is promoted to remigrate downward during freezing and the opposite direction during thawing the analysis suggests that lnapl remobilization is caused by a combination of freezing induced pressure and changes in capillary pressure controlled by water migration rather than through microcracks in the frozen porous media the proposed modified ltv technique shows great promise for investigating lnapl transport and distribution in freezing unfreezing unsaturated porous media that is non destructive the study offers a scientific basis for the prediction of the subsurface behavior of lnapl at contaminated sites in widely distributed cold regions keywords modified light transmission visualization flow chamber porous media freeze thaw cycles lnapl remobilization 1 introduction subsurface contamination by light non aqueous phase liquids lnapls due to the exploitation refining storage and transportation of petroleum is a significant problem worldwide li et al 2018 sheng et al 2018 tsai et al 2020 in recent decades in cold regions where the soils and groundwater undergo diurnal or seasonal freeze thaw cycles ftcs depending on the temperature gradient lundberg et al 2016 the subsurface behavior of petroleum pollutants in ice containing soils with a dynamic four phase system water ice air lnapl has received an increased amount of attention singh and niven 2013 zhao et al 2014 wagner et al 2019 potapowicz et al 2019 ji et al 2019 muir and galarneau 2021 li et al 2021 understanding the subsurface fate and behavior of lnapl in frozen soil is of great significance for assessing and protecting the soil and groundwater environments in cold regions several studies have focused on the behavior of spilled fuel in permafrost environments studies have determined that permafrost might not be an effective barrier to migration of lnapl biggar et al 1998 chuvilin et al 2001a mccarthy et al 2004 and that the infiltration of lnapls into frozen soils is controlled by ice saturation or initial soil moisture content in soil and soil type barnes and filler 2003 barnes and wolfe 2008 chuvilin et al 2001a wiggert et al 1997 some laboratory tests quantified the effect of ftcs on the physico mechanical properties of soil chen et al 2019 roman and zhang 2010 and the relative permeability of lnapls in frozen soil with different ice saturations mccauley et al 2002 wiggert et al 1997 lnapls in frozen soil are transported mainly through soil pores that are not saturated with ice by unfrozen water films on the surface of mineral particles and ice at temperatures below 0 c because of the presence of a pressure gradient in the soil biggar et al 1998 or micro cracks in ice saturated soils chuvilin et al 1999 chuvilin and miklyaeva 2003 in recent years however laboratory studies found that lnapls could be remobilized in the active layer of seasonally frozen soil and permafrost regions undergoing ftcs which may result in further downward infiltration of lnapls a laboratory phenomenon called cryogenic expulsion observed increasing lnapl content at the leading edge of a freezing front with the number of ftcs whether in saturated or unsaturated porous media barnes and chuvilin 2009 iwakun et al 2010 biggar and neufeld 1996 observed that after several top down ftcs on the soil column diesel fuel gradually migrated downward to uncontaminated soil they speculated that diesel fuel may have migrated down through micro fissures created by freezing as micro fissures were observed in the ice formed inside the freezing cell under prolonged freezing such micro fissures formed by freezing have been observed in two dimensional glass bead cells by iwakun et al 2010 a similar remigration phenomenon was observed for different types of soils sand silt and clay by chuvilin et al 2001a and chuvilin et al 2001b they suggested that the cause of this phenomenon is that frozen ice in soil displaces oil from the pores to the freezing front however for silt or clay they believe that advances in dissolved phase petroleum hydrocarbons phcs are most likely the main cause of oil migration downward barnes et al 2004 illustrated the mechanism responsible for the increased phc concentration at the freezing front using a mass balance model the increase in the concentration of phcs at the freezing front is attributed to the exclusion of more mobile components from phcs from the crystalline ice structure significant lnapl remobilization in the direction of the freezing front was also observed in two dimensional cells micromodels at the pore scale niven and singh 2008 and three dimensional visual models singh et al 2011 theoretical calculations by niven and singh 2008 suggest that the lnapl remobilization and rupture of lnapl ganglia at the pore scale are caused by freezing induced pressure gradients which are much higher than the water lnapl capillary pressure singh et al 2011 also proposed two mechanisms for lnapl mobilization in a three dimensional model a freezing induced expulsion mechanism and a freezing induced cutoff mechanism both caused by the expansion of water during freezing however most of the above studies were performed using a saturated three phase system water air lnapl and quantitative observations and investigations of the processes at a two dimensional scale in unsaturated three phase systems water ice air lnapl are still lacking owing to the difficulties in setting an experimental temperature consistent with natural conditions and the lack of suitable non destructive imaging methods for quantifying lnapl saturation the law of the remobilization of lnapl subject to ftcs and its mechanisms are not well understood the light transmission visualization ltv technique has been widely applied to quantitatively measure fluid water and dnapl saturation in 2 d flow chambers as a noninvasive nondestructive and intuitive laboratory tool for the investigation of immiscible fluid movement alazaiza et al 2020 alazaiza et al 2019 alaziaza et al 2017 ye et al 2009 zheng et al 2015 visible light transmission based on the lambert beer law and fresnel s law was first used quantitatively by hoa 1981 to measure the water saturation within a sand filled slab chamber this method has been improved to make it more effective and feasible by tidwell and glass 1994 and niemet and selker 2001 bob et al 2008 modified the light transmission visualization ltv method to enable it to quantitatively measure the saturation of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapl in porous media with a two phase system water dnapl zhang et al 2020 developed light intensity saturation models lisms with two parameters to determine fluid saturation in three phase system napl water gas based on an earlier light transmission technique but it hasn t yet been used in research nevertheless to the best of the authors knowledge no studies have reported the application of the ltv method in a four phase system water ice air napl the aim of this study was to experimentally characterize lnapl remobilization in a two dimensional porous medium with a four phase system water ice air napl to replicate the subsurface behavior of lnapl in cold regions subject to controlled ftcs a modified ltv method with only one parameter was proposed to quantitatively measure the saturation of lnapl in unsaturated porous media of three or four phase systems during freezing and thawing moreover the mechanism of lnapl remobilization is discussed these findings have important implications for the prediction of the subsurface behavior of lnapl at contaminated sites in widely distributed cold regions 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials a 2 d flow chamber with a porous medium allowing lnapl to migrate within it was designed the overall size was 30 wide 45 high 2 cm thick composed of two pieces of tempered glass with a thickness of 10 mm and two stainless steel frames fixed externally rubber strips and glass glue were used to seal the glass and frames eight temperature data logger onset hobo usa probes were evenly arranged every 4 cm from top to bottom on the right side of the 2d flow chamber to monitor the temperature every 10 s in order to to capture trend features of temperature change a porous medium consisting of translucent silica sand 99 8 sio2 mackiln reagent china with a size of 20 40 sand was used to fill the flow chamber the silica sands were cleaned repeatedly with distilled water before the experiment until the light absorption coefficient of the last cleaning solution was the same as that of the last test and then the clean sands were placed in a drying oven to desiccate since sands became discolored when dried at higher temperatures it should not be dried at higher than 45 c dodecane c12h26 sigma aldrich usa was chosen as the ideal lnapl because of its low water solubility solubility in water 3 7 µg l low volatility boiling point 214 216 c and low freezing point freezing point 12 c niven 2008 the dodecane was dyed with an organic soluble oil red o dye sigma aldrich usa at a concentration of 0 1 g l to make the lnapl more visible hence improve the accuracy of the ltv technique oostrom et al 2007 2 2 temperature control system the experimental setup consisted of a temperature control system fig 1 a and a light transmission visualization system fig 1b to simulate the natural conditions of meteorologically driven temperature changes a temperature control system was used to implement unidirectional downward freezing thawing of the flow chamber filled with a porous medium the system included a temperature controlled cabinet xutemp inc hangzhou china with an internal volume of 60 wide 60 depth 70 high cm which had a fast response time allowing for the steady control of the temperature gradient of the box 0 5 c and a thermostatic top plate connecting the refrigerated circulators fig 1a 2 3 light transmission visualization system a light transmission visualization system was established within the temperature controlled cabinet which included a 2 d flow chamber a light box and a digital camera fig 1b as the only light source of the 2 d flow chamber the light box was fixed behind the 2 d flow chamber it consisted of 48 led lights panasonic japan and the uniformity of the light source was guaranteed after passing through the light diffuser panasonic japan two boards were placed on both sides of the light box and the 2 d flow chamber to ensure that only light passing through the 2 d flow chamber from the light source was captured by the camera digital images were captured using a nikon eos m2 digital camera nikon malaysia which was maintained at the 45 cm distance in front of 2 d flow chamber during each experiment the number of pixels produced by the camera was 720 480 pixels resulting in a spatial resolution of 0 035 cm2 per pixel the dynamic range of the camera is 12 bit that results in 4096 gy levels the camera was connected to a laptop and the image capture was controlled by the nikon camera control pro software all images were captured with two 10 nm band pass filters at the center wavelengths of 515 and 575 nm attached to a 52 mm lens nikon 18 55 mm f 3 5 5 6g according to previous research simiao 2017 an analogous customized electronic filter wheel zwo inc suzhou china was used to accommodate the two chosen filters to capture photos in two specific spectrum bands fig 1c all images were taken at a fixed aperture of f 5 6 with an exposure time of 1 20 s during the experiment the temperature controlled cabinet was sealed and opaque 2 4 methodology 2 4 1 experimental procedures the 2 d flow chamber was dry packed with the silica sand the sand was gently mixed to minimize layering after the addition of each 2 cm height of sand increment the sand was compacted prior to the addition of the subsequent sand increment after mounting the flow chamber filled with porous media on the light box and collecting the image of the dry sand air saturated i a the flow chamber was slowly purged with approximately ten pore volumes of co2 gas to remove entrapped air bubbles in the flow chamber niven and singh 2008 distilled water was then used to slowly saturate the porous media in the flow chamber upward from the bottom to the top at a flow rate of about 150 ml min with a peristaltic pump after saturating the porous media in the flow chamber with water for approximately 4 h the image of the water saturated i w was acquired and the water was allowed to drain creating an initial situation of water distribution that is unsaturated above and saturated below alazaiza et al 2018 according the previous research schroth et al 1998 the period of water drainage is approximately 12 h before releasing the lnapl into the porous media the camera captured an image for the flow chamber which was named i d two experiments were carried out using the modified ltv technique to calculate lnapl saturation in the flow chamber to verify the availability of the modified ltv technique and to observe the migration characteristics of lnapl subject to ftcs under different cooling rates and freezing times first several aliquots of dyed lnapl were added using a syringe through the top of the sand tank resulting in final cumulative lnapl volumes within the chamber of 4 0 ml images under two selected light filters were captured to calculate lnapl saturation 1 h after each injection to evaluate the error analysis using the modified ltv technique then after 4 ml of lnapl was released into the flow chamber each experiment was divided into two stages the details of the temperature and duration of the two stages are shown in table 1 the first stage was under natural temperature conditions in which the temperature controlled cabinet was maintained at 25 c in this stage lnapl migrated sufficiently to reach a stable state at a natural temperature so that the confusion of lnapl distribution caused by natural migration and remobilization caused by ftcs was avoided in the second stage two experiments were conducted with 10 ftcs under different temperature control conditions in the first experiment experiment a the flow chamber was frozen for 2 5 h by setting the temperature controlled cabinet to 5 c and a thermostatic top plate at 40 c the flow chamber was thawed for 2 5 h by setting the cabinet to 10 c and top plate at 40 c this temperature setting is the result of many attempts to achieve a top down freezing gradient most similar to natural conditions while not freezing the saturated zone in the second experiment experiment b the flow chamber was frozen for 10 h by setting the cabinet to 10 c and the top plate at 40 similarly the flow chamber was thawed for 2 5 h by setting the cabinet to 10 c and top plate at 40 c the temperature setting in experiment b resulted in a greater top down cooling rate and the saturated area was frozen late during the freezing period 2 4 2 image acquisition and analysis in each set of experiments images were acquired after every freezing thawing cycle the ftc and photographic capturing were repeated for a total of ten cycles before analyzing the image the nikon camera official capture nx 2 software was used to correct the barrel distortion caused by the wide angle lens all images were processed using image pro plus software then the image was converted from the red green and blue rgb system to grayscale to extract the light intensity all strength values were exported to ms excel to calculate saturation using the modified ltv technique finally the same area of interest aoi within which all analyses were carried out was demarcated for all images a region with a width of 50 pixels on the right inside the aoi that is not polluted by lnapl was selected as the water saturation calculation region after each ftc to correct for temporal variation in light intensity a correction area in i d was identified and the average light intensity of this correction area was calculated to correct a particular image light intensities from all images were multiplied by the ratio of the average light intensity of the correction area for i d and the average light intensity of the correction area for the images to be corrected alazaiza et al 2017 2021 2 5 modified ltv technique 2 5 1 water saturation calculation the water saturation of the light filter in two different wavebands in 2d flow chamber systems containing translucent porous media was calculated using the model proposed by niemet and selker 2001 and the final water saturation was obtained by averaging them 1 s w i i a i a i w where i is the emergent light intensity sw is the fraction of pores that are water filled water saturation i w is the light intensity at each pixel when the flow chamber is fully saturated with water and i a is the light intensity at each pixel when the flow chamber is fully saturated with air 2 5 2 lnapl saturation calculation using modified ltv technique the lnapl saturation calculation in porous media within three phases water air and oil was derived from equations developed by bob et al 2008 when the visible light absorption by air and water is neglected the emergent light intensity i after incident light intensity i in passes through the flow chamber can be calculated as 2 i i in τ ws 2 k τ wn 2 k s n τ wa 2 k s a exp α s d p k α n d o k n when the visible light absorption by air water and ice is neglected based on fresnel s law assuming that four phases water ice air and oil are present in the chamber we use the following equation 3 i i in τ ws 2 k τ wn 2 k s n τ wa 2 k s a τ wi 2 k s i exp α s d p k α n d o k n where i in is the incident light intensity τ ws is the transmission factor at the water sand particle interface τ wn is the transmission factor at the water napl interface τ wa is the transmission factor at the sand water air interface τwi is the transmission factor at the sand water ice interface s n is the fraction of pores that are napl filled napl saturation s a is the fraction of pores that are air filled air saturation s i is the fraction of pores that are ice filled ice saturation k is the number of particles or pores across the thickness of the 2d chamber k n is the number of pores that are napl filled k n k s n α s is the sand particle absorption coefficient α n is the dyed lnapl absorption coefficient d p is the diameter of sand particles and d o is the average pore diameter because only two phases were present in the chamber water napl sa 0 in eq 2 and the calculation formula for s n can be derived directly however when three or four phases were present in our experiments there were two or three unknown variables in eqs 2 and 3 s n sa or s n sa si respectively therefore with a set of two equations that can be achieved by applying two band pass filters with different center wavelengths during the monitoring the equations can be solved in three phase systems 4 i i i in τ ws 2 k τ wn 2 k s n τ wa 2 k s a exp α s i d p k α n i d o k n 5 i j i in τ ws 2 k τ wn 2 k s n τ wa 2 k s a exp α s j d p k α n j d o k n and four phase systems 6 i i i in τ ws 2 k τ wn 2 k s n τ wa 2 k s a τ

575 nm in our experiments respectively a 10 nm band pass filters at the center wavelengths of 515nm was used in our experiments to quantify dyed dodecane since absorption measurements showed that near peak absorption of dyed dodecane was at a wavelength of 515 nm the high absorption coefficient of dyed dodecane at 575 nm is in contrast with the low absorption coefficient at 515 nm which makes the calculated lnapl saturation more accurate when the chamber is completely saturated with air the emergent light intensity i a under different light filters can be determined using eq 2 or eq 3 as 8 i a x i in τ sa 2 k exp α s x d p k where x is the different wavelengths of the two light filters and τ sa is the transmission factor at the sand sand particles air interface similarly when the chamber is completely saturated with water the emergent light intensity i w can be determined as 9 i w x i in τ ws 2 k exp α s x d p k when the drainage is finished emergent light intensity i d can be determined as 10 i d x i in τ ws 2 k τ wa 2 k s a exp α s x d p k taking the natural log of i i and i j then subtracting one from the other yields the same result is obtained for three or four phases systems 11 ln i i ln i j s n d o k α n j α n i d p k α s j α s i the difference between the absorption coefficients of the dyed lnapl at different wavelengths is needed for eq 11 which can be set to parameter α d 12 α d α n j α n i the second half of eq 11 can be obtained by taking the natural log of eq 8 eq 9 or eq 10 for different wavelengths and subtracting them 13 ln i s i ln i s j d p k p α s j α s i 14 ln i w i ln i w j d p k p α s j α s i 15 ln i d i ln i d j d p k p α s j α s i theoretically eqs 13 14 and 15 should yield the same values but in practice they do not this is because the water saturation of each pixel in i s i w and i d is different and the tiny light absorption coefficient of water is ignored in the in eqs 2 and 3 and eq 15 was adopted because it resulted in the smallest error by substituting eqs 12 and 15 into eq 11 and rearranging an expression for s n lnapl saturation at each pixel can be derived as follows 16 s n ln i i ln i j ln i d i ln i d j d o k α d in eq 16 d o k is the pore volume of a pixel that is the thickness of the flow chamber multiplied by the porosity 17 s n ln i i ln i j ln i d i ln i d j dn α d where d is the thickness of the flow chamber which is 2 cm in our experiment and n is the porosity obtained by measuring the volume of water required for saturation two methods can be used to obtain parameter α d the first method is direct determination using a spectrophotometer the second method is using a single point calibration step similar to that proposed by bob et al 2008 in the image collected after the first lnapl addition 1 0 ml napl image the α d value was adjusted when calculating the volume to get the correct mass balance and that αd value was used in all subsequent analyses the second method was applied in our normal temperature experiment because it results in a smaller error it should be noted that the absorption coefficient of lnapl changed after every ftc therefore in order to correctly calculate lnapl saturation after every ftc α d was calibrated to the same calculated lnapl volume 4 ml after every freezing or thawing 2 5 3 quantification of lnapl saturation two experiments were carried out using the modified ltv technique to quantify dyed lnapl saturation in a three phase system water air napl in experiment a with a porosity of 0 439 five aliquots of dyed lnapl were added through the top of the sand tank using a syringe resulting in cumulative lnapl volumes of 1 0 1 5 2 5 3 0 and 4 0 ml in the chamber in experiment b with a porosity of 0 446 six aliquots of dyed lnapl were added resulting in cumulative lnapl volumes of 1 0 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 and 4 0 ml the per pixel lnapl saturation and bulk volume in the flow chamber after 1 h of each injection were calculated using the modified ltv technique subsequently different aois were delineated in two experiments the values of α d obtained for lnapl saturation calculation and the sizes of aoi in experiments a and b are shown in table 2 in all images the distribution of 1 and 3 ml lnapl saturation in experiment a were selected at random and are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the areas impacted by lnapl are consistent with the areas of lnapl saturation calculated by the modified ltv technique as can be seen in these figures the lnapl saturation ranged from 0 02 this lower limit is controlled by experimental conditions and porous media to 0 42 depending on the volume of lnapl added the total volume of lnapl vc in a two dimensional flow chamber calculated by image analysis is calculated by the following formula 18 v c i 1 x s n i a d n where a is the actual area of the pixel sn i is the lnapl saturation of the i th pixel x is the total number of pixels in aoi the volume of lnapl added to experiments a and b was plotted against the volume of the lnapl calculated from image analysis and these data are shown in fig 3 there was a strong correlation between the added and calculated amounts of lnapl in experiments a r2 0 999 and b r2 0 996 the results show that the modified ltv technique has high calculation accuracy the difference between the absorption coefficients α d is the difference between the absorbance coefficients of the 515 nm and 575 nm band filters 2 5 4 error analysis to further assess errors in the calculation of saturation histograms showing the distribution of false lnapl saturation in an aoi that was not impacted by lnapl were plotted for 1 ml and 3 ml lnapl images in experiment a the symmetry and goodness normal distribution fit of data in the histograms of experiment a r2 0 9919 and experiment b r2 0 9178 are shown in fig 4 this suggests that the errors in light intensity measurements are mainly due to unavoidable camera noise rather than human factors as in the studies of tidwell and glass 1994 and niemet and selker 2001 there were errors in the calculation of saturation due to the noise in the camera signal as well as from variations in the source light intensity that are not uniformly distributed the stability of the light source can be improved by reducing the number of open and closed times of the light source to further reduce the error by using the modified light transmission visualization technique high precision results of the lnapl saturation calculation were obtained at room temperature after the ftcs the parameters of the absorption coefficient α d must be adjusted based on the actual lnapl volume injected to obtain the correct lnapl saturation distribution the changes in α d with the number of ftcs are shown in fig 5 the parameter α d decreases with an increase in the number of ftcs moreover the decrease was greater in experiment b with higher freezing intensity which indicated that the ftcs had a greater impact on the ltv this is because the ftcs increase the absorption coefficient of the dyed dodecane in the nir band of the optical spectrum arabul reported a similar phenomenon after several ftcs on polyvinyl alcohol gels arabul et al 2014 increasing the number of ftcs boosts the cross linking of molecules resulting in a higher rate of scattering of light ultimately leading to a higher absorption coefficient arabul et al 2015 hence it is important to note the effect of temperature when the ltv method is used 3 results 3 1 temperature variation in porous medium during fcts two typical sets of recorded temperature profiles in experiments a and b are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively every freeze thaw cycle is divided into freezing and thawing periods the overall trend of freezing from the upward base was observed during the freezing period in all cycles the rates of cooling in experiments a and b were initially 22 1 and 26 0 h at top of the flow chamber respectively and diminished as the temperature fell below 0 the top temperatures before the thawing period were 7 5 and 10 7 respectively in experiment a a gradient with a gradually increasing temperature from top to bottom was formed above probe 3 fig 6 a the temperature of probes 4 8 was basically synchronized and kept above 0 in experiment b the temperature of probes 1 4 in the unsaturated medium decreased gradually and finally achieved stability the temperature change of probes 6 8 in the saturated area was basically synchronous fig 6b after 10 h the entire flow chamber was frozen moreover with the increase in water saturation the temperature experienced a longer slower cooling period owing to the nucleation of water into ice this phenomenon is more clearly observed in the temperature data of probes 6 8 in the saturated water aquifer as shown in fig 6c the pore water in saturated flows through the cooling period then an abrupt spike in temperature was measured by probes 6 8 within the chamber corresponding to the nucleation of the ice the temperature was maintained for a period to attain equilibrium ice formation this period was called ice nucleating which is closer to the water saturation of probes 7 and 8 during the melting period the temperature of the probe in the unsaturated aquifer rose steadily and the probe in the saturated aquifer probes 6 8 went through a temperature stagnation period when it reached 0 c which corresponds to the melting of ice and then continued to rise 3 2 effect of ftcs on water migration the water saturations of all pixels in a row of the 2 d flow chamber after each ftc was averaged to obtain the characteristics of water transport in experiments a and b obvious zero flux planes zfp where the water flux at a certain depth is zero in the soil profile were distinguished in fig 7 a1 and b1 respectively it is obvious that a higher cooling rate and lower temperature result in a deeper zfp in the area above the zfp the average water saturation per row increased after each ftc this trend is reversed in the unfrozen zone this indicates that after the ftcs the water migrated from the unfrozen area to the frozen area in experiment a similarly in experiment b after the ftcs the water moved from the low negative temperature zone at the bottom to the high negative temperature zone at the top of the flow chamber the total water volume in the water increase zone light blue background was calculated as shown in fig 7a2 and b2 to further analyze the moisture changes it can be seen that in the first six ftcs the water volume at the area above the zfp increased after each cycle after the 6th ftc the water migrations were stable in both experiments after the 10th ftc in experiment a the average water saturation in the water increase zone increased from 0 18 to 0 25 a 37 5 increase and in experiment b it increased from 0 20 to 0 32 a 58 3 increase zero flux plane zfp can be easily distinguished by image analysis a1 b1 the area with a light blue background above the zfp represents the increase in water saturation the area with light gray background below the zfp represents the decrease in water saturation the dark gray area is affected by lnapl migration and the total water volume in the water increase area versus the number of ftcs in a2 experiment a and b2 experiment b 3 3 effect of ftcs on lnapl migration in experiments a and b lnapl of the same volume was added to the same injection site and stage 1 under normal temperature control was carried out the variation in lnapl saturation over time is shown in the first row of fig 8 a and b for experiments a and b respectively the first images in fig 8a and b represent the distribution of saturation 1 h after the injection of 4 ml lnapl when lnapl is released into the flow chamber its migration followed by release typically entails vertical transport under the influence of gravity accompanied by lateral diffusion due to capillary forces the spread of pollution bodies was different in experiments a and b because of the difference in water saturation and heterogeneity of porous media the migration ceased within the unsaturated zone above the water table as lnapl was immobilized within pores due to retentive capillary forces in experiment a however in experiment b the lnapl migrated downward toward the underlying water table this is because in certain locations where preferential pores exist sufficient gravity can overcome capillary forces once in contact with the saturated zone lnapl begins to spread laterally at the capillary fringe and the vertical migration of the lnapl continues until the pressure head is balanced by the upward forces of buoyancy and capillary pressure after lnapl saturation was calculated the space matrix method christ et al 2005 freyberg 1986 lemke et al 2004 was used to calculate the horizontal centroid x c and vertical centroid y c of the pollution body in matlab software to quantitatively describe the impact of ftcs on lnapl mobilization according to the results of the centroid calculated in fig 9 after 10 h both the horizontal x c and vertical y c centroids in experiments a and b show no obvious change this indicates that lnapl migration stabilized in stage 1 of the experiment after stage 1 the flow chambers within the stable lnapl of experiments a and b were subjected to ftcs with different cooling rates and temperatures respectively the images after each ftc are shown in the last two lines of fig 8a and b in experiments a and b after each ftc the pixels with high lnapl in red or green gradually decreased and the distribution of lnapl saturation became more uniform these results show that ftc promoted the diffusion of lnapl in unsaturated porous media after 10 ftcs the horizontal centroids x c in experiment a and b shifted 2 44 and 13 64 mm to the left respectively and the vertical centroid y c shifted 17 64 and 30 59 mm downward respectively the changes mainly occurred before the 6th ftc it follows that ftcs can cause remobilization of lnapl which has reached a stable migration state mainly in the vertical direction the remobilization is more significant in experiment b with a higher cooling rate and lower freezing temperature fig 10 a1 b1 show the variations of per row of lnapl total volume subject to ftcs in experiment a and b based on the upward or downward trend of lnapl volume per row in the flow chamber four zones with different migration trends were divided for analysis with more detail in experiments a and b respectively the variation of total lnapl in different zones in experiments a and b was calculated as shown in fig 10a2 b2 in experiment a with the increased of number of ftcs lnapl volume in zone i decreased from 1 13 to 1 02 ml after 10 ftcs the volume of lnapl in zone ⅱ decreased from 2 31 to 1 87 ml the volume of lnapl in zone iii increased from 0 55 to 1 10 ml this indicates that the vertical downward remobilization of lnapl caused by ftcs does not come from the frozen zone zone i but is caused by the downward migration of lnapl in the unfrozen intermediate zone with temperature close to 0 zone ⅱ meanwhile lnapl almost never appeared in zone ⅳ in experiment b with the increasing number of ftcs the volume of lnapl in zone i decreased successively from 1 85 to 1 15 ml the volume of lnapl in zone ⅱ experienced a fluctuation from rising to falling and finally stabilizing finally after 10 ftcs the volume of lnapl in the zone ⅱ increased by 0 055 ml by contrast the volume of lnapl in zone iii experienced a process from falling to rising and finally stabilizing the volume of lnapl in zone iii was almost the same as before the ftcs the volume of lnapl in zone ⅳ increased successively with increasing number of ftcs from 0 14 to 0 42 ml 3 4 lnapl remobilization in freezing and thawing to further observe the characteristics of lnapl remobilization during freezing and thawing the distributions of lnapl saturation fig 11 a1 a2 total volume per row fig 11b1 b2 and total volume in every zone fig 11c1 c2 before freezing when frozen and post thawing were calculated separately in experiment a after freezing the volume of lnapl decreased slightly in zone i above the freezing front lnapl in zone ⅱ migrated to zone iii below the freezing front and the migration reversed post thawing the amount of migration during thawing was less than that during freezing ultimately the volume of lnapl in zone ii increased and that of lnapl in zone iii decreased in experiment b in zone i where the temperature dropped gradually the volume of lnapl decreased after freezing it is evident that the volume expansion caused by the freezing of water in the saturated zone pushed the lnapl above the water table to migrate up and down simultaneously lnapls migrated to the saturated area and were captured by the aquifer in the form of ganglia consequently the volume of lnapl in zones ii iii and iv increased during thawing pressure release caused lnapl to migrate in reverse under the influence of gravity and capillarity these effects were quite pronounced after 10 ftcs but changes were evident even after the first cycle fig 10b1 b2 4 discussion 4 1 water remobilization under ftcs from the experimental results section 3 3 with ftcs the phenomenon of upward migration of water was observed and the variations in water were different in the two experiments under different cooling rates and freezing temperatures studies have shown that the decrease in soil matrix potential increase in suction near the freezing front is the main driving force for water migration from the unfrozen zone to the frozen zone zhang et al 2014 in the unfrozen zone the difference in soil water potential between two points in the soil is the driving force of water migration the unfrozen water in the frozen soil and the pore water in the unfrozen soil together constitute the source of water migration matrix potential can be calculated by the clausius clapeyron equation in negative temperature frozen porous media kurylyk and watanabe 2013 19 ψ l f v ln t t m where l f is the latent heat of fusion for water v is the specific volume and t m is the melting temperature of the bulk water the matrix potential at freezing was calculated in experiments a and b respectively the results are shown in fig 12 a3 b3 three linear fittings of matrix potential versus distance were completed on the upper part of zfp in experiment a and the upper and lower parts of zfp in experiment b meanwhile the slope of the fitted curve was calculated as the matrix potential gradient gradψ referring to the change of matrix potential per unit distance the matrix potential gradient above zfp in experiment a was 4 780 kpa mm which is 7 99 times that below zfp it follows that the main driving force of water remobilization subject to ftcs is the change in the matrix potential caused by freezing the matrix potential gradient controls the direction and characteristics of water migration water migrates from regions with a small matrix potential gradient to regions with a large matrix potential the matrix potential gradient above zfp in experiment a was 9 325 kpa mm which is 1 95 times that of experiment b however the water remigration in experiment a was less than that in experiment b in experiment a the lowest matrix potential at probe 3 near the zfp decreased to 92 kpa before thawing in experiment b the matrix potential at probe 4 near the zfp was 721 kpa therefore greater matric suction results in greater water migration 4 2 lnapl remobilization under ftcs according to the experimental results and analysis directional freezing with a different controlled temperature gradient caused the following changes in water and lnapl in the 2d micromodel 1 a greater cooling rate and lower freezing temperature resulted in zfp propagating deeper the matrix potential and its gradient controlled by temperature lead to different amounts of water remobilization in experiments a and b 2 lnapl remobilized in the direction of the freezing front caused by ftcs top downward in our experiments in contaminated freezing soils this phenomenon is consistent with previous observations in saturated or unsaturated porous media by ftcs biggar and neufeld 1996 chuvilin et al 2001a b konrad and seto 1991 niven and singh 2008 singh et al 2011 furthermore the horizontal remobilization of lnapl was also observed in experiment b with a high cooling rate and lower freezing temperature 3 lnapl in the area below the freezing front with a temperature above 0 c was promoted to remigrate downward during freezing in experiment a with a lower cooling rate and temperature 4 the remobilization direction of lnapl during thawing was opposite to that during freezing 4 2 1 freezing induced pressure freezing induced pressure associated with volumetric expansion of pore water on lnapl is considered an important driving force for lnapl remobilization in three phase water lnapl ice or four phase systems water air lnapl ice a schematic diagram of the volume changes of the four phases after ftcs in the pores is shown in fig 13 when only two phases exist in the pores fig 13a the volumetric expansion of water lead to an increase in pore volume of vw and intense freezing induced pressure on the incompressible lnapl niven and singh 2008 calculated that freezing induced pressure was about 350 500 mpa in experiments conducted on dodecane at residual saturation 21 26 in a two dimensional water saturated glass bead cell subject to controlled ftcs which was much larger than the capillary pressure thus leading to the remobilization of lnapl however in the unsaturated four phase system fig 12b in the case of progressive freezing pore water occupies the position of air after freezing and the freeze induced pressure will be greatly weakened even if there are no pores in a four phase system the freezing induced pressure is controlled by both water saturation and lnapl saturation lnapl oil at very low saturations does not redistribute during freezing chuvilin et al 1999 chuvilin et al 2001a therefore the lower lnapl saturation mean maximum value 0 16 and water saturation mean maximum value 0 24 in zone i of experiment a partly explains the minimal lnapl remobilization another important factor controlling the redistribution of lnapl is the artificially set cooling rate and freezing temperature the cooling rate is a significant parameter for ice lens formation konrad 1988 and the low cooling rate and freezing temperature in experiment a resulted in a shallower depth of frost front and a smaller scope of freezing induced pressure which ultimately resulted in minimal redistribution of lnapl 4 2 2 capillary pressure lnapl is held in the pores by capillary forces that arise from the pressure drop across the curved interface between two immiscible fluids the pressure drop is defined as the capillary pressure pc with the threshold capillary pressure for lnapl to enter the wetting fluid water as follows 20 p c p l p w 2 σ lw cos θ r where pl is the pressure in the lnapl pw is the pressure in the water phase σlw is the interfacial tension between the lnapl and water θ is the contact angle and r is the pore throat radius the migration of lnapl reaches a stable state when it is balanced by gravity and capillary pressure upon freezing this equilibrium will be upset because of the occurrence of freezing induced pressure and change in capillary pressure due to water migration in the case of saturation the change in capillary force is much lower than that of freezing induced pressure and can be ignored however in the unsaturated case the effect of capillary pressure cannot be ignored in experiment a which had low water content and freezing intensity the top down ftcs promoted lower remobilization of lnapl in the upper frozen zone and instead caused further downward migration of lnapl in the unfrozen zone above the freezing point to the surface of the saturated zone this is due to the upward migration of water in the unfrozen zone during freezing resulting in a decrease in the water content in the pores which caused r to increase the capillary pressure on lnapl to decrease thus downward migration of lnapl was promoted during the thawing process the ice melts leading to the release of pressure and causing lnapl to migrate in the opposite direction from freezing under the action of buoyancy and capillary forces 4 2 3 effect of the number of ftcs on water and lnapl remobilization we conclude that after the 6th ftc the variation in the physical properties of the porous media and the remobilization of lnapl have reached a steady state this is because the structure and physical and mechanical properties of porous media are changed in a certain direction subject to ftcs which makes the variation range of the matrix potential smaller and smaller with the increase in the number of ftcs zhang et al 2014 coincidentally the influence of ftcs on lnapl remobilization mainly occurred before 6 ftcs which was consistent with the characteristics of water redistribution this suggests that the change in the physical properties of porous media by freezing is an important mechanism controlling the remobilization of lnapl according to a previous report singh et al 2011 after ten ftcs the porosity significantly increased to approximately 37 with successive ftcs the variation amplitude of porosity decreased therefore in our experiment after the 6th ftc the physical properties of the porous media and the redistribution of lnapl reached stable states 4 3 implications micro model investigations of dynamic processes are instructive for our understanding of lnapl migration in porous media subject to ftcs and is also a prerequisite for mechanistic studies at the pore scale simulating the natural temperature conditions of cold regions in the laboratory has always been a difficult problem that has restricted research at the same time a non destructive non intrusive tool to quantify lnapl saturation is urgently needed in this study we combined a temperature control system and an ltv system to measure lnapl saturation in a three or four phase system under the control of ftcs it should be noted that the setting of the temperature control system must be adjusted under different model scales and properties of porous media the results indicate that the factors affecting the remobilization of lnapl are the cooling rate freezing temperature water saturation and lnapl saturation lnapl remobilization is mainly controlled by the freezing induced pressure and capillary force however the quantification of these two pressures on lnapl during freezing in unsaturated porous media requires further study some laboratory results and site investigations have also observed vertical migration of soil in permafrost biggar et al 1998 and chuvilin and miklyaeva 2003 suggested that microcracks formed in the freezing medium are a potential route for lnapl diffusion in the freezing medium similar to the experiment reported by iwakun et al 2010 micro cracks caused by freezing were observed in experiment b as shown in fig 14 however although microcracks were observed although a microcrack was observed above the water table after the 4th ftc no obvious migration of lnapl along the microcracks was observed therefore this mechanism requires further verification it is very difficult to conduct site investigations in cold regions and laboratory experiments are a more suitable simulation method the modified ltv technique proposed in this paper is of great reference value for the study of petroleum pollutants in frozen unsaturated porous media for contaminated areas in cold regions site investigations of permafrost have shown that frozen soil does is not considered as an impermeable barrier to contaminants the migration of lnapl in frozen soil may be deeper than we have previously understood especially in seasonal frozen regions that undergo seasonal freeze thaw cycles the prevention and treatment of pollutants in frozen soil should consider the remobilization of pollutants this study provides a good starting point for discussion and further research nevertheless some limitations of this research deserve attention first the 2 d micromodel did not perfectly reproduce the 3 d porous media structure furthermore whether lnapl contaminated porous media of silts and clay exhibit such dramatic changes with ftcs warrants further investigation 5 conclusion in this study a previous ltv technique for calculating fluid saturation in two phase systems was modified to calculate lnapl saturation in a three phase water air lnapl or four phase system water ice air lnapl strong correlation was found between the injected lnapl amounts into the 2 d flow chamber and the calculated lnapl amounts indicating that modified ltv technique can provide high resolution data for lnapl saturation measurements the remobilization characteristics of lnapl were revealed in unsaturated porous media subjected to ftcs using modified ltv technique the results showed that with the number of ftcs lnapl increasingly remobilized in the freezing front and horizontal directions in unsaturated pores meanwhile lnapl in the area below the freezing front is also promoted to remigrate downward during freezing lnapl migrated in the opposite direction during thawing further analysis suggests that lnapl remobilization is caused by a combination of freezing induced pressure and changes in capillary pressure affected by water migration rather than through microcracks in the frozen porous media this study has important implications for understanding and remediating lnapls in seasonally frozen soils and polar regions moreover the experimental method proposed in this paper is of great reference

3854,isoscapes are useful tools for studies concerned with hydroclimatic processes at multiple scales and their effects on water resources however few studies have been conducted on the application of landscape ecology methods for the characterization of isoscape patterns and their impact factors in this work measurements of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition were performed on 112 pond water samples from the water source forest of the hani terraced fields the spatial gradients of pond water isotope compositions and the altitude factor of these gradients were then analysed according to the topography of the study area using spatial interpolation and gradient analysis methods it was found that 1 the pond water evaporation line pwel of the study area was δd 6 28δ18o 5 5 r 2 0 96 n 112 the gradient and intercept of the pwel were lower than those of the global meteoric water line gmwl and local meteoric water line lmwl indicative of intense evaporation 2 inverse distance weighting idw interpolation natural neighbourhood interpolation spline interpolation kriging and co kriging with altitude as an auxiliary variable were compared and idw interpolation was demonstrated to be the most precise of these methods idw interpolation demonstrated that pond water δ18o values generally increased with decreased altitude in e w s n and se nw directions across the study area 3 gradient analysis demonstrated that δ18o generally decreased with increased altitude across the whole region and at watershed scales the δ18o was significantly correlated with altitude on virtually all transects therefore altitude is one of the key factors for the spatial pattern in the stable isotope compositions of the study area s pond water this was less pronounced in the e w transect across the study area as its isotope compositions were affected by watershed level patterns in summary this work has established a new approach for the analysis of water body isoscapes and their altitude factor by adopting methods of pattern analysis from landscape ecology keywords hani rice terrace pond water stable oxygen and hydrogen isoscapes gradient characteristics altitude 1 introduction landscape mapping pertains to the use of graphical methods to study landscape patterns and processes isotope landscapes isoscapes in particular are geologic maps used to characterize the spatiotemporal distributions of multiple isotopes and their variations isoscapes are obtained by applying spatial interpolation methods or prediction models to geographic information system gis maps and they facilitate studies of the spatiotemporal distribution of isotope ratios bowen 2010 bowen and wilkinson 2002 carol et al 2001 west et al 2010 hence isoscapes serve as a framework for the visualization and identification of isotopic patterns and the elucidation of their drivers and they have immense practical potential in multiple domains including hydrology ecology environmental science food science and forensic medicine stable isotopes of oxygen 18o and hydrogen 2h of water are indicators of the fractionation of water craig 1961 dansgaard 1953 1964 gat 1996 2010 rozanski et al 1993 that can be used for the identification and characterization of water related patterns and processes lee and kim 2007 mcguire and mcdonnell 2007 rozanski et al 1993 water isoscapes are an effective method for the study of hydroclimatic processes and spatial pattern on multiple scales birkel et al 2020 bowen et al 2019 bowen and good 2015 which can be used to visualize and thus trace hydrological processes bowen et al 2009 gautam et al 2020 remmer et al 2020 over the past 15 years water isoscapes have been used to study isotope patterns in precipitation allen et al 2018 bowen and revenaugh 2003 hatvani et al 2020 terzer et al 2013 groundwater scheliga et al 2017 wassenaar et al 2009 wright and novakowski 2020 surface water birkel et al 2018 brooks et al 2012 mountain et al 2015 and other atmospherically derived water valle et al 2016 wang et al 2018 west et al 2014 precipitation isoscapes have been used in studies of regional atmospheric water balances bowen et al 2015 palaeoclimate reconstruction chamberlain et al 2015 jasechko et al 2015 kukla et al 2019 mix et al 2011 and the discrimination of regional water sources vachon et al 2010 for instance isoscapes have been used to study δ18o precipitation values across china liu et al 2009 the tibetan plateau he et al 2015 and the water of lake fuxian in yunnan li et al 2021 studies of surface and groundwater isoscapes usually focus on the determination of water sources the identification and quantification of isotopic fractionation and recharge discharge relationships between water bodies cherry et al 2020 sanchez murillo and birkel 2016 sprenger et al 2017 generally most isoscape studies have used precipitation isoscapes rather than surface water isoscapes and they are generally performed on regional or global scales rather than finer sub regional scales these studies typically focus the creation of δ18o and δ2h isoscapes and recharge discharge relationships but none has utilized landscape pattern analysis to describe their spatiotemporal patterns and impact factors furthermore most studies only specify the spatial interpolation method that was used to create the water isoscape not their selection criteria nor the exact parameters of the interpolation process at present guiding standards for the selection of isoscape interpolation methods are essentially absent birkel et al 2018 the honghe hani rice terraces in southern yunnan were listed as a unesco world heritage site in 2013 due to their unique landscape and water use system the hani tribe have historically used a water storage system consisting of chains of small and shallow ponds these ponds were excavated in the lower lying parts of an upstream forest area and their purpose is to ensure that the terraces would be adequately watered throughout the year especially during the dry season nov mar inclusive the ponds are thus dependent on the forest conserved water source through a recharge discharge relationship by providing an adequate supply of water to terraced fields downstream these ponds play a crucial role in ensuring the long term sustainability of this unique landscape as the pond water is typically recharged by precipitation their water isoscapes should reflect local hydrological and environmental conditions hence this is an ideal area for the study of small scale hydrological processes consequently isoscape mapping was performed on the upstream forests of the hani rice terraces the aims of this study were as follows 1 the formulation of reasonable selection criteria for isoscape interpolation methods and the creation of a finely resolved surface water pond water isoscapes for this region 2 to investigate the spatial pattern and altitude factor of the local water isoscape using established methods of landscape pattern analysis this work shall create a novel analytical framework for the creation of water isoscapes and the analysis of their spatial patterns and also inform decisions regarding the management of water supplies for the hani terraced fields 2 study area and methodology 2 1 study area the study area lies in the central region of the honghe hani rice terraces in yuanyang county in the honghe hani and yi autonomous prefecture of yunnan province 102 44 7 102 46 32 e 23 6 46 23 5 2 n fig 1 topographically the study area is located in the upstream forests of the malizhai river basin on the northern slopes of the southern section of the ailao mountains the altitude of the study area ranges from 1780 m to 2148 m this area has a subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 14 19 c and annual average precipitation of 1353 8 mm it has well defined dry and rainy seasons most precipitation falls during the rainy season between june and august inclusive furthermore the study area is densely forested the hani tribe has over a long period of time created a unique water storage system that consists of small shallow ponds along ditches in the study area which are arranged in chains this pond system plays a critical role in maintaining the sustainability of the hani rice terraces and the management of local water resources 2 2 acquisition and measurement of pond water samples the samples were packed in 100 ml polyethylene bottles before the sampling the bottles were washed thrice with pond water and then rapidly filled after ensuring that there were no bubbles in the bottles they were sealed with a sealant and labelled for reserve the hydrogen and oxygen isotope tests were conducted in the key laboratory of plateau lake ecology and global change yunnan normal university using a picarrol2130 i ultra high precision liquid water and moisture isotope analyser the measurement accuracy of 18o and d of the instrument was 0 1 and 0 5 respectively the final analysis results were expressed by the thousandth difference relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow as follows 1 δ 18 o r sample r v s m o w 1 1 000 in this equation rsample and rv smow are the stable isotope ratio r 18o 16o of the water sample and the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow isotopic standard respectively the deuterium excess d excess which was proposed by dansgaard dansgaard 1964 indicates the deviation of some sample from the global meteoric water line gmwl in terms of their stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions it is a function of δ18o and δd as shown below 2 δ d δ d 8 δ 18 o 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 spatial interpolation methods to produce a water isoscape of the forest ponds of the hani terraced fields it is necessary to interpolate spatially the sampled oxygen and hydrogen isotope values of the pond water spatial interpolation was performed in the spatial analyst and geostatistical analyst tools of arcgis 10 3 a variety of mathematical models can be used to fit local isotopic compositions and the most common of interpolation methods include deterministic interpolation methods such as inverse distance weighted idw interpolation natural neighborhood interpolation and spline interpolation and another kind of geostatistical method the major difference between all interpolation methods is mainly the way of calculating weight values of each point of the neighborhood probabilistic methods geostatistical method unlike deterministic ones take into account the degree of similarity observed in the calculation of weight values while probabilistic methods family kriging takes into account the spatial correlation between samples in the calculation of weight values khazaz et al 2015 li 2008 1 idw interpolation at each interpolated point the influence of a known data point is given a weight that is inversely related to its distance from the interpolated point this is an efficient and intuitive method for spatial analysis azpurua and ramos 2010 3 z i 1 n 1 d i p z i i 1 n 1 d i p in this equation z is the estimated value of the interpolated point zi i 1 n are the values of the measured points di is the distance between the interpolated point and the i th measured point n is the number of measured samples in the computation p is the power parameter 2 spline interpolation in this method a polynomial is used to produce a smooth curve that fits the sample data 4 z 1 i 1 n λ i r d i t x y in this equation z 1 is the estimated value of the interpolated point n is the number of measured samples in the computation λi are solution coefficients for the linear equation set di is the distance between the estimated value and the i th measured sample x and y are horizontal and vertical coordinates of a cartesian coordinate system r di is a function of the independent variable di t x y is a binary linear equation set with and y as independent variables 3 natural neighbourhood interpolation the values and distances of the closest points are used to estimate the area of each pixel 4 ordinary kriging o kriging kriging is a geostatistical method used for spatial interpolation unlike other spatial interpolation algorithms e g idw natural neighbourhood interpolation or spline interpolation kriging is a best linear unbiased estimator in this procedure the variance of the spatial attribute is used to determine the range of distances that affect the value of the to be interpolated point the samples in this range are then used to estimate the attribute value of the to be interpolated point 5 z 2 i 1 n z i λ i in this equation z 2 is the to be estimated value zi is the known value of the i th point n is the number of samples in the computation λi is the weight of point i the weights λi are computed from the kriging equation set 6 i 1 n λ i c x i x j u c x i x 0 7 i 1 n λ i 1 in this equation u is a lagrange multiplier c xi x 0 is the covariance between a sample point and interpolated point c xi xj is the covariance between two sample points 5 co kriging this method generalizes kriging for two or more variables one variable is the primary variable while the other variables are auxiliary variables in co kriging the best linear unbiased estimate is produced by combining the auto correlations of the primary variable with the cross correlations of the auxiliary variables 8 z i 1 n λ 1 i z 1 x i j 1 a λ 2 j z 2 x j in this equation z x 0 is the estimated value of the to be estimated point x 0 z 1 xi and z 2 xi are the measured values of the primary variable z 1 and auxiliary variable z 2 λ 1 i and λ 2 j are the weights assigned to z 1 and z 2 with i 1 n λ 1 i 1 and j 1 a λ 2 j 0 n and a are the number of measured z 1 and z 2 samples participating in the estimation of x 0 in this study the auxiliary variable was altitude 2 3 2 assessment of spatial interpolations most importantly the statistical methods can directly evaluate the accuracy of interpolation results through cross validation while deterministic methods can not be evaluated in the same way therefore we compared accuracy of all interpolation methods by calculating the mean error me and root mean square prediction error rmse between estimated values and actual observations rather than mixing the two evaluation methods to evaluate their accuracy to assess the precision of each spatial interpolation method 30 of the 112 sampling points in the study area were randomly selected as error measurement points using arcgis 10 3 the 78 remaining stations were used as the basis for the interpolation computations the spatial analysis function in arcgis was then used to read out and compare the estimates to their true values the mean errors me and root mean square errors rmse of each method were then assessed the optimal method should have a me close to 0 and the lowest rmse and mse values guillemette et al 2009 yang et al 2014 their calculating equations are in following 9 me 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i 2 in these equations z xi is the actual value while z xi is the predicted value 2 3 3 gradient analysis in landscape ecology the gradient pattern refers to the spatial characteristics that landscape characteristics change regularly and gradually along one or more directions such as altitude gradient soil nutrient gradient water gradient temperature gradient precipitation gradient and human disturbance gradient and so on mcgarigal and cushman 2005 zeng 2017 gradient analysis is a popular method used to elucidate landscape spatial patterns along transects or gradients chen et al 2008 luck and wu 2002 it has been used to study the effects of urbanization of vegetation distributions sukopp 1998 and ecosystem properties pouyat and mcdonnell 1991 pouyat et al 1995 in more recent studies luck and wu luck and wu 2002 and zhang et al zhang et al 2004 used gradient analysis to probe the spatial differentiation of certain landscape types and patterns and the ecological consequences of urban landscape patterns and urbanization kong and nakagoshi 2006 however until now no one has tried to apply it into isotopes field in fact water isoscape is the map that characterizes the spatiotemporal distribution patterns and changes of isotopic compositions therefore in this work for the first time the gradient analysis technique is used to reveal the spatial gradients in pond water isoscapes and their impact factors at a polygon unit rather than point or line unit since the topography of the study area trends in the se nw direction and is sloped in the se nw direction a se nw transect was drawn between the highest and lowest points of the study area transect b e w transects and n s transects were also drawn at the geographic centre of the study area and in 450 m and 1000 m intervals from the centre respectively the e w transects are transects e f and g while the n s transects are transects a c and d in addition the study area was divided into small watersheds and watershed transects were drawn along their streams on each transect isotope and altitude data were acquired in 10 m intervals δ18o and altitude were then plotted against distance from the origin of the transect so as to reveal the gradient characteristics of δ18o values along each transect 3 results and analysis 3 1 h and o isotope ratios of the pond water the δ18o values of the 112 pond water samples in the study area range from 12 55 to 4 7 range 7 85 and have a mean of 9 28 the δd values range from 87 31 to 34 55 range 52 76 and have a mean of 63 83 the d excess values range from 0 96 to 14 35 range 13 39 and have a mean of 10 37 craig observed that the δ18o and δd of 400 water samples from rivers lakes and precipitation across the globe are related by a linear relation δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 this is called the global meteoric water line gmwl and it is a standard for the adjudgement of local precipitation isotope compositions since water bodies in different regions will have different water vapour sources and evaporation processes local meteoric water lines lmwls often deviate from the gmwl a pond water evaporation line pwel was obtained for the study area by performing a linear regression on their δ18o and δd values as shown in fig 2 the linear equation of the pwel is δd 6 28δ18o 5 5 r 2 0 96 n 112 and the δ18o and δd values closely fit this linear trend in terms of precipitation isotope compositions previous studies obtained the lmwl july in the water source area in july red line in fig 2 ma et al 2016 and the lmwl rainy season grey line in fig 2 during each month of the rainy season from may to october in 2015 jiao et al 2019 as compared to the gmwl blue line the lmwl july and the lmwl rainy season the pwel has a lower gradient and intercept and is more similar to the gmwl and the lmwl rainy season than the lwml july and it can be found that pwel and lmwl rainy season intersect with gwml the low gradient and intercept imply that the pond water was strongly affected by evaporation which causes isotopic fractionation from the distribution figure of pond water sampling points we can see that some pond water sampling points are close to lwml july and some of them are close to the gmwl overall the pond water is in a long term retention state and is affected by precipitation input for a long time the isotope value of pond water is a mixed value the gmwl is actually a synthesis of many lmwls in other words the pwel is a mixed line therefore there is an interaction between pwel and gmwl 3 2 interpolation methods for pond water isoscapes and precision analysis of the 11 training models provided by the geostatistical analysis module for co kriging interpolation the spherical exponential and gaussian models are generally speaking the most commonly used models in this work by comparing the cross validation accuracy obtained in the geostatistical wizard it was found that the gaussian model gives the best precision in co kriging table 1 then the co kriging method with altitude as an auxiliary variable is also used to interpolate the δ18o value of pond water between the 5 interpolation methods table 2 idw interpolation was found to be the most precise as it has the lowest rmse 1 289 and a me close to 0 0 015 hence as compared to spline natural neighbourhood kriging and co kriging interpolation idw interpolation is the best interpolation method for isoscape mapping 3 3 pond water isoscapes and their spatial patterns an isoscape was created by performing idw interpolation on the pond water isotope ratios as shown in fig 3 here it is shown that the δ18o and δd distributions are similar to each other but nearly diametrically opposed to the d excess distribution hence the isoscape contains three distinct gradients in the e w direction δ18o and δd values become increasingly positive towards the west in the n s direction δ18o and δd values increase from north to south in the se nw direction the topographic trend of the study area the δ18o and δd values increase from se to nw and also exhibit pronounced isotopic zonations the low lying western regions have especially high more positive δ18o and δd values while the elevated eastern regions have low more negative δ18o and δd values the δ18o and δd values show significant negative correlations with altitude in the d excess map it may be observed the se and nw regions have high and low d excess values respectively therefore d excess increases with increases in altitude and the eastern region has high water vapour recycling ratios 4 discussion 4 1 gradients of the pond water isoscape and their correlation with altitude 4 1 1 whole region transects to analyse the isoscape gradients of the study area and their altitude factor in further detail 7 gradient analysis transects were drawn across the study area in the nw ew and se nw directions as shown in fig 4 h these transects were designed based on the spatial characteristics of the pond water isoscapes and the topography of the study area according to the transects curves of the δ18o values and altitudes varied with distances fig 4 a b c d the n s transects fig 4h a 4h c and 4h d and se nw transect fig 4h b all show relatively smooth curves of δ18o and altitude varied with distances the se nw transect in particular has the smoothest curve among all transects the transects b c and d show the increasing trends of δ18o when the decreasing ones of altitude along distances fig 4 b c d while transect a shows the inverse trend fig 4 a as a whole there is a significant negative correlation between δ18o and altitude in the study area likewise the e w transects fig 4h e 4h f and 4h g also show that differences in altitude are the impact factor of variations in the spatial pattern of pond water isotopic compositions however as the watersheds crossed by transects e f and g have significant variations in altitude altitude and δ18o values fluctuate strongly along these transects fig 4 e f and g the highest and lowest altitudes of the study area are 2148 m and 1780 m respectively which corresponds to an altitude range of 369 m most parts of the study area have altitudes between 1800 m and 2000 m on short time scales factors like water vapour sources precipitation levels and temperatures are effectively identical across the study area given the observed altitude effect in pond water isotope compositions these factors may be safely excluded from the isoscape analysis the pond water δ18o measurements that were taken in july 2014 were averaged in 10 m altitude intervals which resulted in 18 averaged δ18o values a correlation analysis was then performed between the averaged δ18o values and altitude as shown in fig 5 here it is shown that δ18o is significantly negatively correlated with altitude p 0 05 hence altitude has a significant effect on pond water δ18o values in some studies co kriging interpolation was used to incorporate environmental factors like temperature precipitation and altitude and thus improve interpolation precision li et al 2011 yang et al 2014 however when co kriging interpolation was performed with altitude as the auxiliary variable the results were less precise than those of idw interpolation this could be caused by the spatial heterogeneity of the study area the correlation between isotope composition and altitude was calculated for all transects in the study area as well as their corresponding lapse rates table 3 it is shown that the correlation between δ18o and altitude was significant onthe se nw transect b and n s transects a c and d at significance levels greater than 0 01 on transects b c and d the values of δ18o were significantly negatively correlated with altitude since transect a is located in the low altitude western region it is only sparsely vegetated furthermore the δ18o measurements on this transect were also affected by the dayutang reservoir this is why there is a mildly positive correlation between δ18o and altitude on transect a the lapse rates of transects a b c and d are 0 52 100 m 0 75 100 m 0 62 100 m and 0 67 100 m respectively the correlation between δ18o and altitude on the e w transects e f and g is poor due to the large altitude variations of these transects some of these transects also failed to pass the significance test therefore the lapse rates of the e w transects were not calculated 4 1 2 watershed transects since the gradient analysis on whole region transects revealed that altitude variations in the watersheds affect the spatial distribution of isotope compositions the study area was divided into 7 small watersheds transects were then drawn along the streams of these watersheds fig 6 h δ18o and altitude are very significantly correlated in the k l n and o watershed transects table 4 according to the transects curves fig 6 a g of the δ18o values and altitudes varied with distances the transects k l n and o fig 6h show the increasing trends of δ18o when the decreasing ones of altitude along distances fig 6 c d f g while the western transects i j and m fig 6h show the complex variation trends fig 6 a b and e which is due to the small watershed area and the unobvious altitude effect the characteristics of western transect i are consistent with those of transect a on transects k l n and o δ18o is strongly negatively correlated with altitude and their lapse rates are 1 97 100 m 0 52 100 m 1 62 100 m and 0 59 100 m respectively according to this analysis the change in pond water δ18o with altitude varies from one watershed to another and there are significant differences between the eastern and western regions these differences of variations are responsible for the isoscape variances of the study area in the e w direction in summary the isotope compositions on all of the transects are quite strongly correlated with altitude on the whole region scale this correlation is strongest in the se nw transect and weakest on the e w transects furthermore isotope compositions seem to alternate between peaks and valleys in the e w direction the trends on the e w direction were caused by differences between one watershed and another in terms of the relationship between pond water δ18o and altitude at the watershed scale altitude is still an important factor of the pond water isoscapes however the altitude effect was less pronounced in very small watersheds although the whole region e w transects were affected by inter watershed differences altitude still affectsisoscapes of pond water δ18o within each watershed 4 2 other factors of the pond water isoscapes in reality pond water isoscapes are affected by a diverse and complex multitude of factors from the perspective of the water cycle pond water are surface water bodies and thus have isoscapes that are strongly reliant on the precipitation of their feeder watersheds precipitation isotope compositions are affected by temperature amount of precipitation and elevation dansgaard 1964 whereas precipitation isotope gradients are affected by topography vapour transport and the water energy balance kukla et al 2019 therefore pond water isotope compositions are affected by both precipitation and landscape flow processes e g mixing infiltration and evaporation gonfiantini et al 1998 mcdonnell et al 1991 sprenger et al 2017 these processes can also be affected by human activities like the construction of dams and water extraction for crop irrigation yang et al 2020 at present some studies have been performed where the multitude of factors that affect surface water isotope compositions were taken into account and used to interpolate precipitation isoscapes for instance birkel et al used a geographically weighted regression model to link surface water isotope compositions with environmental variables and thus characterized the dynamic surface water isoscapes of scotland they also determined the primary drivers of isoscape variance which include land cover and hydroclimate variables it has also been shown that surface water isoscapes can be affected by the selection of sampling locations and regression models wheeler and calder 2007 as well as the atmospheric general circulation model and its transport pathways birks and edwards 2009 noone et al 2002 however further research will be required to incorporate these factors into isoscape interpolation 5 conclusions based on the pattern analysis methods of landscape ecology we have proposed an approach for the analysis of water body isoscapes and their altitude factors and demonstrated the viability of this approach the δ18o values of the hani terraced fields pond water ranged from 12 55 to 4 7 with an average of 9 28 the δd value ranged from 87 31 to 34 55 with an average of 63 83 the resulting evaporation line pwel was δd 6 28δ18o 5 5 r 2 0 96 n 112 as the gradient and intercept of the pwel are both markedly lower than those of the gmwl and the lmwl of the study area the pond water are strongly affected by evaporation which caused isotopic fractionation idw interpolation was found to be the most precise of the five spatial interpolation methods that were tested in this study the pond water isoscape created by idw interpolation is characterized by three distinct gradients 1 increasingly positive δ18o and δd values from east to west 2 increasing δ18o and δd values from north to south and 3 increasing δ18o and δd values along the topographic trend of the study area se to nw with pronounced isotopic zonations the δ18o and δd distributions are similar to each other and almost diametrically opposed to the d excess distribution pond water isotope composition is significantly correlated with altitude on the whole region and watershed transects which indicates that the gradients of the pond water isoscape are generally affected by altitude the e w transect shows the weakest correlation as it is affected by the watershed patterns of the study area inside each watershed altitude is still affects variations

3854,isoscapes are useful tools for studies concerned with hydroclimatic processes at multiple scales and their effects on water resources however few studies have been conducted on the application of landscape ecology methods for the characterization of isoscape patterns and their impact factors in this work measurements of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition were performed on 112 pond water samples from the water source forest of the hani terraced fields the spatial gradients of pond water isotope compositions and the altitude factor of these gradients were then analysed according to the topography of the study area using spatial interpolation and gradient analysis methods it was found that 1 the pond water evaporation line pwel of the study area was δd 6 28δ18o 5 5 r 2 0 96 n 112 the gradient and intercept of the pwel were lower than those of the global meteoric water line gmwl and local meteoric water line lmwl indicative of intense evaporation 2 inverse distance weighting idw interpolation natural neighbourhood interpolation spline interpolation kriging and co kriging with altitude as an auxiliary variable were compared and idw interpolation was demonstrated to be the most precise of these methods idw interpolation demonstrated that pond water δ18o values generally increased with decreased altitude in e w s n and se nw directions across the study area 3 gradient analysis demonstrated that δ18o generally decreased with increased altitude across the whole region and at watershed scales the δ18o was significantly correlated with altitude on virtually all transects therefore altitude is one of the key factors for the spatial pattern in the stable isotope compositions of the study area s pond water this was less pronounced in the e w transect across the study area as its isotope compositions were affected by watershed level patterns in summary this work has established a new approach for the analysis of water body isoscapes and their altitude factor by adopting methods of pattern analysis from landscape ecology keywords hani rice terrace pond water stable oxygen and hydrogen isoscapes gradient characteristics altitude 1 introduction landscape mapping pertains to the use of graphical methods to study landscape patterns and processes isotope landscapes isoscapes in particular are geologic maps used to characterize the spatiotemporal distributions of multiple isotopes and their variations isoscapes are obtained by applying spatial interpolation methods or prediction models to geographic information system gis maps and they facilitate studies of the spatiotemporal distribution of isotope ratios bowen 2010 bowen and wilkinson 2002 carol et al 2001 west et al 2010 hence isoscapes serve as a framework for the visualization and identification of isotopic patterns and the elucidation of their drivers and they have immense practical potential in multiple domains including hydrology ecology environmental science food science and forensic medicine stable isotopes of oxygen 18o and hydrogen 2h of water are indicators of the fractionation of water craig 1961 dansgaard 1953 1964 gat 1996 2010 rozanski et

effective method for the study of hydroclimatic processes and spatial pattern on multiple scales birkel et al 2020 bowen et al 2019 bowen and good 2015 which can be used to visualize and thus trace hydrological processes bowen et al 2009 gautam et al 2020 remmer et al 2020 over the past 15 years water isoscapes have been used to study isotope patterns in precipitation allen et al 2018 bowen and revenaugh 2003 hatvani et al 2020 terzer et al 2013 groundwater scheliga et al 2017 wassenaar et al 2009 wright and novakowski 2020 surface water birkel et al 2018 brooks et al 2012 mountain et al 2015 and other atmospherically derived water valle et al 2016 wang et al 2018 west et al 2014 precipitation isoscapes have been used in studies of regional atmospheric water balances bowen et al 2015 palaeoclimate reconstruction chamberlain et al 2015 jasechko et al 2015 kukla et al 2019 mix et al 2011 and the discrimination of regional water sources vachon et al 2010 for instance isoscapes have been used to study δ18o precipitation values across china liu et al 2009 the tibetan plateau he et al 2015 and the water of lake fuxian in yunnan li et al 2021 studies of surface and groundwater isoscapes usually focus on the determination of water sources the identification and quantification of isotopic fractionation and recharge discharge relationships between water bodies cherry et al 2020 sanchez murillo and birkel 2016 sprenger et al 2017 generally most isoscape studies have used precipitation isoscapes rather than surface water isoscapes and they are generally performed on regional or global scales rather than finer sub regional scales these studies typically focus the creation of δ18o and δ2h isoscapes and recharge discharge relationships but none has utilized landscape pattern analysis to describe their spatiotemporal patterns and impact factors furthermore most studies only specify the spatial interpolation method that was used to create the water isoscape not their selection criteria nor the exact parameters of the interpolation process at present guiding standards for the selection of isoscape interpolation methods are essentially absent birkel et al 2018 the honghe hani rice terraces in southern yunnan were listed as a unesco world heritage site in 2013 due to their unique landscape and water use system the hani tribe have historically used a water storage system consisting of chains of small and shallow ponds these ponds were excavated in the lower lying parts of an upstream forest area and their purpose is to ensure that the terraces would be adequately watered throughout the year especially during the dry season nov mar inclusive the ponds are thus dependent on the forest conserved water source through a recharge discharge relationship by providing an adequate supply of water to terraced fields downstream these ponds play a crucial role in ensuring the long term sustainability of this unique landscape as the pond water is typically recharged by precipitation their water isoscapes should reflect local hydrological and environmental conditions hence this is an ideal area for the study of small scale hydrological processes consequently isoscape mapping was performed on the upstream forests of the hani rice terraces the aims of this study were as follows 1 the formulation of reasonable selection criteria for isoscape interpolation methods and the creation of a finely resolved surface water pond water isoscapes for this region 2 to investigate the spatial pattern and altitude factor of the local water isoscape using established methods of landscape pattern analysis this work shall create a novel analytical framework for the creation of water isoscapes and the analysis of their spatial patterns and also inform decisions regarding the management of water supplies for the hani terraced fields 2 study area and methodology 2 1 study area the study area lies in the central region of the honghe hani rice terraces in yuanyang county in the honghe hani and yi autonomous prefecture of yunnan province 102 44 7 102 46 32 e 23 6 46 23 5 2 n fig 1 topographically the study area is located in the upstream forests of the malizhai river basin on the northern slopes of the southern section of the ailao mountains the altitude of the study area ranges from 1780 m to 2148 m this area has a subtropical monsoon climate with an annual average temperature of 14 19 c and annual average precipitation of 1353 8 mm it has well defined dry and rainy seasons most precipitation falls during the rainy season between june and august inclusive furthermore the study area is densely forested the hani tribe has over a long period of time created a unique water storage system that consists of small shallow ponds along ditches in the study area which are arranged in chains this pond system plays a critical role in maintaining the sustainability of the hani rice terraces and the management of local water resources 2 2 acquisition and measurement of pond water samples the samples were packed in 100 ml polyethylene bottles before the sampling the bottles were washed thrice with pond water and then rapidly filled after ensuring that there were no bubbles in the bottles they were sealed with a sealant and labelled for reserve the hydrogen and oxygen isotope tests were conducted in the key laboratory of plateau lake ecology and global change yunnan normal university using a picarrol2130 i ultra high precision liquid water and moisture isotope analyser the measurement accuracy of 18o and d of the instrument was 0 1 and 0 5 respectively the final analysis results were expressed by the thousandth difference relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow as follows 1 δ 18 o r sample r v s m o w 1 1 000 in this equation rsample and rv smow are the stable isotope ratio r 18o 16o of the water sample and the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow isotopic standard respectively the deuterium excess d excess which was proposed by dansgaard dansgaard 1964 indicates the deviation of some sample from the global meteoric water line gmwl in terms of their stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions it is a function of δ18o and δd as shown below 2 δ d δ d 8 δ 18 o 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 spatial interpolation methods to produce a water isoscape of the forest ponds of the hani terraced fields it is necessary to interpolate spatially the sampled oxygen and hydrogen isotope values of the pond water spatial interpolation was performed in the spatial analyst and geostatistical analyst tools of arcgis 10 3 a variety of mathematical models can be used to fit local isotopic compositions and the most common of interpolation methods include deterministic interpolation methods such as inverse distance weighted idw interpolation natural neighborhood interpolation and spline interpolation and another kind of geostatistical method the major difference between all interpolation methods is mainly the way of calculating weight values of each point of the neighborhood probabilistic methods geostatistical method unlike deterministic ones take into account the degree of similarity observed in the calculation of weight values while probabilistic methods family kriging takes into account the spatial correlation between samples in the calculation of weight values khazaz et al 2015 li 2008 1 idw interpolation at each interpolated point the influence of a known data point is given a weight that is inversely related to its distance from the interpolated point this is an efficient and intuitive method for spatial analysis azpurua and ramos 2010 3 z i 1 n 1 d i p z i i 1 n 1 d i p in this equation z is the estimated value of the interpolated point zi i 1 n are the values of the measured points di is the distance between the interpolated point and the i th measured point n is the number of measured samples in the computation p is the power parameter 2 spline interpolation in this method a polynomial is used to produce a smooth curve that fits the sample data 4 z 1 i 1 n λ i r d i t x y in this equation z 1 is the estimated value of the interpolated point n is the number of measured samples in the computation λi are solution coefficients for the linear equation set di is the distance between the estimated value and the i th measured sample x and y are horizontal and vertical coordinates of a cartesian coordinate system r di is a function of the independent variable di t x y is a binary linear equation set with and y as independent variables 3 natural neighbourhood interpolation the values and distances of the closest points are used to estimate the area of each pixel 4 ordinary kriging o kriging kriging is a geostatistical method used for spatial interpolation unlike other spatial interpolation algorithms e g idw natural neighbourhood interpolation or spline interpolation kriging is a best linear unbiased estimator in this procedure the variance of the spatial attribute is used to determine the range of distances that affect the value of the to be interpolated point the samples in this range are then used to estimate the attribute value of the to be interpolated point 5 z 2 i 1 n z i λ i in this equation z 2 is the to be estimated value zi is the known value of the i th point n is the number of samples in the computation λi is the weight of point i the weights λi are computed from the kriging equation set 6 i 1 n λ i c x i x j u c x i x 0 7 i 1 n λ i 1 in this equation u is a lagrange multiplier c xi x 0 is the covariance between a sample point and interpolated point c xi xj is the covariance between two sample points 5 co kriging this method generalizes kriging for two or more variables one variable is the primary variable while the other variables are auxiliary variables in co kriging the best linear unbiased estimate is produced by combining the auto correlations of the primary variable with the cross correlations of the auxiliary variables 8 z i 1 n λ 1 i z 1 x i j 1 a λ 2 j z 2 x j in this equation z x 0 is the estimated value of the to be estimated point x 0 z 1 xi and z 2 xi are the measured values of the primary variable z 1 and auxiliary variable z 2 λ 1 i and λ 2 j are the weights assigned to z 1 and z 2 with i 1 n λ 1 i 1 and j 1 a λ 2 j 0 n and a are the number of measured z 1 and z 2 samples participating in the estimation of x 0 in this study the auxiliary variable was altitude 2 3 2 assessment of spatial interpolations most importantly the statistical methods can directly evaluate the accuracy of interpolation results through cross validation while deterministic methods can not be evaluated in the same way therefore we compared accuracy of all interpolation methods by calculating the mean error me and root mean square prediction error rmse between estimated values and actual observations rather than mixing the two evaluation methods to evaluate their accuracy to assess the precision of each spatial interpolation method 30 of the 112 sampling points in the study area were randomly selected as error measurement points using arcgis 10 3 the 78 remaining stations were used as the basis for the interpolation computations the spatial analysis function in arcgis was then used to read out and compare the estimates to their true values the mean errors me and root mean square errors rmse of each method were then assessed the optimal method should have a me close to 0 and the lowest rmse and mse values guillemette et al 2009 yang et al 2014 their calculating equations are in following 9 me 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i 2 in these equations z xi is the actual value while z xi is the predicted value 2 3 3 gradient analysis in landscape ecology the gradient pattern refers to the spatial characteristics that landscape characteristics change regularly and gradually along one or more directions such as altitude gradient soil nutrient gradient water gradient temperature gradient precipitation gradient and human disturbance gradient and so on mcgarigal and cushman 2005 zeng 2017 gradient analysis is a popular method used to elucidate landscape spatial patterns along transects or gradients chen et al 2008 luck and wu 2002 it has been used to study the effects of urbanization of vegetation distributions sukopp 1998 and ecosystem properties pouyat and mcdonnell 1991 pouyat et al 1995 in more recent studies luck and wu luck and wu 2002 and zhang et al zhang et al 2004 used gradient analysis to probe the spatial differentiation of certain landscape types and patterns and the ecological consequences of urban landscape patterns and urbanization kong and nakagoshi 2006 however until now no one has tried to apply it into isotopes field in fact water isoscape is the map that characterizes the spatiotemporal distribution patterns and changes of isotopic compositions therefore in this work for the first time the gradient analysis technique is used to reveal the spatial gradients in pond water isoscapes and their impact factors at a polygon unit rather than point or line unit since the topography of the study area trends in the se nw direction and is sloped in the se nw direction a se nw transect was drawn between the highest and lowest points of the study area transect b e w transects and n s transects were also drawn at the geographic centre of the study area and in 450 m and 1000 m intervals from the centre respectively the e w transects are transects e f and g while the n s transects are transects a c and d in addition the study area was divided into small watersheds and watershed transects were drawn along their streams on each transect isotope and altitude data were acquired in 10 m intervals δ18o and altitude were then plotted against distance from the origin of the transect so as to reveal the gradient characteristics of δ18o values along each transect 3 results and analysis 3 1 h and o isotope ratios of the pond water the δ18o values of the 112 pond water samples in the study area range from 12 55 to 4 7 range 7 85 and have a mean of 9 28 the δd values range from 87 31 to 34 55 range 52 76 and have a mean of 63 83 the d excess values range from 0 96 to 14 35 range 13 39 and have a mean of 10 37 craig observed that the δ18o and δd of 400 water samples from rivers lakes and precipitation across the globe are related by a linear relation δd 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 this is called the global meteoric water line gmwl and it is a standard for the adjudgement of local precipitation isotope compositions since water bodies in different regions will have different water vapour sources and evaporation processes local meteoric water lines lmwls often deviate from the gmwl a pond water evaporation line pwel was obtained for the study area by performing a linear regression on their δ18o and δd values as shown in fig 2 the linear equation of the pwel is δd 6 28δ18o 5 5 r 2 0 96 n 112 and the δ18o and δd values closely fit this linear trend in terms of precipitation isotope compositions previous studies obtained the lmwl july in the water source area in july red line in fig 2 ma et al 2016 and the lmwl rainy season grey line in fig 2 during each month of the rainy season from may to october in 2015 jiao et al 2019 as compared to the gmwl blue line the lmwl july and the lmwl rainy season the pwel has a lower gradient and intercept and is more similar to the gmwl and the lmwl rainy season than the lwml july and it can be found that pwel and lmwl rainy season intersect with gwml the low gradient and intercept imply that the pond water was strongly affected by evaporation which causes isotopic fractionation from the distribution figure of pond water sampling points we can see that some pond water sampling points are close to lwml july and some of them are close to the gmwl overall the pond water is in a long term retention state and is affected by precipitation input for a long time the isotope value of pond water is a mixed value the gmwl is actually a synthesis of many lmwls in other words the pwel is a mixed line therefore there is an interaction between pwel and gmwl 3 2 interpolation methods for pond water isoscapes and precision analysis of the 11 training models provided by the geostatistical analysis module for co kriging interpolation the spherical exponential and gaussian models are generally speaking the most commonly used models in this work by comparing the cross validation accuracy obtained in the geostatistical wizard it was found that the gaussian model gives the best precision in co kriging table 1 then the co kriging method with altitude as an auxiliary variable is also used to interpolate the δ18o value of pond water between the 5 interpolation methods table 2 idw interpolation was found to be the most precise as it has the lowest rmse 1 289 and a me close to 0 0 015 hence as compared to spline natural neighbourhood kriging and co kriging interpolation idw interpolation is the best interpolation method for isoscape mapping 3 3 pond water isoscapes and their spatial patterns an isoscape was created by performing idw interpolation on the pond water isotope ratios as shown in fig 3 here it is shown that the δ18o and δd distributions are similar to each other but nearly diametrically opposed to the d excess distribution hence the isoscape contains three distinct gradients in the e w direction δ18o and δd values become increasingly positive towards the west in the n s direction δ18o and δd values increase from north to south in the se nw direction the topographic trend of the study area the δ18o and δd values increase from se to nw and also exhibit pronounced isotopic zonations the low lying western regions have especially high more positive δ18o and δd values while the elevated eastern regions have low more negative δ18o and δd values the δ18o and δd values show significant negative correlations with altitude in the d excess map it may be observed the se and nw regions have high and low d excess values respectively therefore d excess increases with increases in altitude and the eastern region has high water vapour recycling ratios 4 discussion 4 1 gradients of the pond water isoscape and their correlation with altitude 4 1 1 whole region transects to analyse the isoscape gradients of the study area and their altitude factor in further detail 7 gradient analysis transects were drawn across the study area in the nw ew and se nw directions as shown in fig 4 h these transects were designed based on the spatial characteristics of the pond water isoscapes and the topography of the study area according to the transects curves of the δ18o values and altitudes varied with distances fig 4 a b c d the n s transects fig 4h a 4h c and 4h d and se nw transect fig 4h b all show relatively smooth curves of δ18o and altitude varied with distances the se nw transect in particular has the smoothest curve among all transects the transects b c and d show the increasing trends of δ18o when the decreasing ones of altitude along distances fig 4 b c d while transect a shows the inverse trend fig 4 a as a whole there is a significant negative correlation between δ18o and altitude in the study area likewise the e w transects fig 4h e 4h f and 4h g also show that differences in altitude are the impact factor of variations in the spatial pattern of pond water isotopic compositions however as the watersheds crossed by transects e f and g have significant variations in altitude altitude and δ18o values fluctuate strongly along these transects fig 4 e f and g the highest and lowest altitudes of the study area are 2148 m and 1780 m respectively which corresponds to an altitude range of 369 m most parts of the study area have altitudes between 1800 m and 2000 m on short time scales factors like water vapour sources precipitation levels and temperatures are effectively identical across the study area given the observed altitude effect in pond water isotope compositions these factors may be safely excluded from the isoscape analysis the pond water δ18o measurements that were taken in july 2014 were averaged in 10 m altitude intervals which resulted in 18 averaged δ18o values a correlation analysis was then performed between the averaged δ18o values and altitude as shown in fig 5 here it is shown that δ18o is significantly negatively correlated with altitude p 0 05 hence altitude has a significant effect on pond water δ18o values in some studies co kriging interpolation was used to incorporate environmental factors like temperature precipitation and altitude and thus improve interpolation precision li et al 2011 yang et al 2014 however when co kriging interpolation was performed with altitude as the auxiliary variable the results were less precise than those of idw interpolation this could be caused by the spatial heterogeneity of the study area the correlation between isotope composition and altitude was calculated for all transects in the study area as well as their corresponding lapse rates table 3 it is shown that the correlation between δ18o and altitude was significant onthe se nw transect b and n s transects a c and d at significance levels greater than 0 01 on transects b c and d the values of δ18o were significantly negatively correlated with altitude since transect a is located in the low altitude western region it is only sparsely vegetated furthermore the δ18o measurements on this transect were also affected by the dayutang reservoir this is why there is a mildly positive correlation between δ18o and altitude on transect a the lapse rates of transects a b c and d are 0 52 100 m 0 75 100 m 0 62 100 m and 0 67 100 m respectively the correlation between δ18o and altitude on the e w transects e f and g is poor due to the large altitude variations of these transects some of these transects also failed to pass the significance test therefore the lapse rates of the e w transects were not calculated 4 1 2 watershed transects since the gradient analysis on whole region transects revealed that altitude variations in the watersheds affect the spatial distribution of isotope compositions the study area was divided into 7 small watersheds transects were then drawn along the streams of these watersheds fig 6 h δ18o and altitude are very significantly correlated in the k l n and o watershed transects table 4 according to the transects curves fig 6 a g of the δ18o values and altitudes varied with distances the transects k l n and o fig 6h show the increasing trends of δ18o when the decreasing ones of altitude along distances fig 6 c d f g while the western transects i j and m fig 6h show the complex variation trends fig 6 a b and e which is due to the small watershed area and the unobvious altitude effect the characteristics of western transect i are consistent with those of transect a on transects k l n and o δ18o is strongly negatively correlated with altitude and their lapse rates are 1 97 100 m 0 52 100 m 1 62 100 m and 0 59 100 m respectively according to this analysis the change in pond water δ18o with altitude varies from one watershed to another and there are significant differences between the eastern and western regions these differences of variations are responsible for the isoscape variances of the study area in the e w direction in summary the isotope compositions on all of the transects are quite strongly correlated with altitude on the whole region scale this correlation is strongest in the se nw transect and weakest on the e w transects furthermore isotope compositions seem to alternate between peaks and valleys in the e w direction the trends on the e w direction were caused by differences between one watershed and another in terms of the relationship between pond water δ18o and altitude at the watershed scale altitude is still an important factor of the pond water isoscapes however the altitude effect was less pronounced in very small watersheds although the whole region e w transects were affected by inter watershed differences altitude still affectsisoscapes of pond water δ18o within each watershed 4 2 other factors of the pond water isoscapes in reality pond water isoscapes are affected by a diverse and complex multitude of factors from the perspective of the water cycle pond water are surface water bodies and thus have isoscapes that are strongly reliant on the precipitation of their feeder watersheds precipitation isotope compositions are affected by temperature amount of precipitation and elevation dansgaard 1964 whereas precipitation isotope gradients are affected by topography vapour transport and the water energy balance kukla et al 2019 therefore pond water isotope compositions are affected by both precipitation and landscape flow processes e g mixing infiltration and evaporation gonfiantini et al 1998 mcdonnell et al 1991 sprenger et al 2017 these processes can also be affected by human activities like the construction of dams and water extraction for crop irrigation yang et al 2020 at present some studies have been performed where the multitude of factors that affect surface water isotope compositions were taken into account and used to interpolate precipitation isoscapes for instance birkel et al used a geographically weighted regression model to link surface water isotope compositions with environmental variables and thus characterized the dynamic surface water isoscapes of scotland they also determined the primary drivers of isoscape variance which include land cover and hydroclimate variables it has also been shown that surface water isoscapes can be affected by the selection of sampling locations and regression models wheeler and calder 2007 as well as the atmospheric general circulation model and its transport pathways birks and edwards 2009 noone et al 2002 however further research will be required to incorporate these factors into isoscape interpolation 5 conclusions based on the pattern analysis methods of landscape ecology we have proposed an approach for the analysis of water body isoscapes and their altitude factors and demonstrated the viability of this approach the δ18o values of the hani terraced fields pond water ranged from 12 55 to 4 7 with an average of 9 28 the δd value ranged from 87 31 to 34 55 with an average of 63 83 the resulting evaporation line pwel was δd 6 28δ18o 5 5 r 2 0 96 n 112 as the gradient and intercept of the pwel are both markedly lower than those of the gmwl and the lmwl of the study area the pond water are strongly affected by evaporation which caused isotopic fractionation idw interpolation was found to be the most precise of the five spatial interpolation methods that were tested in this study the pond water isoscape created by idw interpolation is characterized by three distinct gradients 1 increasingly positive δ18o and δd values from east to west 2 increasing δ18o and δd values from north to south and 3 increasing δ18o and δd values along the topographic trend of the study area se to nw with pronounced isotopic zonations the δ18o and δd distributions are similar to each other and almost diametrically opposed to the d excess distribution pond water isotope composition is significantly correlated with altitude on the whole region and watershed transects which indicates that the gradients of the pond water isoscape are generally affected by altitude the e w transect shows the weakest correlation as it is affected by the watershed patterns of the study area inside each watershed altitude is still affects variations in pond water isotope compositions the other factors that may affect the pond water isoscapes include mixing infiltration evaporation land cover and human activities credit authorship contribution
