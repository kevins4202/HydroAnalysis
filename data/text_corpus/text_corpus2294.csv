growth water status floret yield glucosinolate profile and quality use of s water 4 ds m 1 from transplanting to appearance of the inflorescence alternated with ns water 2 ds m 1 from inflorescence appearance to harvest and vice versa were compared with continuous use of s or ns water irrigation with s water during the first growth phase decreased leaf water and osmotic potential net co2

a 22 2 decrease of the head dry biomass compared to ns ns plants regardless of application timing irrigation with s water decreased broccoli yield and head mean fresh weight compared to ns ns plants by 20 and 24 respectively use of s water in one or both growth stages improved broccoli dry matter and soluble solid content while had no impact on total glucosinolate concentration however

of irrigation water sources of good quality is progressively challenging the production of vegetables in the semi arid areas of the mediterranean basin pereira et al 2002 the mediterranean region and especially its coastal areas are particularly suitable for the production of vegetable crops nevertheless with low average rainfall unpredictable precipitation events and relatively high evapotranspiration rates the production of vegetables relies strictly on irrigation wriedt et al 2008 groundwater constitutes the main and most reliable irrigation water source in this region siebert et al 2010 however in the last decade excessive pumping of groundwater from wells located near the coast favoured seawater intrusion thereby resulting in saline groundwater capaccioni et al 2005 mazi et al 2014 in the most compromised areas saline groundwater represents the only water source available for irrigation under such conditions irrigation with saline water is a necessity and adequate management strategies must be implemented to cope with the negative effects associated with the use of saline irrigation water and to prevent soil salinization tanji and kielen 2002 tyagi 2003 if not properly managed the use of saline irrigation water can cause accumulation of salts in the soil with consequent depletion of soil fertility and reduction of the crop productivity rhoades et al 1992 shannon and grieve 1998 the use of saline irrigation water can reduce plant growth and yield by i increasing the soil water potential making it more difficult for plants to absorb water ii causing accumulation within the plant of toxic levels of ions and iii causing ion imbalances di gioia et al 2013a giuffrida 2013 grattan and grieve 1998 munns and tester 2008 plant response to salinity stress varies greatly between species and among cultivars within the same species moreover the sensitivity of the same crop changes at different growth stages leonardi et al 2001 and under different environmental conditions shannon and grieve 1998 besides the use of salt tolerant genotypes aktas et al 2006 muries et al 2013 and when possible of salt tolerant rootstocks di gioia et al 2013a giuffrida et al 2013a most water management strategies are aimed at maintaining the level of salinity within the root zone below the limit tolerated by the crop at the specific growth stage tyagi 2003 a water management strategy adopted when the level of salinity of the irrigation water is moderate 4 6 ds m 1 consists of alternating the use of saline water with that of non saline water limiting the use of the first to the least sensitive crop growth stages baath et al 2017 hassanli and ebrahimian 2017 morales garcia et al 2011 tyagi 2003 in several mediterranean areas non saline groundwater is pumped from non salinized wells located inland and is transported over long distances to irrigate vegetable crops grown along the coastal areas in such cases the precious non saline water is reserved for the most sensitive crop growth phases from this perspective it is important to know the sensitivity to salt stress of each crop at different growth stages taking into consideration the potential influence of the growing season for instance the use of saline irrigation water is preferable on crops grown during the fall winter season characterized by higher rainfall and decreased evapotranspiration levels rather than on those grown over the dryer spring summer season characterized by higher evapotranspiration levels tyagi 2003 broccoli brassica oleracea var italica is an important fall winter vegetable crop considered moderately sensitive to salinity stress flagella et al 2002 francois and maas 1994 and thus potentially suitable for the application of multi quality water management strategies previous studies suggest that broccoli response to salinity stress is biphasic flagella et al 2002 lópez berenguer et al 2006 lópez pérez et al 2007 in a first short phase the reduction of plant growth is principally due to osmotic stress in the second phase damage is primarily a consequence of the accumulation at toxic levels of ions such as na and cl giuffrida et al 2013c munns and tester 2008 as is the case for other crops the use of saline water may also have an impact on the quality of broccoli florets and especially on their glucosinolate profile giuffrida et al 2013b 2017 previous studies suggest that salinity stress might enhance the production of glucosinolates and that these secondary metabolites and their precursors may have a role as osmoprotectants during the osmotic adjustment phase keling and zhujun 2010 lópez berenguer et al 2009 given the potential beneficial health effects attributed to these organosulfur compounds petropoulos et al 2017 it is important to know how the application of saline water at different growth stages besides influencing plant growth and productivity can affect broccoli glucosinolate profile therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of saline and or non saline water application through drip irrigation during two growth phases on broccoli plant growth water status floret yield glucosinolate profile and quality the results of this study may contribute to defining the crop phase most sensitive to salinity stress and the best water management strategy to optimize broccoli yield and or quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material treatments and growth conditions an experiment was conducted during the fall winter season september to december of 2011 at the

gas exchange and water relationship the s water application regime had no significant effect on stomatal conductance transpiration rate and leaf level water use efficiency at either assessment date table 1 at 62 dat net co2 assimilation rate was on average 7 8 lower in plants irrigated with s water than in plants irrigated with ns water while no differences were observed at 84 dat at 62 dat plants irrigated with s water had lower leaf water potential ψw leaf osmotic potential ψ π and rwc than those irrigated with ns water table 1 at harvest the ψw of plants irrigated with s water either for a single phase s ns and ns s or during the entire cycle s s was on average 33 6 lower than in plants irrigated only with ns water at the same time the use of s water during the entire cycle caused an average reduction of ψ π of 40 5 and a 58 5 increase in leaf turgor potential ψp compared to the other water irrigation regimes leaf rwc was 3 7 lower in plants irrigated with s water from inflorescence appearance to harvest or for the whole cultivation cycle 3 2 plant growth irrigation with s water 4 ds m 1 from transplanting until the visible appearance of the inflorescence at 62 dat had no effects on leaf area leaf stem and total dry biomass but caused a 38 3 decrease of the root dry weight compared to plants irrigated with ns water table 2 due to the lower root growth plants irrigated with s water in the first growth phase had a root shoot ratio 36 5 lower than plants irrigated with ns water at harvest 84 dat plants irrigated with ns water during the entire crop cycle ns ns or only during the first growth stage ns s had the highest total plant dry biomass application of s water either for the entire crop cycle s s or only during the first growth phase s ns resulted in reduced stem root and total plant dry weight compared to plants irrigated with ns water either during the entire crop cycle ns ns or only during the first growth phase ns s application of saline water only after inflorescence appearance had no negative impact on leaf area leaf stem root and total dry biomass but caused a 22 2 decrease of head dry biomass compared to ns ns plants 3 3 plant ion concentration and partitioning at the end of the first growth phase 62 dat plants irrigated with s water had a higher concentration of na in leaves and stems and a higher concentration of cl in stem and roots table 3 compared to ns water irrigation with s water during the first growth phase caused a decrease of n 17 no3 77 and k 21 concentration in the leaves and an increase of n 62 k 46 and so4 2 40 concentration in the roots the higher concentration of na in leaves and stems of plants exposed to salinity stress in the first part of the crop cycle also caused a significant decrease of k na mg2 na and ca2 na ratios in the same plant parts at harvest 84 dat plants irrigated with ns ns water had the lowest concentration of na in leaves and stems table 4 in the leaves the concentration of na increased approximately two fold in plants irrigated with ns s water and three times in those irrigated with s ns and s s water in the stem na concentration increased by 99 in plants irrigated with ns s and s ns water and 176 in those irrigated with s s water compared to ns ns treatment in roots of plants exposed to salinity stress during the entire crop cycle na concentration increased by 120 when compared to plants receiving ns ns only in the broccoli heads na concentration was on average 158 higher in plants irrigated with s water in the second phase compared to those irrigated with s water only in the first phase or irrigated with ns water during the entire crop cycle the concentration of cl increased by 34 in the leaves of plants that received s water for at least one growth phase while stem and root cl concentrations were not influenced by the s water application regime the s water application timing had no effects on n concentration except for in the roots where a 10 increase was observed in plants that received s water only in the second growing phase and a 23 increase of n was observed in plants irrigated with s ns and s s water except for the roots where no significant differences were observed plants irrigated with ns water during the entire crop cycle had the highest stem and head k concentrations plants receiving s water in both growth phases had the lowest leaf and head k concentrations while no significant differences were observed for the root k concentration little or no consistent differences were observed for the concentration of other ions however also at harvest k na mg2 na and ca2 na ratios significantly decreased in the leaves and stems of plants irrigated with s water either for a single growing phase or for the entire crop cycle compared to those irrigated only with ns water instead in broccoli heads k na mg2 na and ca2 na ratios were significantly higher in plants irrigated with ns water in the second growth phase as compared to those irrigated with s water in the second growth phase or for the entire cycle in the roots k na mg2 na and ca2 na ratios were not affected by the s water application regimes 3 4 broccoli yield and quality irrigation with s water only for a part of the crop cycle s ns and ns s or during the entire growing season caused a 20 decrease in total broccoli yield and a 24 reduction of broccoli head mean fresh weight compared to irrigation with ns water table 5 from a quality perspective regardless of the s water application timing plants irrigated with s water even for a part of the crop season had 8 6 and 15 higher dry matter and soluble solids content respectively compared to plants that never received s water table 5 titratable acidity and nitrate content of broccoli heads were not influenced by the application regime of saline and non saline irrigation water during the growing season 3 5 glucosinolate profile two aliphatic glucoiberin and glucoerucin and three indolic glucosinolates glucobrassicin 4 methoxyglucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin were identified from broccoli heads at harvest table 6 glucoiberin was the most prevalent glucosinolate accounting for approximately 50 of the total glucosinolate content in plants irrigated with ns water in the first growth phase ns s and ns ns and 36 in those irrigated with s water during the first growth phase s ns and s s together the two aliphatic glucosinolates accounted for about 60 of the total glucosinolate content in plants irrigated with ns water in the first growth phase ns s and ns ns and 46 in those irrigated with s water during the first growth phase s ns and s s nevertheless the content of the single and total aliphatic glucosinolates was not influenced by the s water application timing glucobrassicin was the predominant indolic glucosinolate plants irrigated with s water only during the first growth phase s ns had on average 76 2 higher content of glucobrassicin compared to those irrigated with ns water only during the first growth phase or during the entire crop cycle and compared to those irrigated with s water for the whole crop cycle neoglucobrassicin head concentration of plants irrigated with s water only in the first growing phase was 110 higher than that of plants irrigated with ns water in the first growth phase and for the entire growing season however neoglucobrassicin content was not different between s ns and s s plants the highest total indolic glucosinolate content was achieved in plants irrigated with s water only in the first growth phase which was on average 65 3 higher than the total indolic glucosinolate content of plants irrigated with s water also in the second phase and of those irrigated with ns ns and ns s water despite the different content of indolic glucosinolates the total glucosinolate content was not significantly p 0 08 influenced by the s water application regime 4 discussion application of s water in the first portion of the crop cycle caused a non reversible inhibition of plant growth salinity stress imposed during the first growth phase primarily caused a reduction of the root dry biomass and consequently a reduction of the leaf area and of the total plant dry weight these results are consistent with previous findings on broccoli and cauliflower de pascale et al 2005 giuffrida et al 2013c 2017 and were likely the result of the inhibitory effect of the salinity stress on cell production and elongation at both the root and the shoot level neumann 1997 the lower water ψw and osmotic ψ π potential table 2 and the higher accumulation of na and cl table 3 observed in plants exposed to salinity stress during the first growth stage suggest that both factors contributed to reduced cell division and expansion neumann 1997 the same factors also caused a reduction of the leaf net co2 assimilation rate table 2 and later reduced leaf area table 1 several studies have shown that alterations of the root morphology and anatomy constitute one of the first adaptation mechanisms activated by the plant in response to saline stress lópez pérez et al 2007 along with the activation of physiological processes aimed at maintaining the ion and water homeostasis within the plant cells lópez berenguer et al 2006 in this study application of s water in the first growth phase caused a decrease of the osmotic potential at the soil level limiting the plant s ability to absorb water in response plants maintain turgor potential ψp by decreasing the leaf water potential through the adjustment of the leaf osmotic potential at least in part in the first growth phase the ψπ was reduced by accumulating na in leaves and stem table 3 however at the same time the accumulation of na at toxic levels caused a decrease of the leaf net co2 assimilation rate causing a negative impact on plant growth especially at expense to the roots ashraf 2001 giuffrida et al 2017 the lower root shoot ratio observed in plants irrigated with s water in the first growth phase table 1 may be explained by the ability of the plant under stress conditions and with limited photosynthetic activity to allocate carbohydrates primarily in the shoot to the detriment of the roots brouwer 1962 the lower stem root head and total plant dry weights observed in plants exposed to salinity stress in the first growth phase compared to ns s plants even if irrigated with ns water after the inflorescence appearance suggest that broccoli crops respond better to salinity stress after the first growth phase thus at least in terms of plant growth the use of ns water is more critical in the first growth phase than after the appearance of the inflorescence the application of s water through both growth stages had a significant impact on the accumulation and partitioning of na and cl in different broccoli tissues and influenced the accumulation of other nutrients tables 3 and 4 during both growth stages the excess na associated with the use of s water was accumulated primarily in leaves and stem and only in small proportion in roots and in the broccoli head these results are consistent with previous studies that demonstrated the partial ability of the plant to preserve the development of the apical tissues and of the inflorescence di gioia et al 2013a giuffrida et al 2013c 2017 most likely na is accumulated especially in the leaves with the transpiration flux and in part may be recirculated within the plant to limit its accumulation in the inflorescence and the most sensitive tissues nevertheless irrigation with s water during the second growth phase and thus during the formation of the inflorescence caused a slight increase of na and cl in the broccoli florets the accumulation of na in leaves stem and in lower proportion in the broccoli head also caused some ion imbalances as demonstrated by the lower k na mg2 na and ca2 na ratios observed in these tissues at the end of both growth stages tables 3 and 4 ion imbalances within plant tissues were determined not only by the accumulation of na and cl but also by a reduced concentration of k and no3 n which was likely a consequence of the antagonism between these ions and na and cl respectively grattan and grieve 1998 the lower concentration of no3 observed in the leaves at 62 dat could be a consequence of the antagonism with cl as observed in previous studies giuffrida et al 2017 as well as a consequence of the lower transpiration and water uptake of the plants exposed to salinity stress abdelgadir et al 2005 on the other hand due to its similar physicochemical properties the excess of na in the s water likely limited the uptake of k wakeel 2013 the reduction of broccoli yield observed in plants exposed to salinity stress regardless of its timing was due to the reduced 24 on average broccoli head mean fresh weight observed in s s s ns and ns s plants compared to plants irrigated with ns water during the entire crop cycle table 5 the use of s water likely caused a decrease of the broccoli head mean fresh weight by reducing the plant water uptake and thus the plant water potential with a consequent inhibition of the process of cell division and expansion neumann 1997 such a hypothesis is supported by the higher dry matter and soluble solids content observed in broccoli heads of plants exposed to salinity stress compared to those irrigated exclusively with ns water table 5 similar effects on yield dry matter and total soluble solids content were observed in previous studies on broccoli and cauliflower giuffrida et al 2013b 2017 arugula bonasia et al 2017 tomato di gioia et al 2013a and other vegetable crops exposed to salinity stress rouphael et al 2012 broccoli no3 concentration was slightly above normal levels for broccoli di gioia et al 2013b and conversely to what observed for leaves stem and roots was not influenced by s water application regime in contrast with previous findings pez berenguer et al 2008 2009 irrigation with s water either for part or for the entire crop cycle did not significantly p 0 08 enhance broccoli head total gls concentration table 6 nevertheless the s water application regime had a significant impact on the proportion of indolic glss glucoraphanin glucoiberin glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin usually constitute the main glss found in broccoli petropoulos et al 2017 in this study glucoraphanin the precursor of sulforaphane was not detected and glucoiberin constituted the main gls regardless the application timing of saline irrigation water nevertheless the use of s water during the first growth phase induced a higher accumulation of glucobrassicin and its derivate neoglucobrassicin these results were consistent with the findings of guo et al 2013 who observed an increase of the concentration of glucobrassicin neoglucobrassicin and other indole glss in broccoli sprouts exposed to high salinity levels while sulforaphane is the most studied gls hydrolysis product and it is considered as one of the most potent anticarcinogenic isothiocyanates zhang et al 1992 iberin the hydrolysis product of the glucoiberin and indole 3 carbinol one of the hydrolysis products of glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin have also been found to have anticancer activity petropoulos et al 2017 stoewsand 1995 therefore the higher accumulation of indolic glss observed with the application of s water in only the first growth phase without a simultaneous decrease of the content of aliphatic glss most likely improved the potential health benefit effect of broccoli however it is possible that the higher concentration of indolic glss glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin associated with the use of s water during the first growth phase slightly altered the flavour of the broccoli in fact while sulforaphane and iberin are not characterized by a pungent flavour verkerk et al 2009 glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin have been associated with the bitter taste typical of most brassicas species which may be in conflict with the preference of most consumers drewnowski and gomez carneros 2000 5 conclusions application timing of saline irrigation water influenced broccoli plant growth yield and quality irrigation with saline water from transplanting to inflorescence appearance decreased leaf water and osmotic potential net co2 assimilation rate and favoured the accumulation at toxic levels of na and cl causing ion imbalances and reducing broccoli plant growth the use of saline water in the second growth phase had limited impact on plant growth however regardless of the timing the use of saline irrigation water caused a reduction in broccoli yield compared to irrigation with non saline water for the entire crop cycle in terms of quality the use of saline water improved dry matter and soluble solids content of the florets regardless of its application timing and had no impact on the total glucosinolate content nevertheless the application timing of saline irrigation water influenced the proportion of aliphatic and indolic glucosinolates with consequent potential effects on the beneficial health properties and the flavour of broccoli overall the use of non saline water is more critical during the first growth phase in terms of plant growth and while the application timing of saline water may not affect broccoli yield and commercial quality it has an impact on the glucosinolate profile of broccoli florets

accumulation within the plant of toxic levels of ions and iii causing ion imbalances di gioia et al 2013a giuffrida 2013 grattan and grieve 1998 munns and tester 2008 plant response to salinity stress varies greatly between species and among cultivars within the same species moreover the sensitivity of the same crop changes at different growth stages leonardi et al 2001 and under different environmental conditions shannon and grieve 1998 besides the use of salt tolerant genotypes aktas et al 2006 muries et al 2013 and when possible of salt tolerant rootstocks di gioia et al 2013a giuffrida et al 2013a most water management strategies are aimed at maintaining the level of salinity within the root zone below the limit tolerated by the crop at the specific growth stage tyagi 2003 a water management strategy adopted when the level of salinity of the irrigation water is moderate 4 6 ds m 1 consists of alternating the use of saline water with that of non saline water limiting the use of the first to the least sensitive crop growth stages baath et al 2017 hassanli and ebrahimian 2017 morales garcia et al 2011 tyagi 2003 in several mediterranean areas non saline groundwater is pumped from non salinized wells located inland and is transported over long distances to irrigate vegetable crops grown along the coastal areas in such cases the precious non saline water is reserved for the most sensitive crop growth phases from this perspective it is important to know the sensitivity to salt stress of each crop at different growth stages taking into consideration the potential influence of the growing season for instance the use of saline irrigation water is preferable on crops grown during the fall winter season characterized by higher rainfall and decreased evapotranspiration levels rather than on those grown over the dryer spring summer season characterized by higher evapotranspiration levels tyagi 2003 broccoli brassica oleracea var italica is an important fall winter vegetable crop considered moderately sensitive to salinity stress flagella et al 2002 francois and maas 1994 and thus potentially suitable for the application of multi quality water management strategies previous studies suggest that broccoli response to salinity stress is biphasic flagella et al 2002 lópez berenguer et al 2006 lópez pérez et al 2007 in a first short phase the reduction of plant growth is principally due to osmotic stress in the second phase damage is primarily a consequence of the accumulation at toxic levels of ions such as na and cl giuffrida et al 2013c munns and tester 2008 as is the case for other crops the use of saline water may also have an impact on the quality of broccoli florets and especially on their glucosinolate profile giuffrida et al 2013b 2017 previous studies suggest that salinity stress might enhance the production of glucosinolates and that these secondary metabolites and their precursors may have a role as osmoprotectants during the osmotic adjustment phase keling and zhujun 2010 lópez berenguer et al 2009 given the potential beneficial health effects attributed to these organosulfur compounds petropoulos et al 2017 it is important to know how the application of saline water at different growth stages besides influencing plant growth and productivity can affect broccoli glucosinolate profile therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of saline and or non saline water application through drip irrigation during two growth phases on broccoli plant growth water status floret yield glucosinolate profile and quality the results of this study may contribute to defining the crop phase most sensitive to salinity stress and the best water management strategy to optimize broccoli yield and or quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material treatments and growth conditions an experiment was conducted during the fall winter season september to december of 2011 at the

gas exchange and water relationship the s water application regime had no significant effect on stomatal conductance transpiration rate and leaf level water use efficiency at either assessment date table 1 at 62 dat net co2 assimilation rate was on average 7 8 lower in plants irrigated with s water than in plants irrigated with ns water while no differences were observed at 84 dat at 62 dat plants irrigated with s water had lower leaf water potential ψw leaf osmotic potential ψ π and rwc than those irrigated with ns water table 1 at harvest the ψw of plants irrigated with s water either for a single phase s ns and ns s or during the entire cycle s s was on average 33 6 lower than in plants irrigated only with ns water at the same time the use of s water during the entire cycle caused an average reduction of ψ π of 40 5 and a 58 5 increase in leaf turgor potential ψp compared to the other water irrigation regimes leaf rwc was 3 7 lower in plants irrigated with s water from inflorescence appearance to harvest or for the whole cultivation cycle 3 2 plant growth irrigation with s water 4 ds m 1 from transplanting until the visible appearance of the inflorescence at 62 dat had no effects on leaf area leaf stem and total dry biomass but caused a 38 3 decrease of the root dry weight compared to plants irrigated with ns water table 2 due to the lower root growth plants irrigated with s water in the first growth phase had a root shoot ratio 36 5 lower than plants irrigated with ns water at harvest 84 dat plants irrigated with ns water during the entire crop cycle ns ns or only during the first growth stage ns s had the highest total plant dry biomass application of s water either for the entire crop cycle s s or only during the first growth phase s ns resulted in reduced stem root and total plant dry weight compared to plants irrigated with ns water either during the entire crop cycle ns ns or only during the first growth phase ns s application of saline water only after inflorescence appearance had no negative impact on leaf area leaf stem root and total dry biomass but caused a 22 2 decrease of head dry biomass compared to ns ns plants 3 3 plant ion concentration and partitioning at the end of the first growth phase 62 dat plants irrigated with s water had a higher concentration of na in leaves and stems and a higher concentration of cl in stem and roots table 3 compared to ns water irrigation with s water during the first growth phase caused a decrease of n 17 no3 77 and k 21 concentration in the leaves and an increase of n 62 k 46 and so4 2 40 concentration in the roots the higher concentration of na in leaves and stems of plants exposed to salinity stress in the first part of the crop cycle also caused a significant decrease of k na mg2 na and ca2 na ratios in the same plant parts at harvest 84 dat plants irrigated with ns ns water had the lowest concentration of na in leaves and stems table 4 in the leaves the concentration of na increased approximately two fold in plants irrigated with ns s water and three times in those irrigated with s ns and s s water in the stem na concentration increased by 99 in plants irrigated with ns s and s ns water and 176 in those irrigated with s s water compared to ns ns treatment in roots of plants exposed to salinity stress during the entire crop cycle na concentration increased by 120 when compared to plants receiving ns ns only in the broccoli heads na concentration was on average 158 higher in plants irrigated with s water in the second phase compared to those irrigated with s water only in the first phase or irrigated with ns water during the entire crop cycle the concentration of cl increased by 34 in the leaves of plants that received s water for at least one growth phase while stem and root cl concentrations were not influenced by the s water application regime the s water application timing had no effects on n concentration except for in the roots where a 10 increase was observed in plants that received s water only in the second growing phase and a 23 increase of n was observed in plants irrigated with s ns and s s water except for the roots where no significant differences were observed plants irrigated with ns water during the entire crop cycle had the highest stem and head k concentrations plants receiving s water in both growth phases had the lowest leaf and head k concentrations while no significant differences were observed for the root k concentration little or no consistent differences were observed for the concentration of other ions however also at harvest k na mg2 na and ca2 na ratios significantly decreased in the leaves and stems of plants irrigated with s water either for a single growing phase or for the entire crop cycle compared to those irrigated only with ns water instead in broccoli heads k na mg2 na and ca2 na ratios were significantly higher in plants irrigated with ns water in the second growth phase as compared to those irrigated with s water in the second growth phase or for the entire cycle in the roots k na mg2 na and ca2 na ratios were not affected by the s water application regimes 3 4 broccoli yield and quality irrigation with s water only for a part of the crop cycle s ns and ns s or during the entire growing season caused a 20 decrease in total broccoli yield and a 24 reduction of broccoli head mean fresh weight compared to irrigation with ns water table 5 from a quality perspective regardless of the s water application timing plants irrigated with s water even for a part of the crop season had 8 6 and 15 higher dry matter and soluble solids content respectively compared to plants that never received s water table 5 titratable acidity and nitrate content of broccoli heads were not influenced by the application regime of saline and non saline irrigation water during the growing season 3 5 glucosinolate profile two aliphatic glucoiberin and glucoerucin and three indolic glucosinolates glucobrassicin 4 methoxyglucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin were identified from broccoli heads at harvest table 6 glucoiberin was the most prevalent glucosinolate accounting for approximately 50 of the total glucosinolate content in plants irrigated with ns water in the first growth phase ns s and ns ns and 36 in those irrigated with s water during the first growth phase s ns and s s together the two aliphatic glucosinolates accounted for about 60 of the total glucosinolate content in plants irrigated with ns water in the first growth phase ns s and ns ns and 46 in those irrigated with s water during the first growth phase s ns and s s nevertheless the content of the single and total aliphatic glucosinolates was not influenced by the s water application timing glucobrassicin was the predominant indolic glucosinolate plants irrigated with s water only during the first growth phase s ns had on average 76 2 higher content of glucobrassicin compared to those irrigated with ns water only during the first growth phase or during the entire crop cycle and compared to those irrigated with s water for the whole crop cycle neoglucobrassicin head concentration of plants irrigated with s water only in the first growing phase was 110 higher than that of plants irrigated with ns water in the first growth phase and for the entire growing season however neoglucobrassicin content was not different between s ns and s s plants the highest total indolic glucosinolate content was achieved in plants irrigated with s water only in the first growth phase which was on average 65 3 higher than the total indolic glucosinolate content of plants irrigated with s water also in the second phase and of those irrigated with ns ns and ns s water despite the different content of indolic glucosinolates the total glucosinolate content was not significantly p 0 08 influenced by the s water application regime 4 discussion application of s water in the first portion of the crop cycle caused a non reversible inhibition of plant growth salinity stress imposed during the first growth phase primarily caused a reduction of the root dry biomass and consequently a reduction of the leaf area and of the total plant dry weight these results are consistent with previous findings on broccoli and cauliflower de pascale et al 2005 giuffrida et al 2013c 2017 and were likely the result of the inhibitory effect of the salinity stress on cell production and elongation at both the root and the shoot level neumann 1997 the lower water ψw and osmotic ψ π potential table 2 and the higher accumulation of na and cl table 3 observed in plants exposed to salinity stress during the first growth stage suggest that both factors contributed to reduced cell division and expansion neumann 1997 the same factors also caused a reduction of the leaf net co2 assimilation rate table 2 and later reduced leaf area table 1 several studies have shown that alterations of the root morphology and anatomy constitute one of the first adaptation mechanisms activated by the plant in response to saline stress lópez pérez et al 2007 along with the activation of physiological processes aimed at maintaining the ion and water homeostasis within the plant cells lópez berenguer et al 2006 in this study application of s water in the first growth phase caused a decrease of the osmotic potential at the soil level limiting the plant s ability to absorb water in response plants maintain turgor potential ψp by decreasing the leaf water potential through the adjustment of the leaf osmotic potential at least in part in the first growth phase the ψπ was reduced by accumulating na in leaves and stem table 3 however at the same time the accumulation of na at toxic levels caused a decrease of the leaf net co2 assimilation rate causing a negative impact on plant growth especially at expense to the roots ashraf 2001 giuffrida et al 2017 the lower root shoot ratio observed in plants irrigated with s water in the first growth phase table 1 may be explained by the ability of the plant under stress conditions and with limited photosynthetic activity to allocate carbohydrates primarily in the shoot to the detriment of the roots brouwer 1962 the lower stem root head and total plant dry weights observed in plants exposed to salinity stress in the first growth phase compared to ns s plants even if irrigated with ns water after the inflorescence appearance suggest that broccoli crops respond better to salinity stress after the first growth phase thus at least in terms of plant growth the use of ns water is more critical in the first growth phase than after the appearance of the inflorescence the application of s water through both growth stages had a significant impact on the accumulation and partitioning of na and cl in different broccoli tissues and influenced the accumulation of other nutrients tables 3 and 4 during both growth stages the excess na associated with the use of s water was accumulated primarily in leaves and stem and only in small proportion in roots and in the broccoli head these results are consistent with previous studies that demonstrated the partial ability of the plant to preserve the development of the apical tissues and of the inflorescence di gioia et al 2013a giuffrida et al 2013c 2017 most likely na is accumulated especially in the leaves with the transpiration flux and in part may be recirculated within the plant to limit its accumulation in the inflorescence and the most sensitive tissues nevertheless irrigation with s water during the second growth phase and thus during the formation of the inflorescence caused a slight increase of na and cl in the broccoli florets the accumulation of na in leaves stem and in lower proportion in the broccoli head also caused some ion imbalances as demonstrated by the lower k na mg2 na and ca2 na ratios observed in these tissues at the end of both growth stages tables 3 and 4 ion imbalances within plant tissues were determined not only by the accumulation of na and cl but also by a reduced concentration of k and no3 n which was likely a consequence of the antagonism between these ions and na and cl respectively grattan and grieve 1998 the lower concentration of no3 observed in the leaves at 62 dat could be a consequence of the antagonism with cl as observed in previous studies giuffrida et al 2017 as well as a consequence of the lower transpiration and water uptake of the plants exposed to salinity stress abdelgadir et al 2005 on the other hand due to its similar physicochemical properties the excess of na in the s water likely limited the uptake of k wakeel 2013 the reduction of broccoli yield observed in plants exposed to salinity stress regardless of its timing was due to the reduced 24 on average broccoli head mean fresh weight observed in s s s ns and ns s plants compared to plants irrigated with ns water during the entire crop cycle table 5 the use of s water likely caused a decrease of the broccoli head mean fresh weight by reducing the plant water uptake and thus the plant water potential with a consequent inhibition of the process of cell division and expansion neumann 1997 such a hypothesis is supported by the higher dry matter and soluble solids content observed in broccoli heads of plants exposed to salinity stress compared to those irrigated exclusively with ns water table 5 similar effects on yield dry matter and total soluble solids content were observed in previous studies on broccoli and cauliflower giuffrida et al 2013b 2017 arugula bonasia et al 2017 tomato di gioia et al 2013a and other vegetable crops exposed to salinity stress rouphael et al 2012 broccoli no3 concentration was slightly above normal levels for broccoli di gioia et al 2013b and conversely to what observed for leaves stem and roots was not influenced by s water application regime in contrast with previous findings pez berenguer et al 2008 2009 irrigation with s water either for part or for the entire crop cycle did not significantly p 0 08 enhance broccoli head total gls concentration table 6 nevertheless the s water application regime had a significant impact on the proportion of indolic glss glucoraphanin glucoiberin glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin usually constitute the main glss found in broccoli petropoulos et al 2017 in this study glucoraphanin the precursor of sulforaphane was not detected and glucoiberin constituted the main gls regardless the application timing of saline irrigation water nevertheless the use of s water during the first growth phase induced a higher accumulation of glucobrassicin and its derivate neoglucobrassicin these results were consistent with the findings of guo et al 2013 who observed an increase of the concentration of glucobrassicin neoglucobrassicin and other indole glss in broccoli sprouts exposed to high salinity levels while sulforaphane is the most studied gls hydrolysis product and it is considered as one of the most potent anticarcinogenic isothiocyanates zhang et al 1992 iberin the hydrolysis product of the glucoiberin and indole 3 carbinol one of the hydrolysis products of glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin have also been found to have anticancer activity petropoulos et al 2017 stoewsand 1995 therefore the higher accumulation of indolic glss observed with the application of s water in only the first growth phase without a simultaneous decrease of the content of aliphatic glss most likely improved the potential health benefit effect of broccoli however it is possible that the higher concentration of indolic glss glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin associated with the use of s water during the first growth phase slightly altered the flavour of the broccoli in fact while sulforaphane and iberin are not characterized by a pungent flavour verkerk et al 2009 glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin have been associated with the bitter taste typical of most brassicas species which may be in conflict with the preference of most consumers drewnowski and gomez carneros 2000 5 conclusions application timing of saline irrigation water influenced broccoli plant growth yield and quality irrigation with saline water from transplanting to inflorescence appearance decreased leaf water and osmotic potential net co2 assimilation rate and favoured the accumulation at toxic levels of na and cl causing ion imbalances and reducing broccoli plant growth the use of saline water in the second growth phase had limited impact on plant growth however regardless of the timing the use of saline irrigation water caused a reduction in broccoli yield compared to irrigation with non saline water for the entire crop cycle in terms of quality the use of saline water improved dry matter and soluble solids content of the florets regardless of its application timing and had no impact on the total glucosinolate content nevertheless the application timing of saline irrigation water influenced the proportion of aliphatic and indolic glucosinolates with consequent potential effects on the beneficial health properties and the flavour of broccoli overall the use of non saline water is more critical during the first growth phase in terms of plant growth and while the application timing of saline water may not affect broccoli yield and commercial quality it has an impact on the glucosinolate profile of broccoli florets

question we considered it best be undertaken by using direct sap flow measurements of transpiration in these forests and then using this knowledge to develop irrigation management tools the main objective of this research is to quantify the water consumption of two arid forest species al ghaf and al sidr trees irrigated with saline groundwater gw at salinities typical of the region namely 10 ds m or 6400 ppm our results will enable the development of strategies for improving the use of saline water in agriculture and can address institutional and regulatory aspects of agricultural water management we show how our results will be used by ead in the regulations that have been promulgated through law 5 in abu dhabi 2 materials methods the major species in the arid forests of the abu dhabi desert are al ghaf al sidr al arak and al samar these species were chosen in our broader project to be our experimental trees because they are the most widely distributed native plant species in abu dhabi forests covering around 78 of forest plants in the emirate ead 2016a however in this paper we will only cover the ghaf and sidr trees that have been irrigated with saline groundwater gw further details for each of these tree species are provided below 2 1 research site and soil during december 2014 experiments were set up on two plots of mature al ghaf and al sidr tree in the khub al dahs forest 23 51 n 53 75 e near madinat zayed in the al dhafra region in the western desert of abu dhabi the soil type at the experimental site is classified as a typic torripsamment mixed hyperthermic soil ad158 ead 2009 this type of soil is a deep sandy soil with mixed mineralogy it is widely distributed across abu dhabi with more than 50 of the emirate having this soil type and the majority of the arid forests in the emirate are on this soil type a mini disk infiltrometer decagon devices inc pullman washington usa was used to measure the soil s near saturated hydraulic conductivity k mm h 1 the 3 d flow of water from the fritted disk of the mini disk of radius r o quickly approaches a steady state q m3 s 1 wooding s equation wooding 1968 describes this steady flow in relation to the disk s radius and the soil s hydraulic conductivity function if it is of the form 1 k h k s exp α h where h is the soil water pressure head mm k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity when h 0 and α is the slope of the exponential k h relationship wooding s equation is 2 q k s π r o 2 4 r o α measurements of q from a minidisk of radius r o can be used to resolve the soil s hydraulic character however the equation contains two unknowns k s and α so multiple observations are required clothier 2000 ankeny et al 1991 proposed a simultaneous solution of wooding s equation based on a single permeameter and observations of steady infiltration at the two different heads h 1 and h 2 the infiltration commenced with h 2 first being 60 mm and then with h 1 being 5 mm five replicate measurements of these were made the structureless wind blown sand is spatially quite uniform the sand was found to be very permeable the slope α was found to be 0 02 mm 1 and by extrapolation from h 1 to h 0 eq 1 the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was found to be 9 m h 1 2 2 drip irrigation automatic irrigation systems were installed at both experimental sites to control and manage the irrigation two tanks of 22 730 l one at the ghaf site and the other at the sidr site are filled continuously with gw with salinity of 8 10 ds m 1 the water is then transferred into smaller tanks of 2273 litres to help in the mixing of the water inside the tanks and reduce salinity variations each system was run for 7 h daily starting early in the morning flow meters record the actual amounts of irrigated water water is applied to trees using pressure compensated drippers with two 4 l h 1 drippers per tree thus each tree would receive just under 60 l d 1 every day of the year because of the permeable nature of this coarse sand we sought to understand what size the wetted volume of soil would be when irrigated by dripper at 4 l h 1 for 7 h to do this we used philip s 1984 analytical solution for steady state travel times away from a surface point source discharging at rate q l h 1 this is reasonable as steady state conditions develop rapidly during 3 d infiltration especially close to the emitter clothier 1984 philip s 1984 solution also assumed an exponential hydraulic conductivity function with slope α eq 1 the solution depends only on q α and the soil s average water content θ m3 m 3 philip 1984 provided a simple solution especially the radius of wetting r at the surface depth z 0 where the expansion of the wet front with time t will be 3 t r o 2 exp r 1 r r 2 2 2 and for penetration of the wet front directly under the dripper r 0 4 t o z z 2 2 z ln 1 z here the non dimensional lengths are z αz where z is the depth m below the dripper and r αr where r m is the radial distance from the dripper the non dimensional travel time t from the origin is 5 t α3 qt 16πθ the wet front penetration predictions using eqs 3 and 4 are shown in fig 1 for q 4 l h 1 and an average water content in the transmission zone of 0 2 m3 m 3 and α 0 02 mm 1 it can be seen that during the 7 h irrigation the wet front at the surface could be expected to reach about 200 mm away from the dripper this is what we observed in the field underneath the dripper the wet front would be expected to extend beyond 0 6 m so the drippers would wet the soil to some considerable depth enabling the trees to take up water from deeper down to meet the atmospheric demand for water 2 3 soil water and salinity monitoring two campbell cs655 soil water content reflectometers were installed in the drip zone of both the ghaf and sidr plots one probe was inserted in the drip zone of a gw irrigated tree and the other in that of a tree irrigated with treated sewage effluent tse the cs655 measures the soil water content θ and bulk electrical conductivity ec b ds m 1 in a separate laboratory test we calibrated the cs655 probe to infer the soil solution ec from both θ and ec b the calibration for ec was found to be linear with ec b and parabolic with θ al muaini pers comm 2016 in fig 2 we show the daily pattern of θ and ec during the irrigation period 0630 1330 for the gw irrigated al ghaf that was instrumented with the cs655 probe the rapid rise and fall of θ reflects the highly permeable nature of this sand and rootzone uptake of water to meet the atmosphere s demand on the tree for water the calibration equation for ec provides erroneous values when the soil is at saturation after the free water drains away from the drip zone the ec can be seen to rise to just over 8 ds m 1 being about the salinity of the applied water here and throughout the year at this irrigation rate of about 60 l per tree per day there is no change in the solution ec value showing that there is effective flushing of excess salts from the rootzone 2 4 the tree species there are 12 trees in each of the 2 plots for al ghaf and al sidr and within each plot six trees have been irrigated with gw and six with treated sewage effluent tse the gw has a salinity of around 10 ds m 1 whereas the tse has a salinity of less than 1 ds m 1 here we report only on the gw results our focus here is to develop water management protocols for saline groundwaters the ghaf or al ghaf is the local arabic name for prosopis cineraria al ghaf tree has a straight unbranched trunk for the first few metres then the branching starts it is an indigenous species of the arabian desert al ghaf is a drought tolerant evergreen leguminous tree which can tolerate the harsh climate of the desert environment however the ghaf trees in managed forests are all dependent upon irrigation al ghaf trees can survive even when irrigated with highly saline groundwater nevertheless the degree of salinity does affect their natural growth and health despite being evergreen al ghaf undergoes cycles of leaf fall fruiting and leaf renewal khan 1999 the sidr or al sidr is the local arabic name for ziziphus spina christi the trunk may be undivided or divided near the base the sidr tree is frequently multi branched sidr is tolerant to harsh conditions such as salt drought desert heat and even heavy grazing by gazelles and camels khan 1999 ead 2006 2 5 sapflow monitoring of transpiration we installed heat pulse devices in four trees per treatment to provide continuous monitoring of the trees transpiration t using the compensation heat pulse velocity chpv method green et al 2003 we used a standard spacing of the temperature probes of 5 mm upstream and 10 mm downstream from the heater probe for the larger single trunk ghaf trees the temperature sensors in the probes were located at 10 25 40 and 55 mm below the cambium two sets of devices were installed in each of the four trees for the thinner and multi stemmed sidr trees only two sensors per probe were used and these were located at 5 and 12 mm below the cambium four stems were instrumented in each of the four monitored al sidr trees a campbell data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan usa was used to measure the time taken to achieve temperature equality between sensors located above and below the heater t z s following the application of a 2 5 s heat pulse data were collected at 30 min intervals sap flow l h 1 was calculated from measurements of t z using the approach outlined by green et al 2003 green et al 2009 these calculations included a correction for the effect of wounding a wound diameter of 2 8 mm was used for the 2 0 mm diameter drill holes sap velocity was then deduced from the wound corrected heat pulse velocity and measured volumetric fractions of wood and water within the sapwood the fractions of wood fm and water fl in the sapwood were determined gravimetrically from core samples fm 0 35 and fl 0 60 transpiration t l d 1 was determined by multiplying sap velocity by the conducting wood area using the simple annulus approach suggested by hatton et al 1990 this equipment was installed in the al ghaf trees during december 2014 and during february 2015 in the sidr trees the experiments have continued through into 2018 2 6 weather monitoring the weather station at khub al dahs forest records sub hourly climate data comprising global shortwave radiation licor 1200 air temperature and relative humidity vaisala hmp 45c wind speed at 3 m rm young and rainfall te525 mm l texas electronics these weather data are used to estimate hourly and daily values of the reference evaporation eto mm h 1 or mm d 1 using the standard approach of fao 56 allen 1998 the transpiration of the trees etc mm h 1 or mm d 1 is then related to et o through the dimensionless crop factor k c 6 et c k c et o 3 results and discussion 3 1 al ghaf transpiration sap flow data for the four gw irrigated ghaf trees began on 12 december 2014 and continued through until 2017 the four trees are of different sizes and so we would expect the crop factor kc to vary between trees in fig 3 top we show the hourly transpiration of tree 3 in l h 1 one of the largest in relation to the reference eto mm h 1 over a period of nearly 3 weeks in the spring of 2014 the vertical axes have been scaled so the traces overlap each other that the traces do overlap indicates that a single crop factor eq 6 is appropriate for describing this data set we have repeated this scaling procedure for the smallest gw irrigated ghaf tree 2 and this is shown in fig 3 bottom note the different scales of the right hand axes which reflects the smaller crop factor for the smaller tree the daily value of the crop factor can be quantified by regressing tree water use t in l d 1 against the reference eto in mm d 1 using a year s data set for both trees from 12 december 2014 until 24 november 2015 we found the slope of the regressions to be 4 55 for the large tree tree 3 and 2 88 for the smaller tree 2 fig 4 since the trees are planted on a 7 m by 7 m grid these slopes turn into crop factors of 0 09 4 55 7 7 for tree 3 and 0 059 2 88 7 7 for tree 2 however it is clear from the scatter of both plots that a single annual crop factor kc would not enable a good prediction of the seasonal pattern of daily tree water use etc indeed the correlation coefficient for the regressions are 0 29 and 1 22 respectively for tree 3 and tree 2 which suggests a simple arithmetic annual average for t adjusted to the different tree sizes would be better than using a unitary crop factor and a time varying eto it is instructive therefore to examine the seasonal pattern of daily tree water use t in relation to daily eto for all four monitored trees and over the period of nearly 2 5 years of measurement these data are shown in fig 5 here as the red dots with eto in blue the left hand axes in fig 5 all have different scales as the tree water use t of the two smallest trees trees 2 and 5 do not exceed 40 l d 1 whereas the two larger trees use between 60 and 80 l d 1 as alluded to in fig 4 the pattern of t diverges from eto at distinct times of the year due to the deciduous behaviour of al ghaf there is a period of leaf loss during june which is most noticeable in tree 3 and also in trees 2 and 5 this is not quite so evident with tree 4 furthermore the magnitude of this dip in t is different between years for tree 3 in 2015 the period of both leaf loss and leaf regrowth in june was very sharp covering about 25 days tree 4 in both years showed only weak deciduous behaviours this complex and asynchronous behaviour leads to difficulties in applying a crop factor approach to etc prediction however given the variation due to tree sizes both within our experimental trees and throughout the forest stand an aggregated approach to defining kc was adopted the sap flow data from all four monitored trees was aggregated into average tree water use values over the 2 years of experimentation and these are shown in relation to eto fig 6 the linked patterns of t in l d 1 and eto in mm d 1 can be used to determine the temporal pattern of the crop factor the impact of the varying asynchrony of leaf fall flowering and new leaf growth leads to a muted average pattern of t in relation to eto the phenology of al ghaf trees is typically that new leaves appear just before or simultaneously with the fall of the old leaves flowering typically begins just after the flush of new leaves this pattern of new foliage flowering and fruiting occurs during the hottest period of the year between march and august however we have found that the relative strengths of the vegetative and flowering cycles varies in any given year between trees and is due to the biennial bearing characteristic displayed by fruiting trees in fig 7 we show photos of two neighbouring trees tree 3 left and tree 4 right taken on the same day in 2017 tree 3 can be seen to be having an on year in relation to flowering whereas as tree 4 was having an off for flowering the relative vegetative vigour of the trees is different with tree 4 showing a surge of new leaf growth elsewhere in our experimental plot of eight instrumented trees four gw irrigated and four tse irrigated we observed five trees to be having on years of flowering and three with off years of flowering it is this asynchrony that leads to the muted seasonally deciduous pattern in the average t in relation to eto fig 6 we can scale up to the forest stand using the average pattern of t relative to eto to compute the average crop factor kc this is shown in fig 8 there is a weak seasonal deciduous pattern on average the crop factor drops in february march as the trees begin to lose leaves as they initiate flowering then kc remains effectively constant until new leaf growth lifts the crop factor in september to its peak in december this pattern in the average kc enables us to predict irrigation requirements for stands of al ghaf trees as we show later 3 2 al sidr transpiration our measured etc for each of the four multi stemmed sidr trees is computed using our baseline measurements of sapflow in four measured stems the flow in the measured stems was scaled to a flux density using the trunk cross sectional area of the measured stems the trees were then surveyed to find the diameters of all of the stems the total trunk cross sectional area of the whole tree was computed and the sap flux density applied to this to compute the tree s total water use the pattern of tree water use t is shown for al sidr trees 3 and 5 in fig 9 along with the seasonal pattern over two years of eto the impact of the deciduous behaviour of the sidr trees is distinct and synchronous there is a rapid loss of leaves in april followed by rapid new leaf growth in may there is a second less distinct period of leaf loss in august with regrowth during september our measurements and observations in the forest stand reveal a greater degree of synchrony between trees with less evidence of biennial bearing in fig 10 we show how significant the deciduous behaviour in spring can be on the left of fig 10 we show sidr tree 4 at the full leaf stage in january 2017 by april the tree has no leaves at all fig 10 right in the background of the april photo it can be seen that most trees have either no leaves or just a few the average crop factor kc was computed for all four trees and the seasonal pattern over the year is shown in fig 11 using over two years of sapflow measurements a strong seasonal pattern is found albeit with a degree of variability due to some weak asynchrony and tree to tree variation a 4th order polynomial was fitted to the data and is shown in fig 11 the amplitude in the seasonal pattern of the average kc is large ranging from 0 16 in december january down to 0 06 in summer in contrast the average kc for the ghaf trees ranged from just 0 10 0 15 3 3 irrigation allocation and law 5 current practice is to irrigate both the ghaf and sidr trees with 60 l d 1 of groundwater implementation of abu dhabi s law 5 requires that irrigation be allocated at the minimum amount required to achieve the desired goal our results here are being used to define the irrigation allocation under law 5 for amenity plantings of al ghaf and al sidr trees we use our fitted values of kc broken down by the maximum value for every month to determine firstly the water use of the trees with what we consider to be an equitable 25 factor of safety table 1 because the trees are irrigated with gw at a salinity of 8 10 ds m 1 we recommended that the irrigation allocation be at 1 5 etc so as to provide a 25 salt leaching fraction we have assessed whether a salt leaching fraction of 25 with a factor of safety of 25 is sufficient by monitoring the rootzone salinity of an al ghaf and al sidr tree during 2017 after imposing a monthly irrigation schedule of 1 5 etc we present the results for the ghaf tree in fig 12 the irrigation schedule tracked 1 5 times the measured etc and the bulk electrical conductivity can be seen to rise from around 0 5 1 ds m 1 prior to irrigation up to about 1 2 ds m 1 the pattern depends on the season due to the varying rootzone dynamics of wetting by irrigation and extraction by the tree however there is no progressive rise in the bulk ec of the soil as the bulk ec in january 2018 was the same as it was in january 2017 this indicates that an irrigation rate of 1 5 etc is sufficient to flush excess salts from the rootzone the monthly pattern of irrigation requirements at 1 5 etc shows that al ghaf trees will need on average just 24 l d 1 during winter and up to 53 l d 1 in summer fig 6 the annual average daily water requirements will be 42 l d 1 a saving of 30 on the current practice of 60 l d 1 for the smaller sidr trees the water requirements are less with the lowest water needs occurring in may at 30 l d 1 and rising to 43 l d 1 in october fig 9 on annual average the water requirement for al sidr is just 35 l d 1 an annual saving of over 40 on current practice 4 conclusions the arid forests in the hyper arid deserts of abu dhabi require irrigating saline groundwater is the predominant source for the irrigation water and current practice is to irrigate al ghaf and al sidr trees with design quantity of 60 l of groundwater every day of the year over extraction of the emirate s aquifers threatens groundwater sustainability consequently law 5 has been passed in abu dhabi to restrict groundwater takes for irrigation to protect the subterranean reserves of water law 5 will prescribe allocation limits so that only the minimum amount of water is used to achieve the desired outcome we have carried out experiments on al ghaf and al sidr trees in the western desert of abu dhabi using sap flow measurements to monitor tree water use over 2 5 years these results were used to quantify the seasonal pattern in the crop factor kc for these two deciduous arid forest species the seasonal patterns between the two species are quite different due to their idiosyncratic patterns of leaf fall flowering and leaf regrowth by using predicting tree water use etc as 1 5 kc eto we could provide the regulations for law 5 with irrigation allocation recommendations that included a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction these recommendations represent a 30 reduction on current practice for the groundwater irrigation of al ghaf trees and a 40 saving for al sidr trees 
11471,the arid forests of abu dhabi provide a variety of valuable provisioning regulating and cultural ecosystem services they require irrigating and groundwater is the source about 95 of groundwater consumption is for agriculture and forestry over extraction threatens groundwater resources the government of abu dhabi recently passed law 5 to restrict groundwater abstraction we have determined the minimum allocation required for the irrigation of two tree species we carried out experiments at madinat zayed in the western desert on two arid forest species al ghaf prosopis cineraria and al sidr ziziphus spina christi both planted on a 7 m 7 m grid we measured the actual evapotranspiration etc using heat pulse equipment in the trees saline groundwater with an electrical conductivity of about 8 10 ds m 1 was used for irrigation current practice is to drip irrigate with 60 l d 1 both species displayed distinct and different summer deciduous behaviours that determine their seasonal pattern of etc a single crop factor approach using etc predicted from kc eto where kc is the crop factor and eto is the reference evaporation would not provide appropriate irrigation allocations from our hourly measurements of etc made over 3 years we quantified the seasonal pattern in kc for al ghaf kc ranged from 0 1 during february july to 0 15 in november december for the sidr kc was at a minimum of 0 06 in may and rose to 0 16 in december daily irrigation requirements were provided for law 5 with a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching requirement irrigation requirements for al ghaf ranged from 24 4 l d 1 in january to 52 8 l d 1 in july for al sidr the range was from 33 8 l d 1 in april to 53 5 l d 1 in september these are a 40 saving on current practice keywords hyper arid

activities including irrigation have been stopped in these forests another key strategy for addressing abu dhabi s groundwater sustainability includes regulating for the responsible use of the remaining groundwater in 2017 during the international water summit iws ead announced the new law no 5 the groundwater organisation law for abu dhabi emirate passed by hh sheikh khalifa bin zayed al

for the first few metres then the branching starts it is an indigenous species of the arabian desert al ghaf is a drought tolerant evergreen leguminous tree which can tolerate the harsh climate of the desert environment however the ghaf trees in managed forests are all dependent upon irrigation al ghaf trees can survive even when irrigated with highly saline groundwater nevertheless the degree of salinity does affect their natural growth and health despite being evergreen al ghaf undergoes cycles of leaf fall fruiting and leaf renewal khan 1999 the sidr or al sidr is the local arabic name for ziziphus spina christi the trunk may be undivided or divided near the base the sidr tree is frequently multi branched sidr is tolerant to harsh conditions such as salt drought desert heat and even heavy grazing by gazelles and camels khan 1999 ead 2006 2 5 sapflow monitoring of transpiration we installed heat pulse devices in four trees per treatment to provide continuous monitoring of the trees transpiration t using the compensation heat pulse velocity chpv method green et al 2003 we used a standard spacing of the temperature probes of 5 mm upstream and 10 mm downstream from the heater probe for the larger single trunk ghaf trees the temperature sensors in the probes were located at 10 25 40 and 55 mm below the cambium two sets of devices were installed in each of the four trees for the thinner and multi stemmed sidr trees only two sensors per probe were used and these were located at 5 and 12 mm below the cambium four stems were instrumented in each of the four monitored al sidr trees a campbell data logger cr1000 campbell scientific logan usa was used to measure the time taken to achieve temperature equality between sensors located above and below the heater t z s following the application of a 2 5 s heat pulse data were collected at 30 min intervals sap flow l h 1 was calculated from measurements of t z using the approach outlined by green et al 2003 green et al 2009 these calculations included a correction for the effect of wounding a wound diameter of 2 8 mm was used for the 2 0 mm diameter drill holes sap velocity was then deduced from the wound corrected heat pulse velocity and measured volumetric fractions of wood and water within the sapwood the fractions of wood fm and water fl in the sapwood were determined gravimetrically from core samples fm 0 35 and fl 0 60 transpiration t l d 1 was determined by multiplying sap velocity by the conducting wood area using the simple annulus approach suggested by hatton et al 1990 this equipment was installed in the al ghaf trees during december 2014 and during february 2015 in the sidr trees the experiments have continued through into 2018 2 6 weather monitoring the weather station at khub al dahs forest records sub hourly climate data comprising global shortwave radiation licor 1200 air temperature and relative humidity vaisala hmp 45c wind speed at 3 m rm young and rainfall te525 mm l texas electronics these weather data are used to estimate hourly and daily values of the reference evaporation eto mm h 1 or mm d 1 using the standard approach of fao 56 allen 1998 the transpiration of the trees etc mm h 1 or mm d 1 is then related to et o through the dimensionless crop factor k c 6 et c k c et o 3 results and discussion 3 1 al ghaf transpiration sap flow data for the four gw irrigated ghaf trees began on 12 december 2014 and continued through until 2017 the four trees are of different sizes and so we would expect the crop factor kc to vary between trees in fig 3 top we show the hourly transpiration of tree 3 in l h 1 one of the largest in relation to the reference eto mm h 1 over a period of nearly 3 weeks in the spring of 2014 the vertical axes have been scaled so the traces overlap each other that the traces do overlap indicates that a single crop factor eq 6 is appropriate for describing this data set we have repeated this scaling procedure for the smallest gw irrigated ghaf tree 2 and this is shown in fig 3 bottom note the different scales of the right hand axes which reflects the smaller crop factor for the smaller tree the daily value of the crop factor can be quantified by regressing tree water use t in l d 1 against the reference eto in mm d 1 using a year s data set for both trees from 12 december 2014 until 24 november 2015 we found the slope of the regressions to be 4 55 for the large tree tree 3 and 2 88 for the smaller tree 2 fig 4 since the trees are planted on a 7 m by 7 m grid these slopes turn into crop factors of 0 09 4 55 7 7 for tree 3 and 0 059 2 88 7 7 for tree 2 however it is clear from the scatter of both plots that a single annual crop factor kc would not enable a good prediction of the seasonal pattern of daily tree water use etc indeed the correlation coefficient for the regressions are 0 29 and 1 22 respectively for tree 3 and tree 2 which suggests a simple arithmetic annual average for t adjusted to the different tree sizes would be better than using a unitary crop factor and a time varying eto it is instructive therefore to examine the seasonal pattern of daily tree water use t in relation to daily eto for all four monitored trees and over the period of nearly 2 5 years of measurement these data are shown in fig 5 here as the red dots with eto in blue the left hand axes in fig 5 all have different scales as the tree water use t of the two smallest trees trees 2 and 5 do not exceed 40 l d 1 whereas the two larger trees use between 60 and 80 l d 1 as alluded to in fig 4 the pattern of t diverges from eto at distinct times of the year due to the deciduous behaviour of al ghaf there is a period of leaf loss during june which is most noticeable in tree 3 and also in trees 2 and 5 this is not quite so evident with tree 4 furthermore the magnitude of this dip in t is different between years for tree 3 in 2015 the period of both leaf loss and leaf regrowth in june was very sharp covering about 25 days tree 4 in both years showed only weak deciduous behaviours this complex and asynchronous behaviour leads to difficulties in applying a crop factor approach to etc prediction however given the variation due to tree sizes both within our experimental trees and throughout the forest stand an aggregated approach to defining kc was adopted the sap flow data from all four monitored trees was aggregated into average tree water use values over the 2 years of experimentation and these are shown in relation to eto fig 6 the linked patterns of t in l d 1 and eto in mm d 1 can be used to determine the temporal pattern of the crop factor the impact of the varying asynchrony of leaf fall flowering and new leaf growth leads to a muted average pattern of t in relation to eto the phenology of al ghaf trees is typically that new leaves appear just before or simultaneously with the fall of the old leaves flowering typically begins just after the flush of new leaves this pattern of new foliage flowering and fruiting occurs during the hottest period of the year between march and august however we have found that the relative strengths of the vegetative and flowering cycles varies in any given year between trees and is due to the biennial bearing characteristic displayed by fruiting trees in fig 7 we show photos of two neighbouring trees tree 3 left and tree 4 right taken on the same day in 2017 tree 3 can be seen to be having an on year in relation to flowering whereas as tree 4 was having an off for flowering the relative vegetative vigour of the trees is different with tree 4 showing a surge of new leaf growth elsewhere in our experimental plot of eight instrumented trees four gw irrigated and four tse irrigated we observed five trees to be having on years of flowering and three with off years of flowering it is this asynchrony that leads to the muted seasonally deciduous pattern in the average t in relation to eto fig 6 we can scale up to the forest stand using the average pattern of t relative to eto to compute the average crop factor kc this is shown in fig 8 there is a weak seasonal deciduous pattern on average the crop factor drops in february march as the trees begin to lose leaves as they initiate flowering then kc remains effectively constant until new leaf growth lifts the crop factor in september to its peak in december this pattern in the average kc enables us to predict irrigation requirements for stands of al ghaf trees as we show later 3 2 al sidr transpiration our measured etc for each of the four multi stemmed sidr trees is computed using our baseline measurements of sapflow in four measured stems the flow in the measured stems was scaled to a flux density using the trunk cross sectional area of the measured stems the trees were then surveyed to find the diameters of all of the stems the total trunk cross sectional area of the whole tree was computed and the sap flux density applied to this to compute the tree s total water use the pattern of tree water use t is shown for al sidr trees 3 and 5 in fig 9 along with the seasonal pattern over two years of eto the impact of the deciduous behaviour of the sidr trees is distinct and synchronous there is a rapid loss of leaves in april followed by rapid new leaf growth in may there is a second less distinct period of leaf loss in august with regrowth during september our measurements and observations in the forest stand reveal a greater degree of synchrony between trees with less evidence of biennial bearing in fig 10 we show how significant the deciduous behaviour in spring can be on the left of fig 10 we show sidr tree 4 at the full leaf stage in january 2017 by april the tree has no leaves at all fig 10 right in the background of the april photo it can be seen that most trees have either no leaves or just a few the average crop factor kc was computed for all four trees and the seasonal pattern over the year is shown in fig 11 using over two years of sapflow measurements a strong seasonal pattern is found albeit with a degree of variability due to some weak asynchrony and tree to tree variation a 4th order polynomial was fitted to the data and is shown in fig 11 the amplitude in the seasonal pattern of the average kc is large ranging from 0 16 in december january down to 0 06 in summer in contrast the average kc for the ghaf trees ranged from just 0 10 0 15 3 3 irrigation allocation and law 5 current practice is to irrigate both the ghaf and sidr trees with 60 l d 1 of groundwater implementation of abu dhabi s law 5 requires that irrigation be allocated at the minimum amount required to achieve the desired goal our results here are being used to define the irrigation allocation under law 5 for amenity plantings of al ghaf and al sidr trees we use our fitted values of kc broken down by the maximum value for every month to determine firstly the water use of the trees with what we consider to be an equitable 25 factor of safety table 1 because the trees are irrigated with gw at a salinity of 8 10 ds m 1 we recommended that the irrigation allocation be at 1 5 etc so as to provide a 25 salt leaching fraction we have assessed whether a salt leaching fraction of 25 with a factor of safety of 25 is sufficient by monitoring the rootzone salinity of an al ghaf and al sidr tree during 2017 after imposing a monthly irrigation schedule of 1 5 etc we present the results for the ghaf tree in fig 12 the irrigation schedule tracked 1 5 times the measured etc and the bulk electrical conductivity can be seen to rise from around 0 5 1 ds m 1 prior to irrigation up to about 1 2 ds m 1 the pattern depends on the season due to the varying rootzone dynamics of wetting by irrigation and extraction by the tree however there is no progressive rise in the bulk ec of the soil as the bulk ec in january 2018 was the same as it was in january 2017 this indicates that an irrigation rate of 1 5 etc is sufficient to flush excess salts from the rootzone the monthly pattern of irrigation requirements at 1 5 etc shows that al ghaf trees will need on average just 24 l d 1 during winter and up to 53 l d 1 in summer fig 6 the annual average daily water requirements will be 42 l d 1 a saving of 30 on the current practice of 60 l d 1 for the smaller sidr trees the water requirements are less with the lowest water needs occurring in may at 30 l d 1 and rising to 43 l d 1 in october fig 9 on annual average the water requirement for al sidr is just 35 l d 1 an annual saving of over 40 on current practice 4 conclusions the arid forests in the hyper arid deserts of abu dhabi require irrigating saline groundwater is the predominant source for the irrigation water and current practice is to irrigate al ghaf and al sidr trees with design quantity of 60 l of groundwater every day of the year over extraction of the emirate s aquifers threatens groundwater sustainability consequently law 5 has been passed in abu dhabi to restrict groundwater takes for irrigation to protect the subterranean reserves of water law 5 will prescribe allocation limits so that only the minimum amount of water is used to achieve the desired outcome we have carried out experiments on al ghaf and al sidr trees in the western desert of abu dhabi using sap flow measurements to monitor tree water use over 2 5 years these results were used to quantify the seasonal pattern in the crop factor kc for these two deciduous arid forest species the seasonal patterns between the two species are quite different due to their idiosyncratic patterns of leaf fall flowering and leaf regrowth by using predicting tree water use etc as 1 5 kc eto we could provide the regulations for law 5 with irrigation allocation recommendations that included a 25 factor of safety and a 25 salt leaching fraction these recommendations represent a 30 reduction on current practice for the groundwater irrigation of al ghaf trees and a 40 saving for al sidr trees 
11472,agricultural soils are strong sources of the potent greenhouse gas n2o but soil n2o emissions and its microbial mechanism in greenhouse field especially ammonia oxidizing microorganisms are unclear we characterized a potential response in soil n2o production and its influencing factors such as soil temperature moisture ph and inorganic nitrogen to different irrigation methods named drip irrigation di subsurface irrigation si and furrow irrigation fi in a long term irrigation field in greenhouse the abundance and metabolic activity of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and bacteria aob in greenhouse soils were also investigated using amoa gene as a molecular biomarker by quantitative pcr and 13co2 dna stable isotope probing sip methods results showed that n2o flux peaks would obviously occur within 1 8 days after each irrigation the soil n2o flux in fi treatment was significantly higher than that in di and si treatments p 0 05 correlation analysis between soil n2o flux and its influencing factors indicated that soil moisture and nitrate nitrogen were substantially affecting soil n2o emissions compared with soil temperature ph and ammonium nitrogen the copy numbers of aoa amoa gene in fi treatment were significantly higher than those in di and si treatments p 0 05 while there is no significant difference of aob amoa gene among the three treatments also the copy numbers of aoa amoa gene were significantly higher than those of aob amoa gene the 13co2 dna sip and phylogenetic tree results indicated only aob dominantly involved in nitrosospira genera was active during the nitrification process in the three irrigation methods our findings provided direct evidence that drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation could effectively reduce soil n2o emissions in greenhouse aoa was dominant in abundance while aob played a key role in microbial community under the conditions of this experiment future characterization of the mechanisms for ammonia oxidation requires deeper

was performed at a long term irrigation experimental station began in 2010 shen yang agricultural university which is located in shen yang liaoning province china 41 49 22 n 123 33 55 e the study area has a temperate sub humid continental climate the annual mean precipitation is approximately 721 9 mm the experimental soil was a brown soil and classified as mollic gleysols in the fao unescosystem the initial soil organic matter content is 12 58 g kg 1 total n content 1 47 g kg 1 and available n content 61 26 mg kg 1 at ph 5 8 the tomato was planted on april 19th and harvested on august 6th 2015 three irrigation methods as drip irrigation di subsurface irrigation si and furrow irrigation fi were performed in the present study plots 20 m2 were interspersed in completely randomized blocks with three repetitions the irrigation control upper and lower limits of three irrigation treatments were soil water suction 6 kpa and 30 kpa the lower limits of all treatments were detected by tensiometers placed in 30 cm soil layer at 8 00 a m every day the irrigation would begin during the time that the treated soil water suction value reached or exceeded the setting irrigation control lower limit 30 kpa of soil water suction value and when the irrigation and gas collection conflicted the principle of gas collection was firstly taken the soil water holding characteristic curve previously measured by the soil samples collected in the greenhouse was measured and the soil water content corresponding to the upper and lower limits of soil water suction was calculated according

three irrigation methods the wetting layer in fi treatment was received fully moistened while the di and si treatments were partly moistened and drainage holes in si treatment were stronger around the root system of the underground crop hence the wetting ratios r of fi di and si were set at 1 00 0 50 and 0 33 respectively the single irrigation amount of three irrigation methods based on above was calculated and shown in table 1 in order to prevent the water from penetrating each other during the experiment process all plots were separated by plastic film with a depth of 60 cm the drip irrigation zone was placed on the surface and the drainage holes were placed near the tomato plant about 10 cm to the plant the subsurface irrigation pipes were covered the depth of 30 cm and the plastic film also employed to prevent the water from penetrating sawdust as a filter layer of 1 cm thick on subsurface irrigation pipes was used to prevent the wetting soil from plugging the drainage holes the type and amount of fertilizer applications among three treatments were consistent rotten cow dung n 1 84 and c n 13 and puffed chicken manure n 3 13 and c n 6 were applied before planting and the application rates were 22 5 t ha 1 and 37 5 t ha 1 respectively at the time of colonization urea n 46 phosham n 17 and p2o5 45 and potassium sulfate k2o 51 were applied when tomato planted and the application rates were 0 15 t ha 1 0 6 t ha 1 0 6 t ha 1 respectively on the 9th and july 7th the urea was applied twice with the corresponding irrigation method and the application amount was 0

mixing air to ensure uniform gas the upper part of the chamber body was installed for the determination of the temperature thermometer when the tomato plants grew to more than 60 cm an additional box was added to ensure the smooth progress of sampling the base 50 50 25 cm3 was inserted into soil when the tomato was planted when sampling the box body was placed on the base with water sealing we extracted 40 ml gas with an injection syringe at intervals 0 5 10 15 20 min after hooding the box respectively and then brought back to the laboratory soil n2o emissions were sampled twice a week after irrigation treatment gas samples were collected from 8 00 to 10 00 a m on wednesday and sunday the depth of 5 cm soil temperature was measured with a curved tube thermometer while collecting gas samples the samples in the air bag were analyzed by a gas chromatograph and the concentration of n2o was analyzed by an electron capture detector ecd the gas flux was calculated based on the rate of

emission flux of each treatment in the whole tomato growing season fluctuated fiercely and the change trend was not consistent the obvious emission peaks were observed in 1 8 days after each irrigation and two days after top dressing the reason for this phenomenon might be due to the study of irrigation water by measuring the value of soil water suction and then the irrigation time of the three irrigation methods were different resulting in soil n2o emission flux trends were inconsistent the maximum soil n2o emissions occurred in the earlier stage of tomato growth di and si treatment on may 27 fi treatment for may 24 mainly because a large number of organic and inorganic fertilizers as base fertilizers were applied before planting it provided a sufficient substrate for the microorganisms which was conducive to nitrification and denitrification process and promoted the soil n2o emissions the soil n2o emission flux changed drastically in the earlier stage of tomato growth and maintained at a low level at the end of the tomato growth period the soil n2o emission flux of fi treatment in the whole tomato growing season was significantly higher than that of si treatment and di treatment the average and cumulative n2o emission fluxes under di and si treatments were significantly lower than those under fi treatment p 0 05 using the drip and subsurface irrigation methods apparently reduced the total n2o production by approximately 50 and saved the water by about 50 table 3 3 2 soil temperature and moisture soil temperature and moisture are important factors affecting soil n2o emission the soil temperature of the different irrigation methods varied little during the whole tomato growing season and the overall trend of soil temperature was basically accordant fig 2 the soil temperature in the whole tomato growing season varied from 21 to 28 c with an average temperature of 24 5 c affected by climate the soil temperature reached a high level since july 12th but this did not generate higher n2o emissions as irrigation determined by the soil water suction value irrigation time and amount were different therefore there was no consistent trend of soil moisture wfps during the whole tomato growing season the soil moisture wfps varied from 22 69 to 57 45 in the whole tomato growing season with an average of 43 00 3 3 soil inorganic nitrogen soil n2o emissions are mainly caused by nitrification and denitrification the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in soil directly affect nitrification and denitrification the no3 n concentration in soil was significantly higher than that in nh4 n concentrations fig 3 the nh4 n concentration changed in a certain range of 8 23 mg kg 1 with an average of 13 09 mg kg 1 and the no3 n concentration varied from 61 to 182 mg kg 1 with an average concentration of 98 32 mg kg 1 the nh4 n concentration in soils decreased firstly and then increased during the whole tomato season and the nh4 n concentration reached the maximum at harvesting the no3 n concentration followed no consistent trends for all treatments and the highest value was detected at the beginning of tomato growth 3 4 soil ph the soil ph under different irrigation methods during the whole tomato growing season is presented in fig 4 showing a weak acid to neutral ph ranged from 5 86 to 6 76 similar to the mineral n there was no consistent change in soil ph from all the treatments the soil ph in all treatments before june 21st was significantly higher than that the date after june 21st and intensively decreased trend was observed from june 21st to july 5th 3 5 the abundance of nitrifying gene the copy numbers of amoa gene involved in aoa and aob in total soil dna under different irrigation methods are shown in fig 5 the copy numbers of aoa amoa gene varied from 2 05 108 to 1 46 1010 copies g 1 dry soil the copy numbers of aoa amoa gene in di and si treatments were significantly lower than those in fi treatment the copy numbers of aob amoa gene with the range of 9 23 107 1 92 108 copies g 1 dry soil showed no significant difference among three treatments the copy numbers of aoa amoa gene were higher than those of aob amoa gene by 1 2 orders of magnitude 3 6 the active ammonia oxidizing microorganisms in the soil labeled with 13c the abundances of amoa gene in dna after ultrahigh speed centrifugation by qpcr technique are summarized in fig 6 the copy numbers of amoa gene in 13co2 labeled dna increased with the increase of the buoyancy density gradient the samples of drip irrigation subsurface irrigation and furrow irrigation showed peak values on layers 5 6 and 8 respectively the results showed that the amoa gene of ammonia oxidizing bacteria was enriched in the heavy layer dna of 13c labeled samples after 5 weeks of cultivation which suggested that the ammonia oxidizing bacteria were strongly labeled however the ammonia oxidized archaea was not detected and observed in the 13c labeled heavy layer dna by pcr the cloned library of amoa gene of ammonia oxidizing bacteria was constructed on the 13c labeled heavy layer dna fig 7 phylogenetic development showed that all aob sequences belonged to the nitrosospira like the drip irrigation belonged to the unclassied nitrosospira like which was close to the furrow irrigation although the subsurface irrigation was the same as the nitrosospira like it did not belong to the same branch with furrow irrigation and drip irrigation 3 7 relationship between soil n2o flux and environmental factors ammonia oxidizing gene abundance the soil n2o flux exhibited positive relationships with soil wfps and no3 n concentrations p 0 01 but not with soil ph and nh4 n concentrations table 4 no relationship was observed between soil n2o flux and the abundance of the ammonia oxidizing genes 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of different irrigation methods on soil n2o emission china is a country lacking fresh water resources in addition because of insufficient land heat in the northeast greenhouse is more prevalent it is of practical significance to screen out the optimal irrigation methods in this study soil n2o emissions from the tomato growing season were systematically observed the soil n2o emission flux in furrow irrigation during the whole tomato growing season were significantly higher than that in drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation and there was significant difference p 0 05 this was consistent with the conclusions drawn by sánchez martín et al 2008 and zhang et al 2016c this indicated that different irrigation methods significantly affected soil n2o emissions this was mainly because the irrigation amount in fi treatment was higher than drip and subsurface irrigation which increased the anaerobic environment and caused denitrification or nitrifier denitrification and then n2o was produced and released into the atmosphere silva et al 2008 previous studies had shown that soil wet and dry cycles in the soil made nitrification and denitrification alternated which promoted the production of n2o borken and matzner 2009 harrison kirk et al 2013 priemé and christensen 2001 the current experiment was conducted by measuring the soil water suction for frequent irrigation and multiple dry and wet alternations were occurred in soil as the alternation of dry and wet increased amounts of dead microorganisms in the soil the mineralization of available carbon and available nitrogen increased n2o was produced more rapidly than its reduction when rainfall or irrigation made the soil fully moistened with denitrification resulting in accumulation schimel et al 2011 xiang et al 2008 at the same time soil wet and dry process directly affected the soil microbial activity by affecting the oxygen content in the soil thus affecting the soil nitrification and denitrification mikha et al 2005 and the soil microbial biomass increased rapidly after the drought denef et al 2001 in this study soil was wetted from the surface by the irrigation process and the irrigation amount in fi treatment was higher than that two other treatments under such a condition for wetting soil in 0 30 cm after irrigation microbial activity and abundance in furrow irrigation were higher than the drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation treatments easily being prone to denitrification the peak values in soil n2o flux of the three treatments during the tomato growing season were entirely exhibited in the period after irrigation or fertilization which was consistent with previous studies schellenberg et al 2012 zhang et al 2016d the result of the cumulative n2o flux in this study was far lower than those of some scholars kennedy et al 2013 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 which may be due to the same fertilizers under different irrigation practices in this experiment and the application of fertilizers amount and frequency was lower another reason for this finding might be that the lower water content was received before the n2o measurement associated with the higher temperature and faster evaporation rates in the greenhouse 4 2 impacts of environmental factors on soil n2o emissions soil temperature and moisture are documented as key drivers to influence the soil n2o emissions liu et al 2016 nosalewicz et al 2013 soil temperature affects the formations and emissions of soil n2o by affecting the activity of soil microbes agehara and warncke 2005 the appropriate temperature for nitrifying microbial activity was 15 35 c whereas denitrifying microbial activity for adapting to the temperature was 5 75 c for denitrifying microbial activity zheng et al 1997 in this study the soil temperature varied from 21 c to 28 c with an average temperature of 24 5 c which was beneficial to the activities of nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms the n2o flux in the whole tomato growing season was not significantly correlated with soil temperature which may be due to the soil temperature of 5 cm depth in this experiment was the optimum temperature for microbial activity at this time soil temperature of 5 cm depth was not the influencing factor to control soil n2o emissions in addition soil n2o flux and soil moisture wfps showed a very significant positive correlation p 0 01 which was in agreement with many scholars chen et al 2015 hou et al 2016 laville et al 2011 in the greenhouse environment soil moisture was the main factor affecting the soil n2o emissions the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n in the soil are expected to the most direct substrate of nitrification and denitrification determining the production of soil n2o transformed by nh4 n and no3 n gu et al 2013 liu et al 2010 also suggested that soil nh4 n and no3 n levels are one of the major environmental drivers for soil n2o emissions in this study the concentration of no3 n was significantly higher than that of nh4 n and the concentration of no3 n was positively correlated with the soil n2o flux these findings presumably suggested that nitrification or nitrifier denitrification was strongly occurred in irrigated soil during the whole tomato growing season the relative contributions of nitrification nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification to soil n2o production needed further researches using the dual isotope labelling technique kool et al 2011 soil ph affects nitrification and denitrification and consequently has large impacts on soil n2o emissions as it influences many physical chemical and biological properties and processes in the soil sun et al 2012 soil ph varied from 5 86 to 6 76 during the whole tomato season in present study and probably was not optimal for soil n2o emissions since the report who confirmed that a ph of 6 0 8 0 was optimal for denitrification and that denitrification was inhibited under acidic conditions aulakh et al 1992 causing that soil ph was not correlated with n2o flux and had a faint impact on soil n2o emissions other influencing factors on soil n2o emissions need to be further studied in the future 4 3 impacts of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms on soil n2o emissions the abundance and composition based on qpcr and dna sip technique of ammonia oxidizing gene involved in aoa and aob amoa genes are crucial for soil nitrification wang et al 2015 in our study the abundance of aoa amoa gene was significantly higher than that of aob amoa gene which was in agreement with earlier studies that the abundance of aoa amoa gene was dominant in some weak acid soil compared with aob amoa gene wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016e our study found that the abundance of aoa amoa gene under fi treatment was significantly higher than those under di and si treatments p 0 05 whereas there was no significant difference in aob amoa gene this result demonstrated that higher irrigation input shown in fi treatment significantly increased the abundance of aoa amoa gene probably because the furrow irrigation pattern existed higher oxygen and was more appropriate for the aoa amoa gene as chu et al 2009 and zhang et al 2016e reported no significant difference of the abundance of both aoa and aob amoa genewas observed between di and si treatments suggesting that both drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation methods have a minor impact on ammonia oxidizing process and may be recommended to the agricultural practice in view of almost same irrigation amounts and n2o flux in the present study the soil n2o flux was not correlated with the abundance of aoa and aob amoa gene suggesting the ammonia oxidizing might not significantly affect the soil n2o emissions soil ph is an essential factor that affects the abundance of ammonia oxidizing in soil environments jiang et al 2015 prosser and embley 2002 we observed a negative relationship between aob abundance and soil ph p 0 05 not shown in data nicol et al 2008 also reported that aoa amoa gene copy numbers decreased with increasing ph while aob amoa gene abundance increased with increasing ph in a microcosm across a ph gradient from 4 9 to 7 5 these findings suggested that soil ph regulated the nitrification by determining the chemical form concentration and availability of ammonium providing the substrates for aoa and aob amoa gene kemmitt et al 2006 suzuki et al 1974 members of the nitrosospira nitrosomonas nitrosococcus nitrosolobus and nitrosovibrio belong to aob amoa gene of these genera nitrosospira genera was confirmed to produce n2o by nitrification and denitrification koops et al 2006 osaka et al 2006 studies had shown that nitrosospirawas the dominant group of aob gene in agricultural soil environments ke and lu 2012 wang et al 2014 zhong et al 2015 also argued that aob amoa gene had potential to affect the ammonia oxidation in the vegetable field of high nitrogen input compared to aoa amoa gene and most of the aob amoa gene belonged to the nitrosospira phylogenetic analysis of dna sip and 13co2 labeled aob amoa gene in this study showed that nitrosospira like was the dominant species in aob amoa gene and nitrosospira like was a species belonging to nitrosospira which was basically consistent with previous studies he et al 2016 unexpectedly our study did not detect the aoa amoa gene by using dna sip approach a plausible explanation for this phenomenon was that an increasing number of the aoa amoa genes belonged to the archaea of thaumarchaeota and aob had β mycelium and γ proteobacteria two groups as a result aoa and aob populations accounted for different ph niches nicol et al 2008 the acidification of the greenhouse soil was due to the application of excess nitrogen fertilizer and the aob populations required changes to accommodate the soil ph hence the contribution of aob amoa gene to nitrification in the n enriched soil was exceedingly indispensable than the aoa amoa gene erguder et al 2009 valentine 2007 given that previous studies had suggested aoa had a strong preference for a low n status condition verhamme et al 2011 guo et al 2014 aoa may not play a vital role in ammonia oxidation under our experiment with high organic and inorganic fertilizer input therefore this experiment did not exclude the fact that aoa amoa gene was underestimated during the ammoxidation process as the slow growing speed might be shown during the whole labeled process we also speculated that aoa amoa gene involved in nitrifier denitrification might occur and play a key role in soil n2o emissions by the nitrite reductase encoded by the anirk gene in the whole incubation process trimmer et al 2016 the contribution of aoa amoa gene in different irrigation methods in this study is still to be further corrected in future studies 5 conclusion the soil n2o flux in furrow irrigation was significantly higher than that of drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation and there was no significant difference between drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation soil moisture wfps and nitrate nitrogen were the most important factors affecting soil n2o emissions therefore drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation were more water saving and less n2o emissions than furrow irrigation which was the most effective irrigation method in agricultural production practice under different irrigation methods the ammonia oxidizing archaea responsible for nitrification was dominant in the gene abundance while ammonia oxidizing bacteria in association with nitrosospiragenera was active nitrifier in the microbial community acknowledgements this work was supported by the

11472,agricultural soils are strong sources of the potent greenhouse gas n2o but soil n2o emissions and its microbial mechanism in greenhouse field especially ammonia oxidizing microorganisms are unclear we characterized a potential response in soil n2o production and its influencing factors such as soil temperature moisture ph and inorganic nitrogen to different irrigation methods named drip irrigation di subsurface irrigation si and furrow irrigation fi in a long term irrigation field in greenhouse the abundance and metabolic activity of ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa and bacteria aob in greenhouse soils were also investigated using amoa gene as a molecular biomarker by quantitative pcr and 13co2 dna stable isotope probing sip methods results showed that n2o flux peaks would obviously occur within 1 8 days after each irrigation the soil n2o flux in fi treatment was significantly higher than that in di and si treatments p 0 05 correlation analysis between soil n2o flux and its influencing factors indicated that soil moisture and nitrate nitrogen were substantially affecting soil n2o emissions compared with soil temperature ph and ammonium nitrogen the copy numbers of aoa amoa gene in fi treatment were significantly higher than those in di and si treatments p 0 05 while there is no significant difference of aob amoa gene among the three treatments also the copy numbers of aoa amoa gene were significantly higher than those of aob amoa gene the 13co2 dna sip and phylogenetic tree results indicated only aob dominantly involved in nitrosospira genera was active during the nitrification process in the three irrigation methods our findings provided direct evidence that drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation could effectively reduce soil n2o emissions in greenhouse aoa was dominant in abundance while aob played a key role in microbial community under the conditions of this experiment future characterization of the mechanisms for ammonia oxidation requires deeper

al 2012 and the abundance of nitrifiers is also considered to play an important role in mediating soil n2o emissions cavigelli and robertson 2000 however little information is obtainable with respect to niche differentiation of aoa and aob in response to different irrigation method therefore there is a need to understand the community distribution diversity and abundance of ammonia oxidizing microorganism under different irrigation methods which can provide insights and comprehensions of ammonia oxidizing archaea and bacteria involved in nitrification of the n cycling in the agricultural

zhang et al 2016b wheat maize rotation shan et al 2016 grassland wolf et al 2015 and other field crops but the studies concentrated on n2o emissions in greenhouse have rarely been investigated in fact the production areas of greenhouse vegetables have reached to 4 0 million hectares in 2015 in china and the yields have nearly attained to 260 million tons yu and zhou 2016 given the special characteristics of excellent sealing performance frequent irrigation high multiple cropping index and large application rate of nitrogen fertilizer the soil n2o emissions and its influencing factors

was performed at a long term irrigation experimental station began in 2010 shen yang agricultural university which is located in shen yang liaoning province china 41 49 22 n 123 33 55 e the study area has a temperate sub humid continental climate the annual mean precipitation is approximately 721 9 mm the experimental soil was a brown soil and classified as mollic gleysols in the fao unescosystem the initial soil organic matter content is 12 58 g kg 1 total n content 1 47 g kg 1 and available n content 61 26 mg kg 1 at ph 5 8 the tomato was planted on april 19th and harvested on august 6th 2015 three irrigation methods as drip irrigation di subsurface irrigation si and furrow irrigation fi were performed in the present study plots 20 m2 were interspersed in completely randomized blocks with three repetitions the irrigation control upper and lower limits of three irrigation treatments were soil water suction 6 kpa and 30 kpa the lower limits of all treatments were detected by tensiometers placed in 30 cm soil layer at 8 00 a m every day the irrigation would begin during the time that the treated soil water suction value reached or exceeded the setting irrigation control lower limit 30 kpa of soil water suction value and when the irrigation and gas collection conflicted the principle of gas collection was firstly taken the soil water holding characteristic curve previously measured by the soil samples collected in the greenhouse was measured and the soil water content corresponding to the upper and lower limits of soil water suction was calculated according to the formula 1 1 θ 0 5212 1 6 382 h 11 5005 0 0094 where θ is soil volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 h is soil water suction kpa according to formula 2 to calculate the single amount of irrigation 2

suction irrigation control corresponding soil moisture content cm3 cm 3 respectively according to the specific conditions of this experiment h is 30 cm s is 20 m2 due to the different wetting way in three irrigation methods the wetting layer in fi treatment was received fully moistened while the di and si treatments were partly moistened and drainage holes in si treatment were stronger around the root system of the underground crop hence the wetting ratios r of fi di and si were set at 1 00 0 50 and 0 33 respectively the single irrigation amount of three irrigation methods based on above was calculated and shown in table 1 in order to prevent the water from penetrating each other during the experiment process all plots were separated by plastic film with a depth of 60 cm the drip irrigation zone was placed on the surface and the drainage holes were placed near the tomato plant about 10 cm to the plant the subsurface irrigation pipes were covered the depth of 30 cm and the plastic film also employed to prevent the water from penetrating sawdust as a filter layer of 1 cm thick on subsurface irrigation pipes was used to prevent the wetting soil from plugging the drainage holes the type and amount of fertilizer applications among three treatments were consistent rotten cow dung n 1 84 and c n 13 and puffed chicken manure n 3 13 and c n 6 were applied before planting and the application rates were 22 5 t ha 1 and 37 5 t ha 1 respectively at the time of colonization urea n 46 phosham n 17 and p2o5 45 and potassium sulfate k2o 51 were applied when tomato planted and the application rates were 0 15 t ha 1 0 6 t ha 1 0 6 t ha 1 respectively on the 9th and july 7th the urea was applied twice with the corresponding irrigation method and the application amount was 0

mixing air to ensure uniform gas the upper part of the chamber body was installed for the determination of the temperature thermometer when the tomato plants grew to more than 60 cm an additional box was added to ensure the smooth progress of sampling the base 50 50 25 cm3 was inserted into soil when the tomato was planted when sampling the box body was placed on the base with water sealing we extracted 40 ml gas with an injection syringe at intervals 0 5 10 15 20 min after hooding the box respectively and then brought back to the laboratory soil n2o emissions were sampled twice a week after irrigation treatment gas samples were collected from 8 00 to 10 00 a m on wednesday and sunday the depth of 5 cm soil temperature was measured with a curved tube thermometer while collecting gas samples the samples in the air bag were analyzed by a gas chromatograph and the concentration of n2o was analyzed by an electron capture detector ecd the gas flux was calculated based on the rate of

were performed in origin 9 0 origin lab corporation usa significance was accepted at a level of probability of p 0 05 3 results 3 1 soil n2o emissions it could be seen from fig 1 that the soil n2o emission flux of each treatment in the whole tomato growing season fluctuated fiercely and the change trend was not consistent the obvious emission peaks were observed in 1 8 days after each irrigation and two days after top dressing the reason for this phenomenon might be due to the study of irrigation water by measuring the value of soil water suction and then the irrigation time of the three irrigation methods were different resulting in soil n2o emission flux trends were inconsistent the maximum soil n2o emissions occurred in the earlier stage of tomato growth di and si treatment on may 27 fi treatment for may 24 mainly because a large number of organic and inorganic fertilizers as base fertilizers were applied before planting it provided a sufficient substrate for the microorganisms which was conducive to nitrification and denitrification process and promoted the soil n2o emissions the soil n2o emission flux changed drastically in the earlier stage of tomato growth and maintained at a low level at the end of the tomato growth period the soil n2o emission flux of fi treatment in the whole tomato growing season was significantly higher than that of si treatment and di treatment the average and cumulative n2o emission fluxes under di and si treatments were significantly lower than those under fi treatment p 0 05 using the drip and subsurface irrigation methods apparently reduced the total n2o production by approximately 50 and saved the water by about 50 table 3 3 2 soil temperature and moisture soil temperature and moisture are important factors affecting soil n2o emission the soil temperature of the different irrigation methods varied little during the whole tomato growing season and the overall trend of soil temperature was basically accordant fig 2 the soil temperature in the whole tomato growing season varied from 21 to 28 c with an average temperature of 24 5 c affected by climate the soil temperature reached a high level since july 12th but this did not generate higher n2o emissions as irrigation determined by the soil water suction value irrigation time and amount were different therefore there was no consistent trend of soil moisture wfps during the whole tomato growing season the soil moisture wfps varied from 22 69 to 57 45 in the whole tomato growing season with an average of 43 00 3 3 soil inorganic nitrogen soil n2o emissions are mainly caused by nitrification and denitrification the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations in soil directly affect nitrification and denitrification the no3 n concentration in soil was significantly higher than that in nh4 n concentrations fig 3 the nh4 n concentration changed in a certain range of 8 23 mg kg 1 with an average of 13 09 mg kg 1 and the no3 n concentration varied from 61 to 182 mg kg 1 with an average concentration of 98 32 mg kg 1 the nh4 n concentration in soils decreased firstly and then increased during the whole tomato season and the nh4 n concentration reached the maximum at harvesting the no3 n concentration followed no consistent trends for all treatments and the highest value was detected at the beginning of tomato growth 3 4 soil ph the soil ph under different irrigation methods during the whole tomato growing season is presented in fig 4 showing a weak acid to neutral ph ranged from 5 86 to 6 76 similar to the mineral n there was no consistent change in soil ph from all the treatments the soil ph in all treatments before june 21st was significantly higher than that the date after june 21st and intensively decreased trend was observed from june 21st to july 5th 3 5 the abundance of nitrifying gene the copy numbers of amoa gene involved in aoa and aob in total soil dna under different irrigation methods are shown in fig 5 the copy numbers of aoa amoa gene varied from 2 05 108 to 1 46 1010 copies g 1 dry soil the copy numbers of aoa amoa gene in di and si treatments were significantly lower than those in fi treatment the copy numbers of aob amoa gene with the range of 9 23 107 1 92 108 copies g 1 dry soil showed no significant difference among three treatments the copy numbers of aoa amoa gene were higher than those of aob amoa gene by 1 2 orders of magnitude 3 6 the active ammonia oxidizing microorganisms in the soil labeled with 13c the abundances of amoa gene in dna after ultrahigh speed centrifugation by qpcr technique are summarized in fig 6 the copy numbers of amoa gene in 13co2 labeled dna increased with the increase of the buoyancy density gradient the samples of drip irrigation subsurface irrigation and furrow irrigation showed peak values on layers 5 6 and 8 respectively the results showed that the amoa gene of ammonia oxidizing bacteria was enriched in the heavy layer dna of 13c labeled samples after 5 weeks of cultivation which suggested that the ammonia oxidizing bacteria were strongly labeled however the ammonia oxidized archaea was not detected and observed in the 13c labeled heavy layer dna by pcr the cloned library of amoa gene of ammonia oxidizing bacteria was constructed on the 13c labeled heavy layer dna fig 7 phylogenetic development showed that all aob sequences belonged to the nitrosospira like the drip irrigation belonged to the unclassied nitrosospira like which was close to the furrow irrigation although the subsurface irrigation was the same as the nitrosospira like it did not belong to the same branch with furrow irrigation and drip irrigation 3 7 relationship between soil n2o flux and environmental factors ammonia oxidizing gene abundance the soil n2o flux exhibited positive relationships with soil wfps and no3 n concentrations p 0 01 but not with soil ph and nh4 n concentrations table 4 no relationship was observed between soil n2o flux and the abundance of the ammonia oxidizing genes 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of different irrigation methods on soil n2o emission china is a country lacking fresh water resources in addition because of insufficient land heat in the northeast greenhouse is more prevalent it is of practical significance to screen out the optimal irrigation methods in this study soil n2o emissions from the tomato growing season were systematically observed the soil n2o emission flux in furrow irrigation during the whole tomato growing season were significantly higher than that in drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation and there was significant difference p 0 05 this was consistent with the conclusions drawn by sánchez martín et al 2008 and zhang et al 2016c this indicated that different irrigation methods significantly affected soil n2o emissions this was mainly because the irrigation amount in fi treatment was higher than drip and subsurface irrigation which increased the anaerobic environment and caused denitrification or nitrifier denitrification and then n2o was produced and released into the atmosphere silva et al 2008 previous studies had shown that soil wet and dry cycles in the soil made nitrification and denitrification alternated which promoted the production of n2o borken and matzner 2009 harrison kirk et al 2013 priemé and christensen 2001 the current experiment was conducted by measuring the soil water suction for frequent irrigation and multiple dry and wet alternations were occurred in soil as the alternation of dry and wet increased amounts of dead microorganisms in the soil the mineralization of available carbon and available nitrogen increased n2o was produced more rapidly than its reduction when rainfall or irrigation made the soil fully moistened with denitrification resulting in accumulation schimel et al 2011 xiang et al 2008 at the same time soil wet and dry process directly affected the soil microbial activity by affecting the oxygen content in the soil thus affecting the soil nitrification and denitrification mikha et al 2005 and the soil microbial biomass increased rapidly after the drought denef et al 2001 in this study soil was wetted from the surface by the irrigation process and the irrigation amount in fi treatment was higher than that two other treatments under such a condition for wetting soil in 0 30 cm after irrigation microbial activity and abundance in furrow irrigation were higher than the drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation treatments easily being prone to denitrification the peak values in soil n2o flux of the three treatments during the tomato growing season were entirely exhibited in the period after irrigation or fertilization which was consistent with previous studies schellenberg et al 2012 zhang et al 2016d the result of the cumulative n2o flux in this study was far lower than those of some scholars kennedy et al 2013 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 which may be due to the same fertilizers under different irrigation practices in this experiment and the application of fertilizers amount and frequency was lower another reason for this finding might be that the lower water content was received before the n2o measurement associated with the higher temperature and faster evaporation rates in the greenhouse 4 2 impacts of environmental factors on soil n2o emissions soil temperature and moisture are documented as key drivers to influence the soil n2o emissions liu et al 2016 nosalewicz et al 2013 soil temperature affects the formations and emissions of soil n2o by affecting the activity of soil microbes agehara and warncke 2005 the appropriate temperature for nitrifying microbial activity was 15 35 c whereas denitrifying microbial activity for adapting to the temperature was 5 75 c for denitrifying microbial activity zheng et al 1997 in this study the soil temperature varied from 21 c to 28 c with an average temperature of 24 5 c which was beneficial to the activities of nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms the n2o flux in the whole tomato growing season was not significantly correlated with soil temperature which may be due to the soil temperature of 5 cm depth in this experiment was the optimum temperature for microbial activity at this time soil temperature of 5 cm depth was not the influencing factor to control soil n2o emissions in addition soil n2o flux and soil moisture wfps showed a very significant positive correlation p 0 01 which was in agreement with many scholars chen et al 2015 hou et al 2016 laville et al 2011 in the greenhouse environment soil moisture was the main factor affecting the soil n2o emissions the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n in the soil are expected to the most direct substrate of nitrification and denitrification determining the production of soil n2o transformed by nh4 n and no3 n gu et al 2013 liu et al 2010 also suggested that soil nh4 n and no3 n levels are one of the major environmental drivers for soil n2o emissions in this study the concentration of no3 n was significantly higher than that of nh4 n and the concentration of no3 n was positively correlated with the soil n2o flux these findings presumably suggested that nitrification or nitrifier denitrification was strongly occurred in irrigated soil during the whole tomato growing season the relative contributions of nitrification nitrifier denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification to soil n2o production needed further researches using the dual isotope labelling technique kool et al 2011 soil ph affects nitrification and denitrification and consequently has large impacts on soil n2o emissions as it influences many physical chemical and biological properties and processes in the soil sun et al 2012 soil ph varied from 5 86 to 6 76 during the whole tomato season in present study and probably was not optimal for soil n2o emissions since the report who confirmed that a ph of 6 0 8 0 was optimal for denitrification and that denitrification was inhibited under acidic conditions aulakh et al 1992 causing that soil ph was not correlated with n2o flux and had a faint impact on soil n2o emissions other influencing factors on soil n2o emissions need to be further studied in the future 4 3 impacts of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms on soil n2o emissions the abundance and composition based on qpcr and dna sip technique of ammonia oxidizing gene involved in aoa and aob amoa genes are crucial for soil nitrification wang et al 2015 in our study the abundance of aoa amoa gene was significantly higher than that of aob amoa gene which was in agreement with earlier studies that the abundance of aoa amoa gene was dominant in some weak acid soil compared with aob amoa gene wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016e our study found that the abundance of aoa amoa gene under fi treatment was significantly higher than those under di and si treatments p 0 05 whereas there was no significant difference in aob amoa gene this result demonstrated that higher irrigation input shown in fi treatment significantly increased the abundance of aoa amoa gene probably because the furrow irrigation pattern existed higher oxygen and was more appropriate for the aoa amoa gene as chu et al 2009 and zhang et al 2016e reported no significant difference of the abundance of both aoa and aob amoa genewas observed between di and si treatments suggesting that both drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation methods have a minor impact on ammonia oxidizing process and may be recommended to the agricultural practice in view of almost same irrigation amounts and n2o flux in the present study the soil n2o flux was not correlated with the abundance of aoa and aob amoa gene suggesting the ammonia oxidizing might not significantly affect the soil n2o emissions soil ph is an essential factor that affects the abundance of ammonia oxidizing in soil environments jiang et al 2015 prosser and embley 2002 we observed a negative relationship between aob abundance and soil ph p 0 05 not shown in data nicol et al 2008 also reported that aoa amoa gene copy numbers decreased with increasing ph while aob amoa gene abundance increased with increasing ph in a microcosm across a ph gradient from 4 9 to 7 5 these findings suggested that soil ph regulated the nitrification by determining the chemical form concentration and availability of ammonium providing the substrates for aoa and aob amoa gene kemmitt et al 2006 suzuki et al 1974 members of the nitrosospira nitrosomonas nitrosococcus nitrosolobus and nitrosovibrio belong to aob amoa gene of these genera nitrosospira genera was confirmed to produce n2o by nitrification and denitrification koops et al 2006 osaka et al 2006 studies had shown that nitrosospirawas the dominant group of aob gene in agricultural soil environments ke and lu 2012 wang et al 2014 zhong et al 2015 also argued that aob amoa gene had potential to affect the ammonia oxidation in the vegetable field of high nitrogen input compared to aoa amoa gene and most of the aob amoa gene belonged to the nitrosospira phylogenetic analysis of dna sip and 13co2 labeled aob amoa gene in this study showed that nitrosospira like was the dominant species in aob amoa gene and nitrosospira like was a species belonging to nitrosospira which was basically consistent with previous studies he et al 2016 unexpectedly our study did not detect the aoa amoa gene by using dna sip approach a plausible explanation for this phenomenon was that an increasing number of the aoa amoa genes belonged to the archaea of thaumarchaeota and aob had β mycelium and γ proteobacteria two groups as a result aoa and aob populations accounted for different ph niches nicol et al 2008 the acidification of the greenhouse soil was due to the application of excess nitrogen fertilizer and the aob populations required changes to accommodate the soil ph hence the contribution of aob amoa gene to nitrification in the n enriched soil was exceedingly indispensable than the aoa amoa gene erguder et al 2009 valentine 2007 given that previous studies had suggested aoa had a strong preference for a low n status condition verhamme et al 2011 guo et al 2014 aoa may not play a vital role in ammonia oxidation under our experiment with high organic and inorganic fertilizer input therefore this experiment did not exclude the fact that aoa amoa gene was underestimated during the ammoxidation process as the slow growing speed might be shown during the whole labeled process we also speculated that aoa amoa gene involved in nitrifier denitrification might occur and play a key role in soil n2o emissions by the nitrite reductase encoded by the anirk gene in the whole incubation process trimmer et al 2016 the contribution of aoa amoa gene in different irrigation methods in this study is still to be further corrected in future studies 5 conclusion the soil n2o flux in furrow irrigation was significantly higher than that of drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation and there was no significant difference between drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation soil moisture wfps and nitrate nitrogen were the most important factors affecting soil n2o emissions therefore drip irrigation and subsurface irrigation were more water saving and less n2o emissions than furrow irrigation which was the most effective irrigation method in agricultural production practice under different irrigation methods the ammonia oxidizing archaea responsible for nitrification was dominant in the gene abundance while ammonia oxidizing bacteria in association with nitrosospiragenera was active nitrifier in the microbial community acknowledgements this work was supported by the

11473,the management of water resources in a river basin experiencing the expansion of agricultural activities requires a proper understanding of impacts on its hydrologic cycle this study focused on the analysis of impacts of infield rainwater harvesting irwh and future agricultural expansion as land and water uses change lwuc on the hydrologic cycle in the wami river basin tanzania using the soil and water assessment tool swat in the swat model irwh was implemented by fragmenting rainwater harvesting hydrological response units hrus from cropland hrus and assigning them as potholes for rainwater impoundment lwuc was implemented by customizing land cover types and their corresponding model parameters in all original hrus and introducing projected water uses in the model the study thus demonstrated the successful modelling of irwh and land use change in the swat model using hru fragmentation and customization approaches respectively the results indicated that irwh applications in croplands led to a large increase in evapotranspiration et and the soil water content and a decrease in percolation especially in the dry years however the average annual streamflow showed negligible changes when irwh was implemented even in 50 of current low coverage croplands in the river basin thus irwh applications in the river basin are recommended the results also indicated that lwuc caused huge changes in et the soil water content percolation and the streamflow from the river basin the average annual streamflow was predicted to decrease by 26 due to lwuc however land use change alone without projected water uses was predicted to cause a minor decrease of about 1 in the average annual streamflow therefore further studies on the eco hydrology of the river basin under various water use scenarios are recommended prior to the expansion of agricultural areas keywords hru customization hru fragmentation pothole swat water use change 1 introduction the interactions between hydrologic cycles and agricultural activities i e cultivation and livestock keeping in river basins have received increased attention in recent years bharati et al 2008 speelman et al 2008 tijani et al 2014 in order to improve food security in sub saharan africa countries have engaged in the expansion of agricultural areas and the intensification of technologies which increase crop yields graef et al 2014 mlhhsd 2009 in tanzania and especially in the wami river basin some strategies and plans include the intensification of rainwater harvesting for small scale farms and the expansion of agricultural areas for cultivation and grazing mlhhsd 2009 recently rainwater harvesting has drawn attention in many regions in sub saharan africa as a sustainable and economical water source kahinda et al 2010 ndomba and wambura 2010 welderufael et al 2013 especially for small scale farming infield or in situ rainwater harvesting irwh consists of small pits or furrows that are dug within farms for collecting rainwater in order to increase the soil moisture and consequently the crop yield welderufael et al 2013 the irwh technique has shown a significant increase in the maize yield of up to 80 compared to conventional tillage practice in the makanya catchment tanzania makurira et al 2007 in the wami river basin irwh is also expected to be extended to small scale farmers in order to increase their crop yields currently irwh has been selected as one of the food value chain upgrading strategies studied by the trans sec innovating strategies to safeguard food security using technology and knowledge transfer a people centred approach research project for increasing food security in the wami river basin graef et al 2014 however intensifying irwh practices at a basin level may increase or decrease water availability in other places andersson et al 2011 makurira et al 2009 ngigi et al 2008 ngigi 2003 therefore understanding the impacts of different levels of irwh application before its intensification is crucial for the sustainability of the ecosystem in a river basin tanzania has a potential arable area of about 44 million hectares urt 2007 in the wami river basin the potential area already identified for cultivation grazing and settlement is about 71 of the river basin area mlhhsd 2009 however any land use change luc may also have impacts on the hydrologic cycle and consequently affect the ecosystem downstream of the river basin baker and miller 2013 schilling et al 2008 wagner et al 2013 in most cases lucs are accompanied by an increase in water abstractions i e water use change wuc this is because lucs resulting from the expansion of agricultural and industrial areas also increase the water demand cofie and amede 2015 maeda et al 2011 in the past the impacts of land and water uses change lwuc on water resources were largely neglected or considered byproducts of advancement scanlon et al 2005 schilling et al 2008 recent evaluations of historical effects in the wami river basin have shown that the expansion of arable land for agricultural practices that contributed to a shift in land and water uses in the past continue to shape the direction of land and water uses in the future fbd 2006 madulu 2005 wambura et al 2017 therefore prediction of consequences of future land and water uses on water resources is vital the modelling of irwh and lwuc is useful in the ex ante assessment of their impacts on the hydrologic cycle of a given river basin glendenning and vervoort 2011 ouessar et al 2009 welderufael et al 2013 due to various applications of the soil and water assessment tool swat in river basins in sub saharan africa including the wami river basin in tanzania mulungu and munishi 2007 ndomba et al 2008 nobert and jeremiah 2012 wambura 2014 wambura et al 2015 we selected it as the modelling environment for the irwh and lwuc scenario simulations the objective of this research was to analyse the impacts of irwh and lwuc on the hydrologic cycle in the wami river basin the research aimed at using more convincing process based approaches in implementing irwh and luc in the swat model the analysis focused on changes in evapotranspiration et and the soil water content due to irwh in individual croplands in different parts of the river basin as well as the general impacts of both irwh and lwuc on the streamflow from the river basin 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the wami river basin with an area of approximately 41 170 km2 is located between 5 00 7 27 s and 36 00 39 00 e in east central tanzania fig 1 elevation within this river basin ranges from 0 to 2360 masl the river basin is separated into two major parts by the eastern arc mountains eams which comprise the rubeho ukaguru nguru and nguu mountain ranges the predominant soils in the river basin are loam 38 and sand clay loam 41 fao isric 2003 the land use classes are predominantly bushland 23 woodland 44 and grassland 20 fao 1997 the ranch savannah grassland cropland under small scale farming and irrigation areas cover about 1 7 and 2 of the river basin respectively natural forests which are predominantly located along the eams cover about 3 of the river basin area fao 1997 in the wami river basin the average rainfall ranges between 692 and 1388 mm per year from tanzania meteorological agency 2000 2010 the river basin has two major rainfall zones a unimodal rainfall zone with one heavy rainfall season from october to april ondjfma in the upstream part and a bimodal rainfall zone in the downstream part the bimodal rainfall zone has two rainfall seasons a light rainfall season between october and december ond and a heavy rainfall season between march and may mam a transition between bimodal and unimodal rainfalls occurs in the midstream part of the river basin the average daily temperature in the river basin ranges between 24 and 31 c from tanzania meteorological agency 2000 2010 the average actual et in the river basin ranges between 368 and 1614 mm year from modis et 2000 2010 mu et al 2011 with higher et downstream than upstream the hydrologic cycle in the wami river basin is affected by the domestic water demand irrigation recently introduced rainwater harvesting agriculture ranches and an increasing demand for charcoal fuel wood and timber doggart and burgess 2005 iucn 2010 madulu 2005 most of the abstracted water is used for irrigation of sugarcane and rice plantations wambura 2014 wambura et al 2015 in the year 2010 irrigation activities in the river basin accounted for an average of 96 of the total abstracted water wambura 2014 wambura et al 2015 moreover the small scale farming activities in the wami river basin follow the rainfall seasons of ond and mam as well as the dry period between june and september or october mourice et al 2015 2 2 data for scenario development the slopes were computed from a 90 m shuttle radar topography mission elevation model jarvis et al 2008 the baseline land use at a scale of 1 250 000 was obtained from the fao database fao 1997 the proposed land use map used the future land use plan from the national land use framework plan 2009 2029 nlufp 2009 2029 mlhhsd 2009 to project water uses in sub basins in the year 2029 we used water use data domestic livestock irrigation and industrial water uses and projection parameters from the study by wambura et al 2015 2 3 basic model for scenario simulation the hydrological model used was the previously calibrated and validated swat model of the wami river basin from the study by wambura et al 2018 it was set up using topography 90 m digital elevation model jarvis et al 2008 soil scale of 1 2 000 000 fao isric 2003 and land use scale of 1 250 000 fao 1997 data as a result 45 sub basins and 2034 hydrological response units hrus were obtained from the model setup wambura et al 2018 the average size of the hrus was about 20 km2 and there were 371 original cropland hrus in the model land use of cropland was scheduled for plant growth from mid october to mid june of the following year and the harvest period was in the remaining months wambura et al 2018 the climate data used in the model were temperature and precipitation data tanzania meteorological agency weedon et al 2014 and baseline water use data wambura et al 2015 were used to abstract water from simulated flows the maximum canopy storage and critical depth of shallow groundwater parameters in the model were parameterized by the spatial pattern of long term average et and shallow groundwater levels inferred in the study by wambura et al 2017 respectively the model was calibrated using the first two thirds of the time series of monthly streamflow 2000 2007 at the 1g2 mandera gauging station wami ruvu basin water office fig 1 and the spatial pattern of long term average monthly et from modis et mu et al 2011 in the calibration the nash sutcliffe efficiency and the index of volumetric fit of the hydrograph achieved were 0 67 and 0 93 respectively wambura et al 2018 the correlation coefficient of the spatial calibration of average et achieved was 0 71 the model was also validated using the last third of the time series of monthly streamflow 2007 2010 at the 1g2 mandera gauging station the nash sutcliffe efficiency and the index of volumetric fit of the validation hydrograph achieved were 0 74 and 0 81 respectively wambura et al 2018 more details on the setup parameterization calibration and validation of this model are explained by wambura et al 2018 five types of scenarios namely irwh luc lwuc luc irwh and lwuc irwh table 1 were simulated in the swat model and changes in hydrological variables specifically et the soil water content percolation and the streamflow were analysed the soil water content refers to the amount of water in the soil profile at the end of the month and is directly related to the soil moisture neitsch et al 2011 the streamflow at the river basin outlet gives the overall dynamics of the hydrologic cycle because it includes water yield effects of water abstractions and pothole overflows from all parts of the river basin 2 4 application of irwh several approaches for modelling irwh using the swat model have been involving alterations of model parameters andersson et al 2011 andersson et al 2013 dourte et al 2014 masih et al 2011 welderufael et al 2013 andersson et al 2011 and welderufael et al 2013 modelled irwh by modifying the usda scs curve number parameters masih et al 2011 modelled irwh by modifying the available soil water capacity parameter dourte et al 2014 modelled irwh by modifying the green ampt infiltration routine to represent water harvesting tillage using the maximum depression storage parameter however it is not clearly known how those parameters represent the irwh processes occurring in actual irwh pits or furrows a more convincing approach of modelling irwh involved summation of multiple irwh systems to form a set which was represented by a pond in a sub basin of the swat model ghimire and johnston 2013 in that approach ghimire and johnston 2013 used the pond routine available in the swat model to simulate processes similar to actual irwh systems however in the current version of swat the pond routine cannot be applied to hrus neitsch et al 2011 in addition the separation of areas for crops and rainwater impoundment is a restriction because a single sub basin may contain various land use types in this study irwh was implemented using sets of multiple irwh pits and the pothole routine available in the swat model the main advantage of the pothole approach over other approaches for irwh is that it can be applied at hru level and involves all hydrological processes similar to actual irwh pits neitsch et al 2011 a pothole also has the advantage of specifying the depth of infiltration pits or furrows neitsch et al 2011 moreover when the volume of water in a pothole exceeds its maximum storage the excess water enters the main channel in the sub basin and eventually contributes to the streamflow du et al 2005 neitsch et al 2011 eq 1 represents the water balance of a pothole neitsch et al 2011 1 v v s t o r e d v f l o w i n v f l o w o u t v p c p v e v a p v s e e p where v is the volume of water in the pothole at the end of the day vstored is the volume of water stored in the pothole at the beginning of the day vflowin is the volume of water from a drainage area a soil profile and a shallow aquifer entering the pothole during the day and vflowout is the volume of water flowing out of the pothole during the day vpcp is the volume of precipitation falling into the pothole during the day vevap is the volume of water removed from the pothole by evaporation during the day and vseep is the volume of water lost from the pothole by seepage in actual cropland irwh is a sequence of n pits furrows each with an area api and separated at a distance x where i ranges from 1 to n fig 2 a in the swat model the actual cropland area was represented by a cropland hru with an area ahru fig 2b due to the limitation of a minimum area of a cropland hru in this model and since there can be only one pothole in each hru of the swat model neitsch et al 2011 a series of n pits furrows was aggregated to form a pothole with an area ap fig 2a and b in the swat model a pothole is modelled as a depression area in an hru hence the land cover of the hru for plant growth is also assigned to the pothole fig 2b however since the focus of this study was to model a pothole as a sole rainwater harvesting part of a farm we decided to fragment cropland hrus into crop and irwh areas fig 2c in the model the hru fragmentation was done on cropland hrus by splitting their input files chm gw hru sdr sep sol and mgt files into crop hrus and pothole hrus this led to a doubling of the number of cropland related hrus new crop hrus were similar to original cropland hrus but their coverage areas were reduced depending on the level of irwh application i e 20 35 and 50 of cropland pothole hrus were specified as water bodies and named after the last hrus in the sub basins of their corresponding crop hrus the names of these pothole hrus were then added to the general sub basin input files sub file other parameters used in the pothole hrus are shown in table 2 after the model simulations the outputs of the crop hrus and pothole hrus were re aggregated to form variables for the original cropland hrus a schematic representation of a crop hru and a pothole hru aggregated together as an original cropland hru is illustrated in fig 3 et from a crop area comprises evaporation from the soil plant canopy storage and transpiration whereas from a pothole area comprises evaporation from impounded water and soil infiltrated water increases the soil water content and percolates to the shallow and deep aquifers fig 3 demand for et causes water uptake from the shallow aquifer into the overlying unsaturated soil layers fig 3 the modification of inputs the simulation and the extraction of hydrological variables in the model were carried out using the swat routine and algorithms source code is freely available upon request integrated into the python programming environment johansson 2014 neitsch et al 2011 oliphant 2006 2007 three case study areas were selected for illustration of impacts of irwh applications in croplands fig 1 p1 is one of the cropland hrus with cultivation activities in the upstream area of the river basin cf figs 1 4a and c p2 was selected because one of the case study sites investigated by the trans sec project graef et al 2014 is within this cropland hru in the midstream area and p3 is one of the cropland hrus with extensive cultivation activities further downstream cf figs 1 4a and c these areas still have the same land cover type even with the proposed land use in the year 2029 cf figs 1 and 4c the soil texture of croplands p1 and p3 is sand clay loam and that of cropland p2 is loam the saturated water contents porosities of croplands p1 p2 and p3 are 0 47 0 53 and 0 51 respectively fao 1997 the average saturated hydraulic conductivities are 338 551 and 430 mm hr respectively fao 1997 2 5 application of luc and lwuc prior to the luc application the baseline land use in the year 1997 fig 4a was modified using the future land use plan for the 2009 2029 period fig 4b to obtain the proposed land use for the wami river basin in the year 2029 fig 4c in this process the land uses in urban reserved areas and on steep slopes were not modified steep slopes 11 were not modified because they are not suitable for agricultural activities jasbir and dhillon 2006 the proposed land use in the year 2029 showed that cropland and ranch areas will increase extensively while losing woodland bushland and grassland fig 5 the cropland and ranch areas are expected to increase from 7 to 36 and from 1 to 11 of the basin area respectively figs 5 and 6 common approaches of modelling luc in the swat model include land use remodelling lur and land use updating lup the lur approach involves the use of a new land use map to set up a completely new model and constrain it using baseline parameters nobert and jeremiah 2012 the main disadvantage of the lur approach is that it can lead to different number shapes and locations of hrus thus affecting other applications which depend on specific hrus the lup approach models a continuous land cover change in which only proportions of land use types in hrus change neitsch et al 2011 the limitation of the lup approach is that land use types and their corresponding parameters in hrus cannot be replaced by the new ones in this study we used the hru customization approach for modification of land use types and their corresponding parameters in a previously calibrated and validated swat model the main advantage of the hru customization approach is that completely new land use types and parameters can be introduced in original hrus without altering their number shapes and locations this leads to similar hrus in both the baseline and luc scenario simulations the hru customization involved masking the proposed land use with polygons of original hrus and assigning the largest coverage of masked land use types in the hrus as their new land uses then new land uses in the hrus were used to customize the land use types in the hru input files in the hru management files mgt files the plant codes for plant database were also modified to match the new land use types after the hru customization there were 803 cropland hrus out of 2034 hrus in addition the impacts of the lwuc scenario involved the introduction of the effects of wuc on luc total water uses were projected to increase from 17 5 m3 s in the year 2010 to 37 0 m3 s in the year 2029 most of the projected water uses were irrigation water demands 97 of total water uses in the year 2029 total water use demands were then distributed into the river reaches for abstracting simulated flows using the water use routine available in the swat model neitsch et al 2011 for both the luc and lwuc scenarios the modification simulation and extraction of hydrological variables were carried out using the swat routine and algorithms source code is freely available upon request integrated in the python programming environment johansson 2014 neitsch et al 2011 oliphant 2006 2007 2 6 application of luc irwh and lwuc irwh the luc irwh and lwuc irwh scenarios involved the application of irwh on top of already expanded croplands having undergone luc or lwuc in this case irwh was applied in all 803 new cropland hrus the procedures of applying irwh and luc or lwuc are similar to the explanations in sections 2 4 and 2 5 respectively for these scenarios only the average streamflow from the river basin was analysed 3 results 3 1 impacts of irwh the impacts of irwh applications on hydrological variables in croplands are illustrated for cropland p1 fig 7 in cropland p1 the pattern of rainfall peaks varies from year to year fig 7a in hydrological years from october to september of the following year we found that the dry years when annual rainfall ar is less than the average annual rainfall aar in the time series were 2001 2002 2002 2003 2004 2005 2005 2006 and 2008 2009 the wet years when ar is greater than aar were 2000 2001 and 2006 2007 the remaining years were normal years when ar is approximately equal to aar the applications of irwh in cropland p1 led to an increase in et in the dry years of 2004 2005 and 2008 2009 but the wet years of 2000 2001 and 2006 2007 did not show any clear change in et fig 7b the normal years of 2003 2004 and 2007 2008 showed a slight decrease in et in the first half and a slight increase in the second half of the year similar to et the soil water content also increased in the dry years of 2001 2002 2005 2006 and 2008 2009 fig 7c the normal years of 2003 2004 and 2007 2008 also showed an increase in the soil water content but the wet years did not show any clear changes in the dry and normal years percolation was slightly reduced by the application of irwh fig 7d croplands p2 and p3 had similar results for et the soil water content and percolation although in different years for a better illustration of impacts of irwh application in croplands one typical dry normal and wet years were selected based on ar and aar amounts in each selected cropland i e p1 p2 and p3 fig 8 a c show unimodal rainfalls in the dry normal and wet years respectively in cropland p1 substantial rainfall in the dry normal and wet years occurred in the november april december april and november march periods respectively fig 8d l show that the higher the level of irwh application in cropland p1 the bigger the changes in et the soil water content and percolation throughout the dry year irwh application led to an increase in et fig 8d in the normal year et decreased from october to february but increased from march to september fig 8e during the wet year et increased from october to february but there was no change in et from march to september fig 8f the soil water content increased throughout the dry and normal years due to irwh application but the latter had a higher increase than the former fig 8g and h like et the soil water content also had a similar pattern in the wet year cf fig 8f and i changes in percolation due to irwh applications were very small but a clear decrease was found in the october may january may and october december periods in the dry normal and wet years respectively fig 8j l the average et and soil water content in the 2000 2010 period for cropland p1 increased as the level of application of irwh increased table 3 meanwhile the average percolation shallow and deep groundwater recharges and discharges decreased however the average shallow groundwater uptake did not change at any level of irwh application table 3 the rainfall peaks in cropland p2 in the midstream area represent the transition between unimodal and bimodal rainfalls fig 9 a c the unimodal and bimodal distributions are reflected in the dry and normal years respectively in contrast rainfall distribution in the wet year is affected by extreme storms fig 9d l show that the changes in et the soil water content and percolation increased as higher levels of irwh were applied in cropland p2 in the dry year cropland p2 experienced a substantial increase in et in the october april period due to irwh application fig 9d in the normal year a substantial decrease in et was predicted in the october february period and a slight increase was predicted in the march june period fig 9e in the wet year a decrease and a slight increase in et were predicted in the october march and april june periods respectively fig 9f the pattern of changes in the soil water content due to irwh application in the dry year was very similar to that of et cf fig 9d and g in the normal and wet years the soil water content increased in the october may and november june periods respectively fig 9h and i due to irwh application in cropland p2 percolation increased in the february may and february july periods in the normal and wet years respectively fig 9k and l the decrease in percolation was predicted in the october march and december february periods in the dry and normal years respectively while the remaining months did not show any clear changes in percolation in general in cropland p2 the average et soil water content and lateral flow in the 2000 2010 period increased proportionally to the level of irwh application table 4 with the exception of the average shallow groundwater uptake the remaining hydrological variables decreased table 4 the rainfall peaks in cropland p3 in the downstream area represent bimodal rainfalls however the distribution is more evident in the dry and normal years as compared to the wet year fig 10 a c substantial rainfall in the dry year occurred in the october may period and in the normal and wet years it occurred in the october june period fig 10d l show that the higher the level of irwh was applied in cropland p3 the bigger the changes in et the soil water content and percolation a decrease in et due to irwh application in cropland p3 was predicted in the october february and october march periods in the dry and wet years respectively fig 10d and f in the dry normal and wet years an increase in et was predicted in the february september october april and march july periods respectively however in the normal and wet years there were no clear changes in et in the may september and august september periods respectively due to irwh application the soil water content increased throughout the dry year and in the october april and october june periods in the normal and wet years respectively fig 10g i the application of irwh also led to a decrease in percolation in the january september october march and january may periods in the dry normal and wet years respectively fig 10j l the average et soil water content and lateral flow in cropland p3 increased as the level of irwh application increased table 5 the average shallow groundwater uptake did not change but the remaining hydrological variables decreased inversely to the level of irwh application table 5 the average streamflow at the 1g2 mandera gauging station showed slight changes due to irwh applications in croplands the slight increase in the streamflow was predicted in december and negligible changes of flow were predicted in june and september whereas the remaining months showed the decrease in flow fig 11 the smallest decrease in average streamflow was found at 20 irwh application and the deviation from the baseline got relatively bigger as the higher levels of irwh were applied at 50 irwh application the largest decrease and increase in average streamflow were predicted in may and december respectively fig 11 however overall changes in the average annual streamflow between the years 2000 and 2010 were negligible at all levels of irwh application table 6 3 2 impacts of luc and lwuc the luc and lwuc scenarios have identical land use types they only differ in water abstractions from reaches therefore their sub basin results are the same fig 12 the baseline average et shows a clear dichotomy between the downstream and upstream areas with the former having relatively higher et than the latter fig 12a however the increase in et due to the luc or lwuc was predicted further downstream and upstream along the eams and in the south of the river basin cf figs 1 12a and b the baseline soil water content was relatively high in the south and southwest of the river basin but the luc or lwuc scenario led to an increase in the soil water content in the northwest and east of the river basin cf fig 12c and d moreover the largest part of the river basin did not show changes in the soil water content due to the luc or lwuc scenarios like et the baseline percolation was also relatively higher downstream than upstream cf fig 12a and e however the luc or lwuc scenario led to a decrease in percolation in the south west and further downstream of the river basin cf fig 12e and f the average streamflow at the 1g2 mandera gauging station was differently affected by both luc and lwuc scenarios fig 13 the luc scenario showed a small increase in the streamflow between february and the end of october but the lwuc scenario showed a decrease in the streamflow in the january july and september december periods in relation to the baseline condition changes of the average annual streamflow under the luc and lwuc scenarios were 1 and 26 respectively table 6 3 3 impacts of luc irwh and lwuc irwh since the impacts of various applications of irwh have been presented in section 3 1 here the focus is on the 50 irwh application i e ridge and furrow cultivation system on the luc and lwuc scenarios due to the luc 0 50irwh scenario the average streamflow increased from early january to november and decreased towards december the lwuc 0 50irwh scenario led to a slight increase in the streamflow from july to late september but a decrease was predicted in the january july and october december periods fig 14 the changes in the average annual streamflow under the luc 0 50irwh and lwuc 0 50irwh scenarios were 7 and 22 respectively table 6 4 discussion 4 1 irwh impacts on the hydrologic cycle simulated changes in the variables of the hydrologic cycle in the wami river basin indicate that the hru fragmentation approach is suitable for modelling irwh applications at a basin scale simulated impacts of irwh applications in croplands implied that rainwater stayed in pits while some of it underwent infiltration water in the pits became susceptible to direct evaporation and overflow to the streams whenever the pits were full infiltrated water modified soil water content and became susceptible to transpiration soil evaporation lateral flow and percolation to deeper layers makurira et al 2009 also reported that the application of irwh enhanced an increase in soil moisture at the makanya catchment in tanzania however in this study we also found that retention of water in the pits furrows reduced percolation to groundwater storage moreover water uptake due to et demand did not differ thus the same amount of water was taken from shallow groundwater back to the soil profile at all levels of irwh application see tables 3 5 this process depleted groundwater storage as the level of irwh application increased a similar decrease was also experienced in groundwater discharges thus the increase in et was the main reason for the depletion of groundwater storage and the decrease in groundwater recharges and discharges in cropland p1 substantial rainfall in the dry year started early i e in november and that led to an increase in et throughout the year because irwh saturated the soil layer causing an increase in the soil water content thus irwh application is an appropriate strategy for increasing soil moisture in the dry years in the normal year substantial rainfall started slightly late i e in december thus irwh led to a decrease in et because at the beginning of the season only a little amount of rainfall infiltrated into the soil profile this little rainfall was not sufficient for saturation of the soil layer until the start of heavy rainfall in the january february period in the wet year rainfall started and ended early november march hence irwh led to an increase in et and the soil water content but that change receded as the rainfall declined the causes of et and the soil water content changes in croplands p2 and p3 are similar to those for p1 croplands in the upstream and downstream areas had a slightly higher water uptake from the shallow aquifers than the midstream cropland tables 3 5 in fact the presence of a shallow water table was reported in the upstream and downstream areas glows fiu 2014 jica 2013 wambura et al 2017 the soil related differences in croplands were partly caused by saturated water content and hydraulic conductivity this is because a high saturated water content reduces water impoundment and high saturated hydraulic conductivity facilitates percolation thus they indirectly reduce et and soil water despite the close similarity of rainfall patterns the higher saturated water content and hydraulic conductivity in cropland p2 than in cropland p3 led to a smaller increase in et and the soil water content in the former than in the latter see tables 4 and 5 therefore the application of irwh is the best strategy for increasing soil moisture in areas with soil and groundwater properties similar to croplands p1 and p3 i e low porosity and shallow water table the applications of irwh on current croplands in the river basin led to a slight reduction in the streamflow from the river basin because irwh pits retained rainwater this small change in the streamflow is caused by a small area of the river basin currently conducting cultivation activities 7 of the river basin area thus current changes in the hydrological variables experienced in croplands are too small compared to non croplands which are not affected by irwh applications since current croplands are also in low rainfall areas slight overflows from irwh pits to the streams caused little increase in streamflow only in december in assessing the impacts of irwh welderufael et al 2013 also reported a non significant effect on the amount of flow downstream of a sub catchment in the modder river basin in south africa thus the flow regimes of a river basin with low coverage croplands often are not likely to change significantly even if irwh is widely applied on small scale farms andersson et al 2011 therefore applications of irwh in current croplands have no substantial impacts on the streamflow from the river basin 4 2 luc and lwuc impacts on the hydrologic cycle the spatial distribution of changes in et the soil water content and percolation indicates that the hru customization approach successfully enabled prediction of impacts of luc in the wami river basin at the sub basin level luc was predicted to cause extensive changes on the hydrologic cycle in the river basin due to the expansion of croplands and ranch areas extensive changes in et and the soil water content in the northwest and east of the river basin were caused by the expansion of croplands see figs 4a c 6 12b and d in areas further downstream the changes in et and the soil water content were caused by the expansion of ranch areas see fig 4a and c moreover the pattern of percolation changes was related to changes in et and the soil water content in areas where croplands were converted from bushlands and grasslands there were increases in et and the soil water content and a decrease in percolation these changes were caused by cropland having high leaf area indices compared to bushland and grassland neitsch et al 2011 propastin and kappas 2012 similarly in the areas where croplands changed from woodlands there were decreases in et and the soil water content and an increase in percolation because woodland has higher leaf area indices than cropland most ranch areas emerged from woodland therefore in those areas there was a decrease in et and an increase in percolation because the former land cover has lower leaf area indices than the latter in fact luc affected et which in turn modified the soil water content percolation and other variables of the hydrologic cycle the simulated impacts of the luc and lwuc scenarios are the same at the sub basin level but different for the streamflow from the river basin because the projected water uses in the latter were abstracted in the river reaches the average streamflow of the luc scenario has a smaller impact than that of the lwuc scenario because the latter included projected water abstractions however the lwuc scenario is more plausible than the luc scenario because future land use cannot be implemented without an increase in water use in the river basin geng et al 2015 between june and september the impact of lwuc was negligible because this is the dry low flow and harvesting period thus projected water uses were not abstracted in the remaining months the impacts of lwuc were intensified by projected water uses especially irrigation water demands moreover due to lwuc between the years 2009 and 2029 the change in the average annual streamflow is predicted to decrease by 26 nobert and jeremiah 2012 also inferred that land cover change between years 1987 and 2000 led to the decrease in the average river flows from the wami river basin thus land cover change influences the streamflow characteristics of a drainage basin to a large extent sajikumar and remya 2015 the streamflow change emphasizes how lwuc which is based on increasing cropland ranch areas and water uses modifies the hydrologic cycle of the river basin therefore the nlufp 2009 2029 mlhhsd 2009 has substantial impacts on the hydrologic cycle in the wami river basin 4 3 luc irwh and lwuc irwh impacts on the hydrologic cycle the predicted impacts of the luc irwh and lwuc irwh scenarios on the average streamflow from the river basin were due to the application of irwh on the luc and lwuc scenarios respectively in fact the spatial increase in croplands due to luc led to the expansion of areas conducting irwh in the western and eastern parts of the river basin see fig 6 as a result the presence of heavy rainfall in the eastern part of the river basin wambura 2014 and the shallow aquifers in both the western and eastern parts of the river basin glows fiu 2014 wambura et al 2017 led to an increase in overflows from irwh pits to the streams because the harvested rainwater exceeded the maximum storage of pits this caused an increase in the streamflow as the applications of irwh increased in the river basin in fact excess water which caused changes in the streamflow was compensated for by water uptake from the shallow aquifers in croplands therefore in both the luc irwh and the lwuc irwh scenarios the applications of irwh in croplands led to the depletion of shallow groundwater through water uptake and a decrease in percolation however the luc irwh scenario has a higher streamflow than the lwuc irwh scenario because the latter involved water abstractions i e wuc in addition the luc irwh scenario also has a slightly higher streamflow due to more peak flows from overflows than the irwh scenario because the area conducting irwh in the former is larger than in the latter see fig 6 in general irwh applications on expanded croplands i e proposed land and or water uses might intensively affect the streamflow from the river basin 4 4 modelling limitations in this study the modelling limitations were in the data model structures and applications the coarseness of data such as soil land use and elevation and the lack of flexible model structures for implementing various applications are great challenges in hydrological modelling chaplot 2014 hamel and guswa 2015 shrestha et al 2006 we have managed to model irwh using the hru fragmentation approach this is a great step in impact assessment studies which use distributed hydrological models such as swat but due to the limited data resolution pits of about 30 cm wide were not captured by soil land use and elevation data of more than 30 cm resolution as a result a series of pits were represented by a pothole hru in order to include irwh in the model this upscaling of pits might lead to unexpected results blöschl and sivapalan 1995 despite the need for mathematical theories and model parameters to be consistent at all scales if models are to be used for scenario simulations vinogradov et al 2011 scaling will be a very big challenge until data of finer resolution become available for hydrological models the hru customization approach for implementing luc in the swat model is also a very big step towards modelling lucs because it modifies the original hrus without altering their number shapes and locations the limitation of this approach is that the hru cannot have more than one land use type even if on the ground the same area has other new land covers as the result of lucs in the future hydrologists will be able to combine both hru customization and fragmentation approaches if more than one land use type occurs in the original hru area as the result of lucs however the limitation of spatial distribution of hrus in the swat model still causes similar results for different geographical areas in the swat model an hru can have a coverage area contributed from different scattered small areas within the same sub basin as long as they share the same land use type mulungu and munishi 2007 neitsch et al 2011 in this study cropland p1 is a good example of these spatially scattered hrus see fig 1 this might lead to the impacts of one place being transferred to another place as hrus are not spatially simulated in the swat model teshager et al 2016 in this model we obtained the maximum number of hrus possible using the available data however land use data with more detailed classification crop types management types etc are recommended in order to increase the reliability of predictions from distributed hydrological models 5 conclusion the hru fragmentation and customization approaches used in this approach have shown how irwh and luc applications can successfully be implemented in the swat model therefore these approaches are suitable for simulating basin scale impacts of irwh and luc other hydrological models using computational units similar to hrus can also use these approaches for modelling irwh and luc in river basins by using these approaches in impact predictions in the wami river basin we found that the applications of irwh on the current croplands caused substantial changes on the local hydrologic cycles in those areas irwh led to a substantial increase in et and the soil moisture especially during the dry years nevertheless the change in the average annual streamflow was very small even when irwh was implemented in 50 of current low coverage croplands in the river basin the application of luc led to substantial changes in et the soil water content and percolation across the river basin but had only minor impacts on the average annual streamflow in contrast the application of lwuc led to a huge decrease in the average annual streamflow indicating that wuc has huge impacts in the river basin the application of lwuc irwh also showed that wuc dictates the streamflow in the river basin thus the impacts of luc and irwh applications were very small compared to those of wuc since the lwuc scenario is more plausible than the luc scenario we recommend further studies on the eco hydrology of the river basin under various water use scenarios before the nlufp 2009 2029 proposal is fully implemented in the

11473,the management of water resources in a river basin experiencing the expansion of agricultural activities requires a proper understanding of impacts on its hydrologic cycle this study focused on the analysis of impacts of infield rainwater harvesting irwh and future agricultural expansion as land and water uses change lwuc on the hydrologic cycle in the wami river basin tanzania using the soil and water assessment tool swat in the swat model irwh was implemented by fragmenting rainwater harvesting hydrological response units hrus from cropland hrus and assigning them as potholes for rainwater impoundment lwuc was implemented by customizing land cover types and their corresponding model parameters in all original hrus and introducing projected water uses in the model the study thus demonstrated the successful modelling of irwh and land use change in the swat model using hru fragmentation and customization approaches respectively the results indicated that irwh applications in croplands led to a large increase in evapotranspiration et and the soil water content and a decrease in percolation especially in the dry years however the average annual streamflow showed negligible changes when irwh was implemented even in 50 of current low coverage croplands in the river basin thus irwh applications in the river basin are recommended the results also indicated that lwuc caused huge changes in et the soil water content percolation and the streamflow from the river basin the average annual streamflow was predicted to decrease by 26 due to lwuc however land use change alone without projected water uses was predicted to cause a minor decrease of about 1 in the average annual streamflow therefore further studies on the eco hydrology of the river basin under various water use scenarios are recommended prior to the expansion of agricultural areas keywords hru customization hru fragmentation pothole swat water use change 1 introduction the interactions between hydrologic cycles and agricultural activities i e cultivation and livestock keeping in river basins have received increased attention in recent years bharati et al 2008 speelman et al 2008 tijani et al 2014 in order to improve food security in sub saharan africa countries have engaged in the expansion of agricultural areas and the intensification of technologies which increase crop yields graef et al 2014 mlhhsd 2009 in tanzania and especially in the wami river basin some strategies and plans include the intensification of rainwater harvesting for small scale farms and the expansion of agricultural areas for cultivation and grazing mlhhsd 2009 recently rainwater harvesting has drawn attention in many regions in sub saharan africa as a sustainable and economical water source kahinda et al 2010 ndomba and wambura 2010 welderufael et al 2013 especially for small scale farming infield or in situ rainwater harvesting irwh consists of small pits or furrows that are dug within farms for collecting rainwater in order to increase the soil moisture and consequently the crop yield welderufael et al 2013 the irwh technique has shown a significant increase in the maize yield of up to 80 compared to conventional tillage practice in the makanya catchment tanzania makurira et al 2007 in the wami river basin irwh is also expected to be extended to small scale farmers in order to increase their crop yields currently irwh has been selected as one of the food value chain upgrading strategies studied by the trans sec innovating strategies to safeguard food security using technology and knowledge transfer a people centred approach research project for increasing food security in the wami river basin graef et al 2014 however intensifying irwh practices at a basin level may increase or decrease water availability in other places andersson et al 2011 makurira et al 2009 ngigi et al 2008 ngigi 2003 therefore understanding the impacts of different levels of irwh application before its intensification is crucial for the sustainability of the ecosystem in a river basin tanzania has a potential arable area of about 44 million hectares urt 2007 in the wami river basin the potential area already identified for cultivation grazing and settlement is about 71 of the river basin area mlhhsd 2009 however any land use change luc may also have impacts on the hydrologic cycle and consequently affect the ecosystem downstream of the river basin baker and miller 2013 schilling et al 2008 wagner et al 2013 in most cases lucs are accompanied by an increase in water abstractions i e water use change wuc this is because lucs resulting from the expansion of agricultural and industrial areas also increase the water demand cofie and amede 2015 maeda et al 2011 in the past the impacts of land and water uses change lwuc on water resources were largely neglected or considered byproducts of advancement scanlon et al 2005 schilling et al 2008 recent evaluations of historical effects in the wami river basin have shown that the expansion of arable land for agricultural practices that contributed to a shift in land and water uses in the past continue to shape the direction of land and water uses in the future fbd 2006 madulu 2005 wambura et al 2017 therefore prediction of consequences of future land and water uses on water resources is vital the modelling of irwh and lwuc is useful in the ex ante assessment of their impacts on the hydrologic cycle of a given river basin glendenning and vervoort 2011 ouessar et al 2009 welderufael et al 2013 due to various applications of the soil and water assessment tool swat in river basins in sub saharan africa including the wami river basin in tanzania mulungu and munishi 2007 ndomba et al 2008 nobert and jeremiah 2012 wambura 2014 wambura et al 2015 we selected it as the modelling environment for the irwh and lwuc scenario simulations the objective of this research was to analyse the impacts of irwh and lwuc on the hydrologic cycle in the wami river basin the research aimed at using more convincing process based approaches in implementing irwh and luc in the swat model the analysis focused on changes in evapotranspiration et and the soil water content due to irwh in individual croplands in different parts of the river basin as well as the general impacts of both irwh and lwuc on the streamflow from the river basin 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the wami river basin with an area of approximately 41 170 km2 is located between 5 00 7 27 s and 36 00 39 00 e in east central tanzania fig 1 elevation within this river basin ranges from 0 to 2360 masl the river basin is separated into two major parts by the eastern arc mountains eams which comprise the rubeho ukaguru nguru and nguu mountain ranges the predominant soils in the river basin are loam 38 and sand clay loam 41 fao isric 2003 the land use classes are predominantly bushland 23 woodland 44 and grassland 20 fao 1997 the ranch savannah grassland cropland under small scale farming and irrigation areas cover about 1 7 and 2 of the river basin respectively natural forests which are predominantly located along the eams cover about 3 of the river basin area fao 1997 in the wami river basin the average rainfall ranges between 692 and 1388 mm per year from tanzania meteorological agency 2000 2010 the river basin has two major rainfall zones a unimodal rainfall zone with one heavy rainfall season from october to april ondjfma in the upstream part and a bimodal rainfall zone in the downstream part the bimodal rainfall zone has two rainfall seasons a light rainfall season between october and december ond and a heavy rainfall season between march and may mam a transition between bimodal and unimodal rainfalls occurs in the midstream part of the river basin the average daily temperature in the river basin ranges between 24 and 31 c from tanzania meteorological agency 2000 2010 the average actual et in the river basin ranges between 368 and 1614 mm year from modis et 2000 2010 mu et al 2011 with higher et downstream than upstream the hydrologic cycle in the wami river basin is affected by the domestic water demand irrigation recently introduced rainwater harvesting agriculture ranches and an increasing demand for charcoal fuel wood and timber doggart and burgess 2005 iucn 2010 madulu 2005 most of the abstracted water is used for irrigation of sugarcane and rice plantations wambura 2014 wambura et al 2015 in the year 2010 irrigation activities in the river basin accounted for an average of 96 of the total abstracted water wambura 2014 wambura et al 2015 moreover the small scale farming activities in the wami river basin follow the rainfall seasons of ond and mam as well as the dry period between june and september or october mourice et al 2015 2 2 data for scenario development the slopes were computed from a 90 m shuttle radar topography mission elevation model jarvis et al 2008 the baseline land use at a scale of 1 250 000 was obtained from the fao database fao 1997 the proposed land use map used the future land use plan from the national land use framework plan 2009 2029 nlufp 2009 2029 mlhhsd 2009 to project water uses in sub basins in the year 2029 we used water use data domestic livestock irrigation and industrial water uses and projection parameters from the study by wambura et al 2015 2 3 basic model for scenario simulation the hydrological model used was the previously calibrated and validated swat model of the wami river basin from the study by wambura et al 2018 it was set up using topography 90 m digital elevation model jarvis et al 2008 soil scale of 1 2 000 000 fao isric 2003 and land use scale of 1 250 000 fao 1997 data as a result 45 sub basins and 2034 hydrological response units hrus were obtained from the model setup wambura et al 2018 the average size of the hrus was about 20 km2 and there were 371 original cropland hrus in the model land use of cropland was scheduled for plant growth from mid october to mid june of the following year and the harvest period was in the remaining months wambura et al 2018 the climate data used in the model were temperature and precipitation data tanzania meteorological agency weedon et al 2014 and baseline water use data wambura et al 2015 were used to abstract water from simulated flows the maximum canopy storage and critical depth of shallow groundwater parameters in the model were parameterized by the spatial pattern of long term average et and shallow groundwater levels inferred in the study by wambura et al 2017 respectively the model was calibrated using the first two thirds of the time series of monthly streamflow 2000 2007 at the 1g2 mandera gauging station wami ruvu basin water office fig 1 and the spatial pattern of long term average monthly et from modis et mu et al 2011 in the calibration the nash sutcliffe efficiency and the index of volumetric fit of the hydrograph achieved were 0 67 and 0 93 respectively wambura et al 2018 the correlation coefficient of the spatial calibration of average et achieved was 0 71 the model was also validated using the last third of the time series of monthly streamflow 2007 2010 at the 1g2 mandera gauging station the nash sutcliffe efficiency and the index of volumetric fit of the validation hydrograph achieved were 0 74 and 0 81 respectively wambura et al 2018 more details on the setup parameterization calibration and validation of this model are explained by wambura et al 2018 five types of scenarios namely irwh luc lwuc luc irwh and lwuc irwh table 1 were simulated in the swat model and changes in hydrological variables specifically et the soil water content percolation and the streamflow were analysed the soil water content refers to the amount of water in the soil profile at the end of the month and is directly related to the soil moisture neitsch et al 2011 the streamflow at the river basin outlet gives the overall dynamics of the hydrologic cycle because it includes water yield effects of water abstractions and pothole overflows from all parts of the river basin 2 4 application of irwh several approaches for modelling irwh using the swat model have been involving alterations of model parameters andersson et al 2011 andersson et al 2013 dourte et al 2014 masih et al 2011 welderufael et al 2013 andersson et al 2011 and welderufael et al 2013 modelled irwh by modifying the usda scs curve number parameters masih et al 2011 modelled irwh by modifying the available soil water capacity parameter dourte et al 2014 modelled irwh by modifying the green ampt infiltration routine to represent water harvesting tillage using the maximum depression storage parameter however it is not clearly known how those parameters represent the irwh processes occurring in actual irwh pits or furrows a more convincing approach of modelling irwh involved summation of multiple irwh systems to form a set which was represented by a pond in a sub basin of the swat model ghimire and johnston 2013 in that approach ghimire and johnston 2013 used the pond routine available in the swat model to simulate processes similar to actual irwh systems however in the current version of swat the pond routine cannot be applied to hrus neitsch et al 2011 in addition the separation of areas for crops and rainwater impoundment is a restriction because a single sub basin may contain various land use types in this study irwh was implemented using sets of multiple irwh pits and the pothole routine available in the swat model the main advantage of the pothole approach over other approaches for irwh is that it can be applied at hru level and involves all hydrological processes similar to actual irwh pits neitsch et al 2011 a pothole also has the advantage of specifying the depth of infiltration pits or furrows neitsch et al 2011 moreover when the volume of water in a pothole exceeds its maximum storage the excess water enters the main channel in the sub basin and eventually contributes to the streamflow du et al 2005 neitsch et al 2011 eq 1 represents the water balance of a pothole neitsch et al 2011 1 v v s t o r e d v f l o w i n v f l o w o u t v p c p v e v a p v s e e p where v is the volume of water in the pothole at the end of the day vstored is the volume of water stored in the pothole at the beginning of the day vflowin is the volume of water from a drainage area a soil profile and a shallow aquifer entering the pothole during the day and vflowout is the volume of water flowing out of the pothole during the day vpcp is the volume of precipitation falling into the pothole during the day vevap is the volume of water removed from the pothole by evaporation during the day and vseep is the volume of water lost from the pothole by seepage in actual cropland irwh is a sequence of n pits furrows each with an area api and separated at a distance x where i ranges from 1 to n fig 2 a in the swat model the actual cropland area was represented by a cropland hru with an area ahru fig 2b due to the limitation of a minimum area of a cropland hru in this model and since there can be only one pothole in each hru of the swat model neitsch et al 2011 a series of n pits furrows was aggregated to form a pothole with an area ap fig 2a and b in the swat model a pothole is modelled as a depression area in an hru hence the land cover of the hru for plant growth is also assigned to the pothole fig 2b however since the focus of this study was to model a pothole as a sole rainwater harvesting part of a farm we decided to fragment cropland hrus into crop and irwh areas fig 2c in the model the hru fragmentation was done on cropland hrus by splitting their input files chm gw hru sdr sep sol and mgt files into crop hrus and pothole hrus this led to a doubling of the number of cropland related hrus new crop hrus were similar to original cropland hrus but their coverage areas were reduced depending on the level of irwh application i e 20 35 and 50 of cropland pothole hrus were specified as water bodies and named after the last hrus in the sub basins of their corresponding crop hrus the names of these pothole hrus were then added to the general sub basin input files sub file other parameters used in the pothole hrus are shown in table 2 after the model simulations the outputs of the crop hrus and pothole hrus were re aggregated to form variables for the original cropland hrus a schematic representation of a crop hru and a pothole hru aggregated together as an original cropland hru is illustrated in fig 3 et from a crop area comprises evaporation from the soil plant canopy storage and transpiration whereas from a pothole area comprises evaporation from impounded water and soil infiltrated water increases the soil water content and percolates to the shallow and deep aquifers fig 3 demand for et causes water uptake from the shallow aquifer into the overlying unsaturated soil layers fig 3 the modification of inputs the simulation and the extraction of hydrological variables in the model were carried out using the swat routine and algorithms source code is freely available upon request integrated into the python programming environment johansson 2014 neitsch et al 2011 oliphant 2006 2007 three case study areas were selected for illustration of impacts of irwh applications in croplands fig 1 p1 is one of the cropland hrus with cultivation activities in the upstream area of the river basin cf figs 1 4a and c p2 was selected because one of the case study sites investigated by the trans sec project graef et al 2014 is within this cropland hru in the midstream area and p3 is one of the cropland hrus with extensive cultivation activities further downstream cf figs 1 4a and c these areas still have the same land cover type even with the proposed land use in the year 2029 cf figs 1 and 4c the soil texture of croplands p1 and p3 is sand clay loam and that of cropland p2 is loam the saturated water contents porosities of croplands p1 p2 and p3 are 0 47 0 53 and 0 51 respectively fao 1997 the average saturated hydraulic conductivities are 338 551 and 430 mm hr respectively fao 1997 2 5 application of luc and lwuc prior to the luc application the baseline land use in the year 1997 fig 4a was modified using the future land use plan for the 2009 2029 period fig 4b to obtain the proposed land use for the wami river basin in the year 2029 fig 4c in this process the land uses in urban reserved areas and on steep slopes were not modified steep slopes 11 were not modified because they are not suitable for agricultural activities jasbir and dhillon 2006 the proposed land use in the year 2029 showed that cropland and ranch areas will increase extensively while losing woodland bushland and grassland fig 5 the cropland and ranch areas are expected to increase from 7 to 36 and from 1 to 11 of the basin area respectively figs 5 and 6 common approaches of modelling luc in the swat model include land use remodelling lur and land use updating lup the lur approach involves the use of a new land use map to set up a completely new model and constrain it using baseline parameters nobert and jeremiah 2012 the main disadvantage of the lur approach is that it can lead to different number shapes and locations of hrus thus affecting other applications which depend on specific hrus the lup approach models a continuous land cover change in which only proportions of land use types in hrus change neitsch et al 2011 the limitation of the lup approach is that land use types and their corresponding parameters in hrus cannot be replaced by the new ones in this study we used the hru customization approach for modification of land use types and their corresponding parameters in a previously calibrated and validated swat model the main advantage of the hru customization approach is that completely new land use types and parameters can be introduced in original hrus without altering their number shapes and locations this leads to similar hrus in both the baseline and luc scenario simulations the hru customization involved masking the proposed land use with polygons of original hrus and assigning the largest coverage of masked land use types in the hrus as their new land uses then new land uses in the hrus were used to customize the land use types in the hru input files in the hru management files mgt files the plant codes for plant database were also modified to match the new land use types after the hru customization there were 803 cropland hrus out of 2034 hrus in addition the impacts of the lwuc scenario involved the introduction of the effects of wuc on luc total water uses were projected to increase from 17 5 m3 s in the year 2010 to 37 0 m3 s in the year 2029 most of the projected water uses were irrigation water demands 97 of total water uses in the year 2029 total water use demands were then distributed into the river reaches for abstracting simulated flows using the water use routine available in the swat model neitsch et al 2011 for both the luc and lwuc scenarios the modification simulation and extraction of hydrological variables were carried out using the swat routine and algorithms source code is freely available upon request integrated in the python programming environment johansson 2014 neitsch et al 2011 oliphant 2006 2007 2 6 application of luc irwh and lwuc irwh the luc irwh and lwuc irwh scenarios involved the application of irwh on top of already expanded croplands having undergone luc or lwuc in this case irwh was applied in all 803 new cropland hrus the procedures of applying irwh and luc or lwuc are similar to the explanations in sections 2 4 and 2 5 respectively for these scenarios only the average streamflow from the river basin was analysed 3 results 3 1 impacts of irwh the impacts of irwh applications on hydrological variables in croplands are illustrated for cropland p1 fig 7 in cropland p1 the pattern of rainfall peaks varies from year to year fig 7a in hydrological years from october to september of the following year we found that the dry years when annual rainfall ar is less than the average annual rainfall aar in the time series were 2001 2002 2002 2003 2004 2005 2005 2006 and 2008 2009 the wet years when ar is greater than aar were 2000 2001 and 2006 2007 the remaining years were normal years when ar is approximately equal to aar the applications of irwh in cropland p1 led to an increase in et in the dry years of 2004 2005 and 2008 2009 but the wet years of 2000 2001 and 2006 2007 did not show any clear change in et fig 7b the normal years of 2003 2004 and 2007 2008 showed a slight decrease in et in the first half and a slight increase in the second half of the year similar to et the soil water content also increased in the dry years of 2001 2002 2005 2006 and 2008 2009 fig 7c the normal years of 2003 2004 and 2007 2008 also showed an increase in the soil water content but the wet years did not show any clear changes in the dry and normal years percolation was slightly reduced by the application of irwh fig 7d croplands p2 and p3 had similar results for et the soil water content and percolation although in different years for a better illustration of impacts of irwh application in croplands one typical dry normal and wet years were selected based on ar and aar amounts in each selected cropland i e p1 p2 and p3 fig 8 a c show unimodal rainfalls in the dry normal and wet years respectively in cropland p1 substantial rainfall in the dry normal and wet years occurred in the november april december april and november march periods respectively fig 8d l show that the higher the level of irwh application in cropland p1 the bigger the changes in et the soil water content and percolation throughout the dry year irwh application led to an increase in et fig 8d in the normal year et decreased from october to february but increased from march to september fig 8e during the wet year et increased from october to february but there was no change in et from march to september fig 8f the soil water content increased throughout the dry and normal years due to irwh application but the latter had a higher increase than the former fig 8g and h like et the soil water content also had a similar pattern in the wet year cf fig 8f and i changes in percolation due to irwh applications were very small but a clear decrease was found in the october may january may and october december periods in the dry normal and wet years respectively fig 8j l the average et and soil water content in the 2000 2010 period for cropland p1 increased as the level of application of irwh increased table 3 meanwhile the average percolation shallow and deep groundwater recharges and discharges decreased however the average shallow groundwater uptake did not change at any level of irwh application table 3 the rainfall peaks in cropland p2 in the midstream area represent the transition between unimodal and bimodal rainfalls fig 9 a c the unimodal and bimodal distributions are reflected in the dry and normal years respectively in contrast rainfall distribution in the wet year is affected by extreme storms fig 9d l show that the changes in et the soil water content and percolation increased as higher levels of irwh were applied in cropland p2 in the dry year cropland p2 experienced a substantial increase in et in the october april period due to irwh application fig 9d in the normal year a substantial decrease in et was predicted in the october february period and a slight increase was predicted in the march june period fig 9e in the wet year a decrease and a slight increase in et were predicted in the october march and april june periods respectively fig 9f the pattern of changes in the soil water content due to irwh application in the dry year was very similar to that of et cf fig 9d and g in the normal and wet years the soil water content increased in the october may and november june periods respectively fig 9h and i due to irwh application in cropland p2 percolation increased in the february may and february july periods in the normal and wet years respectively fig 9k and l the decrease in percolation was predicted in the october march and december february periods in the dry and normal years respectively while the remaining months did not show any clear changes in percolation in general in cropland p2 the average et soil water content and lateral flow in the 2000 2010 period increased proportionally to the level of irwh application table 4 with the exception of the average shallow groundwater uptake the remaining hydrological variables decreased table 4 the rainfall peaks in cropland p3 in the downstream area represent bimodal rainfalls however the distribution is more evident in the dry and normal years as compared to the wet year fig 10 a c substantial rainfall in the dry year occurred in the october may period and in the normal and wet years it occurred in the october june period fig 10d l show that the higher the level of irwh was applied in cropland p3 the bigger the changes in et the soil water content and percolation a decrease in et due to irwh application in cropland p3 was predicted in the october february and october march periods in the dry and wet years respectively fig 10d and f in the dry normal and wet years an increase in et was predicted in the february september october april and march july periods respectively however in the normal and wet years there were no clear changes in et in the may september and august september periods respectively due to irwh application the soil water content increased throughout the dry year and in the october april and october june periods in the normal and wet years respectively fig 10g i the application of irwh also led to a decrease in percolation in the january september october march and january may periods in the dry normal and wet years respectively fig 10j l the average et soil water content and lateral flow in cropland p3 increased as the level of irwh application increased table 5 the average shallow groundwater uptake did not change but the remaining hydrological variables decreased inversely to the level of irwh application table 5 the average streamflow at the 1g2 mandera gauging station showed slight changes due to irwh applications in croplands the slight increase in the streamflow was predicted in december and negligible changes of flow were predicted in june and september whereas the remaining months showed the decrease in flow fig 11 the smallest decrease in average streamflow was found at 20 irwh application and the deviation from the baseline got relatively bigger as the higher levels of irwh were applied at 50 irwh application the largest decrease and increase in average streamflow were predicted in may and december respectively fig 11 however overall changes in the average annual streamflow between the years 2000 and 2010 were negligible at all levels of irwh application table 6 3 2 impacts of luc and lwuc the luc and lwuc scenarios have identical land use types they only differ in water abstractions from reaches therefore their sub basin results are the same fig 12 the baseline average et shows a clear dichotomy between the downstream and upstream areas with the former having relatively higher et than the latter fig 12a however the increase in et due to the luc or lwuc was predicted further downstream and upstream along the eams and in the south of the river basin cf figs 1 12a and b the baseline soil water content was relatively high in the south and southwest of the river basin but the luc or lwuc scenario led to an increase in the soil water content in the northwest and east of the river basin cf fig 12c and d moreover the largest part of the river basin did not show changes in the soil water content due to the luc or lwuc scenarios like et the baseline percolation was also relatively higher downstream than upstream cf fig 12a and e however the luc or lwuc scenario led to a decrease in percolation in the south west and further downstream of the river basin cf fig 12e and f the average streamflow at the 1g2 mandera gauging station was differently affected by both luc and lwuc scenarios fig 13 the luc scenario showed a small increase in the streamflow between february and the end of october but the lwuc scenario showed a decrease in the streamflow in the january july and september december periods in relation to the baseline condition changes of the average annual streamflow under the luc and lwuc scenarios were 1 and 26 respectively table 6 3 3 impacts of luc irwh and lwuc irwh since the impacts of various applications of irwh have been presented in section 3 1 here the focus is on the 50 irwh application i e ridge and furrow cultivation system on the luc and lwuc scenarios due to the luc 0 50irwh scenario the average streamflow increased from early january to november and decreased towards december the lwuc 0 50irwh scenario led to a slight increase in the streamflow from july to late september but a decrease was predicted in the january july and october december periods fig 14 the changes in the average annual streamflow under the luc 0 50irwh and lwuc 0 50irwh scenarios were 7 and 22 respectively table 6 4 discussion 4 1 irwh impacts on the hydrologic cycle simulated changes in the variables of the hydrologic cycle in the wami river basin indicate that the hru fragmentation approach is suitable for modelling irwh applications at a basin scale simulated impacts of irwh applications in croplands implied that rainwater stayed in pits while some of it underwent infiltration water in the pits became susceptible to direct evaporation and overflow to the streams whenever the pits were full infiltrated water modified soil water content and became susceptible to transpiration soil evaporation lateral flow and percolation to deeper layers makurira et al 2009 also reported that the application of irwh enhanced an increase in soil moisture at the makanya catchment in tanzania however in this study we also found that retention of water in the pits furrows reduced percolation to groundwater storage moreover water uptake due to et demand did not differ thus the same amount of water was taken from shallow groundwater back to the soil profile at all levels of irwh application see tables 3 5 this process depleted groundwater storage as the level of irwh application increased a similar decrease was also experienced in groundwater discharges thus the increase in et was the main reason for the depletion of groundwater storage and the decrease in groundwater recharges and discharges in cropland p1 substantial rainfall in the dry year started early i e in november and that led to an increase in et throughout the year because irwh saturated the soil layer causing an increase in the soil water content thus irwh application is an appropriate strategy for increasing soil moisture in the dry years in the normal year substantial rainfall started slightly late i e in december thus irwh led to a decrease in et because at the beginning of the season only a little amount of rainfall infiltrated into the soil profile this little rainfall was not sufficient for saturation of the soil layer until the start of heavy rainfall in the january february period in the wet year rainfall started and ended early november march hence irwh led to an increase in et and the soil water content but that change receded as the rainfall declined the causes of et and the soil water content changes in croplands p2 and p3 are similar to those for p1 croplands in the upstream and downstream areas had a slightly higher water uptake from the shallow aquifers than the midstream cropland tables 3 5 in fact the presence of a shallow water table was reported in the upstream and downstream areas glows fiu 2014 jica 2013 wambura et al 2017 the soil related differences in croplands were partly caused by saturated water content and hydraulic conductivity this is because a high saturated water content reduces water impoundment and high saturated hydraulic conductivity facilitates percolation thus they indirectly reduce et and soil water despite the close similarity of rainfall patterns the higher saturated water content and hydraulic conductivity in cropland p2 than in cropland p3 led to a smaller increase in et and the soil water content in the former than in the latter see tables 4 and 5 therefore the application of irwh is the best strategy for increasing soil moisture in areas with soil and groundwater properties similar to croplands p1 and p3 i e low porosity and shallow water table the applications of irwh on current croplands in the river basin led to a slight reduction in the streamflow from the river basin because irwh pits retained rainwater this small change in the streamflow is caused by a small area of the river basin currently conducting cultivation activities 7 of the river basin area thus current changes in the hydrological variables experienced in croplands are too small compared to non croplands which are not affected by irwh applications since current croplands are also in low rainfall areas slight overflows from irwh pits to the streams caused little increase in streamflow only in december in assessing the impacts of irwh welderufael et al 2013 also reported a non significant effect on the amount of flow downstream of a sub catchment in the modder river basin in south africa thus the flow regimes of a river basin with low coverage croplands often are not likely to change significantly even if irwh is widely applied on small scale farms andersson et al 2011 therefore applications of irwh in current croplands have no substantial impacts on the streamflow from the river basin 4 2 luc and lwuc impacts on the hydrologic cycle the spatial distribution of changes in et the soil water content and percolation indicates that the hru customization approach successfully enabled prediction of impacts of luc in the wami river basin at the sub basin level luc was predicted to cause extensive changes on the hydrologic cycle in the river basin due to the expansion of croplands and ranch areas extensive changes in et and the soil water content in the northwest and east of the river basin were caused by the expansion of croplands see figs 4a c 6 12b and d in areas further downstream the changes in et and the soil water content were caused by the expansion of ranch areas see fig 4a and c moreover the pattern of percolation changes was related to changes in et and the soil water content in areas where croplands were converted from bushlands and grasslands there were increases in et and the soil water content and a decrease in percolation these changes were caused by cropland having high leaf area indices compared to bushland and grassland neitsch et al 2011 propastin and kappas 2012 similarly in the areas where croplands changed from woodlands there were decreases in et and the soil water content and an increase in percolation because woodland has higher leaf area indices than cropland most ranch areas emerged from woodland therefore in those areas there was a decrease in et and an increase in percolation because the former land cover has lower leaf area indices than the latter in fact luc affected et which in turn modified the soil water content percolation and other variables of the hydrologic cycle the simulated impacts of the luc and lwuc scenarios are the same at the sub basin level but different for the streamflow from the river basin because the projected water uses in the latter were abstracted in the river reaches the average streamflow of the luc scenario has a smaller impact than that of the lwuc scenario because the latter included projected water abstractions however the lwuc scenario is more plausible than the luc scenario because future land use cannot be implemented without an increase in water use in the river basin geng et al 2015 between june and september the impact of lwuc was negligible because this is the dry low flow and harvesting period thus projected water uses were not abstracted in the remaining months the impacts of lwuc were intensified by projected water uses especially irrigation water demands moreover due to lwuc between the years 2009 and 2029 the change in the average annual streamflow is predicted to decrease by 26 nobert and jeremiah 2012 also inferred that land cover change between years 1987 and 2000 led to the decrease in the average river flows from the wami river basin thus land cover change influences the streamflow characteristics of a drainage basin to a large extent sajikumar and remya 2015 the streamflow change emphasizes how lwuc which is based on increasing cropland ranch areas and water uses modifies the hydrologic cycle of the river basin therefore the nlufp 2009 2029 mlhhsd 2009 has substantial impacts on the hydrologic cycle in the wami river basin 4 3 luc irwh and lwuc irwh impacts on the hydrologic cycle the predicted impacts of the luc irwh and lwuc irwh scenarios on the average streamflow from the river basin were due to the application of irwh on the luc and lwuc scenarios respectively in fact the spatial increase in croplands due to luc led to the expansion of areas conducting irwh in the western and eastern parts of the river basin see fig 6 as a result the presence of heavy rainfall in the eastern part of the river basin wambura 2014 and the shallow aquifers in both the western and eastern parts of the river basin glows fiu 2014 wambura et al 2017 led to an increase in overflows from irwh pits to the streams because the harvested rainwater exceeded the maximum storage of pits this caused an increase in the streamflow as the applications of irwh increased in the river basin in fact excess water which caused changes in the streamflow was compensated for by water uptake from the shallow aquifers in croplands therefore in both the luc irwh and the lwuc irwh scenarios the applications of irwh in croplands led to the depletion of shallow groundwater through water uptake and a decrease in percolation however the luc irwh scenario has a higher streamflow than the lwuc irwh scenario because the latter involved water abstractions i e wuc in addition the luc irwh scenario also has a slightly higher streamflow due to more peak flows from overflows than the irwh scenario because the area conducting irwh in the former is larger than in the latter see fig 6 in general irwh applications on expanded croplands i e proposed land and or water uses might intensively affect the streamflow from the river basin 4 4 modelling limitations in this study the modelling limitations were in the data model structures and applications the coarseness of data such as soil land use and elevation and the lack of flexible model structures for implementing various applications are great challenges in hydrological modelling chaplot 2014 hamel and guswa 2015 shrestha et al 2006 we have managed to model irwh using the hru fragmentation approach this is a great step in impact assessment studies which use distributed hydrological models such as swat but due to the limited data resolution pits of about 30 cm wide were not captured by soil land use and elevation data of more than 30 cm resolution as a result a series of pits were represented by a pothole hru in order to include irwh in the model this upscaling of pits might lead to unexpected results blöschl and sivapalan 1995 despite the need for mathematical theories and model parameters to be consistent at all scales if models are to be used for scenario simulations vinogradov et al 2011 scaling will be a very big challenge until data of finer resolution become available for hydrological models the hru customization approach for implementing luc in the swat model is also a very big step towards modelling lucs because it modifies the original hrus without altering their number shapes and locations the limitation of this approach is that the hru cannot have more than one land use type even if on the ground the same area has other new land covers as the result of lucs in the future hydrologists will be able to combine both hru customization and fragmentation approaches if more than one land use type occurs in the original hru area as the result of lucs however the limitation of spatial distribution of hrus in the swat model still causes similar results for different geographical areas in the swat model an hru can have a coverage area contributed from different scattered small areas within the same sub basin as long as they share the same land use type mulungu and munishi 2007 neitsch et al 2011 in this study cropland p1 is a good example of these spatially scattered hrus see fig 1 this might lead to the impacts of one place being transferred to another place as hrus are not spatially simulated in the swat model teshager et al 2016 in this model we obtained the maximum number of hrus possible using the available data however land use data with more detailed classification crop types management types etc are recommended in order to increase the reliability of predictions from distributed hydrological models 5 conclusion the hru fragmentation and customization approaches used in this approach have shown how irwh and luc applications can successfully be implemented in the swat model therefore these approaches are suitable for simulating basin scale impacts of irwh and luc other hydrological models using computational units similar to hrus can also use these approaches for modelling irwh and luc in river basins by using these approaches in impact predictions in the wami river basin we found that the applications of irwh on the current croplands caused substantial changes on the local hydrologic cycles in those areas irwh led to a substantial increase in et and the soil moisture especially during the dry years nevertheless the change in the average annual streamflow was very small even when irwh was implemented in 50 of current low coverage croplands in the river basin the application of luc led to substantial changes in et the soil water content and percolation across the river basin but had only minor impacts on the average annual streamflow in contrast the application of lwuc led to a huge decrease in the average annual streamflow indicating that wuc has huge impacts in the river basin the application of lwuc irwh also showed that wuc dictates the streamflow in the river basin thus the impacts of luc and irwh applications were very small compared to those of wuc since the lwuc scenario is more plausible than the luc scenario we recommend further studies on the eco hydrology of the river basin under various water use scenarios before the nlufp 2009 2029 proposal is fully implemented in the

11474,agriculture consumes a huge amount of energy every year and then emits lots of greenhouse gases ghg reduction of agricultural energy consumption is important to sustainable agriculture and mitigation of climate change groundwater is the main irrigation source in north china s main food production plains north china plain ncp many studies have shown that the groundwater levels here have declined a lot during past decades however the related environmental and economic impacts have been rarely researched this study carries out a detailed research on the changes in energy cost and ghg emissions caused by groundwater level declines on the ncp results indicate that during 1996 2013 total agricultural groundwater consumption here has increased by 20 over exploitation of groundwater has caused severe groundwater declines 0 6 m yr 1 and the decline rate has become faster in recent years as a result energy use rate for pumping unit water has increased from 0 50 to 0 61 kwh m 3 by nearly 22 therefore ghg emissions have increased from 6 16 to 8 72 mt co2e by 42 hebei suffers the most serious groundwater level declines and emits most ghg from pumping accounting for 47 of the total emissions in the ncp the economic cost of energy consumption and emission reduction for pumping irrigation is us 1 25 billion in 2013 reaching up to 10 3 of gdp in this region the increasing cost is a great threat to sustainable development of agriculture water saving irrigation is one of the most effective ways to reduce water and energy consumption without loss of grain output to reduce ghg emissions and pressures on energy and groundwater resources water saving irrigation should be greatly promoted in this region the study would contribute to the development of water saving and energy saving agriculture keywords energy consumption ghg emissions pumping irrigation north china plain 1 introduction climate change caused by increasing energy consumption and ghg emissions has become a common concern of the international community the paris agreement fully embodies global change as not only significant for the interests and development of each country but to the whole world in the past six decades energy consumption patterns in agriculture have changed enormously cleveland 1995 leach 1976 today the agriculture sector is one of main contributors to energy consumption and ghg emissions barker et al 2009 devi et al 2009 each year agriculture emits 10 12 of the total estimated ghg emissions 5 1 6 1 103 mt co2e yr 1 niggli et al 2009 studies of the direct energy use of on farm operations suggest that groundwater pumping for irrigation is one of the highest energy consumption processes lal 2004 mushtaq et al 2009 singh et al 2003 this issue is especially severe in china because of its agriculture depending largely on the groundwater pumping irrigation china is the world s largest emitter of ghgs and its ghg emissions have drawn widespread attention both domestically and internationally as a signatory to the paris agreement china has committed to reducing ghg emissions per unit of gdp by 2030 to a level that is 60 65 lower than the amount emitted in 2005 the national ghg emissions are estimated to reach a peak in approximately 2030 meanwhile as the world s second largest irrigator ghg emissions from agriculture are responsible for 17 20 of the nation s total annual emissions wang et al 2010 which is almost doubled from the world average level the north china plain ncp is one of the most important agricultural regions in china providing about 20 of china s total grain productionproviding about 20 of china s total grain production yuan and shen 2013 however the ncp is also one of the areas with the greatest water shortages in china to offset the water deficit the high crop productivity in the ncp depends largely on groundwater irrigation zhang et al 2004 in the ncp approximately 70 of the pumped groundwater is consumed for agricultural irrigation and over 87 is consumed in the piedmont regions hu et al 2010 zhang 2004 sustainable development is greatly challenged by groundwater over exploitation which is approximately 4 4 5 km3 yr 1 in this region bu et al 2008 the severe overexploitation of groundwater results in a quickly declining groundwater levels together with environmental degradation and has therefore attracted many research attentions feng et al 2013 jia and liu 2002 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2002 many studies have recently focused on sustainable groundwater supplies and food security bu et al 2008 cao et al 2013 chen et al 2007 du et al 2014 foster and garduño 2004 zhang 2004 however the research into energy consumption and ghg emissions from pumping irrigation is less this paper presents a quantitative estimate of the change of energy consumption and ghg emissions from groundwater irrigation in the ncp the specific objectives of this paper are as follows a to estimate the related cost of pumping irrigation including energy consumption and ghgs reduction costs b to investigate the changes in energy consumption and ghg emissions caused from groundwater level declines c to analyze the factors influencing fluctuations in groundwater and energy consumption and d to clarify the importance of water saving irrigation 2 data and methods 2 1 site description the north china plain ncp is also referred to as the huang huai hai plain from the viewpoint of water resource management and economic importance a narrower definition of the ncp is more commonly used it is the region bordered on the north by the yan mountains on the west by the taihang mountains to the south by the yellow river and to the east by the bohai gulf it is located in the eastern coastal region of china between 34 46 40 25 n latitude and 112 30 119 30 e longitude fig 1 the total area of this narrowly defined ncp is 1 39 105 km2 with a population of approximately 111 million because of the monsoon influence rainfall is highly variable the mean annual average precipitation is 550 650 mm 80 of which occurs from june to september the annual pan evaporation is approximately 1000 1500 mm the proportion of evaporation from april to june to that of the full year is approximately 45 the ncp contains 9 of china s population and 11 of its arable land and produces 10 of the nation s gross domestic agricultural products currently 71 of its cultivated land is irrigated with an irrigated area of 7 5 mha 2 2 data sources the average annual precipitation and temperature 1996 2013 were obtained from the meteorological bureau data on agricultural development 1996 2013 including grain output grain value and grain planting area were obtained from the ministry of agriculture crop pattern data 1996 2013 were from national bureau of statistics data on water consumption for agriculture 1996 2013 were collected from the water resources bulletin irrigation data 1996 2013 including the total irrigated area 1996 2013 and water saving irrigated area 2004 2013 were collected from the national bureau of statistics average groundwater levels 1996 2013 were calculated based on data from china s ground water information center 195 observation wells selected in the ncp of which 29 were in beijing municipality 21 in tianjin municipality 81 in hebei province 26 in henan province and 38 in shandong province data on the number of wells 1960s 2011 were acquired from water resources yearbook data on groundwater exploitation 1996 2013 were collected from the water resources bulletin electricity prices 2006 2013 in different districts were obtained from the annual report on electricity regulation data on groundwater levels and shallow groundwater extraction for 880 observational wells in the hebei plain were collected from the hebei department of water conservation 1950s 2013 table 1 2 3 estimation of pumping lifts there are no valid statistics on groundwater pumping lifts in the ncp pump lifts y were estimated by using the groundwater levels x based on data taken from 366 surveyed villages in northern china wang et al 2012a b the linear regression is shown in eq 1 and its coefficient of determination is r2 0 62 1 y 0 906x 21 75 in this study the average groundwater levels were calculated using data from china s groundwater information center based on 195 observation wells to verify the accuracy of the calculation we compared our data with the groundwater bulletin for a particular area the results indicated that there was a well consistency based on the above data for groundwater levels 1996 2013 the groundwater pumping lifts were estimated 2 4 estimation of agricultural groundwater consumption detailed and comprehensive information on actual groundwater consumption for irrigation are unavailable the most appropriate data are the provincial level statistics of total agricultural water consumption reported in the water resources bulletin we assume that the water consumption per unit area is similar across all the irrigated area regardless of the water source therefore the proportion of total agricultural water derived from groundwater was estimated by the percentages of groundwater irrigated land relative to the total irrigated land eq 2 2 groundwater consumption total water consumtion groundwater irrigated land the percentages were obtained from a national monitoring station administered by the ministry of agriculture from interviews with officials in the water resources bureaus and from further generalizations in the published literature huang et al 2009 wang et al 2012a b xu 2003 zhang et al 2007 2 5 estimation of energy use rate the energy use rate of irrigated land varies with the depth of groundwater being pumped irrigation system and the water requirements of grain for the calculation of energy consumption in pumping processes three methods are assessed karimi et al 2012 lin 1984 rothausen and conway 2011 here we focused on energy consumption in the extraction of groundwater on the basis of irrigation conditions in the ncp and on data availability the method of lin 1984 was chosen for the following calculation eq 3 3 energy use rate 9 8 lift 3 6 10 6 efficiency where the unit is in kwh m 3 for energy use rate and percent for efficiency respectively energy consumption was calculated by first identifying the types of energy sources used agricultural machines in the ncp mainly included electric motors and diesel engines this study assumed that the proportion of electric and diesel pumps were 76 and 24 in beijing and tianjin 10 and 90 in hebei 67 and 33 in henan 100 and 0 in shandong respectively wang et al 2012a b with a 100 efficient process the energy needed to lift 1 km3 of water up 1 m is 2 72 106 kwh however efficiency losses in pumping are likely to make the conversion from actual to theoretical pump efficiency achieve 40 or lower levels given a lack of detailed information on pumping efficiency of the individual pumps we selected commonly used efficiency values of 15 and 40 for diesel and electric pumps respectively in northern china according to wang et al 2012a b once groundwater is pumped to the surface further losses will occur in both the transmission and distribution t d processes this is particularly the case for electricity where losses can be considerable shah et al 2009 the t d of energy losses are believed to range from 10 to 19 in china sun 2006 we adopted a mid range value of 14 5 for t d efficiency losses 2 6 estimation of ghg emission rate ghg emissions from groundwater irrigation were determined by estimating co2 emissions due to energy consumed for pumping irrigation direct and indirect emissions of ghgs such as ch4 and n2o are not strongly associated with energy consumption here we focused on co2 emissions from energy consumption the united kingdom department of environment food and rural affairs department of energy and climate change established ghg conversion factors for diesel and electricity produced that are 0 32021 kg co2e kwh 1 and 0 94773 kg co2e kwh 1 in china wang et al 2012a b this study used these figures and a revised equation eq 4 from wang et al 2012a b to calculate the average ghg emissions rate kg co2e m 3 based on a combination of power sources for pumps in the ncp as follows fig 2 4 ghg emission rate energy use rate electric 0 95 energy use rate diesal 0 32 where the unit is kg co2e m 3 for the ghg emission rate and kwh m 3 is the energy use rate respectively 3 results 3 1 changes in groundwater levels and agricultural groundwater consumption during 1996 2013 3 1 1 agricultural groundwater consumption during 2003 2013 the ncp experienced a substantial increase by nearly 45 in grain output fig 3 the average increment rate was 2 8 mt yr 1 which was coincided with growth of grain planting area higher planting area resulted in an increase in irrigated area during 1996 2013 irrigated area in this region increased from 8 99 mha to 9 45 mha at a rate of 0 03 mha yr 1 area under water saving irrigation techniques increased by roughly 30 from 3 85 mha in 2004 to 4 99 mha in 2013 the proportion of water saving irrigated area to the total correspondingly increased a total of 67 of the water supply from surface runoff and groundwater had been used for irrigation in the ncp irrigation accounts for over 70 of the total groundwater withdrawn over the last 15 years two obvious periods of agricultural groundwater consumption in the ncp could be seen it was 15 33 km3 in 1996 and reached a maximum of 19 84 km3 in 2002 an increase of 0 75 km3 yr 1 fig 4 since 2003 agricultural groundwater use appeared a decreasing trend with two significant drops in 2004 and 2008 the distinct increase of precipitation in 2004 and 2008 data not shown may play an important role in these significant drops 3 1 2 groundwater level declines with the expansion of groundwater irrigation the number of motor pumped wells sharply increased from 1 8 thousand in the 1960s to 0 83 million in the early 2000s the density of pumped wells had reached more than 20 per km2 in the early 2000s in the 2000s the groundwater exploitation rate the ratio of groundwater withdrawals to groundwater recharge in many parts of the ncp exceeded 100 and in some areas the ratio exceeded 150 liu et al 2010 persistent groundwater overexploitation in the ncp had resulted in increasingly serious water level declines groundwater levels represented as positive values similarly hereinafter dropped from 25 62 m in 1996 to 35 94 m in 2013 declining at a rate of 0 61 m yr 1 fig 5 in intensively groundwater irrigated districts the groundwater levels declined at a rate faster than 1 m yr 1 3 2 changes in energy consumption and ghg emissions from pumping irrigation in the ncp due to groundwater level declines pumping became increasingly energy intensive and emitted more ghgs as shown in table 2 data about pump lifts agricultural groundwater consumption energy use rate and energy consumption were used to establish energy consumption and ghg emissions during 1996 2013 the pump lifts increased by 21 which coincided with groundwater level declines by 10 32 m the energy use rate for pumping irrigation increased continuously from 0 50 kwh m 3 to 0 61 kwh m 3 by nearly 22 during 1996 2013 in addition agricultural groundwater consumption increased by 20 during this period the ghg emissions in 2013 were 8 72 mt co2e it was almost 1 5 times that of 1996 6 16 mt co2e there was a temporary decrease in ghg emissions in 2004 and 2008 which indicated a similar trend in agricultural groundwater consumption using data of grain output energy consumption and ghg emissions energy use intensity and ghg emission intensity were evaluated energy use intensity rapidly increased since 1996 103 99 kwh t 1 and peaked in 2003 173 42 kwh t 1 fig 6 a during 1996 2003 ghg emission intensity had similar trend with a 66 7 increase fig 6b then energy use intensity and ghg emission intensity progressively had declined the decreasing trend since 2004 was caused by rapid increase in grain production fig 3 which might be results of efficiency increase in water and energy uses from a broader planning perspective it is critical to analyze the factors underlying the falling intensities of energy use and ghg emissions in this region 3 3 spatiotemporal characteristics of energy consumption and ghg emissions in the ncp 3 3 1 spatial changes of energy consumption and ghg emissions the energy consumption and ghg emissions in the five districts referring to the parts of the plains belonging to the ncp similarly hereinafter are listed in table 3 different districts exhibited impressive differences in ghg emission rate with a range of 0 38 0 55 kg co2e m 3 because ghg emission rate reflected a mix of pump lifts and power sources diesel or electric tianjin had the highest ghg emission rate 0 55 kg co2e m 3 which coincided with the greatest pump lift 61 45 m however in shandong almost all of the pumps were electric powered which caused its ghg emission rate to increase from equal to the lowest energy use rate 0 41 kwh m 3 to the third lowest ghg emission rate 0 39 kg co2e m 3 this results indicated the importance of power source hebei was the largest contributor to ghg emissions by far responsible for 69 due to its mix of higher pump lift and the second highest intensity of agricultural groundwater consumption 3 3 2 temporal changes in energy consumption and ghg emissions rapid groundwater level declines had been taking place in each district with a corresponding increase in energy use rate and ghg emission rate over the past 18 years fig 7 a hebei and beijing had the highest rate of groundwater level declines by approximately 0 8 m yr 1 in the 2000s therefore the magnitude of changes in energy use rate in hebei and beijing were much larger than in the other three districts during 1996 2013 table 4 it was noteworthy that energy consumption and ghg emissions exhibited a reduction in beijing tianjin and shandong in the 2000s fig 7b 3 3 3 relationships among groundwater levels change pumping energy consumption and ghg emissions in a typical district in last 60 years the hebei plain had the most serious groundwater level declines and the largest ghg emissions volume from pumping irrigation table 4 during recent decades the number of active wells increased rapidly for example in 1960 there were 0 04 million wells in the hebei plain in 1980 there were 0 40 million and in 2010 there were 0 92 million which represents a 22 fold increase over the past 50 yrs over 80 of the active wells were used for agricultural irrigation in the 2000s the annual exploitation of groundwater in the hebei plain reached up to 13 6 km3 and the annual overexploitation volume reached up to 3 8 km3 the annual decline in groundwater levels was over 0 4 m in the 1970 1980s 0 6 m in the 1990s and 0 9 m in the 2000s since 1950 a significant correlation r 0 995 α 0 01 between groundwater levels and cumulative agricultural groundwater consumption in this region implied that pumping irrigation was likely a major contributor to groundwater level declines fig 8 in hebei plain groundwater levels decreased from about 20 m in 1955 to 45 m in 2013 fig 9 a while the corresponding energy use rate for pumping irrigation increased by almost more than 0 5 times from 0 37 to 0 57 kwh m 3 during 1955 2013 fig 9b time was divided as three stages during 1955 2013 by ghg emissions in hebei plain during 1955 1995 energy consumption increased slowly at a rate of 0 04 109 kwh yr 1 during 1996 2007 the average incremental rate increased about six times to 0 23 109 kwh yr 1 since 2008 energy consumption changed irregularly due to fluctuations in the volume of groundwater consumption fig 9c d although the energy use rate continued to increase 3 4 influencing factors on energy consumption and ghg emissions one objective of this study was to clarify the factors influencing energy consumption and ghg emissions results of regression analysis showed that there was a significant correlation r 0 994 α 0 01 between the cumulative groundwater consumption and groundwater levels during 1996 2013 fig 10 a this result suggested that for every 1 km3 groundwater use groundwater level would fall 0 033 m in the ncp furthermore the close correlation between energy consumption and groundwater consumption was also found r 0 805 α 0 01 to further identify the critical factors influencing groundwater consumption correlational analyses between precipitation and groundwater consumption were conducted results showed that there was a negative correlation between precipitation and groundwater consumption r 0 608 α 0 05 but not in a good linear relationship r2 0 37 fig 11 as the main replenishment sources precipitation can certainly affect the variation of groundwater consumption in a long term fig 12 table 5 in addition over time the sensitivity of groundwater consumption variation to precipitation decreased in wet year and increased in dry year the results indicated that precipitation supply function weakened when it was sufficient the relationship between agricultural groundwater consumption and crop patterns were studied grains were the main crop species in ncp the planting area of grains accounts about 70 of the total crops planting area fig 13 the proportion of grains planting area did not change a lot during the period and there is no correlation between it and groundwater consumption wheat and maize are the main grain species and they consume most water in ncp cotton is the third water consumption crop and its specific water consumption is the highest luo et al 2015 however the groundwater consumption did not correlate to the planting area of wheat or cotton there was a strong negative correlation between groundwater consumption and planting area proportion of maize r2 0 49 maize is not the least water needed crop third out of five major crops according to luo et al 2015 its increase during 2002 2013 should have not decrease the groundwater consumption therefore we assume there are some factors that affect groundwater consumption more then we chose grain economic value grain output irrigated area and percentage of water saving irrigated area as the main factors and studied the relationship between them and groundwater consumption correlational analyses showed that there was significant correlation between groundwater consumption and grain value r 0 776 α 0 01 grain output r 0 764 α 0 01 but not irrigated area r 0 141 agricultural groundwater consumption decrease as grain value and output increase fig 14 a b in fact agricultural groundwater consumption had a strong negative correlation fig 14d r2 0 64 with the percentage of water saving irrigated area the results indicated that the percentage of water saving irrigation was the critical element of groundwater consumption during 2002 2013 so the smaller increasing rate of groundwater and energy consumption could be closely related to water saving irrigation in recent years that s also why the groundwater consumption did not increase when the grain output increase strong linear relationship between them fig 15 b indicated that an average 1 more percentage of water saving irrigation area would increase 0 13 kg m 3 production efficiency of groundwater the ratio of crop production to agricultural groundwater consumption this results indicated the feasibility of water saving irrigation as a measure to maintain food production and save water 3 5 economic cost of energy consumption and ghg emissions caused by groundwater level declines in this study the total cost only included fuel and electricity costs on fixed investment repairs and maintenance were not included because these data are difficult to obtain most of the energy for pumping irrigation in the ncp came from electricity 76 and a smaller share derives from diesel power 24 to estimate the cost of diesel for pumping irrigation we referenced the energy equivalent of diesel fuel 0 064 l kwh 1 in other countries yilmaz et al 2005 the cost reported were adopted and converted into us using annual exchange rates as shown in table 6 for unit groundwater consumption cost increased from 0 018 us m 3 from 0 030 us m 3 for electricity use and from 0 010 us m 3 to 0 025 us m 3 for diesel use during 2006 2013 on the whole the cost of energy consumption for pumping irrigation had nearly doubled within seven years the high cost rendered irrigation unaffordable for the farmer in addition it was shown that diesel pump is less efficient than electric pump in 2013 unit energy cost of electric pump was 0 09 us kwh 1 while it was 0 12 us kwh 1 1 42 us l 1 for diesel in addition diesel price rose faster than electricity price during 2006 2013 the price of electricity and diesel increased respectively by 52 5 and 136 7 to reduce cost more electric pump should be used to replace the diesel pump in the ncp furthermore we analyzed its ghg emission cost price in the national emissions trading scheme ets was 12 22 eur 14 67 us per tonne by the end of 2011 the 2015 china carbon pricing survey released by the china carbon forum showed that the prices were expected to be us 6 29 11 67 per tonne of co2 emitted during 2017 2025 based on the above understanding this study assumed a marginal carbon abatement cost was us 10 per tonne accordingly the abatement cost of ghg emissions from groundwater pumping 8 72 mt co2e was us 0 087 billion in 2013 4 discussion as cumulative groundwater consumption increases during past decades the groundwater levels have declined in north china plain dramatically fig 9a for every 1 km3 groundwater consumption groundwater level would fall 0 033 m in the ncp during 1996 2013 groundwater level here declined from 25 62 m to 35 94 m moreover in recent years groundwater levels showed accelerating declines the decline rate was 0 34 m yr 1 in the 1990s and almost doubled to 0 64 m yr 1 in the 2000s declined groundwater levels makes the pumping irrigation more energy intensive and emitting more ghgs 4 1 increasing energy consumption and cost caused by groundwater level declines there was a significant positive linear relationship between energy consumption and groundwater levels in ncp eq 3 more energy was required for pumping from lower groundwater the energy needed to pump 1 m3 water increased from 0 5040 kwh in 1996 to 0 6088 kwh in 2013 the total energy consumption in the whole ncp also increased from 7 72 109 kwh to 10 93 109 kwh simultaneously increasing energy consumption led to the increasing energy cost within the seven years 2006 2013 pumping cost increased straightly and nearly doubled until 2013 the farmer must pay us 0 055 for 1 km3 groundwater consumption from the point of the total cost it was as much as us 1 15 billion in 2013 in the ncp reaching up to 9 6 of the local gdp on the other hand farmers are still deepening their wells to maintain their cropland under irrigation if the groundwater levels continue decreasing the cost of pumping irrigation would be quite a burden for farmers in the future increased cost of irrigation is negatively affecting farmers incomes bhuyan 2004 pimentel et al 2002 cost increasing can make farmers difficult to decide whether to plant high yield grain crops or plant high value economic crops which would in turn affect the food security the cost of electric pump is always higher than diesel pump during our study period it was 0 030 us m 3 for electricity use and 0 025 us m 3 for diesel in 2013 however it is because the groundwater levels were lower in electric pump used areas than diesel pump used areas to reduce cost more electric pump should be used to replace the diesel pump in this region according to our study in 2013 unit energy cost of electric pump was 0 09 us kwh 1 while it was 0 12 us kwh 1 1 42 us l 1 for diesel in addition diesel price rose faster than electricity price this was especially true in hebei plain the largest energy consumer in the ncp where almost all of the energy consumption for pumping irrigation came from diesel there was huge potential to reduce economic cost through changing the energy structure other studies also indicate that economic cost of pumping irrigation is notable and should be paid attention to unit pumping cost usually ranges between 0 01 us and 0 20 us depending on different pump lifts llamas and martínezsantos 2005 in turkey the irrigation area relies completely on groundwater resources the irrigation cost of electricity not limited to pumping is found to be 744 64 us ha 1 topak et al 2009 according to a field survey in north china the farmer need to pay a flat rate of 55 us ha 1 including equipment cost for irrigation in henan and 125 150 us ha 1 in hebei yang et al 2003 in the us agriculture is the largest business consumer of both electricity and water using most of the direct energy to pump groundwater at an annual cost of almost us 1 2 billion rothausen and conway 2011 4 2 increasing ghg emissions from pumping irrigation increasing energy consumption led to increasing ghg emissions during 1996 2013 ghg emission rates increased from 0 40 kgco2e m 3 to 0 49 kgco2e m 3 ghg emission rate increased annually by 1 5 10 3 kgco2e m 3 yr 1 in the 1990s and 5 3 10 4 kgco2e m 3 in the 2000s in contrast groundwater consumption for agriculture was no longer increased fig 4 this result suggested that in recent years same groundwater exploitation could lead to more serious declines and ghg emissions than in previous years groundwater was probably stored in funnel shaped space in the future the ncp need to pay more to protect groundwater resources and reduce ghg emissions groundwater declines were not uniformly distributed throughout the ncp and ghg emission rate exhibited impressive differences in 2013 the estimate of ghg emission rate ranged from 0 38 kg co2e m 3 in beijing to 0 55 kg co2e m 3 in tianjin it had relation with diverse groundwater levels with more serious groundwater declines in hebei and beijing during 1996 2013 increase in ghg emission rate in these two districts was higher hebei has the largest ghg emissions due to the largest agricultural groundwater consumption these results from this study are similar the estimates for north china wang et al 2012a b which suggests that tianjin has the highest ghg emission rate and hebei is the largest contributor to ghg emissions in the ncp in different regions ghg emission rates from groundwater pumping showed significant difference mainly because of diverse water depth when estimating economic cost of pumping irrigation emission mitigation cost should be considered the cost of emissions mitigation from pumping irrigation 8 72 mt co2e was us 0 087 billion in 2013 in this region reaching up to 0 7 of the local gdp according to the paris agreement climate change conference 2015 china should reduce ghg emissions at an annual rate of 4 until 2030 agriculture including irrigation has been proposed as a relatively cheap source of net emission reductions west and marland 2002 therefore it was necessary and urgent to reduce ghg emissions from groundwater pumping in fact there is growing interest on policy options to reduce agricultural ghg emissions barker et al 2009 however reduction cost could be high because of large emissions declining groundwater levels are a matter of concern not only on water resources but also on increased energy consumption and ghg emissions energy use and ghg emission rates for groundwater pumping have almost doubled which have coincided with serious groundwater levels declines over the past 50 yr li et al 2013 there has been similar effects in other regions in india pumping lifts become higher for pumping per unit of groundwater energy consumption and ghg emissions become hardly prohibitive kumar 2005 in california agriculture uses 85 of the withdrawn groundwater 15 4 km3 and 90 of all electricity used on farms is consumed in pumping groundwater for irrigation cohen et al 2004 electricity used for pumping groundwater in california would average 2 25 billion kwh the equivalent of 0 1370 kgco2e m 3 with lower pump lifts 36 m and higher pumping efficiency 70 ghg emission rate is smaller in california than the ncp in iran average extracting 1 m3 groundwater requires 0 826 kwh of energy and 0 1 kgco2e karimi et al 2012 more than 70 of the total groundwater extraction in iran is from deep wells with an average depth of 90 m therefore groundwater exploitation in iran is significantly more energy intensive than that in the ncp and emits more ghg extensive studies have been carried out on the effect of groundwater irrigation on total emissions from the whole agriculture carbon footprint of the grain output is estimated in the ncp and the results indicated that the main components of carbon footprint were electricity for irrigation 30 25 wang et al 2015 zou et al 2013 suggested that groundwater pumping is responsible for 30 49 42 68 of total emissions from energy activities in the agriculture sector in china 4 3 importance of water saving irrigation although grain output had increased steadily in recent years groundwater and energy consumption for agriculture didn t have the corresponding increase actually it was mainly because water saving irrigation improve water use efficiency water productivity the ratio of yield to the volume of supplied groundwater is one of the key indicators of water use efficiency during 2004 2013 the percentage of water saving irrigation area increased by 12 9 correspondingly water productivity increased from 3 3 kg m 3 to 5 2 kg m 3 other studies also confirm that water saving irrigation is one of the most effective ways to reduce water use without loss of grain output belder et al 2004 zhang et al 2013a b c zou et al 2013 main measures to water saving irrigation are irrigation management and irrigation technologies water productivity in terms of irrigation water is about 5 35 higher under alternate wetting and drying a water saving irrigation practice than in continuous flooding moya et al 2001 the application of pressurized systems could reduce water consumption by 10 66 and water use efficiency is also enhanced without reduction in grain yield jackson et al 2010 without loss of yield experimental trials have shown that the water saving potentials of several high capacity irrigation technologies exceed 90 abdulai et al 2005 however in the ncp over half of the irrigated area employed traditional irrigation techniques which caused waste of water and energy resources this was in marked contrast to the situation in advanced countries in the field of irrigation techniques in israel almost all of irrigation areas are under water saving irrigation and the efficiency keeps on improving moreover the actual irrigation water use reached up to 1 5 times more than the grain water requirement in the ncp wang et al 2002 the overall water use efficiency of grain production in the ncp has fallen behind the world average due to poor irrigation management practices and lack of investment in infrastructure blanke et al 2007 this implies that there is a tremendous opportunity for saving groundwater and energy consumption in the ncp by developing water saving irrigation by significantly reducing the amount of water that needs to be pumped energy consumption and ghg emissions are also reduced in most cases the application of pressurized systems could reduce energy consumption by 12 44 jackson et al 2010 a study from the usa lal 2004 indicates that the emissions from drip irrigation 216 kg co2e are far less than furrow irrigation 395 kg co2e in 11 surveyed provinces in china low pressure pipeline irrigation can save 6 48 109 kwh yr 1 energy and reduce ghg emissions by 6 72 mt yr 1 zhang et al 2013a b c renewable energy would be an effective way to reduce energy consumption solar photovoltaic water pumping system has been widely studied and applied chandel et al 2015 it requires no fuel cost and is environmentally friendly most parts of ncp are rich in solar energy according to national energy administration however if groundwater levels keep decreasing more photovoltaic water pumping systems are still needed therefore energy saving technologies will work better in combination with water saving technologies now water saving irrigation practices have been one of the china s basic national policies however there are some factors restricting the development of water saving irrigation compared to traditional irrigation water saving irrigation systems need more funding li et al 2003 wang 2010 yao et al 2005 there is a higher workload associated with the control and maintenance of equipment wang and gao 2001 wang and wu 2006 overcoming these barriers would require finance technology and capacity building supports therefore policy makers need to contribute the majority of financial investments to reduce the adverse effects of water scarcity and encourage energy saving besides a reasonable adjustment of water price maybe make water saving irrigation cost less than traditional irrigation subsidy is another way to promote water saving irrigation 5 conclusion over exploitation of groundwater has caused severe groundwater declines in ncp at a rate of 0 6 m yr 1 this trend becomes faster in recent years due to declines in groundwater levels groundwater pumping for irrigation becomes increasingly energy intensive and emits more ghgs within the last 18 years energy use rate of unit water pumping increased from 0 5040 kwh m 3 to 0 6088 kwh m 3 by nearly 22 total ghg emissions have increased from 6 16 to 8 72 mt co2e by 42 hebei suffers the most serious groundwater declines and emits the largest ghg from pumping accounting for 47 of the total emissions in the ncp energy cost of pumping irrigation is notable us 1 15 billion because of a large amount of energy consumption to reduce cost more electric pumps should be used to replace diesel pumps in this region in addition the cost of cutting emissions from pumping irrigation 8 72 mt co2e was us 0 087 billion in 2013 in consideration of energy consumption and emission reduction the total economic cost is us 1 25 billion reaching up to 10 3 of gdp the increasing cost is a great threat to sustainable development of agriculture water saving irrigation is an effective way to reduce water and energy consumption without loss of grain output an average 1 of water saving irrigation area would increase 0 13 kg m 3 water productivity during 2002 2013 water productivity increased from 3 3 kg m 3 to 5 2 kg m 3 as the percentage of water saving irrigated area increased 12 9 to reduce ghg emissions and pressures on energy and groundwater resources water saving irrigation should be greatly promoted in the ncp however there are some factors restricting the development of water saving

11474,agriculture consumes a huge amount of energy every year and then emits lots of greenhouse gases ghg reduction of agricultural energy consumption is important to sustainable agriculture and mitigation of climate change groundwater is the main irrigation source in north china s main food production plains north china plain ncp many studies have shown that the groundwater levels here have declined a lot during past decades however the related environmental and economic impacts have been rarely researched this study carries out a detailed research on the changes in energy cost and ghg emissions caused by groundwater level declines on the ncp results indicate that during 1996 2013 total agricultural groundwater consumption here has increased by 20 over exploitation of groundwater has caused severe groundwater declines 0 6 m yr 1 and the decline rate has become faster in recent years as a result energy use rate for pumping unit water has increased from 0 50 to 0 61 kwh m 3 by nearly 22 therefore ghg emissions have increased from 6 16 to 8 72 mt co2e by 42 hebei suffers the most serious groundwater level declines and emits most ghg from pumping accounting for 47 of the total emissions in the ncp the economic cost of energy consumption and emission reduction for pumping irrigation is us 1 25 billion in 2013 reaching up to 10 3 of gdp in this region the increasing cost is a great threat to sustainable development of agriculture water saving irrigation is one of the most effective ways to reduce water and energy consumption without loss of grain output to reduce ghg emissions and pressures on energy and groundwater resources water saving irrigation should be greatly promoted in this region the study would contribute to the development of water saving and energy saving agriculture keywords energy consumption ghg emissions pumping irrigation north china plain 1 introduction climate change caused by increasing energy consumption and ghg emissions has become a common concern of the international community the paris agreement fully embodies global change as not only significant for the interests and development of each country but to the whole world in the past six decades energy consumption patterns in agriculture have changed enormously cleveland 1995 leach 1976 today the agriculture sector is one of main contributors to energy consumption and ghg emissions barker et al 2009 devi et al 2009 each year agriculture emits 10 12 of the total estimated ghg emissions 5 1 6 1 103 mt co2e yr 1 niggli et al 2009 studies of the direct energy use of on farm operations suggest that groundwater pumping for irrigation is one of the highest energy consumption processes lal 2004 mushtaq et al 2009 singh et al 2003 this issue is especially severe in china because of its agriculture depending largely on the groundwater pumping irrigation china is the world s largest emitter of ghgs and its ghg emissions have drawn widespread attention both domestically and internationally as a signatory to the paris agreement china has committed to reducing ghg emissions per unit of gdp by 2030 to a level that is 60 65 lower than the amount emitted in 2005 the national ghg emissions are estimated to reach a peak in approximately 2030 meanwhile as the world s second largest irrigator ghg emissions from agriculture are responsible for 17 20 of the nation s total annual emissions wang et al 2010 which is almost doubled from the world average level the north china plain ncp is one of the most important agricultural regions in china providing about 20 of china s total grain productionproviding about 20 of china s total grain production yuan and shen 2013 however the ncp is also one of the areas with the greatest water shortages in china to offset the water deficit the high crop productivity in the ncp depends largely on groundwater irrigation zhang et al 2004 in the ncp approximately 70 of the pumped groundwater is consumed for agricultural irrigation and over 87 is consumed in the piedmont regions hu et al 2010 zhang 2004 sustainable development is greatly challenged by groundwater over exploitation which is approximately 4 4 5 km3 yr 1 in this region bu et al 2008 the severe overexploitation of groundwater results in a quickly declining groundwater levels together with environmental degradation and has therefore attracted many research attentions feng et al 2013 jia and liu 2002 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2002 many studies have recently focused on sustainable groundwater supplies and food security bu et al 2008 cao et al 2013 chen et al 2007 du et al 2014 foster and garduño 2004 zhang 2004 however the research into energy consumption and ghg emissions from pumping irrigation is less this paper presents a quantitative estimate of the change of energy consumption and ghg emissions from groundwater irrigation in the ncp the specific objectives of this paper are as follows a to estimate the related cost of pumping irrigation including energy consumption and ghgs reduction costs b to investigate the changes in energy consumption and ghg emissions caused from groundwater level declines c to analyze the factors influencing fluctuations in groundwater and energy consumption and d to clarify the importance of water saving irrigation 2 data and methods 2 1 site description the north china plain ncp is also referred to as the huang huai hai plain from the viewpoint of water resource management and economic importance a narrower definition of the ncp is more commonly used it is the region bordered on the north by the yan mountains on the west by the taihang mountains to the south by the yellow river and to the east by the bohai gulf it is located in the eastern coastal region of china between 34 46 40 25 n latitude and 112 30 119 30 e longitude fig 1 the total area of this narrowly defined ncp is 1 39 105 km2 with a population of approximately 111 million because of the monsoon influence rainfall is highly variable the mean annual average precipitation is 550 650 mm 80 of which occurs from june to september the annual pan evaporation is approximately 1000 1500 mm the proportion of evaporation from april to june to that of the full year is approximately 45 the ncp contains 9 of china s population and 11 of its arable land and produces 10 of the nation s gross domestic agricultural products currently 71 of its cultivated land is irrigated with an irrigated area of 7 5 mha 2 2 data sources the average annual precipitation and temperature 1996 2013 were obtained from the meteorological bureau data on agricultural development 1996 2013 including grain output grain value and grain planting area were obtained from the ministry of agriculture crop pattern data 1996 2013 were from national bureau of statistics data on water consumption for agriculture 1996 2013 were collected from the water resources bulletin irrigation data 1996 2013 including the total irrigated area 1996 2013 and water saving irrigated area 2004 2013 were collected from the national bureau of statistics average groundwater levels 1996 2013 were calculated based on data from china s ground water information center 195 observation wells selected in the ncp of which 29 were in beijing municipality 21 in tianjin municipality 81 in hebei province 26 in henan province and 38 in shandong province data on the number of wells 1960s 2011 were acquired from water resources yearbook data on groundwater exploitation 1996 2013 were collected from the water resources bulletin electricity prices 2006 2013 in different districts were obtained from the annual report on electricity regulation data on groundwater levels and shallow groundwater extraction for 880 observational wells in the hebei plain were collected from the hebei department of water conservation 1950s 2013 table 1 2 3 estimation of pumping lifts there are no valid statistics on groundwater pumping lifts in the ncp pump lifts y were estimated by using the groundwater levels x based on data taken from 366 surveyed villages in northern china wang et al 2012a b the linear regression is shown in eq 1 and its coefficient of determination is r2 0 62 1 y 0 906x 21 75 in this study the average groundwater levels were calculated using data from china s groundwater information center based on 195 observation wells to verify the accuracy of the calculation we compared our data with the groundwater bulletin for a particular area the results indicated that there was a well consistency based on the above data for groundwater levels 1996 2013 the groundwater pumping lifts were estimated 2 4 estimation of agricultural groundwater consumption detailed and comprehensive information on actual groundwater consumption for irrigation are unavailable the most appropriate data are the provincial level statistics of total agricultural water consumption reported in the water resources bulletin we assume that the water consumption per unit area is similar across all the irrigated area regardless of the water source therefore the proportion of total agricultural water derived from groundwater was estimated by the percentages of groundwater irrigated land relative to the total irrigated land eq 2 2 groundwater consumption total water consumtion groundwater irrigated land the percentages were obtained from a national monitoring station administered by the ministry of agriculture from interviews with officials in the water resources bureaus and from further generalizations in the published literature huang et al 2009 wang et al 2012a b xu 2003 zhang et al 2007 2 5 estimation of energy use rate the energy use rate of irrigated land varies with the depth of groundwater being pumped irrigation system and the water requirements of grain for the calculation of energy consumption in pumping processes three methods are assessed karimi et al 2012 lin 1984 rothausen and conway 2011 here we focused on energy consumption in the extraction of groundwater on the basis of irrigation conditions in the ncp and on data availability the method of lin 1984 was chosen for the following calculation eq 3 3 energy use rate 9 8 lift 3 6 10 6 efficiency where the unit is in kwh m 3 for energy use rate and percent for efficiency respectively energy consumption was calculated by first identifying the types of energy sources used agricultural machines in the ncp mainly included electric motors and diesel engines this study assumed that the proportion of electric and diesel pumps were 76 and 24 in beijing and tianjin 10 and 90 in hebei 67 and 33 in henan 100 and 0 in shandong respectively wang et al 2012a b with a 100 efficient process the energy needed to lift 1 km3 of water up 1 m is 2 72 106 kwh however efficiency losses in pumping are likely to make the conversion from actual to theoretical pump efficiency achieve 40 or lower levels given a lack of detailed information on pumping efficiency of the individual pumps we selected commonly used efficiency values of 15 and 40 for diesel and electric pumps respectively in northern china according to wang et al 2012a b once groundwater is pumped to the surface further losses will occur in both the transmission and distribution t d processes this is particularly the case for electricity where losses can be considerable shah et al 2009 the t d of energy losses are believed to range from 10 to 19 in china sun 2006 we adopted a mid range value of 14 5 for t d efficiency losses 2 6 estimation of ghg emission rate ghg emissions from groundwater irrigation were determined by estimating co2 emissions due to energy consumed for pumping irrigation direct and indirect emissions of ghgs such as ch4 and n2o are not strongly associated with energy consumption here we focused on co2 emissions from energy consumption the united kingdom department of environment food and rural affairs department of energy and climate change established ghg conversion factors for diesel and electricity produced that are 0 32021 kg co2e kwh 1 and 0 94773 kg co2e kwh 1 in china wang et al 2012a b this study used these figures and a revised equation eq 4 from wang et al 2012a b to calculate the average ghg emissions rate kg co2e m 3 based on a combination of power sources for pumps in the ncp as follows fig 2 4 ghg emission rate energy use rate electric 0 95 energy use rate diesal 0 32 where the unit is kg co2e m 3 for the ghg emission rate and kwh m 3 is the energy use rate respectively 3 results 3 1 changes in groundwater levels and agricultural groundwater consumption during 1996 2013 3 1 1 agricultural groundwater consumption during 2003 2013 the ncp experienced a substantial increase by nearly 45 in grain output fig 3 the average increment rate was 2 8 mt yr 1 which was coincided with growth of grain planting area higher planting area resulted in an increase in irrigated area during 1996 2013 irrigated area in this region increased from 8 99 mha to 9 45 mha at a rate of 0 03 mha yr 1 area under water saving irrigation techniques increased by roughly 30 from 3 85 mha in 2004 to 4 99 mha in 2013 the proportion of water saving irrigated area to the total correspondingly increased a total of 67 of the water supply from surface runoff and groundwater had been used for irrigation in the ncp irrigation accounts for over 70 of the total groundwater withdrawn over the last 15 years two obvious periods of agricultural groundwater consumption in the ncp could be seen it was 15 33 km3 in 1996 and reached a maximum of 19 84 km3 in 2002 an increase of 0 75 km3 yr 1 fig 4 since 2003 agricultural groundwater use appeared a decreasing trend with two significant drops in 2004 and 2008 the distinct increase of precipitation in 2004 and 2008 data not shown may play an important role in these significant drops 3 1 2 groundwater level declines with the expansion of groundwater irrigation the number of motor pumped wells sharply increased from 1 8 thousand in the 1960s to 0 83 million in the early 2000s the density of pumped wells had reached more than 20 per km2 in the early 2000s in the 2000s the groundwater exploitation rate the ratio of groundwater withdrawals to groundwater recharge in many parts of the ncp exceeded 100 and in some areas the ratio exceeded 150 liu et al 2010 persistent groundwater overexploitation in the ncp had resulted in increasingly serious water level declines groundwater levels represented as positive values similarly hereinafter dropped from 25 62 m in 1996 to 35 94 m in 2013 declining at a rate of 0 61 m yr 1 fig 5 in intensively groundwater irrigated districts the groundwater levels declined at a rate faster than 1 m yr 1 3 2 changes in energy consumption and ghg emissions from pumping irrigation in the ncp due to groundwater level declines pumping became increasingly energy intensive and emitted more ghgs as shown in table 2 data about pump lifts agricultural groundwater consumption energy use rate and energy consumption were used to establish energy consumption and ghg emissions during 1996 2013 the pump lifts increased by 21 which coincided with groundwater level declines by 10 32 m the energy use rate for pumping irrigation increased continuously from 0 50 kwh m 3 to 0 61 kwh m 3 by nearly 22 during 1996 2013 in addition agricultural groundwater consumption increased by 20 during this period the ghg emissions in 2013 were 8 72 mt co2e it was almost 1 5 times that of 1996 6 16 mt co2e there was a temporary decrease in ghg emissions in 2004 and 2008 which indicated a similar trend in agricultural groundwater consumption using data of grain output energy consumption and ghg emissions energy use intensity and ghg emission intensity were evaluated energy use intensity rapidly increased since 1996 103 99 kwh t 1 and peaked in 2003 173 42 kwh t 1 fig 6 a during 1996 2003 ghg emission intensity had similar trend with a 66 7 increase fig 6b then energy use intensity and ghg emission intensity progressively had declined the decreasing trend since 2004 was caused by rapid increase in grain production fig 3 which might be results of efficiency increase in water and energy uses from a broader planning perspective it is critical to analyze the factors underlying the falling intensities of energy use and ghg emissions in this region 3 3 spatiotemporal characteristics of energy consumption and ghg emissions in the ncp 3 3 1 spatial changes of energy consumption and ghg emissions the energy consumption and ghg emissions in the five districts referring to the parts of the plains belonging to the ncp similarly hereinafter are listed in table 3 different districts exhibited impressive differences in ghg emission rate with a range of 0 38 0 55 kg co2e m 3 because ghg emission rate reflected a mix of pump lifts and power sources diesel or electric tianjin had the highest ghg emission rate 0 55 kg co2e m 3 which coincided with the greatest pump lift 61 45 m however in shandong almost all of the pumps were electric powered which caused its ghg emission rate to increase from equal to the lowest energy use rate 0 41 kwh m 3 to the third lowest ghg emission rate 0 39 kg co2e m 3 this results indicated the importance of power source hebei was the largest contributor to ghg emissions by far responsible for 69 due to its mix of higher pump lift and the second highest intensity of agricultural groundwater consumption 3 3 2 temporal changes in energy consumption and ghg emissions rapid groundwater level declines had been taking place in each district with a corresponding increase in energy use rate and ghg emission rate over the past 18 years fig 7 a hebei and beijing had the highest rate of groundwater level declines by approximately 0 8 m yr 1 in the 2000s therefore the magnitude of changes in energy use rate in hebei and beijing were much larger than in the other three districts during 1996 2013 table 4 it was noteworthy that energy consumption and ghg emissions exhibited a reduction in beijing tianjin and shandong in the 2000s fig 7b 3 3 3 relationships among groundwater levels change pumping energy consumption and ghg emissions in a typical district in last 60 years the hebei plain had the most serious groundwater level declines and the largest ghg emissions volume from pumping irrigation table 4 during recent decades the number of active wells increased rapidly for example in 1960 there were 0 04 million wells in the hebei plain in 1980 there were 0 40 million and in 2010 there were 0 92 million which represents a 22 fold increase over the past 50 yrs over 80 of the active wells were used for agricultural irrigation in the 2000s the annual exploitation of groundwater in the hebei plain reached up to 13 6 km3 and the annual overexploitation volume reached up to 3 8 km3 the annual decline in groundwater levels was over 0 4 m in the 1970 1980s 0 6 m in the 1990s and 0 9 m in the 2000s since 1950 a significant correlation r 0 995 α 0 01 between groundwater levels and cumulative agricultural groundwater consumption in this region implied that pumping irrigation was likely a major contributor to groundwater level declines fig 8 in hebei plain groundwater levels decreased from about 20 m in 1955 to 45 m in 2013 fig 9 a while the corresponding energy use rate for pumping irrigation increased by almost more than 0 5 times from 0 37 to 0 57 kwh m 3 during 1955 2013 fig 9b time was divided as three stages during 1955 2013 by ghg emissions in hebei plain during 1955 1995 energy consumption increased slowly at a rate of 0 04 109 kwh yr 1 during 1996 2007 the average incremental rate increased about six times to 0 23 109 kwh yr 1 since 2008 energy consumption changed irregularly due to fluctuations in the volume of groundwater consumption fig 9c d although the energy use rate continued to increase 3 4 influencing factors on energy consumption and ghg emissions one objective of this study was to clarify the factors influencing energy consumption and ghg emissions results of regression analysis showed that there was a significant correlation r 0 994 α 0 01 between the cumulative groundwater consumption and groundwater levels during 1996 2013 fig 10 a this result suggested that for every 1 km3 groundwater use groundwater level would fall 0 033 m in the ncp furthermore the close correlation between energy consumption and groundwater consumption was also found r 0 805 α 0 01 to further identify the critical factors influencing groundwater consumption correlational analyses between precipitation and groundwater consumption were conducted results showed that there was a negative correlation between precipitation and groundwater consumption r 0 608 α 0 05 but not in a good linear relationship r2 0 37 fig 11 as the main replenishment sources precipitation can certainly affect the variation of groundwater consumption in a long term fig 12 table 5 in addition over time the sensitivity of groundwater consumption variation to precipitation decreased in wet year and increased in dry year the results indicated that precipitation supply function weakened when it was sufficient the relationship between agricultural groundwater consumption and crop patterns were studied grains were the main crop species in ncp the planting area of grains accounts about 70 of the total crops planting area fig 13 the proportion of grains planting area did not change a lot during the period and there is no correlation between it and groundwater consumption wheat and maize are the main grain species and they consume most water in ncp cotton is the third water consumption crop and its specific water consumption is the highest luo et al 2015 however the groundwater consumption did not correlate to the planting area of wheat or cotton there was a strong negative correlation between groundwater consumption and planting area proportion of maize r2 0 49 maize is not the least water needed crop third out of five major crops according to luo et al 2015 its increase during 2002 2013 should have not decrease the groundwater consumption therefore we assume there are some factors that affect groundwater consumption more then we chose grain economic value grain output irrigated area and percentage of water saving irrigated area as the main factors and studied the relationship between them and groundwater consumption correlational analyses showed that there was significant correlation between groundwater consumption and grain value r 0 776 α 0 01 grain output r 0 764 α 0 01 but not irrigated area r 0 141 agricultural groundwater consumption decrease as grain value and output increase fig 14 a b in fact agricultural groundwater consumption had a strong negative correlation fig 14d r2 0 64 with the percentage of water saving irrigated area the results indicated that the percentage of water saving irrigation was the critical element of groundwater consumption during 2002 2013 so the smaller increasing rate of groundwater and energy consumption could be closely related to water saving irrigation in recent years that s also why the groundwater consumption did not increase when the grain output increase strong linear relationship between them fig 15 b indicated that an average 1 more percentage of water saving irrigation area would increase 0 13 kg m 3 production efficiency of groundwater the ratio of crop production to agricultural groundwater consumption this results indicated the feasibility of water saving irrigation as a measure to maintain food production and save water 3 5 economic cost of energy consumption and ghg emissions caused by groundwater level declines in this study the total cost only included fuel and electricity costs on fixed investment repairs and maintenance were not included because these data are difficult to obtain most of the energy for pumping irrigation in the ncp came from electricity 76 and a smaller share derives from diesel power 24 to estimate the cost of diesel for pumping irrigation we referenced the energy equivalent of diesel fuel 0 064 l kwh 1 in other countries yilmaz et al 2005 the cost reported were adopted and converted into us using annual exchange rates as shown in table 6 for unit groundwater consumption cost increased from 0 018 us m 3 from 0 030 us m 3 for electricity use and from 0 010 us m 3 to 0 025 us m 3 for diesel use during 2006 2013 on the whole the cost of energy consumption for pumping irrigation had nearly doubled within seven years the high cost rendered irrigation unaffordable for the farmer in addition it was shown that diesel pump is less efficient than electric pump in 2013 unit energy cost of electric pump was 0 09 us kwh 1 while it was 0 12 us kwh 1 1 42 us l 1 for diesel in addition diesel price rose faster than electricity price during 2006 2013 the price of electricity and diesel increased respectively by 52 5 and 136 7 to reduce cost more electric pump should be used to replace the diesel pump in the ncp furthermore we analyzed its ghg emission cost price in the national emissions trading scheme ets was 12 22 eur 14 67 us per tonne by the end of 2011 the 2015 china carbon pricing survey released by the china carbon forum showed that the prices were expected to be us 6 29 11 67 per tonne of co2 emitted during 2017 2025 based on the above understanding this study assumed a marginal carbon abatement cost was us 10 per tonne accordingly the abatement cost of ghg emissions from groundwater pumping 8 72 mt co2e was us 0 087 billion in 2013 4 discussion as cumulative groundwater consumption increases during past decades the groundwater levels have declined in north china plain dramatically fig 9a for every 1 km3 groundwater consumption groundwater level would fall 0 033 m in the ncp during 1996 2013 groundwater level here declined from 25 62 m to 35 94 m moreover in recent years groundwater levels showed accelerating declines the decline rate was 0 34 m yr 1 in the 1990s and almost doubled to 0 64 m yr 1 in the 2000s declined groundwater levels makes the pumping irrigation more energy intensive and emitting more ghgs 4 1 increasing energy consumption and cost caused by groundwater level declines there was a significant positive linear relationship between energy consumption and groundwater levels in ncp eq 3 more energy was required for pumping from lower groundwater the energy needed to pump 1 m3 water increased from 0 5040 kwh in 1996 to 0 6088 kwh in 2013 the total energy consumption in the whole ncp also increased from 7 72 109 kwh to 10 93 109 kwh simultaneously increasing energy consumption led to the increasing energy cost within the seven years 2006 2013 pumping cost increased straightly and nearly doubled until 2013 the farmer must pay us 0 055 for 1 km3 groundwater consumption from the point of the total cost it was as much as us 1 15 billion in 2013 in the ncp reaching up to 9 6 of the local gdp on the other hand farmers are still deepening their wells to maintain their cropland under irrigation if the groundwater levels continue decreasing the cost of pumping irrigation would be quite a burden for farmers in the future increased cost of irrigation is negatively affecting farmers incomes bhuyan 2004 pimentel et al 2002 cost increasing can make farmers difficult to decide whether to plant high yield grain crops or plant high value economic crops which would in turn affect the food security the cost of electric pump is always higher than diesel pump during our study period it was 0 030 us m 3 for electricity use and 0 025 us m 3 for diesel in 2013 however it is because the groundwater levels were lower in electric pump used areas than diesel pump used areas to reduce cost more electric pump should be used to replace the diesel pump in this region according to our study in 2013 unit energy cost of electric pump was 0 09 us kwh 1 while it was 0 12 us kwh 1 1 42 us l 1 for diesel in addition diesel price rose faster than electricity price this was especially true in hebei plain the largest energy consumer in the ncp where almost all of the energy consumption for pumping irrigation came from diesel there was huge potential to reduce economic cost through changing the energy structure other studies also indicate that economic cost of pumping irrigation is notable and should be paid attention to unit pumping cost usually ranges between 0 01 us and 0 20 us depending on different pump lifts llamas and martínezsantos 2005 in turkey the irrigation area relies completely on groundwater resources the irrigation cost of electricity not limited to pumping is found to be 744 64 us ha 1 topak et al 2009 according to a field survey in north china the farmer need to pay a flat rate of 55 us ha 1 including equipment cost for irrigation in henan and 125 150 us ha 1 in hebei yang et al 2003 in the us agriculture is the largest business consumer of both electricity and water using most of the direct energy to pump groundwater at an annual cost of almost us 1 2 billion rothausen and conway 2011 4 2 increasing ghg emissions from pumping irrigation increasing energy consumption led to increasing ghg emissions during 1996 2013 ghg emission rates increased from 0 40 kgco2e m 3 to 0 49 kgco2e m 3 ghg emission rate increased annually by 1 5 10 3 kgco2e m 3 yr 1 in the 1990s and 5 3 10 4 kgco2e m 3 in the 2000s in contrast groundwater consumption for agriculture was no longer increased fig 4 this result suggested that in recent years same groundwater exploitation could lead to more serious declines and ghg emissions than in previous years groundwater was probably stored in funnel shaped space in the future the ncp need to pay more to protect groundwater resources and reduce ghg emissions groundwater declines were not uniformly distributed throughout the ncp and ghg emission rate exhibited impressive differences in 2013 the estimate of ghg emission rate ranged from 0 38 kg co2e m 3 in beijing to 0 55 kg co2e m 3 in tianjin it had relation with diverse groundwater levels with more serious groundwater declines in hebei and beijing during 1996 2013 increase in ghg emission rate in these two districts was higher hebei has the largest ghg emissions due to the largest agricultural groundwater consumption these results from this study are similar the estimates for north china wang et al 2012a b which suggests that tianjin has the highest ghg emission rate and hebei is the largest contributor to ghg emissions in the ncp in different regions ghg emission rates from groundwater pumping showed significant difference mainly because of diverse water depth when estimating economic cost of pumping irrigation emission mitigation cost should be considered the cost of emissions mitigation from pumping irrigation 8 72 mt co2e was us 0 087 billion in 2013 in this region reaching up to 0 7 of the local gdp according to the paris agreement climate change conference 2015 china should reduce ghg emissions at an annual rate of 4 until 2030 agriculture including irrigation has been proposed as a relatively cheap source of net emission reductions west and marland 2002 therefore it was necessary and urgent to reduce ghg emissions from groundwater pumping in fact there is growing interest on policy options to reduce agricultural ghg emissions barker et al 2009 however reduction cost could be high because of large emissions declining groundwater levels are a matter of concern not only on water resources but also on increased energy consumption and ghg emissions energy use and ghg emission rates for groundwater pumping have almost doubled which have coincided with serious groundwater levels declines over the past 50 yr li et al 2013 there has been similar effects in other regions in india pumping lifts become higher for pumping per unit of groundwater energy consumption and ghg emissions become hardly prohibitive kumar 2005 in california agriculture uses 85 of the withdrawn groundwater 15 4 km3 and 90 of all electricity used on farms is consumed in pumping groundwater for irrigation cohen et al 2004 electricity used for pumping groundwater in california would average 2 25 billion kwh the equivalent of 0 1370 kgco2e m 3 with lower pump lifts 36 m and higher pumping efficiency 70 ghg emission rate is smaller in california than the ncp in iran average extracting 1 m3 groundwater requires 0 826 kwh of energy and 0 1 kgco2e karimi et al 2012 more than 70 of the total groundwater extraction in iran is from deep wells with an average depth of 90 m therefore groundwater exploitation in iran is significantly more energy intensive than that in the ncp and emits more ghg extensive studies have been carried out on the effect of groundwater irrigation on total emissions from the whole agriculture carbon footprint of the grain output is estimated in the ncp and the results indicated that the main components of carbon footprint were electricity for irrigation 30 25 wang et al 2015 zou et al 2013 suggested that groundwater pumping is responsible for 30 49 42 68 of total emissions from energy activities in the agriculture sector in china 4 3 importance of water saving irrigation although grain output had increased steadily in recent years groundwater and energy consumption for agriculture didn t have the corresponding increase actually it was mainly because water saving irrigation improve water use efficiency water productivity the ratio of yield to the volume of supplied groundwater is one of the key indicators of water use efficiency during 2004 2013 the percentage of water saving irrigation area increased by 12 9 correspondingly water productivity increased from 3 3 kg m 3 to 5 2 kg m 3 other studies also confirm that water saving irrigation is one of the most effective ways to reduce water use without loss of grain output belder et al 2004 zhang et al 2013a b c zou et al 2013 main measures to water saving irrigation are irrigation management and irrigation technologies water productivity in terms of irrigation water is about 5 35 higher under alternate wetting and drying a water saving irrigation practice than in continuous flooding moya et al 2001 the application of pressurized systems could reduce water consumption by 10 66 and water use efficiency is also enhanced without reduction in grain yield jackson et al 2010 without loss of yield experimental trials have shown that the water saving potentials of several high capacity irrigation technologies exceed 90 abdulai et al 2005 however in the ncp over half of the irrigated area employed traditional irrigation techniques which caused waste of water and energy resources this was in marked contrast to the situation in advanced countries in the field of irrigation techniques in israel almost all of irrigation areas are under water saving irrigation and the efficiency keeps on improving moreover the actual irrigation water use reached up to 1 5 times more than the grain water requirement in the ncp wang et al 2002 the overall water use efficiency of grain production in the ncp has fallen behind the world average due to poor irrigation management practices and lack of investment in infrastructure blanke et al 2007 this implies that there is a tremendous opportunity for saving groundwater and energy consumption in the ncp by developing water saving irrigation by significantly reducing the amount of water that needs to be pumped energy consumption and ghg emissions are also reduced in most cases the application of pressurized systems could reduce energy consumption by 12 44 jackson et al 2010 a study from the usa lal 2004 indicates that the emissions from drip irrigation 216 kg co2e are far less than furrow irrigation 395 kg co2e in 11 surveyed provinces in china low pressure pipeline irrigation can save 6 48 109 kwh yr 1 energy and reduce ghg emissions by 6 72 mt yr 1 zhang et al 2013a b c renewable energy would be an effective way to reduce energy consumption solar photovoltaic water pumping system has been widely studied and applied chandel et al 2015 it requires no fuel cost and is environmentally friendly most parts of ncp are rich in solar energy according to national energy administration however if groundwater levels keep decreasing more photovoltaic water pumping systems are still needed therefore energy saving technologies will work better in combination with water saving technologies now water saving irrigation practices have been one of the china s basic national policies however there are some factors restricting the development of water saving irrigation compared to traditional irrigation water saving irrigation systems need more funding li et al 2003 wang 2010 yao et al 2005 there is a higher workload associated with the control and maintenance of equipment wang and gao 2001 wang and wu 2006 overcoming these barriers would require finance technology and capacity building supports therefore policy makers need to contribute the majority of financial investments to reduce the adverse effects of water scarcity and encourage energy saving besides a reasonable adjustment of water price maybe make water saving irrigation cost less than traditional irrigation subsidy is another way to promote water saving irrigation 5 conclusion over exploitation of groundwater has caused severe groundwater declines in ncp at a rate of 0 6 m yr 1 this trend becomes faster in recent years due to declines in groundwater levels groundwater pumping for irrigation becomes increasingly energy intensive and emits more ghgs within the last 18 years energy use rate of unit water pumping increased from 0 5040 kwh m 3 to 0 6088 kwh m 3 by nearly 22 total ghg emissions have increased from 6 16 to 8 72 mt co2e by 42 hebei suffers the most serious groundwater declines and emits the largest ghg from pumping accounting for 47 of the total emissions in the ncp energy cost of pumping irrigation is notable us 1 15 billion because of a large amount of energy consumption to reduce cost more electric pumps should be used to replace diesel pumps in this region in addition the cost of cutting emissions from pumping irrigation 8 72 mt co2e was us 0 087 billion in 2013 in consideration of energy consumption and emission reduction the total economic cost is us 1 25 billion reaching up to 10 3 of gdp the increasing cost is a great threat to sustainable development of agriculture water saving irrigation is an effective way to reduce water and energy consumption without loss of grain output an average 1 of water saving irrigation area would increase 0 13 kg m 3 water productivity during 2002 2013 water productivity increased from 3 3 kg m 3 to 5 2 kg m 3 as the percentage of water saving irrigated area increased 12 9 to reduce ghg emissions and pressures on energy and groundwater resources water saving irrigation should be greatly promoted in the ncp however there are some factors restricting the development of water saving irrigation in this region in the future policy makers need to contribute the majority of financial investments acknowledgments great thanks also to dr jianhua wang cangzhou normal university for her
