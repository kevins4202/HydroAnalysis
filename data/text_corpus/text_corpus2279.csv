11395,understanding evapotranspiration vapor pressure deficit et vpd hysteresis for different ecosystems can improve our knowledge of vegetation adaptability to a changing environment however no previous studies have compared the controlling factors of et vpd hysteresis for different agroforestry ecosystems in karst landscapes therefore this study explored et vpd hysteresis patterns and the controlling factors for three agroforestry ecosystems using field observations in a subtropical humid karst catchment from march 12 2015 to may 26 2016 the results showed both similarities and differences in et vpd hysteresis among the three ecosystems for example all three agroforestry ecosystems exhibited noticeable et vpd hysteresis and the hysteric magnitude showed noticeable seasonality with higher values during the growing season for all three ecosystems the et vpd hysteretic magnitude had no significant relationship with the daily mean environmental factors e g meteorological factors and soil moisture θ but it was highly r2 0 59 correlated to changing rates of meteorological factors e g temperature ta relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd in the morning the et vpd hysteretic magnitude of the forest grass mixed ecosystem 142 48 74 16 min was significantly higher than that of the grass ecosystem 104 37 82 93 min hysteresis reflected the extent of imbalance between water demand and water supply for ecosystems during a day therefore this study may be helpful in modeling et and further understanding ecosystem responses to environmental

that returns approximately 67 of the annual land precipitation to the atmosphere oki and kanae 2006 the et process uniquely links the water cycle energy cycle and carbon cycle thus it is a key climatic predictor of agroforestry ecosystem health and is the predominant variable needed for water management in agroforestry production allen and breshears 1998 anderson et al 2012 fisher et al 2017 jung et al 2010 koster et al 2004 seneviratne et al 2006 therefore various et processes in different ecosystems have been studied alkaisi et al 1989 dickinson et al 1991 ding et al 2013 fisher et al 2017 kite 2000 kite and droogers 2000 kool et al 2014 tanaka et al 2008 in the et processes of various ecosystems a hysteretic phenomenon between vapor pressure deficit vpd and evapotranspiration et reflects the diurnal water use of a plant which can exert an influence on ecological water depletion and water use efficiency this phenomenon has been studied in various plant species and ecosystems throughout the world ewers et al 2005 meinzer et al 1999 o brien et al 2004 o grady et al 2008 unsworth et al 2004 wullschleger et al 1998 zeppel et al 2006 for example li et al 2016 studied the et vpd hysteresis pattern for populus euphratica in the arid heihe river basin in northwestern china and found that the lag time was approximately 1 0 1 5 h changes in environmental factors often lead to complex physiological responses and the et vpd hysteresis phenomenon is an indirect response of vegetation to a changing environment for example bai et al 2015 found that changes in grapevine stomata conductance were affected by par vpd and temperature ta changes in an oasis ecosystem in northwest china in this case the et vpd hysteresis was a self protection mechanism of the plants to prevent excessive water loss avoiding dehydration chen et al 2011 therefore understanding the et vpd hysteresis will improve our knowledge of the adaptability of different vegetation types to a changing environment previous studies demonstrated that the magnitude of et vpd hysteresis the area inside the hysteresis loop was affected by both abiotic e g temperature available soil moisture and biotic factors e g the physiology of plants leaf area index bai et al 2015 janssen et al 2008 o grady et al 2008 tuzet et al 2003 for example tuzet et al 2003 showed that et vpd hysteretic magnitude increased with decreasing soil moisture however zhang et al 2014 pointed out that for grass ecosystems only when soil water content was below an ecosystem specific threshold i e θ 0 175 cm3 cm 3 it was a key factor in modulating the hysteretic et vpd relationship the study also concluded that leaf or root water potential controls et vpd hysteresis magnitude in a linear manner o grady et al 1999 found that et vpd hysteretic magnitude was larger during the dry season than during the wet season for eucalyptus globulus in southern tasmania australia clearly the factors controlling et vpd hysteresis are different for different plant species or ecosystems in various regions in addition most previous studies explored et vpd hysteresis qualitatively in a single ecosystem li et al 2016 o grady et al 2008 sun et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 therefore quantitative studies are urgently needed to improve et modeling sun et al 2013 tuzet et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 zheng et al 2014 furthermore to our knowledge no studies have compared the et vpd hysteresis patterns of different agroforestry ecosystems in karst landscapes and no studies have explained et vpd hysteresis magnitude by change rate cr of meteorological factors in the morning karst landscapes represent approximately 10 of the earth s land surface and play an important role in water supply for human society especially in southwest china which has one of the largest continuous karst areas in the world yang et al 2017 however this region is generally underdeveloped overpopulated and characterized by severe rocky desertification hartmann et al 2014 nie et al 2012 yang et al 2017 although it receives high precipitation in a subtropical humid climate water stress occurs frequently because of the thin soil layer and low water holding capacity liu et al 2016 in addition to water stress heavy human disturbance has led to severe ecosystem degradation therefore ecological restoration in this catchment was initiated in 2007 napier grass and trees were planted as two main alternatives to traditional crops yang et al 2017 in particular zenia insignis chun an indigenous tree species with high drought enduring capacity in this area comparing et vpd hysteresis patterns of different agroforestry ecosystems will be helpful to further understand the water consumption strategies of different vegetation and improve ecological engineering therefore this study aims to 1 explore the et vpd hysteresis patterns for three agroforestry ecosystems in karst landscapes and 2 identify the key controlling factors the diurnal changing rate vs the diurnal mean of different meteorological factors on et vpd hysteresis magnitude for these different agroforestry ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area 24 44 25 33 n 107 51 108 43 e is a typical peak cluster depression in a karst landscape in southwestern china and covers approximately 0 3 km2 the elevation of study sites is approximately 380 m the area is characterized by shallow soils and high rock outcrops in the guzhou watershed huanjiang county guangxi province fig 1 formed from limestone the calcareous soil can be classified into two types continuous and isolated both the continuous and large isolated outcrops are severely weathered and characterized by a network of soil filled cracks and crevices yang et al 2016 with an annual mean temperature of 18 5 c the area has a humid subtropical monsoon climate and the annual mean precipitation is approximately 1389 mm year 1 approximately 70 of the annual precipitation falls between april and september the frost free period lasts for approximately 290 days and the annual duration of bright sunlight is about 1450 h peng et al 2013 vegetation is mainly dominated by forest grass mixed ecosystem crop and grass ecosystems in this catchment 2 2 field measurements transpiration t of trees was measured using thermal dissipation probes tdp and evapotranspiration et of the crop and grass ecosystems including the grass ecosystem under trees was measured using ventilated chambers data were recorded from march 12 2015 to may 26 2016 in the forest grass mixed ecosystem there were 85 zenia insignis trees of which six typical trees based on different stem sizes and canopy sizes in the forest were selected to measure transpiration calculated by sap flow in the forest grass ecosystem and the grass ecosystem 30 cm tall napier grass seedlings were cultivated since 2011 in the crop ecosystem the crop rotation was maize soybean sweet potato meteorological stations automatic continuous monitoring were positioned inside and outside the forest to monitor precipitation prcp air temperature ta photosynthetic active radiation par relative humidity rh and wind speed ws the saturated vapor pressure deficit vpd can be calculated as v p d 6 1078 e 17 269 t a 237 3 t a r h 6 1078 e 17 269 t a 237 3 t a meanwhile the soil water content θ at 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm and 60 cm depth was logged using time domain reflectometry probes automatic continuous monitoring the leaf area index lai was measured once every 10 15 days using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2200c li cor ltd u s and the leaf water potential was measured once every 10 15 days every 2 h from 06 00 to 20 00 with a plant moisture analyzer skpm1400 british skye cor ltd u k note that only 65 non rainy days were selected to study the relationship between et and meteorological factors because ventilated chambers cannot be used to measure et during rainy days to ensure that plants accept water unrestrictedly 2 3 ventilated chamber thermal dissipation probes and lag time hysteresis magnitude the ventilated chamber technique for measuring evaporation from crops reicosky and peters 1977 trees and plantations has demonstrated its potential for discrimination and practicability at the plot scale greenwood et al 1982 1985a greenwood et al 1985b uncertainty regarding the absolute accuracy of the technique has been discussed in a review of plant physiological methods for studying evapotranspiration denmead 1984 evaluation of ventilated chamber measurement of evaporation from plant communities was called for rose and sharma 1984 sharma 1984a b and then reported in a study of 11 year old regenerating eucalyptus forest dunin and greenwood 1986 however ventilated chambers in these previous studies were not portable and could not be moved or installed therefore we modified the ventilated chamber fig 1 patent no zl 2014 1 0 756 225 x there was an outlet near the top connected to an aspirator pump by pvc tube and there was an inlet hole connected to a pvc tube two temperature and humidity sensors were set inside the inlet and outlet pvc tubes the ventilated chamber frames were made of stainless steel and fixed onto the ground their doors could be taken down freely and were made of a transparent and lightfast plastic plate evapotranspiration et was calculated using the following empirical equations 1 a h 217 r h 6 1078 e 17 269 t a 237 3 t a t a g m 3 2 e t i 1 n v a h o u t l e t i t i 1 n v a h i n l e t i t where ah is the absolute humidity g m 3 and v is the flow rate of the pump m3 min 1 the tdp system consisted of two thermal dissipation probes which were inserted into the sapwood of the tree granier 1985 granier et al 2000 the thermocouples measure the temperature difference tad between the heated probe and the reference probe therefore when a tree is transpiring the sap flow will cool the heated probe and decrease the tad when the sap flow ceases e g during the night the tad will reach its maximum tadm bosch et al 2014 the sap flux can be estimated as follows granier et al 2000 3 s f s a 0 119 t a d m t a d 1 231 3600 c m 3 c m 2 h r 1 where tadm is assumed to be the mean value of tad between 23 00 and 03 00 during the day cramer et al 1999 and sa is the sapwood area of a plant note that the et rate for forest grass mixed ecosystem was estimated using the following equation 4 e t f e t g t a where et f mm h 1 is the et mm h 1 rate of the forest grass mixed ecosystem et g mm h 1 is the et mm h 1 rate of the grass ecosystem under trees t kg h 1 m 2 is the total transpiration of the six trees and a m2 is the cover area of the six trees the hysteresis magnitude was represented using the lag time lt between et and vpd which was determined using the dislocation movement method zhao et al 2005 2006 here positive or negative lag time indicates that et occurs in advance of or lags behind vpd 2 4 relationships between lag time and environmental factors correlation analysis was conducted between the et vpd hysteresis magnitude lag time and the daily mean meteorological factors ta par vpd and rh or soil water content θ hysteresis can be considered a self protection mechanism of plants to avoid dehydration chen et al 2011 therefore the diurnal changing rate of the meteorological factors or soil water content can obviously influence the hysteresis magnitude for example if the temperature increases rapidly in the morning and stays at a high value into the afternoon which means water demand is high it would result in a large lag time to reflect the diurnal distribution of meteorological factors the change rate cr was used which was defined as the slope changing rate of the meteorological factors in the period from the time that the et starts to increase in the morning to the time that the et reaches its maximum for example the cr for temperature was calculated as follows 5 c r t a p t a 0 t p t 0 where tap is the temperature when et reaches its peak ta0 is the temperature when et starts to increase tp is the time when et reaches its peak and t0 is the time when et starts to increase fig 2 first the point time at which et starts to increase t0 was determined as follows the slope of et at time t f t was calculated using two neighboring data points f t s t 1 s t δ t thereafter the f t was normalized by dividing by the maximum f t denoted as f t m a x in a day f n f t f t m a x based on this if in a period in the morning after 05 30 there were five successive f n higher than 0 1 then the first time of the five successive f n was selected as the point at which the et starts to increase fig 3 the results demonstrated that this procedure was robust data not shown here correlation analysis was then conducted between the lag time and the cr as previously mentioned 3 results 3 1 diurnal hysteresis pattern data from may 3 2015 were selected to illustrate the hysteresis patterns fig 4 for the three agroforestry ecosystems note that the day was a random selection in summer days because the hysteresis phenomenon was more obvious in summer fig 4a c reveal similar clockwise et vpd hysteresis patterns for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively meaning that et reached a peak earlier than vpd in detail vpd reached a peak at 15 45 but et started to increase in the morning and reached a peak at approximately 13 25 13 50 and 14 15 for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively this meant that the lag times hysteresis magnitudes for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem were different 140 min 115 min and 90 min respectively intuitively the area of the hysteretic loop formed by the et and vpd curves was the largest for the forest grass mixed ecosystem followed by the crop ecosystem and the grass ecosystem 3 2 daily hysteresis magnitude lag time patterns as shown in fig 5 the et vpd hysteresis magnitude for the three ecosystems exhibited similar noticeable seasonality with a absolute high value during the growing season apr oct and a relatively low value in winter nov mar in detail the lag time during the growing season was 194 96 79 73 min 172 40 91 88 min and 150 43 91 73 min for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively however in winter their lag times were 100 21 60 53 min 77 98 55 46 min and 67 26 50 54 min respectively the et vpd hysteretic magnitude lag time of the forest grass mixed ecosystem 142 48 74 16 min was statistically significantly higher than that of the grass ecosystem 104 37 82 93 min and slightly higher than that of the crop ecosystem 120 10 87 60 min 3 3 relationships between lag time and environmental factors the hysteresis magnitude was highly correlated with the change rate cr of ta rh and vpd with the determination coefficient r2 generally being above 0 59 fig 6 p 0 01 it should be noted that there was no statistical correlation between hysteresis magnitude and the change rate cr of par fig 6b f j p 0 05 however the et vpd hysteresis magnitude lag time of the three ecosystems forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem had poor correlations with the mean daily ta par rh vpd with r2 generally being below 0 20 fig 7 though the lag time was related to daily ta fig 7a e i p 0 01 likewise the hysteresis magnitude was poorly correlated to daily θ with r2 generally being less than 0 1 fig 8 4 discussion previous studies have demonstrated that ventilated chambers can be used to measure et of short vegetation i e grass crops and shrubs dunin and greenwood 1986 even though the modified ventilated chambers in this study was compared with weight method through measuring water evaporation in plate indoors as shown in fig 9 results showed that the average error was below 5 in addition the systemic error of ventilated chamber is same for three agroforestry ecosystems and the absolute et quantity is not the key control to study hysteresis phenomenon in other words the exact time of peak of sap flow rate and environmental factors during a day were more important in this study during the last decades various thermal methods have been developed to measure sap flow which can be used to estimate the whole plant transpiration the thermal dissipation probes tdp method developed by granier have been widely used with different plants and under variable environments given that the method is relative simple and accurate in comparison to other methods fuchs et al 2017 lubczynski et al 2012 paudel et al 2013 wiedemann et al 2016 wullschleger et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 ziegler et al 2009 the diurnal et vpd hysteresis patterns and daily hysteresis magnitude of the three agroforestry ecosystems exhibited some similarities generally et vpd hysteresis is a water related eco physiological response of plants to the changing external environment there are many complex and inter related eco physiological processes that can interact to produce such phenomenon such as the linkages between stomatal control and soil water uptake or transport within the plant sperry et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 therefore all biotic factors biotic such as the physio ecological characteristics of the plant itself e g water stored in the plant xylem transport capacity canopy structure etc can induce stomata closure and exert impacts on hysteresis schulze et al 1985 hysteresis is also affected by a range of environmental factors ivanov et al 2010 mualem 1974 sun et al 2013 in previous studies as shown in table 1 the control factors on et vpd hysteresis were various out of various plants climates and landscapes chen et al 2011 ewers and oren 2000 meinzer et al 1999 o brien et al 2004 o grady et al 2008 oguntunde 2005 tuzet et al 2003 unsworth et al 2004 wang et al 2009 wullschleger et al 1998 zeppel et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 as a whole these controls can be divided into abiotic e g ta par vpd θ and biotic factors e g the physiology of plants lai species among various factors vpd was more important than θ to hysteresis in wet regions and θ may not be a good indicator in these regions o grady et al 2008 wullschleger et al 1998 but in dry areas hysteretic magnitude increases as θ declines which means θ was key controls tuzet et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 noted that only when θ was below 0 175 cm3 cm 3 it was a key factor in modulating et vpd hysteresis magnitude in our study although θ differed in the three ecosystems θ values were generally high 0 2 cm3 cm 3 therefore θ may have limited influence on vegetation water depletion in this study area consequently the et vpd hysteresis magnitude was poorly correlated to mean daily θ p 0 05 for all three ecosystems in this study fig 8 in our study the et vpd hysteresis magnitude was significantly correlated r2 0 66 to the change rate of ta rh and vpd fig 6 for all three ecosystems that means ta rh and vpd are the main controls to hysteresis and θ might not be a key factor in this catchment seasonality of et vpd hysteresis magnitude is observed in temperate and tropical systems ma et al 2008 zeppel et al 2006 for example ma et al 2008 found that the et vpd hysteresis magnitude of a 19 year old acacia mangium in south china was greater in the hot season than in the cold season sun et al 2010 also found that the et vpd magnitude of poplar in northeast china was higher in the summer as noted in a previous study hysteresis magnitude can be influenced by many factors abiotic and biotic zhang et al 2014 in summer the et is generally high because of the high atmospheric water demand i e potential evaporation therefore hydraulic conductivity soil and stem may play an important role in the diurnal hysteresis because the water uptake and upward transport limited by the soil hydraulic conductivity and trunk water resistance might not compensate for the potential water depletion however hysteresis characteristics exhibit strong species specific patterns wang et al 2017 and are not only affected by the environment e g climate soil water availability thus there may be no obvious seasonal variation for some species for example li et al 2016 found that the et vpd hysteresis magnitude of populus euphratica in arid northwestern china had no seasonal variation as a whole the et vpd hysteresis magnitudes fig 5 of the three ecosystems fall within the range of previous studies as shown in table 1 wang et al 2009 noted that et reached a peak approximately 47 130 min in advance of vpd for seven common tree species in the beijing municipality sun et al 2010 found that the et vpd hysteresis magnitude was between 50 and 120 min for poplar during the growing seasons in northeast china and was lower in july and august than in june and september oguntunde 2005 found that the et vpd hysteresis magnitude of cassava manihot esculenta crantz was approximately 110 min in a tropical monsoon area east of ejura ghana however ewers and oren 2000 found that the et vpd hysteresis magnitude of pinus taeda trees 12 years old was only approximately 30 min in the sandhills of north carolina in addition no obvious et vpd hysteresis was found during the summer and autumn for larix gmelinii in a semi humid area wang et al 2011 therefore both climate and plant species or ecosystems play a key role in modulating et vpd hysteresis magnitude ford et al 2004 zang et al 1996 zweifel et al 2001 similarly in this study the et vpd hysteretic magnitude was related to ecosystems or plant species and the value for the forest grass mixed ecosystem 142 48 74 16 min was significantly higher than that for the grass ecosystem 104 37 82 93 min even though the two ecosystems were located very close to each other et vpd hysteresis is affected by many environmental factors such as vpd par ta rh and θ etc ivanov et al 2010 mualem 1974 sun et al 2013 nevertheless previous studies never have quantitatively explained the relationship of hysteresis magnitude with environmental factors what s more though vpd ta or rh reflected water demand for plants a poor relationship was observed between et vpd hysteresis magnitude and the daily meteorological factors fig 7 in this study however the lag times were significantly correlated r2 0 66 to the change rate of the meteorological variables fig 6 in our study analyzing it essentially root water absorption would be restricted by roots resistance aubrecht et al 2006 in other words with et consuming water stored in stem and leaf water can t be replenished without delay and this would lead to leaf water deficit stomatal closure or decreasing the opening degree of stomata then water capacitance wc balance in parenchyma cells of leaf would be broken holbrook and sinclair 1992 waring and hall 1978 kang et al 1990 found that wc would decease 25 30 in the daytime caused by transpiration and it would be replenished in the night kang and liu 1993 in other words upper limit of water supply is restricted by water capacitance wc in parenchyma cells of leaf but water demand was controlled by the change rate of meteorological factors cr as a result when cr exceeded the limit of water supply stomata would close or decrease the opening degree to avoid excessive loss of water technically the change of meteorological factors mainly occurred in the day time however the mean values of meteorological factors neglect their change processes therefore the mean value can t explain the lag time well the lag time reflected the supply demand imbalance of water between plant and its environment cr of ta and vpd reflected the imbalance extent of heat process and cr of rh reflected the imbalance extent of water process in essence in the daytime ta and vpd would increase rapidly and rh would decrease rapidly as a result the gap between water demand and water supply would be big consequently et would increase quicker than those days when cr were lower however plant could close leaf stomata itself for reducing water loss as soon as possible the result was that et rate reach peak earlier and et vpd hysteresis magnitude was bigger as shown in fig 4 the et vpd hysteresis patterns were clockwise therefore the relationship is positive between lag time and cr of ta and cr of vpd but negative between lag time and cr of rh the cr value was defined as the changing rate slope of the meteorological factors between the point that et started to rise and the time point at which the et rate reached to the maximum therefore the cr value can reflect the diurnal structure of meteorological factors to some extent in contrast the daily mean value fails to capture the diurnal distribution of meteorological conditions as a result the correlation between cr and the lag time were much higher than that of the daily mean of the meteorological factors and lag time it needs to be specifically pointed out that cr of par was not correlated with the et vpd hysteretic magnitude generally speaking plant photosynthesis is positively related with par and transpiration should increase with par increasing zeiger and field 1982 but in our study area the supply of par may be far beyond the demand of plant during study period and the use efficiency may decrease out of photosaturation for uppermost leaf wang and jarvis 1990 therefore cr of par may not be suitable for those areas where solar radiation is particularly strong to explain the et vpd hysteresis magnitude 5 conclusions this study compared the et vpd hysteresis characteristics and the relationships between et vpd hysteresis magnitude lag time and environmental factors meteorological factors and soil moisture for three agroforestry ecosystems in a subtropical karst region in southwestern china results show that the hysteresis was affected by multiple factors such as meteorological factors soil water content and plant species the magnitude of hysteresis was strongly affected by the extent of imbalance between water demand and water supply during a day however the mean values of daily meteorological factors often fail to reveal the extent of this imbalance which is better reflected by a new index cr change rate proposed by us soil moisture was not a key influence factor on hysteresis magnitude for all three agroforestry ecosystems in the humid karst catchment acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of

classified into two types continuous and isolated both the continuous and large isolated outcrops are severely weathered and characterized by a network of soil filled cracks and crevices yang et al 2016 with an annual mean temperature of 18 5 c the area has a humid subtropical monsoon climate and the annual mean precipitation is approximately 1389 mm year 1 approximately 70 of the annual precipitation falls between april and september the frost free period lasts for approximately 290 days and the annual duration of bright sunlight is about 1450 h peng et al 2013 vegetation is mainly dominated by forest grass mixed ecosystem crop and grass ecosystems in this catchment 2 2 field measurements transpiration t of trees was measured using thermal dissipation probes tdp and evapotranspiration et of the crop and grass ecosystems including the grass ecosystem under trees was measured using ventilated chambers data were recorded from march 12 2015 to may 26 2016 in the forest grass mixed ecosystem there were 85 zenia insignis trees of which six typical trees based on different stem sizes and canopy sizes in the forest were selected to measure transpiration calculated by sap flow in the forest grass ecosystem and the grass ecosystem 30 cm tall napier grass seedlings were cultivated since 2011 in the crop ecosystem the crop rotation was maize soybean sweet potato meteorological stations automatic continuous monitoring were positioned inside and outside the forest to monitor precipitation prcp air temperature ta photosynthetic active radiation par

content θ at 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm and 60 cm depth was logged using time domain reflectometry probes automatic continuous monitoring the leaf area index lai was measured once every 10 15 days using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2200c li cor ltd u s and the leaf water potential was measured once every 10 15 days every 2 h from 06 00 to 20 00 with a plant moisture analyzer skpm1400 british skye cor ltd u k note that only 65 non rainy days were selected to study the relationship between et and meteorological factors because ventilated chambers cannot be used to measure et during rainy days to ensure that plants accept water unrestrictedly 2 3 ventilated chamber thermal dissipation probes and lag time hysteresis magnitude the ventilated chamber technique for measuring evaporation from crops reicosky and peters 1977 trees and plantations has demonstrated its potential for discrimination and practicability at the plot scale greenwood et al 1982 1985a greenwood et al 1985b uncertainty regarding the absolute accuracy of the technique has been discussed in a review of plant physiological methods for studying evapotranspiration denmead 1984 evaluation of ventilated chamber measurement of evaporation from plant communities was called for rose and sharma 1984 sharma 1984a b and then reported in a study of 11 year old regenerating eucalyptus forest dunin and greenwood 1986 however ventilated chambers in these previous studies were not portable and could not be moved or installed therefore we modified the ventilated chamber fig 1 patent no zl 2014 1 0 756 225 x there was an outlet near the top connected to an aspirator pump by pvc tube and there was an inlet hole connected to a pvc tube two temperature and humidity sensors were set inside the inlet and outlet pvc tubes the ventilated chamber frames were made of stainless steel and fixed onto the ground their doors could be taken down freely and were made of a transparent and lightfast plastic plate evapotranspiration et was calculated using the following empirical equations 1 a h 217 r h 6 1078 e 17 269 t a 237 3 t a t a g m 3 2 e t i 1 n v a h o u t l e t i t i 1 n v a h i n l e t i t where ah is the absolute humidity g m 3 and v is the flow rate of the pump m3 min 1 the tdp system consisted of two thermal dissipation probes which were inserted into the sapwood of the tree granier 1985 granier et al 2000 the thermocouples measure the temperature difference tad between the heated probe and the reference probe therefore when a tree is transpiring the sap flow will cool the heated probe and decrease the tad when the sap flow ceases e g during the night the tad will reach its maximum tadm bosch et al 2014 the sap flux can be estimated as follows granier et al 2000 3 s f s a 0 119 t a d m t a d 1 231 3600 c m 3 c m 2 h r 1 where tadm is assumed to be the mean value of tad between 23 00 and 03 00 during the day cramer et al 1999 and sa is the sapwood area of a plant note that the et rate for forest grass mixed ecosystem was estimated using the following equation 4 e t f e t g t a where et f mm h 1 is the et mm h 1 rate of the forest grass mixed ecosystem et g mm h 1 is the et mm h 1 rate of the grass ecosystem under trees t kg h 1 m 2 is the total transpiration of the six trees and a m2 is the cover area of the six trees the hysteresis magnitude was represented using the lag time lt between et and vpd which was determined using the dislocation movement method zhao et al 2005 2006 here positive or negative lag time indicates that et occurs in advance of or lags behind vpd 2 4 relationships between lag time and environmental factors correlation analysis was conducted between the et vpd hysteresis magnitude lag time and the daily mean meteorological factors ta par vpd and rh or soil water content θ hysteresis can be considered a self protection mechanism of plants to avoid dehydration chen et al 2011 therefore the diurnal changing rate of the meteorological factors or soil water content can obviously influence the hysteresis magnitude for example if the temperature increases rapidly in the morning and stays at a high value into the afternoon which means water demand is high it would result in a large lag time to reflect the diurnal distribution of meteorological factors the change rate cr was used which was defined as the slope changing rate of the meteorological factors in the period from the time that the et starts to increase in the morning to the time that the et reaches its maximum for example the cr for temperature was calculated as follows 5 c r t a p t a 0 t p t 0 where tap is the temperature when et reaches its peak ta0 is the temperature when et starts to increase tp is the time when et reaches its peak and t0 is the time when et starts to increase fig 2 first the point time at which et starts to increase t0 was determined as follows the slope of et at time t f t was calculated using two neighboring data points f t s t 1 s t δ t thereafter the f t was normalized by dividing by the maximum f t denoted as f t m a x in a day f n f t f t m a x based on this if in a period in the morning after 05 30 there were five successive f n higher than 0 1 then the first time of the five successive f n was selected as the point at which the et starts to increase fig 3 the results demonstrated that this procedure was robust data not shown here correlation analysis was then conducted between the lag time and the cr as previously mentioned 3 results 3 1 diurnal hysteresis pattern data from may 3 2015 were selected to illustrate the hysteresis patterns fig 4 for the three agroforestry ecosystems note that the day was a random selection in summer days because the hysteresis phenomenon was more obvious in summer fig 4a c reveal similar clockwise et vpd hysteresis patterns for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively meaning that et reached a peak earlier than vpd in detail vpd reached a peak at 15 45 but et started to increase in the morning and reached a peak at approximately 13 25 13 50 and 14 15 for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively this meant that the lag times hysteresis magnitudes for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem were different 140 min 115 min and 90 min respectively intuitively the area of the hysteretic loop formed by the et and vpd curves was the largest for the forest grass mixed ecosystem followed by the crop ecosystem and the grass ecosystem 3 2 daily hysteresis magnitude lag time patterns as shown in fig 5 the et vpd hysteresis magnitude for the three ecosystems exhibited similar noticeable seasonality with a absolute high value during the growing season apr oct and a relatively low value in winter nov mar in detail the lag time during the growing season was 194 96 79 73 min 172 40 91 88 min and 150 43 91 73 min for the forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem respectively however in winter their lag times were 100 21 60 53 min 77 98 55 46 min and 67 26 50 54 min respectively the et vpd hysteretic magnitude lag time of the forest grass mixed ecosystem 142 48 74 16 min was statistically significantly higher than that of the grass ecosystem 104 37 82 93 min and slightly higher than that of the crop ecosystem 120 10 87 60 min 3 3 relationships between lag time and environmental factors the hysteresis magnitude was highly correlated with the change rate cr of ta rh and vpd with the determination coefficient r2 generally being above 0 59 fig 6 p 0 01 it should be noted that there was no statistical correlation between hysteresis magnitude and the change rate cr of par fig 6b f j p 0 05 however the et vpd hysteresis magnitude lag time of the three ecosystems forest grass mixed ecosystem crop ecosystem and grass ecosystem had poor correlations with the mean daily ta par rh vpd with r2 generally being below 0 20 fig 7 though the lag time was related to daily ta fig 7a e i p 0 01 likewise the hysteresis magnitude was poorly correlated to daily θ with r2 generally being less than 0 1 fig 8 4 discussion previous studies have demonstrated that ventilated chambers can be used to measure et of short vegetation i e grass crops and shrubs dunin and greenwood 1986 even though the modified ventilated chambers in this study was compared with weight method through measuring water evaporation in plate indoors as shown in fig 9 results showed that the average error was below 5 in addition the systemic error of ventilated chamber is same for three agroforestry ecosystems and the absolute et quantity is not the key control to study hysteresis phenomenon in other words the exact time of peak of sap flow rate and environmental factors during a day were more important in this study during the last decades various thermal methods have been developed to measure sap flow which can be used to estimate the whole plant transpiration the thermal dissipation probes tdp method developed by granier have been widely used with different plants and under variable environments given that the method is relative simple and accurate in comparison to other methods fuchs et al 2017 lubczynski et al 2012 paudel et al 2013 wiedemann et al 2016 wullschleger et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 ziegler et al 2009 the diurnal et vpd hysteresis patterns and daily hysteresis magnitude of the three agroforestry ecosystems exhibited some similarities generally et vpd hysteresis is a water related eco physiological response of plants to the changing external environment there are many complex and inter related eco physiological processes that can interact to produce such phenomenon such as the linkages between stomatal control and soil water uptake or transport within the plant sperry et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 therefore all biotic factors biotic such as the physio ecological characteristics of the plant itself e g water stored in the plant xylem transport capacity canopy structure etc can induce stomata closure and exert impacts on hysteresis schulze et al 1985 hysteresis is also affected by a range of environmental factors ivanov et al 2010 mualem 1974 sun et al 2013 in previous studies as shown in table 1 the control factors on et vpd hysteresis were various out of various plants climates and landscapes chen et al 2011 ewers and oren 2000 meinzer et al 1999 o brien et al 2004 o grady et al 2008 oguntunde 2005 tuzet et al 2003 unsworth et al 2004 wang et al 2009 wullschleger et al 1998 zeppel et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 as a whole these controls can be divided into abiotic e g ta par vpd θ and biotic factors e g the physiology of plants lai species among various factors vpd was more important than θ to hysteresis in wet regions and θ may not be a good indicator in these regions o grady et al 2008 wullschleger et al 1998 but in dry areas hysteretic magnitude increases as θ declines which means θ was key controls tuzet et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 noted that only when θ was below 0 175 cm3 cm 3 it was a key factor in modulating et vpd hysteresis magnitude in our study although θ differed in the three ecosystems θ values were generally high 0 2 cm3 cm 3 therefore θ may have limited influence on vegetation water depletion in this study area consequently the et vpd hysteresis magnitude was poorly correlated to mean daily θ p 0 05 for all three ecosystems in this study fig 8 in our study the et vpd hysteresis magnitude was significantly correlated r2 0 66 to the change rate of ta rh and vpd fig 6 for all three ecosystems that means ta rh and vpd are the main controls to hysteresis and θ might not be a key factor in this catchment seasonality of et vpd hysteresis magnitude is observed in temperate and tropical systems ma et al 2008 zeppel et al 2006 for example ma et al 2008 found that the et vpd hysteresis magnitude of a 19 year old acacia mangium in south china was greater in the hot season than in the cold season sun et al 2010 also found that the et vpd magnitude of poplar in northeast china was higher in the summer as noted in a previous study hysteresis magnitude can be influenced by many factors abiotic and biotic zhang et al 2014 in summer the et is generally high because of the high atmospheric water demand i e potential evaporation therefore hydraulic conductivity soil and stem may play an important role in the diurnal hysteresis because the water uptake and upward transport limited by the soil hydraulic conductivity and trunk water resistance might not compensate for the potential water depletion however hysteresis characteristics exhibit strong species specific patterns wang et al 2017 and are not only affected by the environment e g climate soil water availability thus there may be no obvious seasonal variation for some species for example li et al 2016 found that the et vpd hysteresis magnitude of populus euphratica in arid northwestern china had no seasonal variation as a whole the et vpd hysteresis magnitudes fig 5 of the three ecosystems fall within the range of previous studies as shown in table 1 wang et al 2009 noted that et reached a peak approximately 47 130 min in advance of vpd for seven common tree species in the beijing municipality sun et al 2010 found that the et vpd hysteresis magnitude was between 50 and 120 min for poplar during the growing seasons in northeast china and was lower in july and august than in june and september oguntunde 2005 found that the et vpd hysteresis magnitude of cassava manihot esculenta crantz was approximately 110 min in a tropical monsoon area east of ejura ghana however ewers and oren 2000 found that the et vpd hysteresis magnitude of pinus taeda trees 12 years old was only approximately 30 min in the sandhills of north carolina in addition no obvious et vpd hysteresis was found during the summer and autumn for larix gmelinii in a semi humid area wang et al 2011 therefore both climate and plant species or ecosystems play a key role in modulating et vpd hysteresis magnitude ford et al 2004 zang et al 1996 zweifel et al 2001 similarly in this study the et vpd hysteretic magnitude was related to ecosystems or plant species and the value for the forest grass mixed ecosystem 142 48 74 16 min was significantly higher than that for the grass ecosystem 104 37 82 93 min even though the two ecosystems were located very close to each other et vpd hysteresis is affected by many environmental factors such as vpd par ta rh and θ etc ivanov et al 2010 mualem 1974 sun et al 2013 nevertheless previous studies never have quantitatively explained the relationship of hysteresis magnitude with environmental factors what s more though vpd ta or rh reflected water demand for plants a poor relationship was observed between et vpd hysteresis magnitude and the daily meteorological factors fig 7 in this study however the lag times were significantly correlated r2 0 66 to the change rate of the meteorological variables fig 6 in our study analyzing it essentially root water absorption would be restricted by roots resistance aubrecht et al 2006 in other words with et consuming water stored in stem and leaf water can t be replenished without delay and this would lead to leaf water deficit stomatal closure or decreasing the opening degree of stomata then water capacitance wc balance in parenchyma cells of leaf would be broken holbrook and sinclair 1992 waring and hall 1978 kang et al 1990 found that wc would decease 25 30 in the daytime caused by transpiration and it would be replenished in the night kang and liu 1993 in other words upper limit of water supply is restricted by water capacitance wc in parenchyma cells of leaf but water demand was controlled by the change rate of meteorological factors cr as a result when cr exceeded the limit of water supply stomata would close or decrease the opening degree to avoid excessive loss of water technically the change of meteorological factors mainly occurred in the day time however the mean values of meteorological factors neglect their change processes therefore the mean value can t explain the lag time well the lag time reflected the supply demand imbalance of water between plant and its environment cr of ta and vpd reflected the imbalance extent of heat process and cr of rh reflected the imbalance extent of water process in essence in the daytime ta and vpd would increase rapidly and rh would decrease rapidly as a result the gap between water demand and water supply would be big consequently et would increase quicker than those days when cr were lower however plant could close leaf stomata itself for reducing water loss as soon as possible the result was that et rate reach peak earlier and et vpd hysteresis magnitude was bigger as shown in fig 4 the et vpd hysteresis patterns were clockwise therefore the relationship is positive between lag time and cr of ta and cr of vpd but negative between lag time and cr of rh the cr value was defined as the changing rate slope of the meteorological factors between the point that et started to rise and the time point at which the et rate reached to the maximum therefore the cr value can reflect the diurnal structure of meteorological factors to some extent in contrast the daily mean value fails to capture the diurnal distribution of meteorological conditions as a result the correlation between cr and the lag time were much higher than that of the daily mean of the meteorological factors and lag time it needs to be specifically pointed out that cr of par was not correlated with the et vpd hysteretic magnitude generally speaking plant photosynthesis is positively related with par and transpiration should increase with par increasing zeiger and field 1982 but in our study area the supply of par may be far beyond the demand of plant during study period and the use efficiency may decrease out of photosaturation for uppermost leaf wang and jarvis 1990 therefore cr of par may not be suitable for those areas where solar radiation is particularly strong to explain the et vpd hysteresis magnitude 5 conclusions this study compared the et vpd hysteresis characteristics and the relationships between et vpd hysteresis magnitude lag time and environmental factors meteorological factors and soil moisture for three agroforestry ecosystems in a subtropical karst region in southwestern china results show that the hysteresis was affected by multiple factors such as meteorological factors soil water content and plant species the magnitude of hysteresis was strongly affected by the extent of imbalance between water demand and water supply during a day however the mean values of daily meteorological factors often fail to reveal the extent of this imbalance which is better reflected by a new index cr change rate proposed by us soil moisture was not a key influence factor on hysteresis magnitude for all three agroforestry ecosystems in the humid karst catchment acknowledgments this study was supported by the national natural science foundation of

11396,a severe water shortage in arid and semiarid regions in china has triggered regulations limiting the use of irrigation water in desert oasis agricultural systems to determine the actual water demand of agricultural systems and to develop standards for a rational use of water resources maize evapotranspiration rates was simulated using meta analysis of published data determined land use and soil properties in zhangye oasis area and then estimated water consumption with modis for arid northwestern china for the 2014 growing season farmland in zhangye oasis totaled 2189 88 km2 and

plant growth economic social development and rapid increases in human population resulted in increased water demands and severe water shortages in some areas especially in arid and semiarid regions cheng et al 2009 chen et al 2011 jury and vaux 2007 vorosmarty et al 2000 water supply and demand associated scientific problems have caused widespread concerns among many governments scientists and the public alcamo et al 2007 oki and kanae 2006 shen and chen 2010 xia and zhang 2008 in arid and semiarid regions the economy depends mainly on agriculture to establish data driven water resources management in these conditions it is necessary to determine water use of all crops recently many researchers have concentrated on crop water requirements in arid regions abdelhadi et al 2000 ali et al 2000 de azevedo et al 2003 jia and luo 2006 shen et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 chang et al 2015 research on crop evapotranspiration et can be used to determine actual water demand of various crops to develop standards for rational use of water resources dinpashoh 2006 zhang et al 2010a 2010b to develop more efficient and sustainable water management techniques for arable regions to protect and maintain oases methods to determine evapotranspiration have been developed at three different scales such as leaf katerji et al 2003 uehlein et al 2008 wullschleger et al 2000 peng et al 2009 jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 jones 1992 individual plant smith and allen 1996 jara et al 1998 meiresonne et al 1999 chang et al 2006 gong et al 2007 tahir et al 2008 zhao and liu 2010 and canopy allen 2000 monteith and unsworth 1990 chang et al 2015 zhao and zhao 2015 further modeled crop evapotranspiration at each scale is based on the interactions of complex physical and physiological phenomena dauzat et al 2001 in fact accurate estimation of canopy transpiration plays an important role in determining irrigation needs in the region these diverse applications typically require knowledge of the distribution of evapotranspiration rates across catchments and regions cleugh et al 2007 leuning et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 a major limitation however is that measurements are mostly made at a point scale zhao et al 2010 shen et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 zhao and zhao 2015 chang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 because remotely sensed rs methods can provide the spatial and temporal continuity change of normalized difference vegetation index and land use types it has long been regarded as the best tools for determination of spatially distributed evapotranspiration fluxes several approaches combined satellite data to estimate actual et have been developed such as the penman monteith method tasumi et al 2005 consoli et al 2006 cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2007 2011 yuan et al 2010 zhang et al 2008

evapotranspiration across catchments and regions and some have been used in water management tasumi et al 2005 consoli et al 2006 tang et al 2009 a major drawback of most of the earlier studies was the requirement for meteorological data the availability of which was often limited especially in near real time and few meteorological observation sites temesgen et al 1999 voogt 2006 collins 2011 cruz blanco et al 2014 for example meteorological observatories are scarce and mainly concentrated in densely populated areas in the arid northwestern part of china moreover crop characteristics irrigation type topographic and or soil variations were not considered however crop water use depends not only on surface atmospheric conditions but also on crop characteristics the type of irrigation topographic and or soil variations in a region of interest gregory et al 2000 ko and piccinni 2009 although the estimated evapotranspiration is useful for planning research and retrospective estimations are sufficient it has no potential to be applied in near real time water management decision making tang et al 2009 northwestern china is a typical arid and semi arid region with many oases because it is land locked with less than 200 mm per year rainfall more than 2000 mm per year evaporation rates and are controlled by the continental climate shi et al 2007 these oases are entirely dependent on the river feed by tributaries originating in the mountains such as qilian shan tian shan kunlun shan obviously water resources have significantly contributed to economic development and demographic growth in the area in the past half century shah et al 2007 in the oases the economy depends mainly on agriculture supporting its eco environmental functions has become one of the greatest challenges in achieving sustainable water resources management in these areas boehmer et al 2000 chen and xu 2005 jury and vaux 2007 ling et al 2013 natural oasis ecosystems have been drastically and adversely affected by the excessive utilization of water resources in oasis agriculture which is the main consumer of water payero et al 2008 rumbaur et al 2015 in these oases in arid northwestern china agriculture is fully dependent on irrigation where accounts for 70 86 of total water use cheng et al 2004 chang et al 2006 xiong et al 2010 zhao et al 2010 meta analysis provides us with a new possibility in meta analysis the result of each independent experiment is usually expressed as an index of effect the effect estimates are then combined across studies to produce a summary of the findings hedges et al 1999 blankinship and hart 2012 bai et al 2013 li et al 2015 the objectives of this study were a analyze the spatial distribution of land use and soil properties in the oasis region in arid northwestern china b use meta analysis soil variability and satellite data to estimate actual water consumption at the oasis level and c calculate monthly and growing season water consumption in zhangye oasis i e water consumption of the farmland and its protection system of zhangye oasis the hypothesis of this study was water consumption in farmland and in the protection zone of zhangye oasis and it is likely attributable to differences in soil and crop characteristics the results of this study will inform and support water resources management decisions in the oases

assessment q a flags in the database were used to check the quality of the modis ndvi data at each grid all poor quality ndvi data were deleted and replaced with interpolated values obtained from a piecewise cubic and hermite interpolating polynomial zhang et al 2006 then all quality controlled ndvi data for each pixel were smoothed with the savitzky golay filtering method that was widely used for filtering modis ndvi fang et al 2008 a total of 235 soil sampling points in the zhangye oasis were established and the position information was recorded by the global position system gps fig 1 soil data for 153 of those points were obtained from the heihe project data management center of the national natural science fund committee major program http www heihedata org to determine soil properties in the whole study area the other 82 points were added and collected samples and analyzed the soil parameters in this way the sample points would be able to meet the spatial analysis of soil parameters in the whole study area the soil parameters and analysis methods were consistent with 153 soil data the measured parameters included soil bulk density moisture at field capacity and at saturation at each sample point soil was collected with a 200 cm3 soil cutting ring at intervals of 20 cm to 100 cm depth with three replicates analysis methods followed those of liu 1996 averages of the values per sampling point were used as a final measurement value 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 identification of land use in the oasis based on nearly 10 years of cultivation and on current trends in the zhangye oasis landscape patches were classified into ten land use types maize wheat vegetables fruiter forest land wetland water etc vegetation types were differentiated based on ndvi values the ndvi differed with different crop growing seasons and with crop growth stages in this area wheat was planted in mid march maize in the middle of april and resulting in lower values of maize ndvi than those of wheat ndvi in may however in august at the peak of maize growing season maize ndvi was higher than wheat ndvi because wheat condition was yellowed or harvested ndvi for vegetables commercial crops had the same trend as that of maize but it summed only to about 1 pixel because their planting area was smaller compared with the adjacent pixels the pixels of smaller size were vegetables commercial crops data for forest land wetland and water were obtained was from hiwater land cover map of the heihe river basin cold and arid region science data center http westdc westgis ac cn 2 3 2 spatial distribution of soil parameters soil water parameters over the region were predicted using 235 point soil sample data from a mapped reference area and interpolated with gaussian kriging interpolation method goovaerts 1997 1 γ h c 0 c 1 exp 3 h a 2 where c 0 was the nugget effect c was sill and a was range estimations of nearly all spatial interpolation methods can be represented as weighted averages of sampled data simple kriging was based on the following equation 2 z ˆ x 0 i 1 n λ i z x i 1 i 1 n λ i μ where ẑ was the estimated value of an attribute at the point of interest x 0 z was the observed value at the sampled point x i λ i was the weight assigned to the sampled point n represented the number of sampled points used for the estimation webster and oliver 2001 μ was a known stationary mean assumed to be constant over the whole domain and calculated as the average of the data wackernagel 2003 the parameter λ i was kriging weight n was the number of sampled points used for estimation which depended on the size of the search window and μ x0 was the mean of samples within the search window the gaussian covariance function was chosen as the variogram the kriging weights were estimated by minimizing the variance as follows 3 var z ˆ x 0 e z ˆ x 0 z x 0 2 e z ˆ x 0 2 z x 0 2 2 z ˆ x 0 z x 0 i 1 n j 1 n λ i λ j x i x j c x 0 x 0 2 i 1 n λ i c x i x 0 where z x 0 was the

is a statistical technique that allows one to combine the results from multiple studies to glean inferences on the overall importance of various phenomena this method can prove to be more informative than common vote counting in which the number of significant results is compared to the number with nonsignificant results to determine whether the phenomenon of interest is globally important adams et al 1997 it is also more powerful more informative more accurate and less likely to be biased than simple narrative reviews and vote counting e g see hedges and olkin 1985 gurevitch et al 1992 arnqvist and wooster 1995 its purpose is to provide researchers with a statistical tool to summarize synthesize and evaluate independent research studies to reach general conclusions adams et al 1997 the effect size data of crop evapotranspiration etc was extracted the effect size was the natural log transformed response ratio rr used as an index to weigh the response ratio of evapotranspiration to simulated evapotranspiration hedges et al 1999 the rr was calculated as the ratio of the value in the evapotranspiration observation group e t to that in the control group et con the logarithm of rr improved its statistical behavior in meta analyses hedges et al 1999 4 ln r r ln x t x c ln x t ln x c the variance v of the logarithmic effect size was calculated by 5 v s t 2 n t x t 2 s c 2 n c x c 2 where s t and s c were standard deviations s d s e n for the evapotranspiration observation and control groups respectively and n t and n c were the sample sizes for the evapotranspiration observation and control groups respectively the weighting factor w of each observation was calculated as the inverse of the variance 6 w 1 v the grand mean effect size and bias corrected 95 bootstrapped confidence interval ci were calculated for evapotranspiration in the zhangye oasis a fixed effects model in meta win software 2 1 was used to determine whether simulated evapotranspiration significantly affected each variable rosenberg et al 2000 when the number of observations was 20 bootstrapping with 9999 iterations was used to generate confidence intervals cis of effect sizes because confidence limits based on bootstrapping tests were wider than standard confidence limits adams et al 1997 hedges et al 1999 the mean effect size was considered to be significant when its 95 ci did not overlap with zero 2 3 4 the water consumption model evapotranspiration et and infiltration i constituted water consumption w in a pixel i e 7 w e t i evapotranspiration was calculated with meta analysis and further constrained by root water uptake and ndvi it was defined based on the model used by brolsma and bierkens 2007 8 e t n d v i n d v i m f x e t m where et was evapotranspiration mm et m was standard evapotranspiration calculated with meta analysis mm and f x was a root water uptake reduction function dimensionless ndvi was the value of normalized difference vegetation index in a grid during a vegetation growth period and ndvi m was the mean value of normalized difference vegetation index in all grids during vegetation growth period considering modis images involve many issues which reflect vegetation development during vegetation growth remote sensing data can fully reflect its spatial heterogeneity and et m was based on field data which all studies were carried out based on a normal growth state thus eq 5 was modified as follows 9 e t i 1 n n d v i i 1 n m i 1 n j 1 m n d v i i j f x e t m where et was evapotranspiration mm et m was standard evapotranspiration calculated with meta analysis mm ndvi was the value of normalized difference vegetation index in a grid 250 250 m during vegetation growth period i was modis image nper during the growth period i 1 2 3 n and j was all vegetation grid number within oasis j 1 2 3 m a little or no information found to be available in the isi web of science for this oasis for plants other than maize and et m could not be directly assigned values in eq 9 in such cases an adjustment coefficient was introduced based on ndvi into eq 9 10 e t k j i 1 n j 1 m n d v i k i j i 1 n j 1 m

of maize calculated with meta analysis mm and ndvi was the value of normalized difference vegetation index in a grid during a growth period to meet crop water requirements in the zhangye oasis farmers consider water stored in the root volume and maintain saturation irrigation su et al 2002 found that crop growth was not restricted in this area when soil moisture remained at around 70 of field capacity therefore f x was defined similarly to the model used by laio et al 2001 11 f x 0 70 1 s s s f when soil moisture at about 70 of field capacity when soil moisture at about field capacity when soil moisture at more than field capacity where s s and s f were saturation moisture capacity and field capacity respectively i was determined as follows 12 i i c 1 s c j s c m s c max s c min where ic was the irrigation infiltration constant s cj s cm s cmax and s cmin was soil bulk density in j grid mean soil bulk density in all grids maximum and minimum soil bulk density respectively in all grids in the oasis as for evapotranspiration isi web of science did not contain information on the amount of irrigation infiltration for crops other than maize after many years of observation in linze county watering frequency and infiltration were found that they were different for different crops during the growing period to obtain infiltration records about different plants the adjustment coefficient based on et was introduced into eq 12 13 i k j e t k j e t m w i c m 1 s c j s c m s c max s c min where ikj was the infiltration of k in j grid mm i cm was the irrigation infiltration constant for maize based on 4 years continuous observations at the linze inland river basin research station with a mean of 184 9 mm unpublished data etmw is evapotranspiration of maize in the nearest w grid mm however irrigation frequency in forests i e farmland shelterbelts was consistent with that of maize farmland in this region calculation of irrigation infiltration in forests was not adjusted shrubland i e wind breaks and sand fixing forests relied mainly on rainfall and groundwater for survival and irrigation was not involved thus infiltration in shrubland was considered to be zero when f x 0 70 soil moisture was not limiting to crop growth and crop yields were not affected under this condition oasis water consumption was defined as the minimum w min when f x 1 00 soil moisture was sufficient for the growth and yield of crops and oasis water consumption was defined as the optimum w opt when f x s s s f soil moisture far exceeded the needs of crops and oasis water consumption was defined as the maximum w max 3 results 3 1 land use total area of the zhangye oasis was 8618 81 km2 there were 2189 88 km2 of farmland 8 56 km2 of shelterbelt forest or environmental improvement e g

22 56 of the total zhangye oasis area while other farmland uses accounted for smaller proportions of the total area table 1 this was due mainly to available markets and to management costs 3 2 spatial

yield and oasis stability maximum agricultural yield and oasis stability was supported by the maximum water consumption at 1 75 109 m3 in this oasis 4 discussion to irrigated crops over large areas estimation of actual water requirements is still a paramount concern in agriculture abdelhadi et al 2000 ali et al 2000 de azevedo et al 2003 jia and luo 2006 shen et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 chang et al 2015 campos et al 2017 because of severe water shortages in arid and semiarid regions agricultural water requirements should be considered together with those in protection systems such as shelterbelts especially in arid desert oases a great deal of knowledge has enabled us to develop more effective methods for measuring evapotranspiration since the mid 1930s weighing lysimetry has been commonly used to measure evapotranspiration from agronomic crops rangelands forests and orchard crops allen et al 1991 eddy covariance and bowen ratio were regarded as the most accurate methods of estimating evapotranspiration at scales of 0 1 to 1 km rana and katerji 2000 the crop coefficient reference evapotranspiration method was also considered one of the best ways allen 2000 evett et al 1995 allen 2000 eitzinger et al 2002 the use of direct and indirect measurements has proven to be valid for the assessment of crop evapotranspiration at field scales however the implementation of these techniques was restricted by installation and maintenance costs and limited spatial representation campos et al 2017 moreover it was limited by field to field heterogeneity in crop development and cropping systems management which prevented the up scaling of these approaches to larger areas campos et al 2017 based on the development and validation of remote sensing models it can be applied to evapotranspiration measurements over large areas remote sensing methods for estimating evapotranspiration could be divided into two categories the first involves the use of thermal band based energy balance approaches in either one layer or two layer models bastiaanssen et al 1998a b norman et al 1995 glenn et al 2007 kalma et al 2008 the second utilizes reflectance based basal crop coefficients derived from vegetation indices like the well known normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the soil adjusted vegetation index and the enhanced vegetation index these crop coefficients derived from remote sensing are used in water balance models such as penman monteith priestly taylor energy balance water balance method combined with empirical models and most of these studies methods require surface meteorological data in this study area there are only five weather stations fig 1 the availability of surface meteorological data is limited especially in near real time and access to meteorological data was not guaranteed however there are quite a few studies of evapotranspiration at field scales to avoid the scarcity of ground based meteorological data water consumption was estimated based on meta analysis and modis data in this study meta analysis is a very useful statistical technique is also more powerful more informative more accurate and less likely to be biased than simple narrative reviews and vote counting e g see hedges and olkin 1985 gurevitch et al 1992 arnqvist and wooster 1995 and prove to be more informative than common vote counting adams et al 1997 in the study area numerous studies have determined evapotranspiration at field scale providing a basis for the use of meta analysis however the isi web of science returned only 6 literature items containing data usable in our meta analysis table 3 these studies mainly focused on maize at field scale and with full irrigation probably because maize had the largest planting area and was a major crop in the oasis little research was available on other plants in this oasis with this method mean maize evapotranspiration was 655 91 20 53 mm and was considered at a normal growth state combined with modis data and soil water physical parameters minimum water consumption in the zhangye oasis was 1 14 109 m3 the optimum was 1 46 109 m3 and maximum was 1 75 109 m3 it provided greater insight into the water consumption to inform water resources management decision making in zhangye oasis region arid zone of northwestern china calculated maximum water consumption calculated in this study was lower than that analyzed with the coupled ground water land surface model for the middle reaches of the heihe river of 1 93 109 m3 tian et al 2012 and this data was very big difference compared to the results that difference maybe because 3 0 3 0 500 km grid and be limited by surface meteorological data was used especially in near real time where meteorological observation sites are few study area was presented here a first attempt to understand land use distribution however the modis data used was only at 250 m pixel at this resolution the shelterbelt and shelterbelt net could not be identified with 2 or 2 6 rows with spacing of 1 0 m 1 0 m in the interior of the oasis without specific identification the area in shelterbelts can only be classified as that of crops this undoubtedly underestimated water consumption in the oasis modis data were available only for 8 or 16 days which may not indicate how water should be distributed over the area of interest to improve the efficiency of irrigation in this oasis in future research both high spatial resolution 10 m and higher data frequency day needs to be used to this method it will be more feasible for the operational monitoring of water use water requirements and irrigation at a regional scale 5 conclusions the results of this study improved the understanding of the spatial distribution of land use types of soil properties and of water consumption in an oasis region analysis methods were appropriate for applications at regional scales with the use of meta analysis modis ndvi products and soil water physical parameters these results provide insight into the spatial variation of water consumption and allow water resources management to improve the efficiency of irrigation and water resources management in the zhangye oasis northwestern china mean monthly optimum water consumption was 83 32 25 73 mm 164 51 44 84 mm 163 05 42 77 mm 151 33 40 20 mm and 101 61

11396,a severe water shortage in arid and semiarid regions in china has triggered regulations limiting the use of irrigation water in desert oasis agricultural systems to determine the actual water demand of agricultural systems and to develop standards for a rational use of water resources maize evapotranspiration rates was simulated using meta analysis of published data determined land use and soil properties in zhangye oasis area and then estimated water consumption with modis for arid northwestern china for the 2014 growing season farmland in zhangye oasis totaled 2189 88 km2 and accounted for 25 41 of the total oasis area crop protecting forestland totaled 8 56 km2 and accounted for 0 10 of the total oasis area grassland and unutilized land accounted for 1 85 71 48 of the

plant growth economic social development and rapid increases in human population resulted in increased water demands and severe water shortages in some areas especially in arid and semiarid regions cheng et al 2009 chen et al 2011 jury and vaux 2007 vorosmarty et al 2000 water supply and demand associated scientific problems have caused widespread concerns among many governments scientists and the public alcamo et al 2007 oki and kanae 2006 shen and chen 2010 xia and zhang 2008 in arid and semiarid regions the economy depends mainly on agriculture to establish data driven water resources management in these conditions it is necessary to determine water use of all crops recently many researchers have concentrated on crop water requirements in arid regions abdelhadi et al 2000 ali et al

monteith and unsworth 1990 chang et al 2015 zhao and zhao 2015 further modeled crop evapotranspiration at each scale is based on the interactions of complex physical and physiological phenomena dauzat et al 2001 in fact accurate estimation of canopy transpiration plays an important role in determining irrigation needs in the region these diverse applications typically require knowledge of the distribution of evapotranspiration rates across catchments and regions cleugh et al 2007 leuning et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 a major limitation however is that measurements are mostly made at a point scale zhao et al 2010 shen et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 zhao and zhao 2015 chang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 because remotely sensed rs methods can provide the spatial and temporal continuity change of normalized difference vegetation index and land use types it has long been regarded as the best tools for determination of spatially distributed evapotranspiration fluxes several approaches combined satellite data to estimate actual et have been developed such as the penman monteith method tasumi et al 2005 consoli et al 2006 cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2007 2011 yuan et al 2010 zhang et al 2008

evapotranspiration across catchments and regions and some have been used in water management tasumi et al 2005 consoli et al 2006 tang et al 2009 a major drawback of most of the earlier studies was the requirement for meteorological data the availability of which was often limited especially in near real time and few meteorological observation sites temesgen et al 1999 voogt 2006 collins 2011 cruz blanco et al 2014 for example meteorological observatories are scarce and mainly concentrated in densely populated areas in the arid northwestern part of china moreover crop characteristics irrigation type topographic and or soil variations were not considered however crop water use depends not only on surface atmospheric conditions but also on crop characteristics the type of irrigation topographic and or soil variations in a region of interest gregory et al 2000 ko and piccinni 2009 although the estimated evapotranspiration is useful for planning research and retrospective estimations are sufficient it has no potential to be applied in near real time water management decision making tang et al 2009 northwestern china is a typical arid and semi arid region with many oases because it is land locked with less than 200 mm per year rainfall more than 2000 mm per year evaporation rates and are controlled by the continental climate shi et al 2007 these oases are entirely dependent on the river feed by tributaries originating in the mountains such as qilian shan tian shan kunlun shan obviously water resources have significantly contributed to economic development and demographic growth in the area in the past half century shah et al 2007 in the oases the economy depends mainly on agriculture supporting its eco environmental functions has become one of the greatest challenges in achieving sustainable water resources management in these areas boehmer et al 2000 chen and xu 2005 jury and vaux 2007 ling et al 2013 natural oasis ecosystems have been drastically and adversely affected by the excessive utilization of water resources in oasis agriculture which is the main consumer of water payero et al 2008 rumbaur et al 2015 in these oases in arid northwestern china agriculture is fully dependent on irrigation where accounts for 70 86 of total water use cheng et al 2004 chang et al 2006 xiong et al 2010 zhao et al 2010 meta analysis provides us with a new possibility in meta analysis the result of each independent experiment is usually expressed as an index of effect the effect estimates are then combined across studies to produce a summary of the findings hedges et al 1999 blankinship and hart 2012 bai et al 2013 li et al 2015 the objectives of this study were a analyze the spatial distribution of land use and soil properties in the oasis region in arid northwestern china b use meta analysis soil variability and satellite data to estimate actual water consumption at the oasis level and c calculate monthly and growing season water consumption in zhangye oasis i e water consumption of the farmland and its protection system of zhangye oasis the hypothesis of this study was water consumption in farmland and in the protection zone of zhangye oasis and it is likely attributable to differences in soil and crop characteristics the results of this study will inform and support water resources management decisions in the oases

from april 23rd to september 30th 2014 for a 250 m modis pixel the modis ndvi data provide reasonable estimates of land use except for june 26 data because they contained stripes and data illegible initial modis products exhibited a hierarchical structure of data management hdf hierarchical data format sine curve projection storage containing multiple data types first mod13q1 products were converted from sine curve projection hdf file for geotiff file format under the world geodetic system 1984 wgs84 longitude and latitude coordinate system using modis reprojection tools mrt software of national aeronautics and space administration nasa second after projection transformation mosaic orbit and resembling operation processing were applied finally data for analysis were obtained quality assessment q a flags in the database were used to check the quality of the modis ndvi data at each grid all poor quality ndvi data were deleted and replaced with interpolated values obtained from a piecewise cubic and hermite interpolating polynomial zhang et al 2006 then all quality controlled ndvi data for each pixel were smoothed with the savitzky golay filtering method that was widely used for filtering modis ndvi fang et al 2008 a total of 235 soil sampling points in the zhangye oasis were established and the position information was recorded by the global position system gps fig 1 soil data for 153 of those points were obtained from the heihe project data management center of the national natural science fund committee major program http www heihedata org to determine soil properties in the whole study area the other 82 points were added and collected samples and analyzed the soil parameters in this way the sample points would be able to meet the spatial analysis of soil parameters in the whole study area the soil parameters and analysis methods were consistent with 153 soil data the measured parameters included soil bulk density moisture at field capacity and at saturation at each sample point soil was collected with a 200 cm3 soil cutting ring at intervals of 20 cm to 100 cm depth with three replicates analysis methods followed those of liu 1996 averages of the values per sampling point were used as a final measurement value 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 identification of land use in the oasis based on nearly 10 years of cultivation and on current trends in the zhangye oasis landscape patches were classified into ten land use types maize wheat vegetables fruiter forest land wetland water etc vegetation types were differentiated based on ndvi values the ndvi differed with different crop growing seasons and with crop growth stages in this area wheat was planted in mid march maize in the middle of april and resulting in lower values of maize ndvi than those of wheat ndvi in may however in august at the peak of maize growing season maize ndvi was higher than wheat ndvi because wheat condition was yellowed or harvested ndvi for vegetables commercial crops had the same trend as that of maize but it summed only to about 1 pixel because their planting area was smaller compared with the adjacent pixels the pixels of smaller size were vegetables commercial crops data for forest land wetland and water were obtained was from hiwater land cover map of the heihe river basin cold and arid region science data center http westdc westgis ac cn 2 3 2 spatial distribution of soil parameters soil water parameters over the region were predicted using 235 point soil sample data from a mapped reference area and interpolated with gaussian kriging interpolation method goovaerts 1997 1 γ h c 0 c 1 exp 3 h a 2 where c 0 was the nugget effect c was sill and a was range estimations of nearly all spatial interpolation methods can be represented as weighted averages of sampled data simple kriging was based on the following equation 2 z ˆ x 0 i 1 n λ i z x i 1 i 1 n λ i μ where ẑ was the estimated value of an attribute at the point of interest x 0 z was the observed value at the sampled point x i λ i was the weight assigned to the sampled point n represented the number of sampled points used for the estimation webster and oliver 2001 μ was a known stationary mean assumed to be constant over the whole domain and calculated as the average of the data wackernagel 2003 the parameter λ i was kriging weight n was the number of sampled points used for estimation which depended on the size of the search window and μ x0 was the mean of samples within the search window the gaussian covariance function was chosen as the variogram the kriging weights were estimated by minimizing the variance as follows 3 var z ˆ x 0 e z ˆ x 0 z x 0 2 e z ˆ x 0 2 z x 0 2 2 z ˆ x 0 z x 0 i 1 n j 1 n λ i λ j x i x j c x 0 x 0 2 i 1 n λ i c x i x 0 where z x 0 was the

is a statistical technique that allows one to combine the results from multiple studies to glean inferences on the overall importance of various phenomena this method can prove to be more informative than common vote counting in which the number of significant results is compared to the number with nonsignificant results to determine whether the phenomenon of interest is globally important adams et al 1997 it is also more powerful more informative more accurate and less likely to be biased than simple narrative reviews and vote counting e g see hedges and olkin 1985 gurevitch et al 1992 arnqvist and wooster 1995 its purpose is to provide researchers with a statistical tool to summarize synthesize and evaluate independent research studies to reach general conclusions adams et al 1997 the effect size data of crop evapotranspiration etc was extracted the effect size was the natural log transformed response ratio rr used as an index to weigh the response ratio of evapotranspiration to simulated evapotranspiration hedges et al 1999 the rr was calculated as the ratio of the value in the evapotranspiration observation group e t to that in the control group et con the logarithm of rr improved its statistical behavior in meta analyses hedges et al 1999 4 ln r r ln x t x c ln x t ln x c the variance v of the logarithmic effect size was calculated by 5 v s t 2 n t x t 2 s c 2 n c x c 2 where s t and s c were standard deviations s d s e n for the evapotranspiration observation and control groups respectively and n t and n c were the sample sizes for the evapotranspiration observation and control groups respectively the weighting factor w of each observation was calculated as the inverse of the variance 6 w 1 v the grand mean effect size and bias corrected 95 bootstrapped confidence interval ci were calculated for evapotranspiration in the zhangye oasis a fixed effects model in meta win software 2 1 was used to determine whether simulated evapotranspiration significantly affected each variable rosenberg et al 2000 when the number of observations was 20 bootstrapping with 9999 iterations was used to generate confidence intervals cis of effect sizes because confidence limits based on bootstrapping tests were wider than standard confidence limits adams et al 1997 hedges et al 1999 the mean effect size was considered to be significant when its 95 ci did not overlap with zero 2 3 4 the water consumption model evapotranspiration et and infiltration i constituted water consumption w in a pixel i e 7 w e t i evapotranspiration was calculated with meta analysis and further constrained by root water uptake and ndvi it was defined based on the model used by brolsma and bierkens 2007 8 e t n d v i n d v i m f x e t m where et was evapotranspiration mm et m was standard evapotranspiration calculated with meta analysis mm and f x was a root water uptake reduction function dimensionless ndvi was the value of normalized difference vegetation index in a grid during a vegetation growth period and ndvi m was the mean value of normalized difference vegetation index in all grids during vegetation growth period considering modis images involve many issues which reflect vegetation development during vegetation growth remote sensing data can fully reflect its spatial heterogeneity and et m was based on field data which all studies were carried out based on a normal growth state thus eq 5 was modified as follows 9 e t i 1 n n d v i i 1 n m i 1 n j 1 m n d v i i j f x e t m where et was evapotranspiration mm et m was standard evapotranspiration calculated with meta analysis mm ndvi was the value of normalized difference vegetation index in a grid 250 250 m during vegetation growth period i was modis image nper during the growth period i 1 2 3 n and j was all vegetation grid number within oasis j 1 2 3 m a little or no information found to be available in the isi web of science for this oasis for plants other than maize and et m could not be directly assigned values in eq 9 in such cases an adjustment coefficient was introduced based on ndvi into eq 9 10 e t k j i 1 n j 1 m n d v i k i j i 1 n j 1 m n d v i m i j i 1 n n d v i k i j 1 n m i 1 n j 1 m n d v i k i j f x e t m m where etkj was evapotranspiration in j grid mm k represented a vegetation type et mm was the standard evapotranspiration of maize calculated with meta analysis mm and ndvi was the value of normalized difference vegetation index in a grid during a growth period to meet crop water requirements in the zhangye oasis farmers consider water stored in the root volume and maintain saturation irrigation su et al 2002 found that crop growth was not restricted in this area when soil moisture remained at around 70 of field capacity therefore f x was defined similarly to the model used by laio et al 2001 11 f x 0 70 1 s s s f when soil moisture at about 70 of field capacity when soil moisture at about field capacity when soil moisture at more than field capacity where s s and s f were saturation moisture capacity and field capacity respectively i was determined as follows 12 i i c 1 s c j s c m s c max s c min where ic was the irrigation infiltration constant s cj s cm s cmax and s cmin was soil bulk density in j grid mean soil bulk density in all grids maximum and minimum soil bulk density respectively in all grids in the oasis as for evapotranspiration isi web of science did not contain information on the amount of irrigation infiltration for crops other than maize after many years of observation in linze county watering frequency and infiltration were found that they were different for different crops during the growing period to obtain infiltration records about different plants the adjustment coefficient based on et was introduced into eq 12 13 i k j e t k j e t m w i c m 1 s c j s c m s c max s c min where ikj was the infiltration of k in j grid mm i cm was the irrigation infiltration constant for maize based on 4 years continuous observations at the linze inland river basin research station with a mean of 184 9 mm unpublished data etmw is evapotranspiration of maize in the nearest w grid mm however irrigation frequency in forests i e farmland shelterbelts was consistent with that of maize farmland in this region calculation of irrigation infiltration in forests was not adjusted shrubland i e wind breaks and sand fixing forests relied mainly on rainfall and groundwater for survival and irrigation was not involved thus infiltration in shrubland was considered to be zero when f x 0 70 soil moisture was not limiting to crop growth and crop yields were not affected under this condition oasis water consumption was defined as the minimum w min when f x 1 00 soil moisture was sufficient for the growth and yield of crops and oasis water consumption was defined as the optimum w opt when f x s s s f soil moisture far exceeded the needs of crops and oasis water consumption was defined as the maximum w max 3 results 3 1 land use total area of the zhangye oasis was 8618 81 km2 there were 2189 88 km2 of farmland 8 56 km2 of shelterbelt forest or environmental improvement e g

22 56 of the total zhangye oasis area while other farmland uses accounted for smaller proportions of the total area table 1 this was due mainly to available markets and to management costs 3 2 spatial

yield and oasis stability maximum agricultural yield and oasis stability was supported by the maximum water consumption at 1 75 109 m3 in this oasis 4 discussion to irrigated crops over large areas estimation of actual water requirements is still a paramount concern in agriculture abdelhadi et al 2000 ali et al 2000 de azevedo et al 2003 jia and luo 2006 shen et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 chang et al 2015 campos et al 2017 because of severe water shortages in arid and semiarid regions agricultural water requirements should be considered together with those in protection systems such as shelterbelts especially in arid desert oases a great deal of knowledge has enabled us to develop more effective methods for measuring evapotranspiration since the mid 1930s weighing lysimetry has been commonly used to measure evapotranspiration from agronomic crops rangelands forests and orchard crops allen et al 1991 eddy covariance and bowen ratio were regarded as the most accurate methods of estimating evapotranspiration at scales of 0 1 to 1 km rana and katerji 2000 the crop coefficient reference evapotranspiration method was also considered one of the best ways allen 2000 evett et al 1995 allen 2000 eitzinger et al 2002 the use of direct and indirect measurements has proven to be valid for the assessment of crop evapotranspiration at field scales however the implementation of these techniques was restricted by installation and maintenance costs and limited spatial representation campos et al 2017 moreover it was limited by field to field heterogeneity in crop development and cropping systems management which prevented the up scaling of these approaches to larger areas campos et al 2017 based on the development and validation of remote sensing models it can be applied to evapotranspiration measurements over large areas remote sensing methods for estimating evapotranspiration could be divided into two categories the first involves the use of thermal band based energy balance approaches in either one layer or two layer models bastiaanssen et al 1998a b norman et al 1995 glenn et al 2007 kalma et al 2008 the second utilizes reflectance based basal crop coefficients derived from vegetation indices like the well known normalized difference vegetation index ndvi the soil adjusted vegetation index and the enhanced vegetation index these crop coefficients derived from remote sensing are used in water balance models such as penman monteith priestly taylor energy balance water balance method combined with empirical models and most of these studies methods require surface meteorological data in this study area there are only five weather stations fig 1 the availability of surface meteorological data is limited especially in near real time and access to meteorological data was not guaranteed however there are quite a few studies of evapotranspiration at field scales to avoid the scarcity of ground based meteorological data water consumption was estimated based on meta analysis and modis data in this study meta analysis is a very useful statistical technique is also more powerful more informative more accurate and less likely to be biased than simple narrative reviews and vote counting e g see hedges and olkin 1985 gurevitch et al 1992 arnqvist and wooster 1995 and prove to be more informative than common vote counting adams et al 1997 in the study area numerous studies have determined evapotranspiration at field scale providing a basis for the use of meta analysis however the isi web of science returned only 6 literature items containing data usable in our meta analysis table 3 these studies mainly focused on maize at field scale and with full irrigation probably because maize had the largest planting area and was a major crop in the oasis little research was available on other plants in this oasis with this method mean maize evapotranspiration was 655 91 20 53 mm and was considered at a normal growth state combined with modis data and soil water physical parameters minimum water consumption in the zhangye oasis was 1 14 109 m3 the optimum was 1 46 109 m3 and maximum was 1 75 109 m3 it provided greater insight into the water consumption to inform water resources management decision making in zhangye oasis region arid zone of northwestern china calculated maximum water consumption calculated in this study was lower than that analyzed with the coupled ground water land surface model for the middle reaches of the heihe river of 1 93 109 m3 tian et al 2012 and this data was very big difference compared to the results that difference maybe because 3 0 3 0 500 km grid and be limited by surface meteorological data was used especially in near real time where meteorological observation sites are few study area was presented here a first attempt to understand land use distribution however the modis data used was only at 250 m pixel at this resolution the shelterbelt and shelterbelt net could not be identified with 2 or 2 6 rows with spacing of 1 0 m 1 0 m in the interior of the oasis without specific identification the area in shelterbelts can only be classified as that of crops this undoubtedly underestimated water consumption in the oasis modis data were available only for 8 or 16 days which may not indicate how water should be distributed over the area of interest to improve the efficiency of irrigation in this oasis in future research both high spatial resolution 10 m and higher data frequency day needs to be used to this method it will be more feasible for the operational monitoring of water use water requirements and irrigation at a regional scale 5 conclusions the results of this study improved the understanding of the spatial distribution of land use types of soil properties and of water consumption in an oasis region analysis methods were appropriate for applications at regional scales with the use of meta analysis modis ndvi products and soil water physical parameters these results provide insight into the spatial variation of water consumption and allow water resources management to improve the efficiency of irrigation and water resources management in the zhangye oasis northwestern china mean monthly optimum water consumption was 83 32 25 73 mm 164 51 44 84 mm 163 05 42 77 mm 151 33 40 20 mm and 101 61 28 88 mm for may through september respectively during the 2014 growing season water consumption reached 1 14 109 m3 to ensure agricultural production and oasis stability and 1 46 109 m3 to ensure

irrigation water use efficiency yield winter wheat 1 introduction winter wheat is one of the most important crops in the semi arid regions of china and more than 60 of wheat grown in china is grown there however minimal precipitation and uneven rainfall distributions are major factors affecting production and water use efficiency wue in these regions de santana et al 2015 and the only practice to maintain sustainable crop productivity is efficient use of irrigation water richards 2000 kang et al 2002 therefore effective water saving agricultural technologies urgently need to be developed to maintain high productivity and enhance wue sun et al 2011 precipitation is one of the key water resources in semi arid regions han et al 2004 and uneven or insufficient precipitation have major negative effects on crop production therefore it is important to efficiently use light rainfall and increase soil water storage liao et al 2003 the ridge furrow r precipitation harvesting system with plastic film mulching has been commonly implemented in semi arid regions to preserve rainwater in the root zone of crops wang et al 2008 ridges covered with plastic film mulching and limited irrigation have been studied as an extremely effective strategy with great potential for decreasing soil evaporation and enhancing soil water storage as well as crop growth and yield and wue oweis and hachum 2006 zhang et al 2000 however most of the studies focused on fixed amounts of irrigation and did not consider the effect of crop cultivation techniques on the irrigation amount water consumption and crop production therefore studies that focus on cultivation techniques and use supplemental irrigation and simulated rainfall are needed in order to develop effective water saving agricultural in semi arid regions photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence are the physiological processes that are most sensitive to water stress pan et al 2014 several studies indicated that soil water content significantly affected photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and wheat production yang et al 2000 luo et al 2011 it is generally recognized that increasing soil water content through micro rainwater collection methods can help increase co2 diffusion from the atmosphere to the site of carboxylation due to stomatal opening and increased mesophyll conductance which in turn contributes to an increase in net photosynthetic rate and the content stability index and fluorescence of chlorophyll ashraf and harris 2013 chaves and oliveira 2004 previous studies reported that water scarcity that occurs during flowering and grain filling stages can inhibit and reduce the period of photosynthesis and significantly increase flag leaf senescence which may reduce the contribution of pre flowering assimilates to grains xue et al 2006 wu et al 2014 the r system with supplemental irrigation could improve the stomatal regulation of plants and also sustain the physiological function of the photosynthetic apparatus by increasing chlorophyll content and fluorescence damatta et al 2002 chlorophyll fluorescence an important component of plant photosynthesis can be used as an indicator to evaluate yield performance and it is sensitive to water deficit zivcak et al 2013 xu et al 2014 fluorescence measurements could be widely used to study photosynthetic performance in leaves and they can provide useful information on physical changes in pigment protein complexes and the electron transport rate through psii govindjee 2004 baker rosenqvist 2004 water

of psii tambussi et al 2005 hura et al 2007 photosynthetic activities of plants are improved under micro rainwater harvesting with plastic film mulching compared to conventional flat planting with plastic film mulching hossain et al 2011 however knowledge of how winter wheat photosynthesis fluorescence and production are affected by different cultivation modes with supplemental irrigation under simulated rainfall conditions is relatively limited thus the main objective of the study was to determine whether photosynthesis chlorophyll content and fluorescence and production of wheat are affected by cultivation modes with supplemental irrigation under simulated rainfall conditions we believe that the results can be used to explore the interactive effect of cultivation modes with supplemental irrigation under simulated rainfall conditions and provide a scientific basis for improving winter wheat production in semi arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description

detail about the precipitation conditions can be seen in table 1 the amount of rainwater used for this study was reasonably similar to natural rainfall amounts of semi arid regions using a precise water meter half of the supplemental irrigation was supplied on december 12 2015 and december 15 2016 before the re wintering stage and the other half was supplied on march 28 2016 and march 25 2017

the seed filling and harvesting stages fig 3 the swc at the flowering and seed filling stages at depths of 0 60 cm increased while at depths of 60 200 cm the swc decreased under both planting patterns furthermore the swc increased under both planting models as the precipitation and limited irrigation levels increased however at the maturity stage the swc under the r technique increased compared to f treatment at depths of 0 80 cm this demonstrated that the r system the wheat crops took up less water from deeper soil layers compared to the crops in the f planting treatment the f planting had higher soil temperatures compared to the r technique under different precipitation and limited irrigation levels during the seed filling and harvesting stages fig 4 the f375 treatment the soil

mm supplemental irrigation respectively the etr and φpsii values under the r1150 and r2150 treatments were significantly higher at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages compared to f1150 and f2150 treatments in both study years there were no significant differences in etr and φpsii values at simulated rainfall of 275 mm and 200 mm under both cultivation modes at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages 3 5 variable fluorescence fv and maximum quantum efficiency of psii fv fm under both cultivation modes the fv and psii fv fm values of winter wheat significantly improved with increasing supplemental irrigation and simulated rainfall levels at different growth stages the fv and fv fm values of flag leaves were not significantly different between jointing and flowering stage

treatments but the trend of et rate in each year was similar table 4 the r system under supplemental irrigation with simulated precipitation significantly p 0 05 reduced the et rate compared to f planting in each study year the average of data from both years indicated that the r cultivation model increased soil water and decreased soil evaporation and as a result significantly reduced the et rate by 35 8 in 2015 16 and by 26 9 in 2016 17 compared to f planting the average over both years indicated that et of r1150 and r175 treatments were significantly decreased by 28 1 and 27 8 compared to f1150 and f175 treatments the mean et rate of r2150 and r275 treatments were significantly decreased by 32 7 and 33 7 compared with f2150 and f275 treatments respectively the et rate was

rainfall levels under both cultivation modes but differences were not significant when the precipitation was more than 200 mm the wue improved with increasing grain yield the average of data from both years indicated that wue under the r cultivation model significantly increased by 58 6 in 2015 16 and by 78 4 in 2016 17 compared to the f planting mode the mean wue over both study years indicated

treatment the grain yield was highest under the r system with 150 mm supplemental irrigation and 200 mm rainfall concentration compared with f planting the average grain yield over both years revealed that the r system increased soil water and decreased et rate at the field scale as a result the r system produced a significantly higher grain yield of 0 79 t ha 1 compared with f planting when compared to f2150 and f275 treatments the average grain yield of data from both years revealed that r2150 and r275 treatments were significantly improved by 1 19 t ha 1 and 1 15 t ha 1 respectively 4 discussion in the semi arid areas of china crop productivity can be restricted by poor photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence due to water deficits and irregular precipitation distribution which leads to pronounced drought stress during critical growth stages of the winter wheat crop baker and rosenqvist 2004 wang et al 2009 results of this study indicated that both cultivation modes with supplemental irrigation affect crop photosynthesis chlorophyll fluorescence and yield under simulated rainfall conditions water deficits induce stomatal closure affecting diffusion of co2 from the air to the cell interior reddy et al 2004 which is the main reason for reduced pn value during water scarcity conditions effects of deficit irrigation develop inside plant tissue leading to significantly improved photosynthesis cui et al 2015 this study also confirmed that the average pn values under the r system with 150 mm supplemental irrigation were significantly higher than those of f planting by 14 5 10 4 and 25 8 under 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm simulated precipitation levels respectively the r system had significantly higher effects on the pn value of winter wheat at each irrigation and simulated rainfall level during the grain filling stage compared with f planting several studies have revealed that pn and chlorophyll content in wheat were increased under precipitation harvesting systems with plastic film compared to flat planting without plastic mulching wu et al 2004 ding et al 2004 the pn value is reduced at the grain filling stage when leaves start to senesce and the photosynthetic machine is disassembled quickly within chloroplasts brouwer et al 2012 this senescence is linked to the decline in photosynthetic capacity of leaves and can be intensified by light rainfall yang et al 2003 saeedipour and moradi 2011 the r system with plastic mulch has been shown to reduce rainfall water losses reduces evaporation and improves soil moisture content zhao et al 2014 we found that the r technique can considerably increase the swc among soil layers at depths of 0 200 cm compared to f planting at the flowering and seed filling stage the swc between 0 60 cm increased while from 60 to 200 cm the swc decreased under both planting patterns at the maturity stage the swc increased under the r technique compared to f at soil depths of 0 80 cm showing that the r system results in less water uptake from deeper soil layers compared to that of f planting a study by wang et al 2015 showed that the r technique with 340 mm of simulated rainfall can retain more rainwater in the soil than f planting practices thereby reducing soil temperature another reason that soil temperatures are reduced when utilizing the r system is better usage of light rains hu et al 2014 greater rainfall conservation in soils was a key reason why the soil moisture was higher under r cultivation than in f planting chen et al 2013 ren et al 2016 previous research has confirmed that the r technique can decrease soil temperature li et al 2013 and increase soil moisture li et al 2001 thereby increasing grain yield we also found that the f planting pattern resulted in higher soil temperatures compared to the r technique under with all precipitation and irrigation levels during the seed filling and harvesting stages fig 4 additionally the soil temperature was higher under the f375 treatment than that of the r1150 and r2150 treatments at the seed filling stage an earlier study also revealed that r cultivation can decrease soil temperature and improve soil moisture li et al 2001 thereby significantly increasing winter wheat yields duan et al 2006 the decline in total chl contents and chlorophyll stability index csi might be caused by leaves being injured and turning yellowish due to water scarcity and light rainfall in semi arid regions tahi et al 2007 the total chl ab contents of winter wheat significantly increased with increasing supplemental irrigation and rainfall concentrations under both cultivation modes in this study table 3 the average of data from both years showed that total chl ab contents under the r system with 150 mm supplemental irrigation were significantly higher than those of f planting by 65 2 62 5 and 53 8 under 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm simulated rainfall levels respectively previous studies reported that water stress leads to the production of reactive oxygen species ros such as o2 and h2o2 which lead to damaged chlorophyll and reduced csi jianguo et al 2017 wang et al 2016 the csi was significantly higher under the r cultivation mode at each supplemental irrigation and simulated rainfall condition table 3 however the average over both years indicated that r1150 and r2150 treatments had higher csi than the r3150 treatment by 89 9 and 88 3 respectively the pn value is directly affected by total chl contents csi and chlorophyll fluorescence all of which decreased considerably under drought stress reducing photosynthesis and crop production wang et al 2016 rudzani et al 2017 the photosynthetic characters of wheat especially psii photochemistry respond positively to water shortage and provide valuable information on psii photochemistry and photosynthetic metabolism under water stress kastori et al 2000 tahi et al 2007 in our study all chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were affected to some extent by cultivation mode deficit irrigation and simulated rainfall our results show that the peak etr and φpsii asset value were recorded under the r1150 treatment at the flowering stage but etr was not significantly different from the jointing stage the etr and φpsii values were reduced by the grain filling stage but the differences between r1150 and r2150 treatments were not significant earlier studies reported that the etr value decreased under water stress showing that etr ability was decreased possibly due to photochemical down regulation and the dark reaction was blocked which reduced photosynthesis lu et al 2002 elazab et al 2016 decreased etr led to the generation of excess excitation energy which in turn caused serious photo inhibition under light and uneven rainfall distribution tezara et al 2005 in the present study the r system had significantly higher effects on the etr and φpsii values of winter wheat flag leaves at each irrigation and simulated rainfall level during the flowering stage compared with f planting there were no significant differences in etr and φpsii values at simulated rainfall levels of 275 mm and 200 mm under both cultivation models at jointing flowering and grain filling stages previous studies have reported that water scarcity and light rainfall decrease etr fv fm and φpsii values osorio et al 1998 wang et al 2016 the fv fm value can be used to detect damage to psii and leaf photosynthetic efficiency chutia and borah 2012 numerous studies have confirmed destruction to the psii oxygen evolving complex and the psii reaction centers and in turn degradation of d1 protein under water scarcity conditions jianguo et al 2017 rudzani et al 2017 photo inhibition is denoted by declining fv fm φpsii and etr schapendonk et al 1989 decreases in the fv fm and etr values by water stress may be the result of calvin cycle disturbances and can induce psii down regulation wang et al 2016 jianguo et al 2017 the fv fv fm fv fo and fv fmʹ values of flag leaves significantly increased from jointing to flowering stage in the present study however fv fv fm fv fo and fv fmʹ values quickly decreased from flowering to grain filling stage of the same treatments in both study years figs 5 and 6 the fv fv fm fv fo and fv fmʹ values of flag leaves were reasonably higher under the r1150 and r2150 treatments compared with the f1150 and f2150 treatments at different growth stages of winter wheat crop during grain filling stages the fv fv fm fv fo and fv fmʹ values of flag leaves were significantly higher under the r system at each supplemental irrigation and precipitation level as compared with the f planting mode the fv fm fv fo and fv fmʹ values will only work for measuring water stress in c3 plants due to photorespiration jianguo et al 2017 rudzani et al 2017 under the r2150 treatment the fv fo value at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages were significantly increased by 2 9 3 0 and 7 3 respectively and the fv fmʹ values were significantly increased by 8 8 3 3 and 3 3 respectively compared to the f2150 treatment terzi et al 2010 reported that decreases in the fv fm fv fo and fv fmʹ values might reduce the net photosynthesis rate thereby affecting plant development and crop production the ridges covered with plastic film mulch can improve soil water and nutrients status compared to planting without plastic film oweis and hachum 2006 ali et al 2017 the micro rainwater collecting system can increase the soil moisture and reduce et during wheat growing season and improve wue zhang et al 2005 plastic film improves soil moisture supply during reproductive growth stages oweis and hachum 2006 our results showed that wue and grain yield significantly increased with increasing supplemental irrigation and rainfall levels under both cultivation modes but differences were not significant when the precipitation was higher than 200 mm the wue improved with increasing grain yield the r system improved soil moisture which enhanced photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters during the later growth stages and resulted in higher wue and wheat production huang et al 2005 the average over both years indicated that wue under the r cultivation mode significantly increased by 58 6 in 2015 16 and 78 4 in 2016 17 compared to the f planting model the average grain yield of both years revealed that the r system increased soil water and decreased et rate at the field scale as a result the r system produced a significantly higher maximum grain yield of 0 79 t ha 1 compared with f planting it has been reported that ridges covered with plastic film could significantly prolong photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence duration and produce higher wue and yield zhang et al 2005 the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of winter wheat were significantly positively correlated with the pn total chl wue and grain yield except et and soil tempeature table 5 our results suggest that the r2150 treatment was the best cultivation practice for improving photosynthesis chlorophyll fluorescence wue and production in semi arid areas 5 conclusion in conclusion the

fluorescence fv energy transformation potential of psii fv fo and leaf photosynthetic performance index of psⅱ fv fmʹ at the jointing flowering and later stages of grain filling were obtained under the r2150 treatment these maximum values were due to increases in moisture content total chlorophyll ab contents and chlorophyll stability index csi of flag leaves and reduced et at the field scale all of which increased the grain yield and water use efficiency it is hypothesized that the r cultivation mode can ensue appropriate soil moisture conditions at critical growth stages the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of winter wheat were significantly positively correlated with the pn total chl wue and grain yield except et and soil temperature in this experiment it is necessary for winter wheat to adopt r system in regions with an annual rainfall below 275 mm therefore we recommend that the r system could be suitable for regions within 200 mm rainfall to make the system be adopted for

irrigation water use efficiency yield winter wheat 1 introduction winter wheat is one of the most important crops in the semi arid regions of china and more than 60 of wheat grown in china is grown there however minimal precipitation and uneven rainfall distributions are major factors affecting production and water use efficiency wue in these regions de santana et al 2015 and the only practice to maintain sustainable crop productivity is efficient use of irrigation water richards 2000 kang et al 2002 therefore effective water saving agricultural technologies urgently need to be developed to maintain high productivity and enhance wue sun et al 2011 precipitation is one of the key water resources in semi arid regions han et al 2004 and uneven or insufficient precipitation have major negative effects on crop production therefore it is important to efficiently use light rainfall and increase soil water storage liao et al 2003 the ridge furrow r precipitation harvesting system with plastic film mulching has been commonly implemented in semi arid regions to preserve rainwater in the root zone of crops wang et al 2008 ridges covered with plastic film mulching and limited irrigation have been studied as an extremely effective strategy with great potential for decreasing soil evaporation and enhancing soil water storage as well as crop growth and yield and wue oweis and hachum 2006 zhang et al 2000 however most of the studies focused on fixed amounts of irrigation and did not consider the effect of crop cultivation techniques on the irrigation amount water consumption and crop production therefore studies that focus on cultivation techniques and use supplemental irrigation and simulated rainfall are needed in order to develop effective water saving agricultural in semi arid regions photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence are the physiological processes that are most sensitive to water stress pan et al 2014 several studies indicated that soil water content significantly affected photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and wheat production yang et al 2000 luo et al 2011 it is generally recognized that increasing soil water content through micro rainwater collection methods can help increase co2 diffusion from the atmosphere to the site of carboxylation due to stomatal opening and increased mesophyll conductance which in turn contributes to an increase in net photosynthetic rate and the content stability index and fluorescence of chlorophyll ashraf and harris 2013 chaves and oliveira 2004 previous studies reported that water scarcity that occurs during flowering and grain filling stages can inhibit and reduce the period of photosynthesis and significantly increase flag leaf senescence which may reduce the contribution of pre flowering assimilates to grains xue et al 2006 wu et al 2014 the r system with supplemental irrigation could improve the stomatal regulation of plants and also sustain the physiological function of the photosynthetic apparatus by increasing chlorophyll content and fluorescence damatta et al 2002 chlorophyll fluorescence an important component of plant photosynthesis can be used as an indicator to evaluate yield performance and it is sensitive to water deficit zivcak et al 2013 xu et al 2014 fluorescence measurements could be widely used to study photosynthetic performance in leaves and they can provide useful information on physical changes in pigment protein complexes and the electron transport rate through psii govindjee 2004 baker rosenqvist 2004 water stress not only causes structural damage to psii but can also affect the process of photosynthetic electron transport maximum photochemical efficiency fv fm and actual photochemical efficiency φpsii of psii tambussi et al 2005 hura et al 2007 photosynthetic activities of plants are improved under micro rainwater harvesting with plastic film mulching compared to conventional flat planting with plastic film mulching hossain et al 2011 however knowledge of how winter wheat photosynthesis fluorescence and production are affected by different cultivation modes with supplemental irrigation under simulated rainfall conditions is relatively limited thus the main objective of the study was to determine whether photosynthesis chlorophyll content and fluorescence and production of wheat are affected by cultivation modes with supplemental irrigation under simulated rainfall conditions we believe that the results can be used to explore the interactive effect of cultivation modes with supplemental irrigation under simulated rainfall conditions and provide a scientific basis for improving winter wheat production in semi arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description

among soil layers at the depth of 0 200 cm compared to the f planting there were no considerable differences in the soil moisture between the r1150 and r2150 treatment at a depth of 0 200 cm during the seed filling and harvesting stages fig 3 the swc at the flowering and seed filling stages at depths of 0 60 cm increased while at depths of 60 200 cm the swc decreased under both planting patterns furthermore the swc increased under both planting models as the precipitation and limited irrigation levels increased however at the maturity stage the swc under the r technique increased compared to f treatment at depths of 0 80 cm this demonstrated that the r system the wheat crops took up less water from deeper soil layers compared to the crops in the f planting treatment the f planting had higher soil temperatures compared to the r technique under different precipitation and limited irrigation levels during the seed filling and harvesting stages fig 4 the f375 treatment the soil temperature was higher than that of the r1150 and r2150 treatments after the seed filling stage in addition the soil temperatures under the r1150 r2150 and f1150 treatments were lower than that of the

different between r1150 and r2150 treatments 3 4 electron transport rate etr and effective quantum yield of ps ii φpsii the etr and φpsii values of winter wheat significantly increased with increasing supplemental irrigation and simulated precipitation levels at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages under both cultivation modes figs 5 and 6 the peak etr and φpsii asset values were recorded under the r1150 treatment at the flowering stage but etr was not significantly different from the jointing stage the etr and φpsii values slowly decreased to the grain filling stage but the differences between r1150 and r2150 treatment were non significant the φpsii value was significantly improved from jointing to flowering stage but rapidly decreased from the flowering to grain filling stage at each supplemental irrigation and precipitation level under both cultivation modes figs 5 and 6 the r system had significantly higher effects on the etr and φpsii values of winter wheat flag leaves at each irrigation and simulated rainfall level during the flowering stage compared with f planting the average of data from both years at three different growth stages indicated that the etr and φpsii values under the r system were significantly higher than with f planting by 15 9 and 12 1 14 0 and 8 3 and 11 8 and 11 3 under simulated rainfall of 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm levels with 150 mm supplemental irrigation respectively the etr and φpsii values under the r1150 and r2150 treatments were significantly higher at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages compared to f1150 and f2150 treatments in both study years there were no significant differences in etr and φpsii values at simulated rainfall of 275 mm and 200 mm under both cultivation modes at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages 3 5 variable fluorescence fv and maximum quantum efficiency of psii fv fm under both cultivation modes the fv and psii fv fm values of winter wheat significantly improved with increasing supplemental irrigation and simulated rainfall levels at different growth stages the fv and fv fm values of flag leaves were not significantly different between jointing and flowering stage however fv and fv fm values quickly decreased from the flowering to grain filling stage of the same treatments in both study years figs 7 and 8 the average fv and fv fm values under the r system with 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm simulated rainfall under 150 mm supplemental irrigation were significantly higher by 6 3 and 0 9 7 6 and 1 1 and 8 8 and 1 4 respectively compared with f planting the fv and fv fm values of flag leaves were reasonably higher under the r1150 and r2150 treatments compared to f1150 and f2150 treatments at different growth stages of winter wheat in both experimental years

7 and 4 7 respectively and the fv fmʹ values were significantly increased by 6 2 2 4 and 3 0 respectively compared to the f1150 treatment under the r2150 treatment the fv fo value at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages were significantly increased by 2 9 3 0 and 7 3 respectively and the fv fmʹ values were significantly increased by 8 8 3 3 and 3 3 respectively compared to the f2150

treatments but the trend of et rate in each year was similar table 4 the r system under supplemental irrigation with simulated precipitation significantly p 0 05 reduced the et rate compared to f planting in each study year the average of data from both years indicated that the r cultivation model increased soil water and decreased soil evaporation and as a result significantly reduced the et rate by 35 8 in 2015 16 and by 26 9 in 2016 17 compared to f planting the average over both years indicated that et of r1150 and r175 treatments were significantly decreased by 28 1 and 27 8 compared to f1150 and f175 treatments the mean et rate of r2150 and r275 treatments were significantly decreased by 32 7 and 33 7 compared with f2150 and f275 treatments respectively the et rate was significantly decreased by 31 7 in r3150 and 37 3 in r375 treatment compared with f3150 and f375 treatments respectively the wue and grain yield were significantly increased by the interactive effect of cultivation modes with supplemental irrigation and simulated rainfall levels in both study years table 4 the wue and grain yield significantly increased with increasing supplemental irrigation and rainfall levels under both cultivation modes but differences were not significant when the precipitation was more than 200 mm the wue improved with increasing grain yield the average of data from both years indicated that wue under the r cultivation model significantly increased by 58 6 in 2015 16 and by 78 4 in 2016 17 compared to the f planting mode the mean wue over both study years indicated that r1150 and r175 treatments were significantly increased by 53 3 and 56 4 compared to f1150 and f175 treatments respectively the wue of r2150 and r275 treatments were significantly increased by 75

treatment the grain yield was highest under the r system with 150 mm supplemental irrigation and 200 mm rainfall concentration compared with f planting the average grain yield over both years revealed that the r system increased soil water and decreased et rate at the field scale as a result the r system produced a significantly higher grain yield of 0 79 t ha 1 compared with f planting when compared to f2150 and f275 treatments the average grain yield of data from both years revealed that r2150 and r275 treatments were significantly improved by 1 19 t ha 1 and 1 15 t ha 1 respectively 4 discussion in the semi arid areas of china crop productivity can be restricted by poor photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence due to water deficits and irregular precipitation distribution which leads to pronounced drought stress during critical growth stages of the winter wheat crop baker and rosenqvist 2004 wang et al 2009 results of this study indicated that both cultivation modes with supplemental irrigation affect crop photosynthesis chlorophyll fluorescence and yield under simulated rainfall conditions water deficits induce stomatal closure affecting diffusion of co2 from the air to the cell interior reddy et al 2004 which is the main reason for reduced pn value during water scarcity conditions effects of deficit irrigation develop inside plant tissue leading to significantly improved photosynthesis cui et al 2015 this study also confirmed that the average pn values under the r system with 150 mm supplemental irrigation were significantly higher than those of f planting by 14 5 10 4 and 25 8 under 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm simulated precipitation levels respectively the r system had significantly higher effects on the pn value of winter wheat at each irrigation and simulated rainfall level during the grain filling stage compared with f planting several studies have revealed that pn and chlorophyll content in wheat were increased under precipitation harvesting systems with plastic film compared to flat planting without plastic mulching wu et al 2004 ding et al 2004 the pn value is reduced at the grain filling stage when leaves start to senesce and the photosynthetic machine is disassembled quickly within chloroplasts brouwer et al 2012 this senescence is linked to the decline in photosynthetic capacity of leaves and can be intensified by light rainfall yang et al 2003 saeedipour and moradi 2011 the r system with plastic mulch has been shown to reduce rainfall water losses reduces evaporation and improves soil moisture content zhao et al 2014 we found that the r technique can considerably increase the swc among soil layers at depths of 0 200 cm compared to f planting at the flowering and seed filling stage the swc between 0 60 cm increased while from 60 to 200 cm the swc decreased under both planting patterns at the maturity stage the swc increased under the r technique compared to f at soil depths of 0 80 cm showing that the r system results in less water uptake from deeper soil layers compared to that of f planting a study by wang et al 2015 showed that the r technique with 340 mm of simulated rainfall can retain more rainwater in the soil than f planting practices thereby reducing soil temperature another reason that soil temperatures are reduced when utilizing the r system is better usage of light rains hu et al 2014 greater rainfall conservation in soils was a key reason why the soil moisture was higher under r cultivation than in f planting chen et al 2013 ren et al 2016 previous research has confirmed that the r technique can decrease soil temperature li et al 2013 and increase soil moisture li et al 2001 thereby increasing grain yield we also found that the f planting pattern resulted in higher soil temperatures compared to the r technique under with all precipitation and irrigation levels during the seed filling and harvesting stages fig 4 additionally the soil temperature was higher under the f375 treatment than that of the r1150 and r2150 treatments at the seed filling stage an earlier study also revealed that r cultivation can decrease soil temperature and improve soil moisture li et al 2001 thereby significantly increasing winter wheat yields duan et al 2006 the decline in total chl contents and chlorophyll stability index csi might be caused by leaves being injured and turning yellowish due to water scarcity and light rainfall in semi arid regions tahi et al 2007 the total chl ab contents of winter wheat significantly increased with increasing supplemental irrigation and rainfall concentrations under both cultivation modes in this study table 3 the average of data from both years showed that total chl ab contents under the r system with 150 mm supplemental irrigation were significantly higher than those of f planting by 65 2 62 5 and 53 8 under 275 mm 200 mm and 125 mm simulated rainfall levels respectively previous studies reported that water stress leads to the production of reactive oxygen species ros such as o2 and h2o2 which lead to damaged chlorophyll and reduced csi jianguo et al 2017 wang et al 2016 the csi was significantly higher under the r cultivation mode at each supplemental irrigation and simulated rainfall condition table 3 however the average over both years indicated that r1150 and r2150 treatments had higher csi than the r3150 treatment by 89 9 and 88 3 respectively the pn value is directly affected by total chl contents csi and chlorophyll fluorescence all of which decreased considerably under drought stress reducing photosynthesis and crop production wang et al 2016 rudzani et al 2017 the photosynthetic characters of wheat especially psii photochemistry respond positively to water shortage and provide valuable information on psii photochemistry and photosynthetic metabolism under water stress kastori et al 2000 tahi et al 2007 in our study all chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were affected to some extent by cultivation mode deficit irrigation and simulated rainfall our results show that the peak etr and φpsii asset value were recorded under the r1150 treatment at the flowering stage but etr was not significantly different from the jointing stage the etr and φpsii values were reduced by the grain filling stage but the differences between r1150 and r2150 treatments were not significant earlier studies reported that the etr value decreased under water stress showing that etr ability was decreased possibly due to photochemical down regulation and the dark reaction was blocked which reduced photosynthesis lu et al 2002 elazab et al 2016 decreased etr led to the generation of excess excitation energy which in turn caused serious photo inhibition under light and uneven rainfall distribution tezara et al 2005 in the present study the r system had significantly higher effects on the etr and φpsii values of winter wheat flag leaves at each irrigation and simulated rainfall level during the flowering stage compared with f planting there were no significant differences in etr and φpsii values at simulated rainfall levels of 275 mm and 200 mm under both cultivation models at jointing flowering and grain filling stages previous studies have reported that water scarcity and light rainfall decrease etr fv fm and φpsii values osorio et al 1998 wang et al 2016 the fv fm value can be used to detect damage to psii and leaf photosynthetic efficiency chutia and borah 2012 numerous studies have confirmed destruction to the psii oxygen evolving complex and the psii reaction centers and in turn degradation of d1 protein under water scarcity conditions jianguo et al 2017 rudzani et al 2017 photo inhibition is denoted by declining fv fm φpsii and etr schapendonk et al 1989 decreases in the fv fm and etr values by water stress may be the result of calvin cycle disturbances and can induce psii down regulation wang et al 2016 jianguo et al 2017 the fv fv fm fv fo and fv fmʹ values of flag leaves significantly increased from jointing to flowering stage in the present study however fv fv fm fv fo and fv fmʹ values quickly decreased from flowering to grain filling stage of the same treatments in both study years figs 5 and 6 the fv fv fm fv fo and fv fmʹ values of flag leaves were reasonably higher under the r1150 and r2150 treatments compared with the f1150 and f2150 treatments at different growth stages of winter wheat crop during grain filling stages the fv fv fm fv fo and fv fmʹ values of flag leaves were significantly higher under the r system at each supplemental irrigation and precipitation level as compared with the f planting mode the fv fm fv fo and fv fmʹ values will only work for measuring water stress in c3 plants due to photorespiration jianguo et al 2017 rudzani et al 2017 under the r2150 treatment the fv fo value at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages were significantly increased by 2 9 3 0 and 7 3 respectively and the fv fmʹ values were significantly increased by 8 8 3 3 and 3 3 respectively compared to the f2150 treatment terzi et al 2010 reported that decreases in the fv fm fv fo and fv fmʹ values might reduce the net photosynthesis rate thereby affecting plant development and crop production the ridges covered with plastic film mulch can improve soil water and nutrients status compared to planting without plastic film oweis and hachum 2006 ali et al 2017 the micro rainwater collecting system can increase the soil moisture and reduce et during wheat growing season and improve wue zhang et al 2005 plastic film improves soil moisture supply during reproductive growth stages oweis and hachum 2006 our results showed that wue and grain yield significantly increased with increasing supplemental irrigation and rainfall levels under both cultivation modes but differences were not significant when the precipitation was higher than 200 mm the wue improved with increasing grain yield the r system improved soil moisture which enhanced photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters during the later growth stages and resulted in higher wue and wheat production huang et al 2005 the average over both years indicated that wue under the r cultivation mode significantly increased by 58 6 in 2015 16 and 78 4 in 2016 17 compared to the f planting model the average grain yield of both years revealed that the r system increased soil water and decreased et rate at the field scale as a result the r system produced a significantly higher maximum grain yield of 0 79 t ha 1 compared with f planting it has been reported that ridges covered with plastic film could significantly prolong photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence duration and produce higher wue and yield zhang et al 2005 the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of winter wheat were significantly positively correlated with the pn total chl wue and grain yield except et and soil tempeature table 5 our results suggest that the r2150 treatment was the best cultivation practice for improving photosynthesis chlorophyll fluorescence wue and production in semi arid areas 5 conclusion in conclusion the results presented here indicated that interactive effects of cultivation modes with supplemental irrigation significantly improved photosynthesis chlorophyll fluorescence and yield of winter wheat under simulated rainfall conditions the maximum net photosynthesis rate pn electron transport rate etr effective quantum yield of ps ii φpsii maximum quantum efficiency of psii fv fm variable fluorescence fv energy transformation potential of psii fv fo and leaf photosynthetic performance index of psⅱ fv fmʹ at the jointing flowering and later stages of grain filling were obtained under the r2150 treatment these maximum values were due to increases in moisture content total chlorophyll ab contents and chlorophyll stability index csi of flag leaves and reduced et at the field scale all of which increased the grain yield and water use efficiency it is hypothesized that the r cultivation mode can ensue appropriate soil moisture conditions at critical growth stages the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of winter wheat were significantly positively correlated with the pn total chl wue and grain yield except et and soil temperature in this experiment it is necessary for winter wheat to adopt r system in regions with an annual rainfall below 275 mm therefore we recommend that the r system could be suitable for regions within 200 mm rainfall to make the system be adopted for a large scale a further experiment in different regions would be conducted acknowledgments this work was supported by china support program 2012bad09b03 for dry land farming in the 12th 5 year plan

11398,addressing water scarcity in dryland areas requires identification of promising water saving practices this paper reviews the effect of land management and water use practices on water productivity wp in uzbekistan and makes an inventory of strengths and constraints peer reviewed articles were screened for various local practices including furrow deficit and drip irrigation the performance of practices was analysed using the wp concept defined as ratio of crop yield per unit of water consumed irrigation water supply and evapotranspiration strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats swot of selected practices were studied by conducting semi structured interviews with local stakeholders in tashkent province this scoping process showed that overall drip irrigationhas the highest potential to improve wp in comparison with deficit and furrow irrigation with a wp supply and wp evapotranspiration for cotton of 1 44 and 1 70 kg m 3 respectively an excess use of irrigation water is not necessarily leading to increased cotton yield there is an opportunity to decrease the gap between low and high values of wp which vary from 0 12 1 44 kg m 3 for cotton low water use efficiency rates of furrow irrigation are one of the key issues to resolve for improved water management the return on investment of drip irrigation is viable for private farms growing fruit and vegetables which is mainly due to government support through export trade agreements and favorable policy incentives wp values of deficit irrigation within 0 25 water stress shows that its water saving potential is high but with certain yield reduction the high risk of crop yield reduction is a trade off between yield and adopting deficit irrigation to conclude the large gap between low and high wp values can be minimized with economically affordable technology beyond the technical improvements of each water saving practice it is also crucial to better design the system of policy incentives supporting users of the practices although the paper focused on uzbekistan the results can be beneficial to other semi arid regions and the scoping process can be replicated elsewhere keywords water productivity furrow irrigation deficit irrigation drip irrigation water saving swot 1 introduction the current arid and semi arid regions occupy almost one third of the total land area

agricultural lands in these areas are already occupied and cropland expansion as common strategy to increase food production is no longer possible solving the problem of water scarcity in drylands requires identification of promising water saving practices under similar conditions the case of uzbekistan covering both arid and semi arid zones provides a great example of the importance of selecting sustainable practices given that the past strategies of large scale agricultural expansion and construction of irrigation infrastructures have already led to serious environmental and socio

committee of uzbekistan 2013 sutton et al 2010 estimate that due to climate change water demand in uzbekistan will increase from 59 km3 in 2005 to 62 63 km3 in 2050 in some regions the economic growth rate can decline by 6 of gdp by 2050 as a result of water related losses in agriculture world bank 2016 reducing water consumption in agriculture and optimising land use strategies in the dry regions are the greatest challenges for the achievement of the sustainable development goals sdgs in uzbekistan center for economic research 2015 in a context of scarcity of land and water resources the key strategy to increase food production should be through the increase of production per unit resources in this respect the water productivity wp concept e g crop yield per unit of water consumed provides a useful framework to analyze crop production or water savings use in agriculture van dam et al 2008 there are numerous definitions of wp depending on the specific aim stakeholder interest and scale bastiaanssen and ali 2003 molden 1997 for instance plant physiologists may be interested in increasing dry matter per unit of transpiration irrigation engineers may need to increase efficient use of water per crop yield while farmers tend to maximise their economic benefit through the increase of their crop yields in general the wp concept internalizes various aspects of water management such as production utilisation and economy droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 molden and sakthivadivel 1999 molden et al 2001 wp can be analysed at different scales for instance at the plant field or basin scale molden et al 2001 in a search for higher resource efficiency the wp concept can thus guide the selection of promising water saving practices at field and farm level uzbekistan has

of di performance on water productivity is less studied in uzbekistan and the wider central asia region it should be noted that modern drip irrigation dpi practices have received increased attention over the world similarly in uzbekistan interest in the adoption of drip irrigation systems is increasing it should be noted that sprinkler irrigation is also a known water use practice but it is not commonly used in the study area therefore we have not focused on the sprinkler irrigation practice in this study above mentioned studies analyze various promising land and water use practices from a certain perspective technical institutional socio economic which already builds a knowledge base for each practice however the studies on land management and water use practices were not inventoried with the intention to improve wp in uzbekistan conditions apart from technical criteria the level of adoption suitability of practices to the local context is crucial water saving practices are not always suitable to local context due to a range of socio economic institutional and policy aspects djumaboev et al 2017 dukhovny et al 2008 hellegers et al 2009 hellegers and perry 2006 khamraev 2011 the aim of this paper is to review a set of land management and water use practices in terms of wp effectiveness and to make an inventory of constraints and opportunities for their adoption implementation in the uzbek context this analysis of the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats swot of irrigation practices will be based on knowledge from literature review in combination with firsthand perspectives of local stakeholders through interviews the specific objectives of this study are 1 to review studies on various land management and water use practices and measures to improve wp 2 to analyze wpsupply and wpet irrigation water use and crop yield values of selected water use practices i e furrow irrigation deficit irrigation and drip irrigation 3 to analyze strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats swot of the irrigation practices based on the literature and the interview data with local farmers land and water management experts 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area uzbekistan is the most populous and rapidly growing country in central asia with a current population of more than 32 million state committee of the republic of uzbekistan on statistics 2017 the climate is arid and semi arid with high seasonal fluctuations of air temperature and rainfall average annual rainfall ranges from 80 to 200 mm in the desert plain areas and 600 800 mm in the highland mountainous areas precipitation mainly falls outside the growing season during the winter and spring therefore precipitation during the summer month amounts less than 100 mm for most of the country the summer mean maximum temperature reaches 36 c and the mean minimum temperature in winter is 8 c centre of hydrometeorological service 2008 due to the low precipitation irrigation water is essential for the agricultural production in uzbekistan most irrigation water is derived from the transboundary rivers amu darya and syr darya which originate in tadjikistan and kyrgyzstan thus over 90 of water withdrawals in uzbekistan is used by the agricultural sector which is delivered by surface canals and groundwater aquifers fao 2013 major irrigated crops in uzbekistan are cotton and winter wheat other crops like rice fodder vegetables potato fruit and melons are growing in cultivated area as well intensification of monocultural cotton production on irrigated lands during the past decades has led to increased soil salinity and water logging micklin 2007 soil salinization of irrigated land varies to some degree and reached about 50 0 shirokova et al 2000 soil types in the irrigated areas of uzbekistan are dominated by sierozem and meadow soils fao 2003 2 2 literature review a literature review was conducted to establish wp effects of promising land management and water use practices in uzbekistan in this study wp is defined as crop yield y per unit of irrigation water supplied m3 wpsupply y m3 or per amount of evapotranspiration m3 wpet y et bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 van dam and malik 2003 a comprehensive database search of peer reviewed articles was conducted using the web based search engine of the institute for scientific information s web of knowledge in this electronic database we used topic search ts to identify publications that refer to water productivity in the title abstract and author s keywords the following keywords were used to identify relevant water productivity publications ts e g land management practice product water product water management water use efficiency furrow irrigation deficit irrigation drip irrigation irrigation fergana valley amudarya river syrdarya river uzbekistan central asia aral sea arid and semi arid dry areas dryland the composite terms were placed inside inverted commas and an asterisk was used at the end of each term to capture all possible extensions and variations of the word we only selected papers in the english language reporting on land and water management practices to improve water productivity such as furrow irrigation deficit irrigation drip irrigation conservation agriculture mulching and manure etc the database search was conducted between november december 2016 and resulted in 143 publications including peer reviewed research papers and proceeding papers abstracts of selected publications were screened for relevance to water productivity studies in uzbekistan the most relevant publications were selected totalling 20 publications while we principally relied on peer reviewed scholarly sources we also considered three reports from projects based on recommendations of interviewees see section 2 2 these reports were complementary to peer reviewed english sources as many studies in uzbekistan are reported in the local language and only available in the grey literature 2 3 interview data collection in order to get more insight about constraints and strengths of practices we conducted semi structured interviews with local farmers n 24 and farmer s councils n 4 in tashkent province farmer s councils act as land and water management authorities at district level and keep records of farm types and crops grown the sampling was done through farmers councils in four districts parkent urta chirchiq yuqori and quyi chirchiq districts by random selection of farmers using particular irrigation water practices e g furrow drip total n 17 and crop type e g cotton wheat the sample also included farmers in rain fed areas in parkent and urta chirchiq district by random selection of farmers growing commonly grown crop types i e fruits and grapes n 4 or wheat n 3 local agricultural land and water management experts n 4 affiliated with relevant organisations were also interviewed about strengths and constraints of land management and water use practices the respondents were asked open ended questions and notes were taken the interviews were conducted during july august 2016 and february may 2017 2 4 literature review data analysis 2 4 1 data analysis of wp studies the selected 20 studies were screened by considering several variables such as minimum and maximum values of wp crop type research study year research method and spatial scale the data on the above variables were extracted and combined into one table for further analysis the selected studies were grouped according to spatial scale at the field farm and basin levels as well as by methods applied to assess wp values the minimum and maximum values of wp in local studies were compared with available studies on a global scale subsequently the performance of selected land management and water use practices for cotton was evaluated based on minimum and maximum wp values using data from the selected 20 studies we performed more detailed analyses for furrow deficit and drip irrigation 2 4 2 practices furrow deficit and drip irrigation we studied the performance of furrow deficit and drip irrigation practices in relation to the following indicators wpsupply wpet evapotranspiration irrigation water use and crop yield data from the literature on furrow irrigation for cotton production was analysed by the trend of wpsupply and wpet over the time period spanned by experimental studies 1999 2015 moreover we studied irrigation quantity evapotranspiration and cotton yield drip irrigation performance was analysed by considering the relation of wpsupply wpet evapotranspiration and yield with irrigation water quantity papers on deficit irrigation in cotton production were analysed on three aspects of wp firstly the effect of various levels of irrigation water reduction relative to fi was studied deficit irrigation was classified by the proportional reduction of irrigation water supply akhtar et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 mild water deficit irrigation reduction between 0 20 moderate water deficit irrigation reduction between 20 40 and severe water deficit irrigation reduction between or in excess of 50 60 with respect to full irrigation supply these classifications provide a standardized approach allowing water deficit treatments and responses reported in various published studies to be assessed using a similar scale secondly an analysis was made of the various levels of irrigation water reduction with respect to climatic demand the climatic demand was divided into average high and very high with respect to demand for irrigation water due to climatic conditions pereira et al 2009 thirdly the level of irrigation water reduction in specific crop growth stages such as vegetative and ripening was assessed treatment effects of deficit irrigation in terms of yield and wp were analysed for the early growth stage and late growth stage akhtar et al 2013 2 5 identifying strengths and constraints of irrigation practices in the uzbekistan context the publications selected from the literature review and transcripts from the interviews with local farmers farmer s councils and land and water management experts were used in combination to analyze the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats swot of selected practices diamantopoulou and voudouris 2008 in swot analysis strengths refer to what makes the practices excel weaknesses to what stops the chosen practice from performing at its optimum level opportunities refer to favourable external factors that give a practice a competitive advantage and threats refer to external factors that have the potential to impair the practice atlas ti software was used to generate quotes from the selected publications and interview transcripts quotes were subsequently sorted by manually coding strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats per each selected practice i e furrow drip and deficit irrigation in the atlas ti software in total 131 quotes were generated from selected literature and interview data these quotes with similar content taken from literature and interview data were combined resulting into a total of 67 statements the 67 statements were filled into the swot tables and numerically ordered under each of the four swot attributes and three irrigation practices relevant themes emerging from the statements were identified and captured in headings information from published sources supporting statements were referenced while references for interviews were indexed in the following format f refers to farmer and order number fc refers to farmers council e refers to expert the frequency of quotes supporting each of the ten themes was counted distinguishing between information gathered from literature review publications and interview data per irrigation practice and swot attribute the frequencies of quotes from literature and interview data were classified in ranges and colour coded 1 4 grey 5 8 yellow 9 12 green and 13 16 red higher numbers of quotes responses under a certain theme are understood as higher importance attached to the theme by respondents and researchers for the practice considered subsequently analysis of the number of quotes in ten themes allows to identify intersecting priorities of the local farmers and water managers based on swot analysis of the three irrigation practices 3 results and discussion 3 1 review of wp studies uzbekistan the search methodology with isi wos yielded 20 publications on wpsupply and wpet for the years of 1992 to 2015 in uzbekistan we also considered reports from projects based on the recommendations of interviewees an iwmi report on water productivity in the syrdarya river basin by murray rust et al 2003 improving water use efficiency through innovative technologies in irrigation and agriculture in the fergana valley by dukhovny et al 2016 and petrick and djanibekov 2016 the 20 selected publications included wp indicators for land management practices such as laser levelling zero tillage manuring and associated practices as well as various water use practices namely drip irrigation furrow irrigation deficit irrigation flood irrigation practices furrow irrigation surge flow alternative surge flow short furrows and alternative furrow irrigation practices data on wp indicators from each publication on land management and water use practices were collected into one table for further analysis along with details on assessment method and scale of analysis table 1 the output of the literature study is an overview of agricultural practices used in uzbekistan to increase wp as well as wp values for certain years of study the most widely examined crop is cotton while limited attention is given to food crops table 1 the cotton crop is the key interest of the authors in most papers reflecting that cotton is of strategic importance for the socio economic development of uzbekistan attention to agricultural practices to improve wp has mainly been focused on furrow irrigation at field scale as can be seen from table 1 more research studies on wp were conducted during the period of 1999 2011 while comparatively fewer studies were done after 2011 several authors including abdullaev and molden 2004 horst et al 2007 pereira et al 2009 highlighted the issue of severe water scarcity every 2 3 year in relation to wp in table 1 some authors estimated wp values as the ratio of yield y kg to amount of irrigation water supply m3 while others use yield y kg divided by amount of evapotranspiration m3 3 1 1 wp review with respect to method of assessment the review of the literature reveals that authors examined wp values of crops with various approaches such as field experiments participatory surveys interviews and secondary data modelling and remote sensing rs tools table 1 the most widely applied method to assess wp is field experimentation table 1 for instance field experiments were used to study the effect of various irrigation practices e g fi di dpi similarly participatory methods including surveys and interviews have been widely used by authors to assess wp of various crop types abdullaev and molden 2004 bekchanov et al 2010 in recent years there is growing interest in evaluating wp based on modelling approaches for example in studies of fi and di practices reported in table 1 authors employed a range of models like isareg sirmod cropstat aqua crop hydrus 1d and swap to assess wp furthermore modelling based studies e g akhtar et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 qureshi et al 2011 focused on accurate estimation of irrigation water scheduling and groundwater balance qureshi et al 2011 demonstrate high potential for increasing wp of cotton by optimising irrigation scheduling while considering groundwater table depths in syr darya province uzbekistan in this study the physically based agro hydrological swap model was applied to assess wp in an experimental cotton field akhtar et al 2013 estimated irrigation scheduling for various deficit irrigation levels with the aqua crop model and hydrus 1d model at shallow groundwater condition in regions like khorezm and syrdarya the groundwater table is close to the root zone at a depth of around 1 2 m and soil salinity level is high forkutsa 2006 qureshi et al 2011 several scholars have conducted assessments of cotton water productivity with rs data cai et al 2009 chemin et al 2005 platonov et al 2008 these authors focused on the development of a methodology for monitoring and development of water productivity maps at field and farm scales to be more specific chemin et al 2005 demonstrated the potential for monitoring field and farm scale crop water productivity values using the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal method bastiaanssen 1995 based on remote sensing data also platonov et al 2008 illustrated a method for producing water productivity maps using landsat images 30 30 m spatial resolution while cai et al 2009 and biradar et al 2008 demonstrated applications of satellite images at various spatial resolutions in the studies of cai et al 2009 and biradar et al 2008 authors used the simplified surface energy balance sseb algorithm based on rs the scholars cai et al 2009 chemin et al 2005 and platonov et al 2008 suggest that the application of rs can be a useful tool for monitoring of wp and provide a practical view of the crop performance at various scales overall data from different publications results in high variation of wpsupply and wpet values which can be seen in detail in table 1 the reason for the high range between lowest and highest value of water productivity are due to different methods of assessment of wp i e experimental modelling rs different experimental treatments and heterogeneous environment i e climate soil groundwater depths we did not deeply focus on analyzing the impact of different measurement approaches field measurement modelling remote sensing for the assessment of wp however this can be an interesting topic for further studies 3 1 2 wp review with respect to scale the ranges in wpet values for cotton wheat and rice provide interesting insights about the magnitude of wpet at global and uzbekistan scale our study shows that minimum and maximum values of wpet at field and farm scales in uzbekistan are between 0 006 1 70 kg m 3 for cotton 0 60 3 78 kg m 3 for wheat and 0 17 0 90 kg m 3 for rice several other studies on wpet assessment at global scale reported a wpet range for cotton between 0 41 0 95 kg m 3 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 a wpet range of rice of 0 60 1 60 kg m 3 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and wpet ranges of wheat between 0 60 1 70 kg m 3 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 0 67 1 97 kg m 3 bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 0 16 1 89 kg m 3 liu et al 2007 0 20 1 80 kg m 3 bastiaanssen et al 2010 and 0 22 2 15 kg m 3 chapagain and hoekstra 2004 only few studies have focused on the basin scale for instance karimov et al 2012 conducted an extensive analysis of potential wp under various water management strategies in the syr darya river basin covering the period 1992 2004 these strategies included a range of farm and improved irrigation practices with a mix of conjunctive use of groundwater canal water and groundwater banking subsoil storage the study found that applying water banking in the subsoil raised wp by 19 for cotton by 23 for orchards and vines by 14 for wheat and by 9 for vegetables karimov et al 2012 abdullaev and molden 2004 studied the spatial variation of cotton water productivity in terms of wpsupply and wpet in collective farms former shirkat and private farms in wet and dry years their study found that in the middle reach of the syr darya basin fergana province higher wpsupply values for cotton were obtained in privately owned farms from 0 49 to 0 57 kg m 3 than in collectively owned farms from 0 43 to 0 45 kg m 3 abdullaev and molden 2004 the analysis of abdullaev and molden 2004 showed that wp levels were higher in dry years than in wet years furthermore wpsupply and wpet were higher in private owned farms due to distinctions in farm ownership policies overall the results of karimov et al 2012 and abdullaev and molden 2004 indicate that achieving higher levels of wp is possible by improved water management at the basin level 3 2 water productivity performance analysis of selected practices in fig 1 the various land management and water use practices table 1 have been grouped together in order to evaluate the performance of wpsupply values for cotton some of the practices i e surge flow alternate flow double furrow were used in supplement to furrow irrigation only a single wp value was available for alternate flow and alternate surge horst et al 2007 as can be seen from fig 1 the highest values of wpsupply were achieved with drip irrigation 1 44 kg m 3 followed by furrow irrigation at 1 39 kg m 3 and furrow in combination with mulching at 1 19 kg m 3 respectively review analysis shows that mild deficit irrigation level 0 25 can help to improve wp more detailed information is given in section 3 3 2 akhtar et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 comparing across practices in fig 1 the variability of wpsupply is the most significant for fi ranging from 0 12 to 1 39 kg m 3 the second largest variability is observed in furrow with mulching from 0 39 to 1 19 kg m 3 and in drip irrigation wp ranges from 0 82 to 1 44 kg m 3 drip irrigation offers the highest potential for improvement having the highest minimum point of wp among all practices farmers also can explore the potential for improving fi and supplementing it with mulching deficit irrigation with little water stress level has also shown to be promising with proper use of irrigation scheduling 3 3 water productivity effect of irrigation practices 3 3 1 furrow irrigation to improve wp in irrigated agriculture a range of field experiments were carried out with traditional fi to assess the possibilities of improving irrigation performances in uzbekistan table 1 trends of wpsupply and wpet are given for cotton in fig 2 the values of wpsupply and wpet range between 0 12 1 39 kg m 3 and 0 06 1 11 kg m 3 respectively fig 2 these results indicate that there is a high gap between lowest and highest value of wp however in this review analysis of the wpsupply and wpet over the period 1999 2015 shows an unsteady trend as can be seen from fig 2 in some years a large variation of cotton wp can be observed more specifically variation of wpsupply was between 0 12 1 39 kg m 3 in 2001 whereas wpet varied between 0 006 0 52 kg m 3 in 2006 and 0 40 0 89 kg m 3 in 2010 we also analysed the irrigation water amount and evapotranspiration values reported in the reviewed publications with respect to cotton yield fig 3 as can be seen from this figure use of irrigation water ranged from 1120 12 860 m3 ha 1 average 6990 m3 ha 1 evapotranspiration ranged from 450 to 8200 m3 ha 1 average 4325 m3 ha 1 yield ranged between 250 5400 kg ha 1 average 2825 kg ha 1 at the same time fig 3 illustrates that maximum yield of cotton 5400 kg ha 1 can be achieved with an optimal amount of irrigation and evapotranspiration the optimal irrigation quantity and yield ratio is concentrated between 6000 8000 m3 ha 1 irrigation water resulting in 3000 5400 kg ha 1 cotton yield in this sense it is clear from fig 3 that increases in irrigation water application and evapotranspiration beyond a certain point are not increasing the yield experimental results of dukhovny et al 2016 show that wpsupply and wpet values can be increased from 0 63 to 0 74 kg m 3 and 0 86 1 11 kg m 3 respectively with better irrigation scheduling horst et al 2005 aimed at improving water productivity of cotton by means of adequate irrigation scheduling for fi horst et al 2007 highlighted a comparison of conventional fi with alternative furrow irrigation furrow irrigation surge flow alternative surge flow irrigation and short furrow irrigation results demonstrated that with the conventional fi an average value of wpsupply was 0 38 kg m 3 and the best wp of 0 61 kg m 3 was achieved with surge flow on alternate furrows horst et al 2007 3 3 2 deficit irrigation a number of scholars i e akhtar et al 2013 and pereira et al 2009 have emphasised that application of mild deficit irrigation at range 5 20 has a potential to save 10 25 of water relative to traditional full irrigation and to improve physical wp value by 10 15 table 2 from table 2 it becomes clear that although wp can increase by 18 43 with the application of a moderate level of di 20 40 cotton crop yields are reduced by 14 29 akhtar et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 at a severe level of di water use is reduced by 50 60 in relation to full irrigation but causes a significant yield decline between 30 59 akhtar et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 simulated different di schedules in scenarios under average high and very high climatic demand to assess wpet impacts compared to fi the study shows that under the fi practice wpet value of cotton at average high and very high climatic demand stood at 0 332 0 307 and 0 293 kg m 3 respectively comparatively the simulation modelling results show that the various levels of di can achieve higher wpet values at average climatic demand up to 0 349 kg m 3 at high demand 0 328 kg m 3 and at very high climatic demand up to 0 312 kg m 3 pereira et al 2009 in fergana province of uzbekistan akhtar et al 2013 examined the impact of di levels on crop yield response taking into consideration the various crop development stages in case water supply is reduced by 12 13 during the late crop growth stage it results in a yield increase of 7 8 during the earlier crop growth stage a reduced water supply of 8 9 resulted in a yield loss of 17 18 water deficit at the late ripening stage of cotton would provide an adequate irrigation water saving option for water managers and farmers akhtar et al 2013 from a farmer perspective the higher yield loss translates in reduced income it is known that di requires an accurate irrigation water management in order to achieve high wp with minimal yield loss oweis and hachum 2003 as mentioned by reddy et al 2016 the main reasons for low wp and yield are the mismanagement of irrigation water and very little amount of irrigation water application however at a larger scale i e river basin reduced yields and water savings should then be offset by higher marginal productivity elsewhere this is not in the farmer s interest though with respect to crop yield an application of the mild level of di reveals a slight increase of crop yield or insignificant loss see fig 4 awan et al 2011 estimated that the proportional reduction of irrigation at 25 and 50 could reduce cotton yield by between 10 18 and 22 30 it is evident from the above studies and shown in fig 4 that due to the high yield loss at severe deficit irrigation level this practice may not be economically acceptable for farmers growing cotton and potato 3 3 3 drip irrigation two studies examine wp of cotton under dpi in comparison to traditional furrow irrigation ibragimov et al 2007 komilov et al 2002 in the early 2000 s komilov et al 2002 and ibragimov et al 2007 conducted field experiments at the central experimental station of uzbekistan s national cotton growing research institute the key results of the study demonstrate that higher values of cotton wpet 1 70 kg m 3 komilov et al 2002 and 0 88 kg m 3 ibragimov et al 2007 were achieved by applying dpi leading to water savings of 18 42 under the dpi practice cotton yield increased by 10 22 relative to furrow irrigation fig 5 presents the experimental results of komilov et al 2002 and ibragimov et al 2007 referring to treatment numbers 1 4 and 5 10 respectively from this figure we can see that when irrigation water amount is 2250 m 3 ha 1 and et 1830 m 3 ha 1 the yield reaches 3120 kg ha 1 treatment 1 in fig 5 the wpsupply and wpet values recorded are the highest in this combination of amount of irrigation water et and yield in relation to treatment 1 more than doubling the irrigation amount 4840 m 3 ha 1 and a more than threefold increase in et 6140 m 3 ha 1 in treatment 10 lead to a cotton yield of 4030 kg ha 1 i e a less than half 910 kg ha 1 increase in yield fig 5 due to a rise in irrigation water amount and et value the wp values are decreasing an appropriate irrigation schedule is crucial in order to achieve better water saving in drip irrigation ibragimov et al 2007 komilov et al 2002 overall the findings of ibragimov et al 2007 and komilov et al 2002 as represented in fig 5 are another noteworthy example showing that the excess use of irrigation water is not necessarily leading to increased cotton yield consequently applying an optimal amount of irrigation water is necessary for improvement of wpsupply 3 4 strengths and constraints of irrigation practices this section provides an overview of the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats analysis of selected practices consolidated in annex a1 a3 based on the review of publications and interviews with local farmers farmers councils and land and water management experts subsequently analysis of the number of responses grouped in ten themes leads to the identification of intersecting priorities of the stakeholders based on swot analysis of the three practices 3 4 1 furrow irrigation practice fi is the dominant and most commonly known irrigation practice in uzbekistan according to interviews fc 2 3 f 9 10 one of the key strengths of fi is its commonly known application annex a1 fi is used by many farmers who can learn from each other and use a knowledge base developed over centuries fi does not require high initial investment costs and electricity for water pumping at farm fields bekchanov et al 2010 also applying different flow regimes like the alternative flow and surge flow regime can save irrigation water and reduce deep percolation horst et al 2007 2005 fi has several weaknesses such as high water consumption need for proper land levelling and high fuel requirements for machinery at sowing periods bekchanov et al 2010 moreover land and water management experts raise concerns about overuse of irrigation water e 3 if irrigation water schedules and norms are not adequately applied pereira et al 2009 farmers would use excessive irrigation water at field level abdullaev and molden 2004 awan 2010 devkota 2011 horst et al 2005 pereira et al 2009 water authorities spend more resources on electricity used for water pumping and regional distribution of water f 14 e 1 however the government subsidizes these costs for farmers water delivery and maintenance costs are charged at relatively low price which does not create sufficient incentives for the efficient use of water djumaboev et al 2017 hamidov 2015 moreover improper irrigation scheduling of furrow irrigation leads to the issue of soil salinity and soil degradation bekchanov et al 2010 according to the interviews water accounting at field level is compromised by lack of proper measurement tools in some instances therefore farmers can only roughly estimate the amount of irrigation water supplied by counting the irrigation application times farmers apply irrigation water three times during the growing period of cotton in wet years and five times in dry years f 16 17 18 19 22 e 3 the farmers use water more efficiently in dry years not by choice but due to water scarcity reddy et al 2012 fi has many opportunities annex a1 considering that farmers do not pay for water itself except charges for water supply it turns to be an opportunity for wider application of fi despite of its high water consumption ibragimov et al 2007 improved irrigation management like better irrigation scheduling involving farmers in water distribution planning and irrigation adjustment to groundwater table depth lead to better results of wp akhtar et al 2013 karimov et al 2012 qureshi et al 2011 reddy et al 2012 moreover additional modern technological solutions like measurement tools e g telemetry calibrated sluices etc and improved human capacity can help to improve the performance of the fi practice provision of extension services can lead to increased farmers awareness about available measurement tools and current technologies fi has several external threats annex a1 for instance the poor irrigation field design and drainage conditions lead to lower efficiency of the irrigation practice and increased soil salinity bekchanov et al 2010 pereira et al 2009 qureshi et al 2011 due to unreliable water supply and unequal water distribution at irrigation system level fc 3 farmers use any chance to irrigate excessively to avoid future crop water stress akhtar et al 2013 when land for expanding irrigation area is limited land productivity has more priority than water productivity for the farmers this leads to over irrigation and low water efficiency in furrow irrigation horst et al 2007 poor drainage conditions make the situation more complicated causing soil degradation and rise of soil salinity horst et al 2005 also there are insufficient experienced specialists to operate fi at irrigation system level e 3 3 4 2 deficit irrigation swot analysis annex a3 shows that the strength of implementing di can be observed in extreme water deficit conditions when it is still possible to derive a minimum income from some crops instead of a total loss pereira et al 2009 di is useful when farmers have open access to irrigation water during sensitive crop growth stages akhtar et al 2013 di also leads to better use of the available soil water and groundwater at the field akhtar et al 2013 chemin et al 2005 pereira et al 2009 as discussed above for the furrow irrigation practice in most cases farmers do not reduce water consumption annex a3 farmers do not consciously implement a water stress strategy but only reduce the quantity of irrigation water in drought years consequently di is implemented only in water scarce years another weakness of di is that it requires uniform water application due to mismanagement of irrigation water supply and unreliable scheduling farmers may have no access to irrigation water in the crop s sensitive growing stage in this sense application of di leads to higher risk of low crop yield when there is no temporal availability of irrigation water akhtar et al 2013 by implementing di water productivity is increasing but the yield is decreasing pereira et al 2009 platonov et al 2008 another major weakness of di is a reduction of yield however from a water authority perspective with the implementation of accurate water accounting and scheduling di may help to save water in drought years for irrigating other crops or for other purposes reddy et al 2012 there are several opportunities for improving the effectiveness of di annex a3 there is potential to increase wp by using proper water management and improving institutional capacity e g equal water distribution reliable water supply quantity and application timing akhtar et al 2013 reddy et al 2016 2012 effectiveness can also be improved by accurate irrigation water scheduling carli et al 2014 if information about expected drought is available it is preferable to plant in a smaller plot with no or moderate deficit irrigation rather than an extreme deficit in a larger area reddy et al 2016 saved water can be used later in more sensitive periods by using small water storage facilities akhtar et al 2013 3 4 3 drip irrigation practice water saving technologies like drip irrigation systems were acknowledged as water efficient practice in the field by interviewees f 10 e 2 3 annex a2 it is important to note that dpi has the potential to increase crop yield f 10 e 2 3 and increase economic benefit bekchanov et al 2010 ibragimov et al 2007 karimov et al 2012 another strong point is that dpi requires less labour input and fertilizers as the fertigation process through the drip system enables more direct application to the plant resulting in fertilizer savings bekchanov et al 2010 there is the possibility of irrigation by simple automation drip system e 2 f 21 in terms of water availability it is also possible to use groundwater when surface water is scarce karimov et al 2012 in rain fed areas where water availability is unpredictable drip irrigation is one of the solutions used for supplementary irrigation in dry periods fc 1 f 1 also those farmers who have dpi systems can individually control their water scheduling while other irrigated farmers mainly rely on operation management from the water users association wua one of the main weaknesses of dpi is the high investment cost of this technology annex a2 the cost of introducing a drip irrigation system per one hectare was estimated as 2 million uzbek sums in 2005 then equivalent to 1600 usd in the khorezm region with an average lifetime of eight years bobojonov 2008 in our interviews with local farmers we found out an average cost for dpi technology of 2000 usd per hectare in 2017 f 10 14 20 i e an apparent price increase of 25 over the period 2005 2017 furthermore operation and maintenance costs e g due to short lifetime of drip tubes need for skilled labour and good water quality are high bekchanov et al 2010 ibragimov et al 2007 moreover dpi requires costly electricity resources for water pumping and allocation f 14 e 1 4 these costs are still viable for fruit producers while the return on investment is low for wheat and cotton due to high investment cost and low profit ibragimov et al 2007 f 10 e 2 3 4 the policy of the government to both subsidize the cheap water and promote water saving technology turns to double expenditure for the government and hampers uptake of water saving technology despite the fact that dpi requires fewer labour resources it needs well trained skilled labour to operate the dpi system f 11 the lack of this capacity in place is a constraint for wider adoption of dpi an important opportunity for dpi lies in policy change annex a2 it is important to point out that the government of uzbekistan provides incentives for the adoption of water saving technologies such as drip irrigation annex a2 the incentives given to farmers for the adoption of drip irrigation include 5 years of land use tax reduction and low rate loans from banks for investment in water saving technology fc 3 4 f 11 f 20 e 1 3 those farmers responsible for supplying cotton and wheat crops to the government have limited options as the government buys crops crop yield ha at fixed prices agreed on contract basis studies of bobojonov et al 2010 and djanibekov et al 2012 indicate that reduction of the state production targets of cotton and wheat stipulated in land use policy reform can help to achieve more rational water use and adoption of water saving technologies for example over the past years less profitable cotton wheat growing areas were converted to intensive horticulture with drip irrigation due to favorable changes in land use policy fc 3 4 current market trade agreements with neighbouring and other countries have significantly increased export potentials of agricultural products fruits and vegetables and help securing a return on dpi investment fc 3 4 f 20 consequently modern technologies like drip irrigation are an affordable capital investment for farmers who grow fruits fc 3 4 f 20 policy and incentives are also considered as potential threats of the dpi practice annex a2 despite the fact that the distribution of water is governmentment subsidized and cost of water is cheap for the farmer however these incentives appear not enough for boosting wide scale rationale water use and adoption of dpi technology for cotton and wheat producers bekchanov et al 2010 research by bekchanov et al 2010 points out that fussy availability of bank credits leads to this observed late adoption moreover lack of mass production of dpi parts locally creates dependency on import bekchanov et al 2010 consequently only fruit producers are interested in investing in water saving practices some of them are located in rainfed lands where supplemental irrigation is needed 3 5 intersection of irrigation practices with the group of themes in swot analysis by further analysing given responses in the swot data table 3 several findings can be highlighted such as that overall investment and operational cost emerges as the theme with the largest number of responses in total 27 among ten themes followed by the irrigation and management at field and basin and policy and incentives themes the same top 3 themes come on top when only considering quotes from interviews from a research point of view based on the number of mentions in the literature the themes receiving the highest attention are irrigation and management at field and basin investment and operational cost and knowledge capacity comparing each theme in more detail investment and operational cost received high attention from local farmers and researchers for all practices specifically dpi is frequently discussed as a technological advancement requiring high investment cost providing viable economic return for particular farm types only e g private farms growing fruit and vegetables bobojonov 2008 ibragimov et al 2007 f 10 14 20 in this sense among all practices local stakeholders and researchers more critically addressed the high investment cost for dpi technology table 3 secondly irrigation management at field and basin has been addressed in multiple responses for the fi practice while few responses are given in relation to di literature study shows that despite the major weaknesses of fi exposed by local stakeholders who express a demand to improve irrigation management main opportunities and external threats fall under the same category options to enhance fi performance are strongly dependent on solving external threats e g irrigation management fi and di also hold scope for improving irrigation management at different scales thirdly based on interview data table 3 the policy and incentives theme received the largest number of responses supporting a single statement which concerned opportunities for dpi offered by government support in the form of policy and economic incentives mainly for modernisation of horticulture production state policies on land tax and export have created favourable conditions for private farms to scale up the use of dpi however there are threats like limited domestic dpi technology production there is also scope for economic incentives to use water more rationally which would make it more attractive to invest into economically affordable dpi technology furthermore several respondents mentioned strengths for dpi and di practices under the water use efficiency theme table 3 water use efficiency of the dpi practice received the highest number of responses from interviews while the di practice was mentioned most often by research publications in this review fi has been used from ancient times therefore knowledge and skills are well developed by generations of users in this sense the widespread use of the fi practice in the field dominated this theme while information about current knowledge in relation to di and dpi practices is less known from research publications and interviews although fi is a well known and long used practice the progress of upgrading its efficiency in current development is weak looking forward modern technology plays a crucial role many respondents not only recognise that dpi has strengths as a modern technology but at the same time the swot analysis identifies it as an opportunity for all practices too table 3 all themes represent various numbers of responses for swot attributes and irrigation practices in a few occasions themes present trade offs like a trade off between water use efficiency and yield or between scale and access to water these trade offs particularly focus on di and dpi practices but concern themes with the least responses even though some researchers have been contributing to the study di in uzbekistan it is clear from interview data table 3 that less statements were provided for the di practice which can be due to this practice being less commonly practiced among the farmers in the region overall the above mentioned theme categories highlight the key points from the swot analysis in relation to fi dpi and di practices and establishes an agenda of synergistic opportunities for researchers and farmers to pursue 4 conclusions this review analysis provides evidence that the dpi practice has the highest values of wpsupply 1 44 kg m 3 in comparison with fi 1 39 kg m 3 and di at a mild deficit level of 20 0 95 kg m 3 for cotton similarly dpi recorded the highest wpet values at 1 70 kg m 3 in comparison with fi at 1 11 kg m 3 for cotton the differences between wpsupply and wpet values indicate that irrigation water supplies could be reduced the optimal irrigation quantity and yield ratio obtained from analysis of fi studies was between 6000 8000 m3 ha 1 irrigation water resulting in 3000 5400 kg ha 1 cotton yield growing cotton with excessive use of irrigation water is not necessarily leading to increased cotton yield the performance analysis of the different land management and water use practices indicated that there is considerable scope to increase wpsupply values which vary from 0 12 to 1 44 kg m 3 for cotton in particular a large variability in wpsupply was observed in the fi mulching di and dpi practices for cotton each of the practices has different milestones to reach best performance for instance fi presents large scope for upgrading its efficiency by adequately resolving the issues inhibiting improved water management practices like reliable water distribution irrigation water scheduling and water accounting at field level dpi has the highest performance among irrigation practices when considering minimum and maximum wp values investment return of dpi is viable for private farms growing fruit and vegetables partially aided by government support in the form of economic incentives land tax and export policies in uzbekistan for horticulture production compared to other practices wp values of di within 0 25 water stress show that the water saving potential of this practice is high albeit it comes with a certain yield reduction consequence since high crop yield is the key indicator for farmers to adopt a certain practice di has the least opportunity to be adopted on wider scale the irrigation and management at field and basin options to increase water productivity are playing a major role in addressing water scarcity with much to be gained from adoption and scaling up of promising water saving practices but beyond the technical improvements afforded by water saving practices taking in consideration the research studies and interview results as a whole investment and operational cost emerges as the bottleneck theme with the highest given attention for all three practices in this sense any promising practice as a tool for saving water may not be effective unless an enabling environment is in place overall water productivity scope can be enhanced with building an appropriate system of socio economic and policy incentives supporting users of the practices although these findings focus on the uzbek situation they can be beneficial to other semi arid regions moreover the scoping method presented can be replicated for other context specific assessments of land management and water use

11398,addressing water scarcity in dryland areas requires identification of promising water saving practices this paper reviews the effect of land management and water use practices on water productivity wp in uzbekistan and makes an inventory of strengths and constraints peer reviewed articles were screened for various local practices including furrow deficit and drip irrigation the performance of practices was analysed using the wp concept defined as ratio of crop yield per unit of water consumed irrigation water supply and evapotranspiration strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats swot of selected practices were studied by conducting semi structured interviews with local stakeholders in tashkent province this scoping process showed that overall drip irrigationhas the highest potential to improve wp in comparison with deficit and furrow irrigation with a wp supply and wp evapotranspiration for cotton of 1 44 and 1 70 kg m 3 respectively an excess use of irrigation water is not necessarily leading to increased cotton yield there is an opportunity to decrease the gap between low and high values of wp which vary from 0 12 1 44 kg m 3 for cotton low water use efficiency rates of furrow irrigation are one of the key issues to resolve for improved water management the return on investment of drip irrigation is viable for private farms growing fruit and vegetables which is mainly due to government support through export trade agreements and favorable policy incentives wp values of deficit irrigation within 0 25 water stress shows that its water saving potential is high but with certain yield reduction the high risk of crop yield reduction is a trade off between yield and adopting deficit irrigation to conclude the large gap between low and high wp values can be minimized with economically affordable technology beyond the technical improvements of each water saving practice it is also crucial to better design the system of policy incentives supporting users of the practices although the paper focused on uzbekistan the results can be beneficial to other semi arid regions and the scoping process can be replicated elsewhere keywords water productivity furrow irrigation deficit irrigation drip irrigation water saving swot 1 introduction the current arid and semi arid regions occupy almost one third of the total land area of the world fao 2016 and are expected to be the most vulnerable to increased climate induced drought risk pachauri et al 2014 united nations world water assessment programme 2016 the best agricultural lands in these areas are already occupied and cropland expansion as common strategy to increase food production is no longer possible solving the problem of water scarcity in drylands requires identification of promising water saving practices under similar conditions the case of uzbekistan covering both arid and semi arid zones provides a great example of the importance of selecting sustainable practices given that the past strategies of large scale agricultural expansion and construction of irrigation infrastructures have already led to serious environmental and socio economic problems in the aral sea basin micklin 2007 in uzbekistan 80 of the total area is covered by desert and only 10 is cultivated area used for agriculture land geodesy and cadastre of national committee of uzbekistan 2013 sutton et al 2010 estimate that due to climate change water demand in uzbekistan will increase from 59 km3 in 2005 to 62 63 km3 in 2050 in some regions the economic growth rate can decline by 6 of gdp by 2050 as a result of water related losses in agriculture world bank 2016 reducing water consumption in agriculture and optimising land use strategies in the dry regions are the greatest challenges for the achievement of the sustainable development goals sdgs in uzbekistan center for economic research 2015 in a context of scarcity of land and water resources the key strategy to increase food production should be through the increase of production per unit resources in this respect the water productivity wp concept e g crop yield per unit of water consumed provides a useful framework to analyze crop production or water savings use in agriculture van dam et al 2008 there are numerous definitions of wp depending on the specific aim stakeholder interest and scale bastiaanssen and ali 2003 molden 1997 for instance plant physiologists may be interested in increasing dry matter per unit of transpiration irrigation engineers may need to increase efficient use of water per crop yield while farmers tend to maximise their economic benefit through the increase of their crop yields in general the wp concept internalizes various aspects of water management such as production utilisation and economy droogers and bastiaanssen 2002 molden and sakthivadivel 1999 molden et al 2001 wp can be analysed at different scales for instance at the plant field or basin scale molden et al 2001 in a search for higher resource efficiency the wp concept can thus guide the selection of promising water saving practices at field and farm level uzbekistan has a solid background of different irrigation and land management practices over the centuries furrow irrigation fi cai et al 2009 is one of the ancient and most commonly used methods of irrigating crops in uzbekistan dukhovny and stulina 2011 fi is known as a type of surface irrigation where farmers irrigate their fields with free flow gravity through the use of small trenches past research in the region intended to develop appropriate farm irrigation guidelines for specific crop irrigation regimes e g laktaev 1978 nerozin 2011 shreder et al 1977 also several studies have attempted to improve the performance of fi by implementing intermittent flow regimes in furrows double sided furrows short and long furrows and alternative furrows bekchanov et al 2010 karimov et al 2012 reddy et al 2013 other studies such as laktaev 1978 and pereira et al 2009 provided evidence that significant water savings can be achieved compared to conventional fi by implementing deficit irrigation deficit irrigation di has been widely studied as a promising on farm strategy to maximize crop water productivity in dry areas fereres and soriano 2006 pereira et al 2002 several previous papers review di strategies in a broader context e g doorenbos and kassam 1979 taylor et al 1983 and geerts and raes 2009 geerts and raes 2009 presented a summary of advantages and disadvantages of di practices based on a review of selected global studies the geerts and raes 2009 study concludes that with proper water scheduling di can significantly improve wp and achieve high water savings however the implication of di performance on water productivity is less studied in uzbekistan and the wider central asia region it should be noted that modern drip irrigation dpi practices have received increased attention over the world similarly in uzbekistan interest in the adoption of drip irrigation systems is increasing it should be noted that sprinkler irrigation is also a known water use practice but it is not commonly used in the study area therefore we have not focused on the sprinkler irrigation practice in this study above mentioned studies analyze various promising land and water use practices from a certain perspective technical institutional socio economic which already builds a knowledge base for each practice however the studies on land management and water use practices were not inventoried with the intention to improve wp in uzbekistan conditions apart from technical criteria the level of adoption suitability of practices to the local context is crucial water saving practices are not always suitable to local context due to a range of socio economic institutional and policy aspects djumaboev et al 2017 dukhovny et al 2008 hellegers et al 2009 hellegers and perry 2006 khamraev 2011 the aim of this paper is to review a set of land management and water use practices in terms of wp effectiveness and to make an inventory of constraints and opportunities for their adoption implementation in the uzbek context this analysis of the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats swot of irrigation practices will be based on knowledge from literature review in combination with firsthand perspectives of local stakeholders through interviews the specific objectives of this study are 1 to review studies on various land management and water use practices and measures to improve wp 2 to analyze wpsupply and wpet irrigation water use and crop yield values of selected water use practices i e furrow irrigation deficit irrigation and drip irrigation 3 to analyze strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats swot of the irrigation practices based on the literature and the interview data with local farmers land and water management experts 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area uzbekistan is the most populous and rapidly growing country in central asia with a current population of more than 32 million state committee of the republic of uzbekistan on statistics 2017 the climate is arid and semi arid with high seasonal fluctuations of air temperature and rainfall average annual rainfall ranges from 80 to 200 mm in the desert plain areas and 600 800 mm in the highland mountainous areas precipitation mainly falls outside the growing season during the winter and spring therefore precipitation during the summer month amounts less than 100 mm for most of the country the summer mean maximum temperature reaches 36 c and the mean minimum temperature in winter is 8 c centre of hydrometeorological service 2008 due to the low precipitation irrigation water is essential for the agricultural production in uzbekistan most irrigation water is derived from the transboundary rivers amu darya and syr darya which originate in tadjikistan and kyrgyzstan thus over 90 of water withdrawals in uzbekistan is used by the agricultural sector which is delivered by surface canals and groundwater aquifers fao 2013 major irrigated crops in uzbekistan are cotton and winter wheat other crops like rice fodder vegetables potato fruit and melons are growing in cultivated area as well intensification of monocultural cotton production on irrigated lands during the past decades has led to increased soil salinity and water logging micklin 2007 soil salinization of irrigated land varies to some degree and reached about 50 0 shirokova et al 2000 soil types in the irrigated areas of uzbekistan are dominated by sierozem and meadow soils fao 2003 2 2 literature review a literature review was conducted to establish wp effects of promising land management and water use practices in uzbekistan in this study wp is defined as crop yield y per unit of irrigation water supplied m3 wpsupply y m3 or per amount of evapotranspiration m3 wpet y et bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 van dam and malik 2003 a comprehensive database search of peer reviewed articles was conducted using the web based search engine of the institute for scientific information s web of knowledge in this electronic database we used topic search ts to identify publications that refer to water productivity in the title abstract and author s keywords the following keywords were used to identify relevant water productivity publications ts e g land management practice product water product water management water use efficiency furrow irrigation deficit irrigation drip irrigation irrigation fergana valley amudarya river syrdarya river uzbekistan central asia aral sea arid and semi arid dry areas dryland the composite terms were placed inside inverted commas and an asterisk was used at the end of each term to capture all possible extensions and variations of the word we only selected papers in the english language reporting on land and water management practices to improve water productivity such as furrow irrigation deficit irrigation drip irrigation conservation agriculture mulching and manure etc the database search was conducted between november december 2016 and resulted in 143 publications including peer reviewed research papers and proceeding papers abstracts of selected publications were screened for relevance to water productivity studies in uzbekistan the most relevant publications were selected totalling 20 publications while we principally relied on peer reviewed scholarly sources we also considered three reports from projects based on recommendations of interviewees see section 2 2 these reports were complementary to peer reviewed english sources as many studies in uzbekistan are reported in the local language and only available in the grey literature 2 3 interview data collection in order to get more insight about constraints and strengths of practices we conducted semi structured interviews with local farmers n 24 and farmer s councils n 4 in tashkent province farmer s councils act as land and water management authorities at district level and keep records of farm types and crops grown the sampling was done through farmers councils in four districts parkent urta chirchiq yuqori and quyi chirchiq districts by random selection of farmers using particular irrigation water practices e g furrow drip total n 17 and crop type e g cotton wheat the sample also included farmers in rain fed areas in parkent and urta chirchiq district by random selection of farmers growing commonly grown crop types i e fruits and grapes n 4 or wheat n 3 local agricultural land and water management experts n 4 affiliated with relevant organisations were also interviewed about strengths and constraints of land management and water use practices the respondents were asked open ended questions and notes were taken the interviews were conducted during july august 2016 and february may 2017 2 4 literature review data analysis 2 4 1 data analysis of wp studies the selected 20 studies were screened by considering several variables such as minimum and maximum values of wp crop type research study year research method and spatial scale the data on the above variables were extracted and combined into one table for further analysis the selected studies were grouped according to spatial scale at the field farm and basin levels as well as by methods applied to assess wp values the minimum and maximum values of wp in local studies were compared with available studies on a global scale subsequently the performance of selected land management and water use practices for cotton was evaluated based on minimum and maximum wp values using data from the selected 20 studies we performed more detailed analyses for furrow deficit and drip irrigation 2 4 2 practices furrow deficit and drip irrigation we studied the performance of furrow deficit and drip irrigation practices in relation to the following indicators wpsupply wpet evapotranspiration irrigation water use and crop yield data from the literature on furrow irrigation for cotton production was analysed by the trend of wpsupply and wpet over the time period spanned by experimental studies 1999 2015 moreover we studied irrigation quantity evapotranspiration and cotton yield drip irrigation performance was analysed by considering the relation of wpsupply wpet evapotranspiration and yield with irrigation water quantity papers on deficit irrigation in cotton production were analysed on three aspects of wp firstly the effect of various levels of irrigation water reduction relative to fi was studied deficit irrigation was classified by the proportional reduction of irrigation water supply akhtar et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 mild water deficit irrigation reduction between 0 20 moderate water deficit irrigation reduction between 20 40 and severe water deficit irrigation reduction between or in excess of 50 60 with respect to full irrigation supply these classifications provide a standardized approach allowing water deficit treatments and responses reported in various published studies to be assessed using a similar scale secondly an analysis was made of the various levels of irrigation water reduction with respect to climatic demand the climatic demand was divided into average high and very high with respect to demand for irrigation water due to climatic conditions pereira et al 2009 thirdly the level of irrigation water reduction in specific crop growth stages such as vegetative and ripening was assessed treatment effects of deficit irrigation in terms of yield and wp were analysed for the early growth stage and late growth stage akhtar et al 2013 2 5 identifying strengths and constraints of irrigation practices in the uzbekistan context the publications selected from the literature review and transcripts from the interviews with local farmers farmer s councils and land and water management experts were used in combination to analyze the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats swot of selected practices diamantopoulou and voudouris 2008 in swot analysis strengths refer to what makes the practices excel weaknesses to what stops the chosen practice from performing at its optimum level opportunities refer to favourable external factors that give a practice a competitive advantage and threats refer to external factors that have the potential to impair the practice atlas ti software was used to generate quotes from the selected publications and interview transcripts quotes were subsequently sorted by manually coding strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats per each selected practice i e furrow drip and deficit irrigation in the atlas ti software in total 131 quotes were generated from selected literature and interview data these quotes with similar content taken from literature and interview data were combined resulting into a total of 67 statements the 67 statements were filled into the swot tables and numerically ordered under each of the four swot attributes and three irrigation practices relevant themes emerging from the statements were identified and captured in headings information from published sources supporting statements were referenced while references for interviews were indexed in the following format f refers to farmer and order number fc refers to farmers council e refers to expert the frequency of quotes supporting each of the ten themes was counted distinguishing between information gathered from literature review publications and interview data per irrigation practice and swot attribute the frequencies of quotes from literature and interview data were classified in ranges and colour coded 1 4 grey 5 8 yellow 9 12 green and 13 16 red higher numbers of quotes responses under a certain theme are understood as higher importance attached to the theme by respondents and researchers for the practice considered subsequently analysis of the number of quotes in ten themes allows to identify intersecting priorities of the local farmers and water managers based on swot analysis of the three irrigation practices 3 results and discussion 3 1 review of wp studies uzbekistan the search methodology with isi wos yielded 20 publications on wpsupply and wpet for the years of 1992 to 2015 in uzbekistan we also considered reports from projects based on the recommendations of interviewees an iwmi report on water productivity in the syrdarya river basin by murray rust et al 2003 improving water use efficiency through innovative technologies in irrigation and agriculture in the fergana valley by dukhovny et al 2016 and petrick and djanibekov 2016 the 20 selected publications included wp indicators for land management practices such as laser levelling zero tillage manuring and associated practices as well as various water use practices namely drip irrigation furrow irrigation deficit irrigation flood irrigation practices furrow irrigation surge flow alternative surge flow short furrows and alternative furrow irrigation practices data on wp indicators from each publication on land management and water use practices were collected into one table for further analysis along with details on assessment method and scale of analysis table 1 the output of the literature study is an overview of agricultural practices used in uzbekistan to increase wp as well as wp values for certain years of study the most widely examined crop is cotton while limited attention is given to food crops table 1 the cotton crop is the key interest of the authors in most papers reflecting that cotton is of strategic importance for the socio economic development of uzbekistan attention to agricultural practices to improve wp has mainly been focused on furrow irrigation at field scale as can be seen from table 1 more research studies on wp were conducted during the period of 1999 2011 while comparatively fewer studies were done after 2011 several authors including abdullaev and molden 2004 horst et al 2007 pereira et al 2009 highlighted the issue of severe water scarcity every 2 3 year in relation to wp in table 1 some authors estimated wp values as the ratio of yield y kg to amount of irrigation water supply m3 while others use yield y kg divided by amount of evapotranspiration m3 3 1 1 wp review with respect to method of assessment the review of the literature reveals that authors examined wp values of crops with various approaches such as field experiments participatory surveys interviews and secondary data modelling and remote sensing rs tools table 1 the most widely applied method to assess wp is field experimentation table 1 for instance field experiments were used to study the effect of various irrigation practices e g fi di dpi similarly participatory methods including surveys and interviews have been widely used by authors to assess wp of various crop types abdullaev and molden 2004 bekchanov et al 2010 in recent years there is growing interest in evaluating wp based on modelling approaches for example in studies of fi and di practices reported in table 1 authors employed a range of models like isareg sirmod cropstat aqua crop hydrus 1d and swap to assess wp furthermore modelling based studies e g akhtar et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 qureshi et al 2011 focused on accurate estimation of irrigation water scheduling and groundwater balance qureshi et al 2011 demonstrate high potential for increasing wp of cotton by optimising irrigation scheduling while considering groundwater table depths in syr darya province uzbekistan in this study the physically based agro hydrological swap model was applied to assess wp in an experimental cotton field akhtar et al 2013 estimated irrigation scheduling for various deficit irrigation levels with the aqua crop model and hydrus 1d model at shallow groundwater condition in regions like khorezm and syrdarya the groundwater table is close to the root zone at a depth of around 1 2 m and soil salinity level is high forkutsa 2006 qureshi et al 2011 several scholars have conducted assessments of cotton water productivity with rs data cai et al 2009 chemin et al 2005 platonov et al 2008 these authors focused on the development of a methodology for monitoring and development of water productivity maps at field and farm scales to be more specific chemin et al 2005 demonstrated the potential for monitoring field and farm scale crop water productivity values using the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal method bastiaanssen 1995 based on remote sensing data also platonov et al 2008 illustrated a method for producing water productivity maps using landsat images 30 30 m spatial resolution while cai et al 2009 and biradar et al 2008 demonstrated applications of satellite images at various spatial resolutions in the studies of cai et al 2009 and biradar et al 2008 authors used the simplified surface energy balance sseb algorithm based on rs the scholars cai et al 2009 chemin et al 2005 and platonov et al 2008 suggest that the application of rs can be a useful tool for monitoring of wp and provide a practical view of the crop performance at various scales overall data from different publications results in high variation of wpsupply and wpet values which can be seen in detail in table 1 the reason for the high range between lowest and highest value of water productivity are due to different methods of assessment of wp i e experimental modelling rs different experimental treatments and heterogeneous environment i e climate soil groundwater depths we did not deeply focus on analyzing the impact of different measurement approaches field measurement modelling remote sensing for the assessment of wp however this can be an interesting topic for further studies 3 1 2 wp review with respect to scale the ranges in wpet values for cotton wheat and rice provide interesting insights about the magnitude of wpet at global and uzbekistan scale our study shows that minimum and maximum values of wpet at field and farm scales in uzbekistan are between 0 006 1 70 kg m 3 for cotton 0 60 3 78 kg m 3 for wheat and 0 17 0 90 kg m 3 for rice several other studies on wpet assessment at global scale reported a wpet range for cotton between 0 41 0 95 kg m 3 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 a wpet range of rice of 0 60 1 60 kg m 3 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 and wpet ranges of wheat between 0 60 1 70 kg m 3 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 0 67 1 97 kg m 3 bastiaanssen and steduto 2017 0 16 1 89 kg m 3 liu et al 2007 0 20 1 80 kg m 3 bastiaanssen et al 2010 and 0 22 2 15 kg m 3 chapagain and hoekstra 2004 only few studies have focused on the basin scale for instance karimov et al 2012 conducted an extensive analysis of potential wp under various water management strategies in the syr darya river basin covering the period 1992 2004 these strategies included a range of farm and improved irrigation practices with a mix of conjunctive use of groundwater canal water and groundwater banking subsoil storage the study found that applying water banking in the subsoil raised wp by 19 for cotton by 23 for orchards and vines by 14 for wheat and by 9 for vegetables karimov et al 2012 abdullaev and molden 2004 studied the spatial variation of cotton water productivity in terms of wpsupply and wpet in collective farms former shirkat and private farms in wet and dry years their study found that in the middle reach of the syr darya basin fergana province higher wpsupply values for cotton were obtained in privately owned farms from 0 49 to 0 57 kg m 3 than in collectively owned farms from 0 43 to 0 45 kg m 3 abdullaev and molden 2004 the analysis of abdullaev and molden 2004 showed that wp levels were higher in dry years than in wet years furthermore wpsupply and wpet were higher in private owned farms due to distinctions in farm ownership policies overall the results of karimov et al 2012 and abdullaev and molden 2004 indicate that achieving higher levels of wp is possible by improved water management at the basin level 3 2 water productivity performance analysis of selected practices in fig 1 the various land management and water use practices table 1 have been grouped together in order to evaluate the performance of wpsupply values for cotton some of the practices i e surge flow alternate flow double furrow were used in supplement to furrow irrigation only a single wp value was available for alternate flow and alternate surge horst et al 2007 as can be seen from fig 1 the highest values of wpsupply were achieved with drip irrigation 1 44 kg m 3 followed by furrow irrigation at 1 39 kg m 3 and furrow in combination with mulching at 1 19 kg m 3 respectively review analysis shows that mild deficit irrigation level 0 25 can help to improve wp more detailed information is given in section 3 3 2 akhtar et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 comparing across practices in fig 1 the variability of wpsupply is the most significant for fi ranging from 0 12 to 1 39 kg m 3 the second largest variability is observed in furrow with mulching from 0 39 to 1 19 kg m 3 and in drip irrigation wp ranges from 0 82 to 1 44 kg m 3 drip irrigation offers the highest potential for improvement having the highest minimum point of wp among all practices farmers also can explore the potential for improving fi and supplementing it with mulching deficit irrigation with little water stress level has also shown to be promising with proper use of irrigation scheduling 3 3 water productivity effect of irrigation practices 3 3 1 furrow irrigation to improve wp in irrigated agriculture a range of field experiments were carried out with traditional fi to assess the possibilities of improving irrigation performances in uzbekistan table 1 trends of wpsupply and wpet are given for cotton in fig 2 the values of wpsupply and wpet range between 0 12 1 39 kg m 3 and 0 06 1 11 kg m 3 respectively fig 2 these results indicate that there is a high gap between lowest and highest value of wp however in this review analysis of the wpsupply and wpet over the period 1999 2015 shows an unsteady trend as can be seen from fig 2 in some years a large variation of cotton wp can be observed more specifically variation of wpsupply was between 0 12 1 39 kg m 3 in 2001 whereas wpet varied between 0 006 0 52 kg m 3 in 2006 and 0 40 0 89 kg m 3 in 2010 we also analysed the irrigation water amount and evapotranspiration values reported in the reviewed publications with respect to cotton yield fig 3 as can be seen from this figure use of irrigation water ranged from 1120 12 860 m3 ha 1 average 6990 m3 ha 1 evapotranspiration ranged from 450 to 8200 m3 ha 1 average 4325 m3 ha 1 yield ranged between 250 5400 kg ha 1 average 2825 kg ha 1 at the same time fig 3 illustrates that maximum yield of cotton 5400 kg ha 1 can be achieved with an optimal amount of irrigation and evapotranspiration the optimal irrigation quantity and yield ratio is concentrated between 6000 8000 m3 ha 1 irrigation water resulting in 3000 5400 kg ha 1 cotton yield in this sense it is clear from fig 3 that increases in irrigation water application and evapotranspiration beyond a certain point are not increasing the yield experimental results of dukhovny et al 2016 show that wpsupply and wpet values can be increased from 0 63 to 0 74 kg m 3 and 0 86 1 11 kg m 3 respectively with better irrigation scheduling horst et al 2005 aimed at improving water productivity of cotton by means of adequate irrigation scheduling for fi horst et al 2007 highlighted a comparison of conventional fi with alternative furrow irrigation furrow irrigation surge flow alternative surge flow irrigation and short furrow irrigation results demonstrated that with the conventional fi an average value of wpsupply was 0 38 kg m 3 and the best wp of 0 61 kg m 3 was achieved with surge flow on alternate furrows horst et al 2007 3 3 2 deficit irrigation a number of scholars i e akhtar et al 2013 and pereira et al 2009 have emphasised that application of mild deficit irrigation at range 5 20 has a potential to save 10 25 of water relative to traditional full irrigation and to improve physical wp value by 10 15 table 2 from table 2 it becomes clear that although wp can increase by 18 43 with the application of a moderate level of di 20 40 cotton crop yields are reduced by 14 29 akhtar et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 at a severe level of di water use is reduced by 50 60 in relation to full irrigation but causes a significant yield decline between 30 59 akhtar et al 2013 pereira et al 2009 simulated different di schedules in scenarios under average high and very high climatic demand to assess wpet impacts compared to fi the study shows that under the fi practice wpet value of cotton at average high and very high climatic demand stood at 0 332 0 307 and 0 293 kg m 3 respectively comparatively the simulation modelling results show that the various levels of di can achieve higher wpet values at average climatic demand up to 0 349 kg m 3 at high demand 0 328 kg m 3 and at very high climatic demand up to 0 312 kg m 3 pereira et al 2009 in fergana province of uzbekistan akhtar et al 2013 examined the impact of di levels on crop yield response taking into consideration the various crop development stages in case water supply is reduced by 12 13 during the late crop growth stage it results in a yield increase of 7 8 during the earlier crop growth stage a reduced water supply of 8 9 resulted in a yield loss of 17 18 water deficit at the late ripening stage of cotton would provide an adequate irrigation water saving option for water managers and farmers akhtar et al 2013 from a farmer perspective the higher yield loss translates in reduced income it is known that di requires an accurate irrigation water management in order to achieve high wp with minimal yield loss oweis and hachum 2003 as mentioned by reddy et al 2016 the main reasons for low wp and yield are the mismanagement of irrigation water and very little amount of irrigation water application however at a larger scale i e river basin reduced yields and water savings should then be offset by higher marginal productivity elsewhere this is not in the farmer s interest though with respect to crop yield an application of the mild level of di reveals a slight increase of crop yield or insignificant loss see fig 4 awan et al 2011 estimated that the proportional reduction of irrigation at 25 and 50 could reduce cotton yield by between 10 18 and 22 30 it is evident from the above studies and shown in fig 4 that due to the high yield loss at severe deficit irrigation level this practice may not be economically acceptable for farmers growing cotton and potato 3 3 3 drip irrigation two studies examine wp of cotton under dpi in comparison to traditional furrow irrigation ibragimov et al 2007 komilov et al 2002 in the early 2000 s komilov et al 2002 and ibragimov et al 2007 conducted field experiments at the central experimental station of uzbekistan s national cotton growing research institute the key results of the study demonstrate that higher values of cotton wpet 1 70 kg m 3 komilov et al 2002 and 0 88 kg m 3 ibragimov et al 2007 were achieved by applying dpi leading to water savings of 18 42 under the dpi practice cotton yield increased by 10 22 relative to furrow irrigation fig 5 presents the experimental results of komilov et al 2002 and ibragimov et al 2007 referring to treatment numbers 1 4 and 5 10 respectively from this figure we can see that when irrigation water amount is 2250 m 3 ha 1 and et 1830 m 3 ha 1 the yield reaches 3120 kg ha 1 treatment 1 in fig 5 the wpsupply and wpet values recorded are the highest in this combination of amount of irrigation water et and yield in relation to treatment 1 more than doubling the irrigation amount 4840 m 3 ha 1 and a more than threefold increase in et 6140 m 3 ha 1 in treatment 10 lead to a cotton yield of 4030 kg ha 1 i e a less than half 910 kg ha 1 increase in yield fig 5 due to a rise in irrigation water amount and et value the wp values are decreasing an appropriate irrigation schedule is crucial in order to achieve better water saving in drip irrigation ibragimov et al 2007 komilov et al 2002 overall the findings of ibragimov et al 2007 and komilov et al 2002 as represented in fig 5 are another noteworthy example showing that the excess use of irrigation water is not necessarily leading to increased cotton yield consequently applying an optimal amount of irrigation water is necessary for improvement of wpsupply 3 4 strengths and constraints of irrigation practices this section provides an overview of the strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats analysis of selected practices consolidated in annex a1 a3 based on the review of publications and interviews with local farmers farmers councils and land and water management experts subsequently analysis of the number of responses grouped in ten themes leads to the identification of intersecting priorities of the stakeholders based on swot analysis of the three practices 3 4 1 furrow irrigation practice fi is the dominant and most commonly known irrigation practice in uzbekistan according to interviews fc 2 3 f 9 10 one of the key strengths of fi is its commonly known application annex a1 fi is used by many farmers who can learn from each other and use a knowledge base developed over centuries fi does not require high initial investment costs and electricity for water pumping at farm fields bekchanov et al 2010 also applying different flow regimes like the alternative flow and surge flow regime can save irrigation water and reduce deep percolation horst et al 2007 2005 fi has several weaknesses such as high water consumption need for proper land levelling and high fuel requirements for machinery at sowing periods bekchanov et al 2010 moreover land and water management experts raise concerns about overuse of irrigation water e 3 if irrigation water schedules and norms are not adequately applied pereira et al 2009 farmers would use excessive irrigation water at field level abdullaev and molden 2004 awan 2010 devkota 2011 horst et al 2005 pereira et al 2009 water authorities spend more resources on electricity used for water pumping and regional distribution of water f 14 e 1 however the government subsidizes these costs for farmers water delivery and maintenance costs are charged at relatively low price which does not create sufficient incentives for the efficient use of water djumaboev et al 2017 hamidov 2015 moreover improper irrigation scheduling of furrow irrigation leads to the issue of soil salinity and soil degradation bekchanov et al 2010 according to the interviews water accounting at field level is compromised by lack of proper measurement tools in some instances therefore farmers can only roughly estimate the amount of irrigation water supplied by counting the irrigation application times farmers apply irrigation water three times during the growing period of cotton in wet years and five times in dry years f 16 17 18 19 22 e 3 the farmers use water more efficiently in dry years not by choice but due to water scarcity reddy et al 2012 fi has many opportunities annex a1 considering that farmers do not pay for water itself except charges for water supply it turns to be an opportunity for wider application of fi despite of its high water consumption ibragimov et al 2007 improved irrigation management like better irrigation scheduling involving farmers in water distribution planning and irrigation adjustment to groundwater table depth lead to better results of wp akhtar et al 2013 karimov et al 2012 qureshi et al 2011 reddy et al 2012 moreover additional modern technological solutions like measurement tools e g telemetry calibrated sluices etc and improved human capacity can help to improve the performance of the fi practice provision of extension services can lead to increased farmers awareness about available measurement tools and current technologies fi has several external threats annex a1 for instance the poor irrigation field design and drainage conditions lead to lower efficiency of the irrigation practice and increased soil salinity bekchanov et al 2010 pereira et al 2009 qureshi et al 2011 due to unreliable water supply and unequal water distribution at irrigation system level fc 3 farmers use any chance to irrigate excessively to avoid future crop water stress akhtar et al 2013 when land for expanding irrigation area is limited land productivity has more priority than water productivity for the farmers this leads to over irrigation and low water efficiency in furrow irrigation horst et al 2007 poor drainage conditions make the situation more complicated causing soil degradation and rise of soil salinity horst et al 2005 also there are insufficient experienced specialists to operate fi at irrigation system level e 3 3 4 2 deficit irrigation swot analysis annex a3 shows that the strength of implementing di can be observed in extreme water deficit conditions when it is still possible to derive a minimum income from some crops instead of a total loss pereira et al 2009 di is useful when farmers have open access to irrigation water during sensitive crop growth stages akhtar et al 2013 di also leads to better use of the available soil water and groundwater at the field akhtar et al 2013 chemin et al 2005 pereira et al 2009 as discussed above for the furrow irrigation practice in most cases farmers do not reduce water consumption annex a3 farmers do not consciously implement a water stress strategy but only reduce the quantity of irrigation water in drought years consequently di is implemented only in water scarce years another weakness of di is that it requires uniform water application due to mismanagement of irrigation water supply and unreliable scheduling farmers may have no access to irrigation water in the crop s sensitive growing stage in this sense application of di leads to higher risk of low crop yield when there is no temporal availability of irrigation water akhtar et al 2013 by implementing di water productivity is increasing but the yield is decreasing pereira et al 2009 platonov et al 2008 another major weakness of di is a reduction of yield however from a water authority perspective with the implementation of accurate water accounting and scheduling di may help to save water in drought years for irrigating other crops or for other purposes reddy et al 2012 there are several opportunities for improving the effectiveness of di annex a3 there is potential to increase wp by using proper water management and improving institutional capacity e g equal water distribution reliable water supply quantity and application timing akhtar et al 2013 reddy et al 2016 2012 effectiveness can also be improved by accurate irrigation water scheduling carli et al 2014 if information about expected drought is available it is preferable to plant in a smaller plot with no or moderate deficit irrigation rather than an extreme deficit in a larger area reddy et al 2016 saved water can be used later in more sensitive periods by using small water storage facilities akhtar et al 2013 3 4 3 drip irrigation practice water saving technologies like drip irrigation systems were acknowledged as water efficient practice in the field by interviewees f 10 e 2 3 annex a2 it is important to note that dpi has the potential to increase crop yield f 10 e 2 3 and increase economic benefit bekchanov et al 2010 ibragimov et al 2007 karimov et al 2012 another strong point is that dpi requires less labour input and fertilizers as the fertigation process through the drip system enables more direct application to the plant resulting in fertilizer savings bekchanov et al 2010 there is the possibility of irrigation by simple automation drip system e 2 f 21 in terms of water availability it is also possible to use groundwater when surface water is scarce karimov et al 2012 in rain fed areas where water availability is unpredictable drip irrigation is one of the solutions used for supplementary irrigation in dry periods fc 1 f 1 also those farmers who have dpi systems can individually control their water scheduling while other irrigated farmers mainly rely on operation management from the water users association wua one of the main weaknesses of dpi is the high investment cost of this technology annex a2 the cost of introducing a drip irrigation system per one hectare was estimated as 2 million uzbek sums in 2005 then equivalent to 1600 usd in the khorezm region with an average lifetime of eight years bobojonov 2008 in our interviews with local farmers we found out an average cost for dpi technology of 2000 usd per hectare in 2017 f 10 14 20 i e an apparent price increase of 25 over the period 2005 2017 furthermore operation and maintenance costs e g due to short lifetime of drip tubes need for skilled labour and good water quality are high bekchanov et al 2010 ibragimov et al 2007 moreover dpi requires costly electricity resources for water pumping and allocation f 14 e 1 4 these costs are still viable for fruit producers while the return on investment is low for wheat and cotton due to high investment cost and low profit ibragimov et al 2007 f 10 e 2 3 4 the policy of the government to both subsidize the cheap water and promote water saving technology turns to double expenditure for the government and hampers uptake of water saving technology despite the fact that dpi requires fewer labour resources it needs well trained skilled labour to operate the dpi system f 11 the lack of this capacity in place is a constraint for wider adoption of dpi an important opportunity for dpi lies in policy change annex a2 it is important to point out that the government of uzbekistan provides incentives for the adoption of water saving technologies such as drip irrigation annex a2 the incentives given to farmers for the adoption of drip irrigation include 5 years of land use tax reduction and low rate loans from banks for investment in water saving technology fc 3 4 f 11 f 20 e 1 3 those farmers responsible for supplying cotton and wheat crops to the government have limited options as the government buys crops crop yield ha at fixed prices agreed on contract basis studies of bobojonov et al 2010 and djanibekov et al 2012 indicate that reduction of the state production targets of cotton and wheat stipulated in land use policy reform can help to achieve more rational water use and adoption of water saving technologies for example over the past years less profitable cotton wheat growing areas were converted to intensive horticulture with drip irrigation due to favorable changes in land use policy fc 3 4 current market trade agreements with neighbouring and other countries have significantly increased export potentials of agricultural products fruits and vegetables and help securing a return on dpi investment fc 3 4 f 20 consequently modern technologies like drip irrigation are an affordable capital investment for farmers who grow fruits fc 3 4 f 20 policy and incentives are also considered as potential threats of the dpi practice annex a2 despite the fact that the distribution of water is governmentment subsidized and cost of water is cheap for the farmer however these incentives appear not enough for boosting wide scale rationale water use and adoption of dpi technology for cotton and wheat producers bekchanov et al 2010 research by bekchanov et al 2010 points out that fussy availability of bank credits leads to this observed late adoption moreover lack of mass production of dpi parts locally creates dependency on import bekchanov et al 2010 consequently only fruit producers are interested in investing in water saving practices some of them are located in rainfed lands where supplemental irrigation is needed 3 5 intersection of irrigation practices with the group of themes in swot analysis by further analysing given responses in the swot data table 3 several findings can be highlighted such as that overall investment and operational cost emerges as the theme with the largest number of responses in total 27 among ten themes followed by the irrigation and management at field and basin and policy and incentives themes the same top 3 themes come on top when only considering quotes from interviews from a research point of view based on the number of mentions in the literature the themes receiving the highest attention are irrigation and management at field and basin investment and operational cost and knowledge capacity comparing each theme in more detail investment and operational cost received high attention from local farmers and researchers for all practices specifically dpi is frequently discussed as a technological advancement requiring high investment cost providing viable economic return for particular farm types only e g private farms growing fruit and vegetables bobojonov 2008 ibragimov et al 2007 f 10 14 20 in this sense among all practices local stakeholders and researchers more critically addressed the high investment cost for dpi technology table 3 secondly irrigation management at field and basin has been addressed in multiple responses for the fi practice while few responses are given in relation to di literature study shows that despite the major weaknesses of fi exposed by local stakeholders who express a demand to improve irrigation management main opportunities and external threats fall under the same category options to enhance fi performance are strongly dependent on solving external threats e g irrigation management fi and di also hold scope for improving irrigation management at different scales thirdly based on interview data table 3 the policy and incentives theme received the largest number of responses supporting a single statement which concerned opportunities for dpi offered by government support in the form of policy and economic incentives mainly for modernisation of horticulture production state policies on land tax and export have created favourable conditions for private farms to scale up the use of dpi however there are threats like limited domestic dpi technology production there is also scope for economic incentives to use water more rationally which would make it more attractive to invest into economically affordable dpi technology furthermore several respondents mentioned strengths for dpi and di practices under the water use efficiency theme table 3 water use efficiency of the dpi practice received the highest number of responses from interviews while the di practice was mentioned most often by research publications in this review fi has been used from ancient times therefore knowledge and skills are well developed by generations of users in this sense the widespread use of the fi practice in the field dominated this theme while information about current knowledge in relation to di and dpi practices is less known from research publications and interviews although fi is a well known and long used practice the progress of upgrading its efficiency in current development is weak looking forward modern technology plays a crucial role many respondents not only recognise that dpi has strengths as a modern technology but at the same time the swot analysis identifies it as an opportunity for all practices too table 3 all themes represent various numbers of responses for swot attributes and irrigation practices in a few occasions themes present trade offs like a trade off between water use efficiency and yield or between scale and access to water these trade offs particularly focus on di and dpi practices but concern themes with the least responses even though some researchers have been contributing to the study di in uzbekistan it is clear from interview data table 3 that less statements were provided for the di practice which can be due to this practice being less commonly practiced among the farmers in the region overall the above mentioned theme categories highlight the key points from the swot analysis in relation to fi dpi and di practices and establishes an agenda of synergistic opportunities for researchers and farmers to pursue 4 conclusions this review analysis provides evidence that the dpi practice has the highest values of wpsupply 1 44 kg m 3 in comparison with fi 1 39 kg m 3 and di at a mild deficit level of 20 0 95 kg m 3 for cotton similarly dpi recorded the highest wpet values at 1 70 kg m 3 in comparison with fi at 1 11 kg m 3 for cotton the differences between wpsupply and wpet values indicate that irrigation water supplies could be reduced the optimal irrigation quantity and yield ratio obtained from analysis of fi studies was between 6000 8000 m3 ha 1 irrigation water resulting in 3000 5400 kg ha 1 cotton yield growing cotton with excessive use of irrigation water is not necessarily leading to increased cotton yield the performance analysis of the different land management and water use practices indicated that there is considerable scope to increase wpsupply values which vary from 0 12 to 1 44 kg m 3 for cotton in particular a large variability in wpsupply was observed in the fi mulching di and dpi practices for cotton each of the practices has different milestones to reach best performance for instance fi presents large scope for upgrading its efficiency by adequately resolving the issues inhibiting improved water management practices like reliable water distribution irrigation water scheduling and water accounting at field level dpi has the highest performance among irrigation practices when considering minimum and maximum wp values investment return of dpi is viable for private farms growing fruit and vegetables partially aided by government support in the form of economic incentives land tax and export policies in uzbekistan for horticulture production compared to other practices wp values of di within 0 25 water stress show that the water saving potential of this practice is high albeit it comes with a certain yield reduction consequence since high crop yield is the key indicator for farmers to adopt a certain practice di has the least opportunity to be adopted on wider scale the irrigation and management at field and basin options to increase water productivity are playing a major role in addressing water scarcity with much to be gained from adoption and scaling up of promising water saving practices but beyond the technical improvements afforded by water saving practices taking in consideration the research studies and interview results as a whole investment and operational cost emerges as the bottleneck theme with the highest given attention for all three practices in this sense any promising practice as a tool for saving water may not be effective unless an enabling environment is in place overall water productivity scope can be enhanced with building an appropriate system of socio economic and policy incentives supporting users of the practices although these findings focus on the uzbek situation they can be beneficial to other semi arid regions moreover the scoping method presented can be replicated for other context specific assessments of land management and water use

11399,paddy fields are drained and irrigated several times during the whole rice growth period although studies have acknowledged the sensitivity of flooding and drainage in rice rhizosphere current knowledge regarding how moderate drying at grain filling stage affects ecological characteristics of rice rhizosphere is limited a field experiment with two irrigation regimes alternate moderate wetting and drying irrigation amwd and continuous irrigation ci was conducted to investigate the changes in soil physical and chemical properties and microbial communities results from this investigation demonstrated that soil ph under amwd was decreased while eh was increased moreover soil electrical conductivity increased and decreased with a decline in soil water potential interestingly all studied variables quickly recovered after re watering the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism t rflp analysis revealed that the diversity indices of bacterial communities were higher in drying phase as compared to the initial treatment of amwd regime but the evenness index decreased remarkably amwd process increased the proportion of aerobic bacteria such as azotobacter nitrifying bacteria phosphate and potassium solubilizing bacteria which participate in the nutrient cycling in addition the increase of enzyme activity under amwd regime promoted the release of nutrients thereby enhancing the amounts of no3 n available phosphorus p and potassium k in soils which met rice nutrient demands at late grain filling stage this led to a promotion in plant physiological activities and grain filling and hence increased grain yield from these results we infer that there was a positive response of rice rhizosphere to amwd irrigation at grain filling stage which laid the groundwork to set up a sound irrigation system in rice fields without reducing its yield keywords alternate wetting and drying grain filling photosynthesis root activity soil redox potential eh t rflp 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is an important food crop for a large proportion of the world s population fageria 2007 worldwide around 93 million ha of irrigated lowland rice provide 75 of the world s rice production lampayan et al 2015a however irrigation water resource has shrunk in many areas due to global population growth increasing urban and industrial demand bouman 2007 watanabe et al 2013 to meet the major challenge of incremented rice production under increasing scarcity of water resources alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd has been widely adopted in many southeast asian countries and china as a water saving technique chu et al 2014 lampayan et al 2015b the most appealing feature of awd to reduce irrigation water use is mainly attributed to rationally controlling the water supply amount and timing liu et al 2013 indicated that water application from transplanting to maturity was 412 435 mm in awd regime which was 78 1 79 5 of that 527 5 547 mm applied to the standard irrigation practice continuous irrigation ci from these results it is obviously that awd can significantly save an amount of irrigation water research demonstrates that in comparison with the ci regime the alternate moderate wetting and soil drying amwd regime has significantly progressed nevertheless the alternate severe wetting and soil drying aswd regime significantly decreased root oxidation activity phytohormonal signaling leaf photosynthetic rate dry matter accumulation and consequently affected the grain filling rate and grain yield zhang et al 2009a liu et al 2013 dodd et al 2015 pascual and wang 2017 this implied that soil moisture content is a very important factor affecting grain yield a moderate degree of soil hydropenia in the soil drying phase of awd would not seriously affect plant water status and be a limitation factor for the rice plants growth zhang et al 2010 miao et al 2015 however the physiological mechanisms underpinning these responses are not fully understood especially the effects of amwd on belowground processes remains to be elucidated as an integral part of plant organs roots are in direct contact with the surrounding environment of soil and involved in acquisition of nutrients and water yang et al 2004 soil moderate drying and re watering can greatly promote the extension and initiation of root particularly secondary roots liang et al 1996 the work of yang et al 2012 has shown that when compared with the continuous flooding amwd regime significantly increased the number of mitochondria golgi bodies and amyloplasts in root tip cells at the panicle initiation stage and the aswd regime exhibited an opposite effect numerous reports indicated that an increase in root biomass root length density root oxidation activity and root sourced hormones promoted shoot system growth and development of shoot system leading to higher grain yield yang et al 2007 dong et al 2012 zhou et al 2017 thus indicating that the stronger physiological activities of roots may be the major reason for the high yield under water saving irrigation nonetheless the real situations of root growth in the field is not easily recognized by visual inspection and in situ sampling and the assessments of the amwd effects on rice root fitness are still hardly proceeded and inconclusive it is generally believed that about 30 60 of the net fixed carbon is transferred to the roots in annual plants and a considerable proportion of that carbon between 40 and 90 can be released into the rhizosphere lynch and whipps 1990 neumann and römheld 2000 the rhizosphere is a narrow region of soil that is strongly affected by plant root activities and metabolism bell et al 2015 under varying moisture conditions several changes occurred in the rhizospheric environment previous literature indicated that when paddy field was subjected to drying processes the gaseous exchange between the atmosphere and soil was strengthened and adequate oxygen was consequently added to the rhizosphere miao et al 2015 this can greatly improve soil redox and promote the action of microorganisms and avoid the accumulation of poisonous substances in the rhizosphere mao 2002 contrarily flooding can lower the soil redox potential eh and increase the hydrous oxides of fe mn and al and this can increase metal adsorption li et al 2015 it is noteworthy that soil eh has been implicated not only as a ratio of oxidized to reduced forms that adopted to indirect changes of soil oxygen concentration but an important role in regulating root growth flowering development of floral organs leaf sectoring and photoperiodism xing et al 2006 rosso et al 2009 husson 2013 vo and kang 2013 all these suggest that rhizosphere environmental disturbances are one of the important factors affecting rice growth and its grain filling therefore we hypothesized that different irrigation regimes can produce severe modification in morphology and physiology traits of roots with significant impact on the above ground plant growth and development since a comprehensive assessment of the influence on rhizosphere ecosystem functioning was lacking we investigated the potential relation between rhizosphere ecological environment and the physiological status of rice plant under an alternate moderate wetting and soil drying regime amwd at grain filling stage the rhizosphere eco factors were mainly focused on soil ph redox potential eh electrical conductivity ec available nutrient enzymatic activities and bacterial communities structure the purpose of this study was to find out the changing pattern of rhizosphere eco factors and then provide a theoretical basis for high yielding cultivation and water management

the basal dressing and 50 as the top dressing panicles 50 of plants headed on 6 july in 2012 and 7 july in 2013 harvesting was done on 16 august in 2012 and 18 august in 2013 except for soil drying one time at the tiller number reached the expected 80 of panicles the water level in the plot was kept at 2 3 cm until 6 days after heading dah when the treatments were initiated 2 2 treatments the experiment was laid out in a complete randomized block design with three replications the plots were separated by an alley of 20 cm wide and 50 cm depth of concrete barriers two irrigation regimes alternate moderate wetting and drying irrigation amwd and continuous irrigation ci were conducted from 6 days after heading dah to maturity in amwd plants were not irrigated until the soil water potential had reached 25 2 kpa at 20 cm depth the ci regime was kept a shallow layer of water 2 3 cm depth until one week before harvest as recommended farming practices three granular matrix sensors gms watermark soil moisture sensor irrometer co riverside ca were installed in each plot in the amwd regime according to shock et al 2005 and readings were recorded at 10 00 a m and 4 00 p m daily when soil water potential reached the threshold a flood with 2 3 cm water depth was applied to the plots the amount of irrigation water was estimated by volumetric water meters and recorded immediately after water application a rain shelter consisting of a steel frame covered with a plastic sheet was used in each block to minimize the effect of rainfall precipitation on the treatments and was removed after the rain 2 3 soil physico chemical parameters and plant growth status six rice plants with similar developmental status were randomly selected and tagged for each plot as fixed point observation the soil ph redox potential eh and electrical conductivity ec at 5 cm distance and 10 cm depth around the base of chosen plants were measured daily between 9 00 11 00 in the morning from 5 to 35 dah a portable ph meter iq 150 spectrum technologies inc illinois usa orp depolarization automatic analyzer fja 6 chuan di inc nanjing china and wet sensor wet 2 delta t devices ltd burwell cambridge uk were used for soil ph eh and ec measurement in the field respectively meanwhile chlorophyll contents and photosynthetic parameters of the flag leaves were monitored at 5 day intervals after 5 dah chlorophyll contents were estimated by a portable chlorophyll meter spad 502 konica minolta inc osaka japan as formerly described by peng et al 1993 with 10 spad readings for each plot net photosynthesis pn instantaneous transpiration rate tr were determined by a li 6400 portable photosynthesis system li cor lincoln ne usa according to ren et al 2015 water use efficiency wue was calculated as the ratio of pn to tr pn tr 2 4 sampling and physiological measurements rhizosphere soil samples were obtained by removing three representative plants from each plot at every five days between 5 to 35 dah through shaking roots and collecting soil adhering to plant roots one subsample of the fresh soil was stored at 4 c and analyzed within 2 days after sampling for soil enzyme activities the remaining soils were air dried ground and filtered by 2 mm sieve then homogenized for analysis of available nutrients all soil parameter values were presented from oven dried soil simultaneously the rest of the roots were washed thoroughly with tap water and dry weights at 80 c to constant weight of shoots and roots were recorded bleeding rate has been widely used as an index of root activity and the measurements were carried out according to the method described by matsuo and mochizuki 2009 which was also measured at every five days during the treatment period in four hills per plot in both amwd and ci regime each plant was cut at an internode about 10 cm above the soil surface pre weighted cotton pads were placed on the cut end and this was covered by plastic film sealed with rubber bands at 6 00 p m the next morning at 8 00 a m the cotton pads were weighted to measure the bleeding rate nh4 n and no3 n contents were spectrophotometrically measured using indophenol blue photometric and phenol disulfonic acid respectively tan et al 2013 soil available p was analyzed by phosphomolybdate blue colorimetry nh4f hcl extraction while available k content in the soil was determined by flame photometry after extraction with 1 m ammonium acetate nh4oac solution buffered at ph 7 likewise soil urease invertase catalase phosphatase and polyphenol oxidase activities were assayed as described by guan et al 1986 and soil nitrate reductase was determined by the method described by alef and nannipieri 1995 2 5 final harvesting the spikelets on the first and second primary rachis branches counted from the top of the panicle were designated as superior and the base of secondary rachis branches of the lowest primary branch as inferior spikelets ishimaru et al 2003 yield components including spikelet number per panicle percentage of filled grains and 1000 grain weight of superior and inferior spikelets were derived from 6 plants with nearly the average number of panicles calculated from 50 plants were selected from both amwd and ci plants except border plants a 4 m2 area was harvested manually in each plot for estimating grain yield 2 6 analysis of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism t rflp data sampling was done from the rhizosphere soil of amwd regime prior to the start of experiment 5 dah when soil water was kept shallow and at the other three stages of early grain filling 10 dah when soil water potential was approximately at 5 kpa in drying phase while mid grain filling data was collected 18 dah when soil water potential was approximately at 25 kpa in drying phase and late grain filling 27 dah when plants were re watered the total dna was extracted from 0 5 g of soil samples using the biofast soil dna kit bioer technology co ltd zhejiang china according to the manufacturer s protocol the amounts of the extracted dna were detected using a biophotometer eppendorf hamburg germany and the quality and quantity of the dna was checked on a 1 0 agarose gel and then stored at 20 c until all samples were analyzed together 6 carboxyflurescein labeled primer 27f fam and 1492r were used to amplify the 16s rrna genes by pcr as reported previously wu et al 2015 purified 16s rrna fragments were digested with fastdigest alui haeiii mspi and rsai thermo scientific for 30 min at 37 c the length of terminal restriction fragments t rfs were determined by an automated abi 3730xl dna sequencer applied biosystems foster city usa restriction fragment analyses were conducted using genemarker version 1 2 softgenetics llc pa usa the relative abundance of a t rf was calculated by dividing the peak area of the t rf by the total peak area of all t rfs detected within a fragment length range between 35 and 700 bp wu et al 2015 affiliations of the fragments were determined via online t rflp analysis of ribosomal database project ii lin et al 2012 the total number of peaks pi 1 in a sample was used as the measured species richness s where pi is the proportion of an individual peak area relative to the sum of all peak areas the shannon wiener diversity index h and shannon evenness e were calculated as the following equation h pi log pi and e h log s respectively 2 7 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was performed using spss 19 0 and least significant difference lsd multiple comparison was used to determine significant differences between treatments α 0 05 origin software version 8 0 was used for drawing figures the data of soil available nutrient and enzymatic activities were averaged across two near sampling dates due to each cycle of the dry wet process roughly experienced 4 5 days 3 results 3 1 grain yield and the changes in the physiological status in plants table 1 shows that rice yield varied significantly between amwd and ci regimes the impact of panicles per m 2 and spikelets per panicle were not significant due to the irrigation treatments which started after heading however the average percentage of filled grains and 1 000 grain weight of inferior spikelets under amwd were remarkably increased by 11 1 and 17 0 respectively as compared with that in the ci condition and consequently causing grain yield increase by 9 2 12 3 subsequently we found that the pn of flag leaves slightly increased following re watering in amwd treatment but its tr decreased significantly which contributed to the average increase in instantaneous wue of 8 3 and the chlorophyll contents as estimated by spad was only lower at the late grain filling stage 30 35 dah than that in ci treatment supplementary fig s1 and s2 simultaneously it significantly enhanced the above ground dry biomass fig 2 and indicated a positive influence on root bleeding rate which revealed a physiological activity of roots fig 3 this ultimately maintained a higher root biomass and root shoot ratios in amwd compared with ci at mid and late grain filling stages 20 35 dah the results exhibited the same tendencies across the two experimental years 3 2 changes in soil ph eh and ec over the entire length of the treatments in 2013 the ci regime received 11 times with 204 7 mm of irrigation at 2 3 d interval whereas the amwd regime was irrigated 6 times with 145 8 mm apart from 7 d to reach soil water potential of 25 kpa for the first time most irrigation cycles only took 4 5 d fig s1 fig 4 a compared to the ci regime amwd regime could apparently save 28 8 irrigation water fig s3 in the ci regime ph and eh were relatively stable between 6 5 6 8 and 174 9 218 4 mv after a prolonged period of irrigation by contrast soil ph decreased significantly after imposing a loss of soil water saturation at 6 dah with a decrease being lowest when the soil water potential was 25 kpa in the amwd regime fig 4b moreover soil eh values increased and reached a peak of about 314 369 mv when the soil water potential reached 25 kpa fig 4c soil ph values increased and eh decreased with re watering at 13 18 22 26 30 and 33 dah but did not reach the previous levels obtained after the initial treatment in contrast soil ec was higher during the first two cycles of dry wet process and decreased later to about 14 2 in amwd over the same period of ci fig 4d 3 3 soil available nutrient contents as shown in fig 5 there were significant differences in the available nutrients of rice rhizosphere between amwd and ci regimes in general the content of nh4 n in the amwd regime demonstrated a declining trend with time and the average fell to 0 73 mg kg 1 in 20 35 dah 37 3 lower than that in the ci regime fig 5a furthermore there was a significantly higher content of no3 n in amwd regime relative to ci regime at 10 15 dah first re rewetting period consequently there was a sharp increase thereafter reaching a maximum at 20 25 dah and then declined slightly fig 5b very similarly to no3 n available k reached a peak concentration at 15 25 dah in awd regime the mean concentration increased by 50 5 when compared with that in the ci regime fig 5d in amwd regime the content of available p revealed no superiority effect relative to the ci regime at earlier measurement times but it was reversed by the concomitant cycle times increasing with re watering which was about twice as much as that in the ci regime measured at 30 35 dah fig 5c 3 4 soil enzymatic activities the activities of rice rhizospheric soil enzymes exhibited marked differences between the two irrigation regimes fig 6 over the entire study period except for 5 10 dah soil invertase urease and phosphatase activities were significantly higher in the amwd regime than in the ci regime fig 6b d in contrast soil polyphenol oxidase and nitrate reductase activities were lower in amwd regime than in ci regime at earlier measurement times but they were reversed at later measurement times indicating that these two soil enzymatic activities were more sensitive to the cycle times of re watering fig 6a e moreover catalase activity fluctuations in the ci regime contributed substantially to the mean values which was much lower than in the amwd regime within 10 30 dah 3 5 soil microbe analysis by t rflp the diversity variations of bacterial communities based on the t rflp results are presented in table 2 statistically significant differences of the diversity index of bacterial communities were detected among the different time periods of amwd regime compared to the 5 dah the soil samples of 10 dah revealed a significantly greater species richness of 18 and 12 t rfs generated respectively by haeⅲ and mspⅰ in response to drainage a similar tendency of variation was observed in the soil samples of 18 dah interestingly the abundance of t rfs obtained by aluⅰ haeⅲ rsaⅰindicated no significant difference as a result of the 27 dah as compared to that of the 5 dah however the evenness index values estimated from the rsaⅰ digested t rflp data at 27 dah and 18 dah showed a reverse trend significantly higher equitability than that at 5 dah for the soil samples of 10 dah the values of evenness derived from haeⅲ mspⅰand rsaⅰ substantially declined as compared to the data at treatment initiation 5 dah table 2 meanwhile shannon wiener index obtained from four restriction enzymes showed that soil samples of both 18 dah and 27 dah were more diverse than that of 5 dah by the amwd process after several cycle times of re watering whereas it declined in the soil samples of 10 dah when amwd treatment started at the early grain filling stage for the 16s rdna t rflp profiles which were derived from aluⅰ haeⅲ mspⅰ and rsaⅰ digestions the number of t rfs in comparison with the ribosomal database project ii identified 73 255 110 and 100 types of bacteria in the soil samples of 5 dah 10 dah 18 dah and 27 dah respectively all microbes were categorized into 15 phyla 163 genera and 642 species as shown in fig 7 a at the phylum level the proportions of t rfs that affiliated to actinobacteria and bacteroidetes were notably altered by the amwd process at either soil drying or the re watering time whereas tenericutes 5 57 was the most dominant in the soil samples of 5 dah furthermore classification at the genus level revealed that the predominant t rfs were affiliated to kitasatospora 8 21 and clostridium 8 96 in the 5 dah samples while rhodococcus 5 56 and paenibacillus 3 33 were present in the 27 dah it was further noted that the dominant taxa of novosphingobium 3 77 and brevibacillus 7 80 were detected in the soil samples of 18 dah and 10 dah respectively fig 7b the relative abundance of rhizospheric soil bacteria exhibited that amwd regime produced a significant increase values of t rfs including aluⅰ 234 and 236 bp mspⅰ 122 and 128 bp and rsaⅰ 476 bp in the rhizosphere at either the soil drying or the re watering time however there was a reduction in haeⅲ 199 bp mspⅰ 88 and 140 bp table 3 than the soil samples of 5 dah assignation from pat has identified the fragments mostly to be from the phylum firmicutes proteobacteria and actinobacteria toward an ecological function classification of the dominant bacteria the proportion of aerobic bacteria related to the recycling of soil nutrients increased dramatically in the soil samples during drying phase especially the soil water potential reached 25 kpa we further observed that azotobacter azospirillum brasilense str beijerinckia indica subsp frankia sp str herbaspirillum nitrifying bacteria nitrosospira phosporus solubilizing or potassium solubilizing bacteria bacillus edaphicus str agrobacterium vitis str were abundant under amwd regime while anaerobic or facultative anaerobic denitrifying bacteria neisseria denitrificans and sulfate reducing bacteria desulfobulbus desulfovibrio senezii showed much lower abundance in the recycling regime amwd than in the initial treatment at 5 dah table 3 4 discussion in the present study we found that amwd regime helped save 28 8 irrigation water and increased yield significantly by 9 2 12 3 when compared with ci regime this increment was mainly due to the increased percentage of filled grains and grain weight of inferior grain fig s3 table 1 which was consistent with the results of zhang et al 2010 the essence of grain filling is the process of translocation and accumulation of photosynthates from source to sink it has been reported that more than 60 of grain filling substance in rice comes from photosynthate after heading zhang et al 2009b from supplementary fig s1 it was evident that the photosynthetic rate in flag leaves showed no significant difference between the two irrigation regimes at soil drying time but when water was applied it was slightly higher in amwd than that in ci regime also because of this with significant decreases of transpiration rate improving instantaneous wue of leaf was observed in amwd than that in ci fig s1 besides there was no difference in chlorophyll content up to 30 dah in both irrigation treatments fig s2 the chlorophyll contents spad value of the flag leaves showed a high degree of correlation with leaf photosynthetic function duration wei et al 2016 these findings implied that a moderate soil drying didn t negatively affect the photosynthetic productivity during grain filling stage this conclusion was further supported by the enhancement of shoot and root biomass accumulation in amwd when compared with ci fig 2 in addition an improved root activity root bleeding rate and root shoot ratio were observed in amwd regime figs 2 and 3 which was essential for maintaining root absorption ability and reduce water loss through transpiration zhang et al 2017 it is therefore reasonable for us to infer that the stimulation of root growth by moderate dry wet cycles could be partly owing to the changes in rhizosphere ecological environment based on our observations a proposed model for underlying mechanism of rice rhizosphere in response to amwd treatment is presented in fig 8 and discussed below here we performed an analysis in situ at the base of rice plant and observed that soil eh fluctuated from about 230 mv to about 370 mv in the amwd but remained constant at about 200 mv while continuously flooded fig 4c there is an assumption that an arbitrary limit of 300 mv eh exists between oxidized and reduced soils tokarz and urban 2015 the results presented here as well as the results of liu et al 2012 indicate that decreased water content can induce variations from reductive to oxidative status this implies that a higher redox potential can result in the precipitation of mn and fe oxides kogel knabner et al 2010 and thus reactions that release protons and decrease the ph fig 4b accordingly an increase in hydrogen ion concentration can have a competitive advantage at the surface adsorption sites relative to the nh4 k ca2 and mg2 thus leading to a large proportion of base cations being released into the rhizosphere tomlinson 1983 which indirectly enhanced soil nutrient availability similar observations have also been recorded by husson 2013 who indicated that eh and ph changes could indirectly increase p availability in soil through affecting the solubility of metal cations which fix p specifically mn al fe oxides and hydroxides in this study the concentrations of both no3 n and available k decreased simultaneously with ec in amwd regime at later measurement times 20 35 dah figs 4 and 5 this could be possibly due to better nutrient uptake by rice root and lowered ec rui and wienhold 2002 as evidenced by the higher dry matter accumulation and root bleeding rate in amwd than in ci treatment figs 2 and 3 the results of t rflp in this study indicated that the diversity index of bacterial community was enhanced when water status of soils changed from flooding to drought while the evenness index declined table 2 paddy soil being an anthropogenic soil has been drained several times during the whole rice growth period which resulted in sharp variations of microbial community structure noll et al 2005 furthermore moderate drying can improve the diversity of bacterial community structure in soil rhizosphere while the opposite is true for excessive drying and wetting peralta et al 2014 this research found that soil drying phase of the amwd cycle indeed promoted the growth of aerobic bacteria including mycobacterium sp frankia sp β proteobacteria brevibacillus brevis and bacillus edaphicus but reduced the anaerobic bacterial growth such as desulfovibrio and anaerobranca table 2 however other studies have shown that a vast amount of anaerobic bacteria prefers to reside in continuous flooding condition rather than in amwd condition on the other hand in another study aerobic bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi were higher in amwd condition unger et al 2009 during the amwd process there was a cyclical variation in soil ph and eh in a way that a decline in soil moisture content led to a decrease in ph value but increased eh fig 4 soil ph and eh had been reported as important factors affecting the diversity of soil microbial community husson 2013 soil oxidation and reduction were the main means for microbes to obtain energy thus each type of microorganism is adapted to specific ph and eh conditions and is characterized by its ability to develop within a wider or a narrower range aerobic bacteria such as actinomyces sp or azotobacter sp multiply rapidly at high eh values while the anaerobic bacteria performed better at a lower eh value condition rabotnova and schwartz 1962 previous study has indicated that soil ph impacts on the enzymatic activity of microbial cell as well as reduce the ability of soil microbial community to utilize organic compounds dues to electrolysis and amendments cang et al 2007 our findings assumed that aerobic bacteria released co2 during the process of respiration and resulted in the reduction of soil ph value however with the submerged treatment the activity of anaerobic bacteria was dominant thereby depleting soil organic matter and oxyanions such as no3 no2 and so4 2 which led to a sharp decline in eh values hinsinger et al 2003 these findings suggested that there was a significant interaction among the soil ph eh and microbial activities soil enzymes as biochemical catalysts of specific reactions play an important role in maintaining soil ecology however we observed changes in different enzyme activities with varying soil water conditions the work of waldrop and firestone 2004 has shown that increasing soil water content reduced the activities of phenol oxidase and peroxidase but the effect was not significant for other enzyme activities in our study the soil enzymatic activities of invertase urease and phosphatase activities increased under conditions of amwd regime fig 6b d which was consistent with earlier findings yang et al 2005 it has been reported that anaerobic conditions inhibited soil enzymatic activities by mobilizing some metal ions notably fe2 while a mild water deficit increased oxygen availability and the removal of inhibitory metal ions could activate the enzyme activities pulford and tabatabai 1988 kang and freeman 1999 in addition we found that the soil polyphenoloxidase and nitrate reductase activities revealed more sensitivity to the cycle times of re watering in amwd soil than in ci soil fig 6a e it is possible that activity changes for different enzymes were closely associated with the dramatic change in soil ph and eh this is supported by mclatchey and reddy 1998 who clarified that phenol oxidase activity could only be detected under aerobic conditions and acidic conditions of aerobic soils induce a negative effectiveness because of the ph out of its optimal range likewise kang and freeman 1999 noted that hydrogen ion concentration could modify the enzyme reaction site but also the stability of immobilized enzymes in the soil matrix moreover soil ph can indirectly impact soil enzyme activity via changing to the activities of microorganisms and the composition of microbial community which also affects soil enzyme production and diversity wittmann et al 2004 weintraub et al 2007 the amwd process improved the proportion of aerobic bacteria such as azotobacter nitrifying bacteria phosphorus solubilizing and potassium solubilizing bacteria which participate in the nutrient cycling furthermore an increase in enzyme activity promoted the release of nutrients and thereby enhanced the amount of nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and potassium in soils simultaneously amwd treatment also enhanced soil oxygen content and improved the respiration activity and absorption capacity of the root fig 3 this subsequently triggered root growth systematic senescence remobilization of reserves from sheath stem to grain pools li et al 2016 and thus increased number of filled grains and grain weight of inferior spikelets table 1 however the detailed information about the interaction between the rhizospheric microbial communities with rice roots and their environments mediated by root exudates have not been reported under amwd regime therefore these factors need further investigation 5 conclusion the present results demonstrate that amwd is the best irrigation regime which saves water and yet increases yield relative to ci at grain filling stage furthermore amwd regime periodically changed the soil ph and eh in turn improved a proportion of aerobic bacteria consequently increased the nutrition in rhizosphere soil and enhanced the enzyme activities during grain filling relative to ci regime consequently the cycling and transfer of nutrients in soil were accelerated which replenished the available nutrients in rhizosphere soil at the later stage of rice in addition adequate oxygen improved the respiration activity and absorption capacity of rice root therefore the amwd treatment had a great promise to improve physiological activity by preventing rapid senescence of rice during the grain filling phase and accelerated nutrient remobilization into rice grain and hence increased yield acknowledgements

11399,paddy fields are drained and irrigated several times during the whole rice growth period although studies have acknowledged the sensitivity of flooding and drainage in rice rhizosphere current knowledge regarding how moderate drying at grain filling stage affects ecological characteristics of rice rhizosphere is limited a field experiment with two irrigation regimes alternate moderate wetting and drying irrigation amwd and continuous irrigation ci was conducted to investigate the changes in soil physical and chemical properties and microbial communities results from this investigation demonstrated that soil ph under amwd was decreased while eh was increased moreover soil electrical conductivity increased and decreased with a decline in soil water potential interestingly all studied variables quickly recovered after re watering the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism t rflp analysis revealed that the diversity indices of bacterial communities were higher in drying phase as compared to the initial treatment of amwd regime but the evenness index decreased remarkably amwd process increased the proportion of aerobic bacteria such as azotobacter nitrifying bacteria phosphate and potassium solubilizing bacteria which participate in the nutrient cycling in addition the increase of enzyme activity under amwd regime promoted the release of nutrients thereby enhancing the amounts of no3 n available phosphorus p and potassium k in soils which met rice nutrient demands at late grain filling stage this led to a promotion in plant physiological activities and grain filling and hence increased grain yield from these results we infer that there was a positive response of rice rhizosphere to amwd irrigation at grain filling stage which laid the groundwork to set up a sound irrigation system in rice fields without reducing its yield keywords alternate wetting and drying grain filling photosynthesis root activity soil redox potential eh t rflp 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is an important food crop for a large proportion of the world s population fageria 2007 worldwide around 93 million ha of irrigated lowland rice provide 75 of the world s rice production lampayan et al 2015a however irrigation water resource has shrunk in many areas due to global population growth increasing urban and industrial demand bouman 2007 watanabe et al 2013 to meet the major challenge of incremented rice production under increasing scarcity of water resources alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd has been widely adopted in many southeast asian countries and china as a water saving technique chu et al 2014 lampayan et al 2015b the most appealing feature of awd to reduce irrigation water use is mainly attributed to rationally controlling the water supply amount and timing liu et al 2013 indicated that water application from transplanting to maturity was 412 435 mm in awd regime which was 78 1 79 5 of that 527 5 547 mm applied to the standard irrigation practice continuous irrigation ci from these results it is obviously that awd can significantly save an amount of irrigation water research demonstrates that in comparison with the ci regime the alternate moderate wetting and soil drying amwd regime has significantly progressed nevertheless the alternate severe wetting and soil drying aswd regime significantly decreased root oxidation activity phytohormonal signaling leaf photosynthetic rate dry matter accumulation and consequently affected the grain filling rate and grain yield zhang et al 2009a liu et al 2013 dodd et al 2015 pascual and wang 2017 this implied that soil moisture content is a very important factor affecting grain yield a moderate degree of soil hydropenia in the soil drying phase of awd would not seriously affect plant water status and be a limitation factor for the rice plants growth zhang et al 2010 miao et al 2015 however the physiological mechanisms underpinning these responses are not fully understood especially the effects of amwd on belowground processes remains to be elucidated as an integral part of plant organs roots are in direct contact with the surrounding environment of soil and involved in acquisition of nutrients and water yang et al 2004 soil moderate drying and re watering can greatly promote the extension and initiation of root particularly secondary roots liang et al 1996 the work of yang et al 2012 has shown that when compared with the continuous flooding amwd regime significantly increased the number of mitochondria golgi bodies and amyloplasts in root tip cells at the panicle initiation stage and the aswd regime exhibited an opposite effect numerous reports indicated that an increase in root biomass root length density root oxidation activity and root sourced hormones promoted shoot system growth and development of shoot system leading to higher grain yield yang et al 2007 dong et al 2012 zhou et al 2017 thus indicating that the stronger physiological activities of roots may be the major reason for the high yield under water saving irrigation nonetheless the real situations of root growth in the field is not easily recognized by visual inspection and in situ sampling and the assessments of the amwd effects on rice root fitness are still hardly proceeded and inconclusive it is generally believed that about 30 60 of the net fixed carbon is transferred to the roots in annual plants and a considerable proportion of that carbon between 40 and 90 can be released into the rhizosphere lynch and whipps 1990 neumann and römheld 2000 the rhizosphere is a narrow region of soil that is strongly affected by plant root activities and metabolism bell et al 2015 under varying moisture conditions several changes occurred in the rhizospheric environment previous literature indicated that when paddy field was subjected to drying processes the gaseous exchange between the atmosphere and soil was strengthened and adequate oxygen was consequently added to the rhizosphere miao et al 2015 this can greatly improve soil redox and promote the action of microorganisms and avoid the accumulation of poisonous substances in the rhizosphere mao 2002 contrarily flooding can lower the soil redox potential eh and increase the hydrous oxides of fe mn and al and this can increase metal adsorption li et al 2015 it is noteworthy that soil eh has been implicated not only as a ratio of oxidized to reduced forms that adopted to indirect changes of soil oxygen concentration but an important role in regulating root growth flowering development of floral organs leaf sectoring and photoperiodism xing et al 2006 rosso et al 2009 husson 2013 vo and kang 2013 all these suggest that rhizosphere environmental disturbances are one of the important factors affecting rice growth and its grain filling therefore we hypothesized that different irrigation regimes can produce severe modification in morphology and physiology traits of roots with significant impact on the above ground plant growth and development since a comprehensive assessment of the influence on rhizosphere ecosystem functioning was lacking we investigated the potential relation between rhizosphere ecological environment and the physiological status of rice plant under an alternate moderate wetting and soil drying regime amwd at grain filling stage the rhizosphere eco factors were mainly focused on soil ph redox potential eh electrical conductivity ec available nutrient enzymatic activities and bacterial communities structure the purpose of this study was to find out the changing pattern of rhizosphere eco factors and then provide a theoretical basis for high yielding cultivation and water management

alternate moderate wetting and drying irrigation amwd and continuous irrigation ci were conducted from 6 days after heading dah to maturity in amwd plants were not irrigated until the soil water potential had reached 25 2 kpa at 20 cm depth the ci regime was kept a shallow layer of water 2 3 cm depth until one week before harvest as recommended farming practices three granular matrix sensors gms watermark soil moisture sensor irrometer co riverside ca were installed in each plot in the amwd regime according to shock et al 2005 and readings were recorded at 10 00 a m and 4 00 p m daily when soil water potential reached the threshold a flood with 2 3 cm water depth was applied to the plots the amount of irrigation water was estimated by volumetric water meters and recorded immediately after water application a rain shelter consisting of a steel frame covered with a plastic sheet was used in each block to minimize the effect of rainfall precipitation on the treatments and was removed after the rain 2 3 soil physico chemical parameters and plant growth status six rice plants with similar developmental status were randomly selected and tagged for each plot as fixed point observation the soil ph redox potential eh and electrical conductivity ec at 5 cm distance and 10 cm depth around the base of chosen plants were measured daily between 9 00 11 00 in the morning from 5 to 35 dah a portable ph meter iq 150 spectrum technologies inc illinois usa orp depolarization automatic analyzer fja 6 chuan di inc nanjing china and wet sensor wet 2 delta t devices ltd burwell cambridge uk were used for soil ph eh and ec measurement in the field respectively meanwhile chlorophyll contents and photosynthetic parameters of the flag leaves were monitored at 5 day intervals after 5 dah chlorophyll contents were estimated by a portable chlorophyll meter spad 502 konica minolta inc osaka japan as formerly described by peng et al 1993 with 10 spad readings for each plot net photosynthesis pn instantaneous transpiration rate tr were determined by a li 6400 portable photosynthesis system li cor lincoln ne usa according to ren et al 2015 water use efficiency wue was calculated as the ratio of pn to tr pn tr 2 4 sampling and physiological measurements rhizosphere soil samples were obtained by removing three representative plants from each plot at every five days between 5 to 35 dah through shaking roots and collecting soil adhering to plant roots one subsample of the fresh soil was stored at 4 c and analyzed within 2 days after sampling for soil enzyme activities the remaining soils were air dried ground and filtered by 2 mm sieve then homogenized for analysis of available nutrients all soil parameter values were presented from oven dried soil simultaneously the rest of the roots were washed thoroughly with tap water and dry weights at 80 c to constant weight of shoots and roots were recorded bleeding rate has been widely used as an index of root activity and the measurements were carried out according to the method described by matsuo and mochizuki 2009 which was also measured at every five days during the treatment period in four hills per plot in both amwd and ci regime each plant was cut at an internode about 10 cm above the soil surface pre weighted cotton pads were placed on the cut end and this was covered by plastic film sealed with rubber bands at 6 00 p m the next morning at 8 00 a m the cotton pads were weighted to measure the bleeding rate nh4 n and no3 n contents were spectrophotometrically measured using indophenol blue photometric and phenol disulfonic acid respectively tan et al 2013 soil available p was analyzed by phosphomolybdate blue colorimetry nh4f hcl extraction while available k content in the soil was determined by flame photometry after extraction with 1 m ammonium acetate nh4oac solution buffered at ph 7 likewise soil urease invertase catalase phosphatase and polyphenol oxidase activities were assayed as described by guan et al 1986 and soil nitrate reductase was determined by the method described by alef and nannipieri 1995 2 5 final harvesting the spikelets on the first and second primary rachis branches counted from the top of the panicle were designated as superior and the base of secondary rachis branches of the lowest primary branch as inferior spikelets ishimaru et al 2003 yield components including spikelet number per panicle percentage of filled grains and 1000 grain weight of superior and inferior spikelets were derived from 6 plants with nearly the average number of panicles calculated from 50 plants were selected from both amwd and ci plants except border plants a 4 m2 area was harvested manually in each plot for estimating grain yield 2 6 analysis of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism t rflp data sampling was done from the rhizosphere soil of amwd regime prior to the start of experiment 5 dah when soil water was kept shallow and at the other three stages of early grain filling 10 dah when soil water potential was approximately at 5 kpa in drying phase while mid grain filling data was collected 18 dah when soil water potential was approximately at 25 kpa in drying phase and late grain filling 27 dah when plants were re watered the total dna was extracted from 0 5 g of soil samples using the biofast soil dna kit bioer technology co ltd zhejiang china according to the manufacturer s protocol the amounts of the extracted dna were detected using a biophotometer eppendorf hamburg germany and the quality and quantity of the dna was checked on a 1 0 agarose gel and then stored at 20 c until all samples were analyzed together 6 carboxyflurescein labeled primer 27f fam and 1492r were used to amplify the 16s rrna genes by pcr as reported previously wu et al 2015 purified 16s rrna fragments were digested with fastdigest alui haeiii mspi and rsai thermo scientific for 30 min at 37 c the length of terminal restriction fragments t rfs were determined by an automated abi 3730xl dna sequencer applied biosystems foster city usa restriction fragment analyses were conducted using genemarker version 1 2 softgenetics llc pa usa the relative abundance of a t rf was calculated by dividing the peak area of the t rf by the total peak area of all t rfs detected within a fragment length range between 35 and 700 bp wu et al 2015 affiliations of the fragments were determined via online t rflp analysis of ribosomal database project ii lin et al 2012 the total number of peaks pi 1 in a sample was used as the measured species richness s where pi is the proportion of an individual peak area relative to the sum of all peak areas the shannon wiener diversity index h and shannon evenness e were calculated as the following equation h pi log pi and e h log s respectively 2 7 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was performed using spss 19 0 and least significant difference lsd multiple comparison was used to determine significant differences between treatments α 0 05 origin software version 8 0 was used for drawing figures the data of soil available nutrient and enzymatic activities were averaged across two near sampling dates due to each cycle of the dry wet process roughly experienced 4 5 days 3 results 3 1 grain yield and the changes in the physiological status in plants table 1 shows that rice yield varied significantly between amwd and ci regimes the impact of panicles per m 2 and spikelets per panicle were not significant due to the irrigation treatments which started after heading however the average percentage of filled grains and 1 000 grain weight of inferior spikelets under amwd were remarkably increased by 11 1 and 17 0 respectively as compared with that in the ci condition and consequently causing grain yield increase by 9 2 12 3 subsequently we found that the pn of flag leaves slightly increased following re watering in amwd treatment but its tr decreased significantly which contributed to the average increase in instantaneous wue of 8 3 and the chlorophyll contents as estimated by spad was only lower at the late grain filling stage 30 35 dah than that in ci treatment supplementary fig s1 and s2 simultaneously it significantly enhanced the above ground dry biomass fig 2 and indicated a positive influence on root bleeding rate which revealed a physiological activity of roots fig 3 this ultimately maintained a higher root biomass and root shoot ratios in amwd compared with ci at mid and late grain filling stages 20 35 dah the results exhibited the same tendencies across the two experimental years 3 2 changes in soil ph eh and ec over the entire length of the treatments in 2013 the ci regime received 11 times with 204 7 mm of irrigation at 2 3 d interval whereas the amwd regime was irrigated 6 times with 145 8 mm apart from 7 d to reach soil water potential of 25 kpa for the first time most irrigation cycles only took 4 5 d fig s1 fig 4 a compared to the ci regime amwd regime could apparently save 28 8 irrigation water fig s3 in the ci regime ph and eh were relatively stable between 6 5 6 8 and 174 9 218 4 mv after a prolonged period of irrigation by contrast soil ph decreased significantly after imposing a loss of soil water saturation at 6 dah with a decrease being lowest when the soil water potential was 25 kpa in the amwd regime fig 4b moreover soil eh values increased and reached a peak of about 314 369 mv when the soil water potential reached 25 kpa fig 4c soil ph values increased and eh decreased with re watering at 13 18 22 26 30 and 33 dah but did not reach the previous levels obtained after the initial treatment in contrast soil ec was higher during the first two cycles of dry wet process and decreased later to about 14 2 in amwd over the same period of ci fig 4d 3 3 soil available nutrient contents as shown in fig 5 there were significant differences in the available nutrients of rice rhizosphere between amwd and ci regimes in general the content of nh4 n in the amwd regime demonstrated a declining trend with time and the average fell to 0 73 mg kg 1 in 20 35 dah 37 3 lower than that in the ci regime fig 5a furthermore there was a significantly higher content of no3 n in amwd regime relative to ci regime at 10 15 dah first re rewetting period consequently there was a sharp increase thereafter reaching a maximum at 20 25 dah and then declined slightly fig 5b very similarly to no3 n available k reached a peak concentration at 15 25 dah in awd regime the mean concentration increased by 50 5 when compared with that in the ci regime fig 5d in amwd regime the content of available p revealed no superiority effect relative to the ci regime at earlier measurement times but it was reversed by the concomitant cycle times increasing with re watering which was about twice as much as that in the ci regime measured at 30 35 dah fig 5c 3 4 soil enzymatic activities the activities of rice rhizospheric soil enzymes exhibited marked differences between the two irrigation regimes fig 6 over the entire study period except for 5 10 dah soil invertase urease and phosphatase activities were significantly higher in the amwd regime than in the ci regime fig 6b d in contrast soil polyphenol oxidase and nitrate reductase activities were lower in amwd regime than in ci regime at earlier measurement times but they were reversed at later measurement times indicating that these two soil enzymatic activities were more sensitive to the cycle times of re watering fig 6a e moreover catalase activity fluctuations in the ci regime contributed substantially to the mean values which was much lower than in the amwd regime within 10 30 dah 3 5 soil microbe analysis by t rflp the diversity variations of bacterial communities based on the t rflp results are presented in table 2 statistically significant differences of the diversity index of bacterial communities were detected among the different time periods of amwd regime compared to the 5 dah the soil samples of 10 dah revealed a significantly greater species richness of 18 and 12 t rfs generated respectively by haeⅲ and mspⅰ in response to drainage a similar tendency of variation was observed in the soil samples of 18 dah interestingly the abundance of t rfs obtained by aluⅰ haeⅲ rsaⅰindicated no significant difference as a result of the 27 dah as compared to that of the 5 dah however the evenness index values estimated from the rsaⅰ digested t rflp data at 27 dah and 18 dah showed a reverse trend significantly higher equitability than that at 5 dah for the soil samples of 10 dah the values of evenness derived from haeⅲ mspⅰand rsaⅰ substantially declined as compared to the data at treatment initiation 5 dah table 2 meanwhile shannon wiener index obtained from four restriction enzymes showed that soil samples of both 18 dah and 27 dah were more diverse than that of 5 dah by the amwd process after several cycle times of re watering whereas it declined in the soil samples of 10 dah when amwd treatment started at the early grain filling stage for the 16s rdna t rflp profiles which were derived from aluⅰ haeⅲ mspⅰ and rsaⅰ digestions the number of t rfs in comparison with the ribosomal database project ii identified 73 255 110 and 100 types of bacteria in the soil samples of 5 dah 10 dah 18 dah and 27 dah respectively all microbes were categorized into 15 phyla 163 genera and 642 species as shown in fig 7 a at the phylum level the proportions of t rfs that affiliated to actinobacteria and bacteroidetes were notably altered by the amwd process at either soil drying or the re watering time whereas tenericutes 5 57 was the most dominant in the soil samples of 5 dah furthermore classification at the genus level revealed that the predominant t rfs were affiliated to kitasatospora 8 21 and clostridium 8 96 in the 5 dah samples while rhodococcus 5 56 and paenibacillus 3 33 were present in the 27 dah it was further noted that the dominant taxa of novosphingobium 3 77 and brevibacillus 7 80 were detected in the soil samples of 18 dah and 10 dah respectively fig 7b the relative abundance of rhizospheric soil bacteria exhibited that amwd regime produced a significant increase values of t rfs including aluⅰ 234 and 236 bp mspⅰ 122 and 128 bp and rsaⅰ 476 bp in the rhizosphere at either the soil drying or the re watering time however there was a reduction in haeⅲ 199 bp mspⅰ 88 and 140 bp table 3 than the soil samples of 5 dah assignation from pat has identified the fragments mostly to be from the phylum firmicutes proteobacteria and actinobacteria toward an ecological function classification of the dominant bacteria the proportion of aerobic bacteria related to the recycling of soil nutrients increased dramatically in the soil samples during drying phase especially the soil water potential reached 25 kpa we further observed that azotobacter azospirillum brasilense str beijerinckia indica subsp frankia sp str herbaspirillum nitrifying bacteria nitrosospira phosporus solubilizing or potassium solubilizing bacteria bacillus edaphicus str agrobacterium vitis str were abundant under amwd regime while anaerobic or facultative anaerobic denitrifying bacteria neisseria denitrificans and sulfate reducing bacteria desulfobulbus desulfovibrio senezii showed much lower abundance in the recycling regime amwd than in the initial treatment at 5 dah table 3 4 discussion in the present study we found that amwd regime helped save 28 8 irrigation water and increased yield significantly by 9 2 12 3 when compared with ci regime this increment was mainly due to the increased percentage of filled grains and grain weight of inferior grain fig s3 table 1 which was consistent with the results of zhang et al 2010 the essence of grain filling is the process of translocation and accumulation of photosynthates from source to sink it has been reported that more than 60 of grain filling substance in rice comes from photosynthate after heading zhang et al 2009b from supplementary fig s1 it was evident that the photosynthetic rate in flag leaves showed no significant difference between the two irrigation regimes at soil drying time but when water was applied it was slightly higher in amwd than that in ci regime also because of this with significant decreases of transpiration rate improving instantaneous wue of leaf was observed in amwd than that in ci fig s1 besides there was no difference in chlorophyll content up to 30 dah in both irrigation treatments fig s2 the chlorophyll contents spad value of the flag leaves showed a high degree of correlation with leaf photosynthetic function duration wei et al 2016 these findings implied that a moderate soil drying didn t negatively affect the photosynthetic productivity during grain filling stage this conclusion was further supported by the enhancement of shoot and root biomass accumulation in amwd when compared with ci fig 2 in addition an improved root activity root bleeding rate and root shoot ratio were observed in amwd regime figs 2 and 3 which was essential for maintaining root absorption ability and reduce water loss through transpiration zhang et al 2017 it is therefore reasonable for us to infer that the stimulation of root growth by moderate dry wet cycles could be partly owing to the changes in rhizosphere ecological environment based on our observations a proposed model for underlying mechanism of rice rhizosphere in response to amwd treatment is presented in fig 8 and discussed below here we performed an analysis in situ at the base of rice plant and observed that soil eh fluctuated from about 230 mv to about 370 mv in the amwd but remained constant at about 200 mv while continuously flooded fig 4c there is an assumption that an arbitrary limit of 300 mv eh exists between oxidized and reduced soils tokarz and urban 2015 the results presented here as well as the results of liu et al 2012 indicate that decreased water content can induce variations from reductive to oxidative status this implies that a higher redox potential can result in the precipitation of mn and fe oxides kogel knabner et al 2010 and thus reactions that release protons and decrease the ph fig 4b accordingly an increase in hydrogen ion concentration can have a competitive advantage at the surface adsorption sites relative to the nh4 k ca2 and mg2 thus leading to a large proportion of base cations being released into the rhizosphere tomlinson 1983 which indirectly enhanced soil nutrient availability similar observations have also been recorded by husson 2013 who indicated that eh and ph changes could indirectly increase p availability in soil through affecting the solubility of metal cations which fix p specifically mn al fe oxides and hydroxides in this study the concentrations of both no3 n and available k decreased simultaneously with ec in amwd regime at later measurement times 20 35 dah figs 4 and 5 this could be possibly due to better nutrient uptake by rice root and lowered ec rui and wienhold 2002 as evidenced by the higher dry matter accumulation and root bleeding rate in amwd than in ci treatment figs 2 and 3 the results of t rflp in this study indicated that the diversity index of bacterial community was enhanced when water status of soils changed from flooding to drought while the evenness index declined table 2 paddy soil being an anthropogenic soil has been drained several times during the whole rice growth period which resulted in sharp variations of microbial community structure noll et al 2005 furthermore moderate drying can improve the diversity of bacterial community structure in soil rhizosphere while the opposite is true for excessive drying and wetting peralta et al 2014 this research found that soil drying phase of the amwd cycle indeed promoted the growth of aerobic bacteria including mycobacterium sp frankia sp β proteobacteria brevibacillus brevis and bacillus edaphicus but reduced the anaerobic bacterial growth such as desulfovibrio and anaerobranca table 2 however other studies have shown that a vast amount of anaerobic bacteria prefers to reside in continuous flooding condition rather than in amwd condition on the other hand in another study aerobic bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi were higher in amwd condition unger et al 2009 during the amwd process there was a cyclical variation in soil ph and eh in a way that a decline in soil moisture content led to a decrease in ph value but increased eh fig 4 soil ph and eh had been reported as important factors affecting the diversity of soil microbial community husson 2013 soil oxidation and reduction were the main means for microbes to obtain energy thus each type of microorganism is adapted to specific ph and eh conditions and is characterized by its ability to develop within a wider or a narrower range aerobic bacteria such as actinomyces sp or azotobacter sp multiply rapidly at high eh values while the anaerobic bacteria performed better at a lower eh value condition rabotnova and schwartz 1962 previous study has indicated that soil ph impacts on the enzymatic activity of microbial cell as well as reduce the ability of soil microbial community to utilize organic compounds dues to electrolysis and amendments cang et al 2007 our findings assumed that aerobic bacteria released co2 during the process of respiration and resulted in the reduction of soil ph value however with the submerged treatment the activity of anaerobic bacteria was dominant thereby depleting soil organic matter and oxyanions such as no3 no2 and so4 2 which led to a sharp decline in eh values hinsinger et al 2003 these findings suggested that there was a significant interaction among the soil ph eh and microbial activities soil enzymes as biochemical catalysts of specific reactions play an important role in maintaining soil ecology however we observed changes in different enzyme activities with varying soil water conditions the work of waldrop and firestone 2004 has shown that increasing soil water content reduced the activities of phenol oxidase and peroxidase but the effect was not significant for other enzyme activities in our study the soil enzymatic activities of invertase urease and phosphatase activities increased under conditions of amwd regime fig 6b d which was consistent with earlier findings yang et al 2005 it has been reported that anaerobic conditions inhibited soil enzymatic activities by mobilizing some metal ions notably fe2 while a mild water deficit increased oxygen availability and the removal of inhibitory metal ions could activate the enzyme activities pulford and tabatabai 1988 kang and freeman 1999 in addition we found that the soil polyphenoloxidase and nitrate reductase activities revealed more sensitivity to the cycle times of re watering in amwd soil than in ci soil fig 6a e it is possible that activity changes for different enzymes were closely associated with the dramatic change in soil ph and eh this is supported by mclatchey and reddy 1998 who clarified that phenol oxidase activity could only be detected under aerobic conditions and acidic conditions of aerobic soils induce a negative effectiveness because of the ph out of its optimal range likewise kang and freeman 1999 noted that hydrogen ion concentration could modify the enzyme reaction site but also the stability of immobilized enzymes in the soil matrix moreover soil ph can indirectly impact soil enzyme activity via changing to the activities of microorganisms and the composition of microbial community which also affects soil enzyme production and diversity wittmann et al 2004 weintraub et al 2007 the amwd process improved the proportion of aerobic bacteria such as azotobacter nitrifying bacteria phosphorus solubilizing and potassium solubilizing bacteria which participate in the nutrient cycling furthermore an increase in enzyme activity promoted the release of nutrients and thereby enhanced the amount of nitrate nitrogen available phosphorus and potassium in soils simultaneously amwd treatment also enhanced soil oxygen content and improved the respiration activity and absorption capacity of the root fig 3 this subsequently triggered root growth systematic senescence remobilization of reserves from sheath stem to grain pools li et al 2016 and thus increased number of filled grains and grain weight of inferior spikelets table 1 however the detailed information about the interaction between the rhizospheric microbial communities with rice roots and their environments mediated by root exudates have not been reported under amwd regime therefore these factors need further investigation 5 conclusion the present results demonstrate that amwd is the best irrigation regime which saves water and yet increases yield relative to ci at grain filling stage furthermore amwd regime periodically changed the soil ph and eh in turn improved a proportion of aerobic bacteria consequently increased the nutrition in rhizosphere soil and enhanced the enzyme activities during grain filling relative to ci regime consequently the cycling and transfer of nutrients in soil were accelerated which replenished the available nutrients in rhizosphere soil at the later stage of rice in addition adequate oxygen improved the respiration activity and absorption capacity of rice root therefore the amwd treatment had a great promise to improve physiological activity by preventing rapid senescence of rice during the grain filling phase and accelerated nutrient remobilization into rice grain and hence increased yield acknowledgements
