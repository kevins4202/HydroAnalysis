3055,reservoir operation may impact algal blooms by altering flow conditions but relevant studies and a theoretical understanding of this subject are limited in this study two phytoplankton bloom events with different spatial coverage patterns in a reservoir were investigated by examining environmental variables a suitable nutrient content and water temperature were considered responsible for bloom initiation during both events but the different water level operations could possibly explain the observed spatial difference a two dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model was then used to simulate the mixing processes within the reservoir during these two bloom events the simulation results indicated that the rising water level during the bloom event with a larger coverage area caused closed circulation flow conditions above the intrusion layer displacing surface water in front of the dam upstream until reaching inflowing river water which then intruded to support water offtake and water level lifting operations while the other event did not exhibit a similar flow pattern the water age was sensitive to water level operation which suggested that phytoplankton dispersal could be promoted by rising water level processes inflow densimetric froude number analysis indicated that reservoir impoundment facilitated a conversion of the inflow kinetic energy into potential energy thus promoting algal dispersal via circulation this study provides insights into the impact of reservoir operation on phytoplankton communities offering a reference for operational design to mitigate algal blooms in reservoirs keywords algal bloom reservoir operation water level mixing inflow intrusion water age data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phytoplankton bloom events in freshwater systems such as lakes and reservoirs have drawn public attention because of their direct impacts on water resource safety mechanisms influencing the initiation and development of algal blooms are diverse and involve interactions of various processes the nutrient status has been widely examined regarding its impact on algal blooms within the broad context of eutrophication in lake systems to guide watershed load management while other factors such as light and temperature have also been extensively studied to reveal their individual or coupled impact mechanisms on bloom development and it has been reported that these factors can directly determine algal physiology processes such as photosynthesis guildford and hecky 2000 karlsson et al 2009 strzepek et al 2019 in addition hydrodynamic conditions has been recognized for their critical role in the development and maintenance of blooms lehman 2014 deng et al 2016 feng et al 2018 as it is the physical background that determines how dissolved materials and suspended particles such as algae are transported at spatial or temporal scales kalinin et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 mao and xia 2020 for example serra et al 2007 suggested that the distribution of phytoplankton populations in surface water was determined by combination of vertical convection and internal waves cyr et al 2012 2017 reported that wind driven processes in a stratified lake could lead to predictable differences in the spatial accumulation patterns of phytoplankton notably phytoplankton could suitably follow water mixing dynamics and be retained suggesting that algal blooms could potentially be prevented by regulating the mixing process which could feasibly be accomplished in systems such as artificial reservoirs and insight into the relationship between mixing processes and artificial operation is crucial in natural lakes mixing processes are commonly dominated by their stratification features and hydrological meteorological events artificial reservoirs show many differences because of the involvement of human operations which together with natural inflow variability cause high water level fluctuations and relevant hydrodynamic features inside the reservoir jørgensen et al 2005 hayes et al 2017 li et al 2020 duka et al 2021 certain researchers have used theories from physical limnology or fluid mechanics to interpret the specific flow patterns within reservoirs along with water level alterations bocaniov et al 2014 xie et al 2017 yang et al 2020 moreover water level fluctuations in reservoirs have been noted for their association with significant ecological outcomes carmignani and roy 2017 harrison et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 found that water mass mixing between a reservoir and its tributary resulting from water level manipulation caused the redistribution of nutrients guo et al 2021 also reported that the density currents due to water level operation would reduce nitrous oxide emissions in the bay of a reservoir furthermore a study by bordet et al 2017 revealed that water level scheduling is one of the most important factors affecting the vertical distribution of algae in a reservoir these previous studies provided different interpretations of the physical and ecological effects of water level changes the fluctuation amplitude of reservoirs can vary by up to tens of meters within a year and such a strong boundary force can obviously impact the water within them from the perspective of their physical limnological features reservoirs are usually considered similar to natural lakes but the unique pathway by which artificial water level operation influences the hydrodynamic conditions has rarely been discussed specifically and how it interacts with other ecological processes inside reservoirs still warrants further examination as reservoirs are an unignorable freshwater system and are growing rapidly in number zarfl et al 2014 the artificially controlled properties of reservoirs have gained increasing attention in regard to their use in alleviating the adverse ecological effects caused by reservoirs such as downstream river water temperature recovery weber et al 2017 hypolimnion dissolved oxygen supplementation carr et al 2020 and fish habitat protection li et al 2020 if algal control can be achieved through the implementation of reservoir operation strategies operating and environmental costs are expected to be saved there have been some attempts to schedule water level operations to control algal bloom problems in reservoirs ji et al 2017 jin et al 2019 however apart from theoretical analysis and simulation predictions rigosi and rueda 2012 xu et al 2019 only a few actual operation trials have been conducted to date chuo et al 2019 reported a case in the three gorges reservoir and proved that the chlorophyll a concentration in a tributary bay would respond significantly to water level manipulation which was related to the density current formation and stratification intensity in the bay these previous studies have illustrated that there is a potential to achieve algal bloom control in reservoirs by creating certain hydrodynamic conditions during reservoir water level operation although the information available for reference is scarce and more cases are needed to further interpret the underlying mechanism in this study two phytoplankton bloom events in a reservoir were investigated to identify the major factor inducing a notable difference in spatial coverage scale through the examination of field data it was determined that variables including the nutrient status and temperature were unrelated to the bloom coverage scale but the water level operation scheme exhibited a possible causality information extracted from hydrodynamic simulations was then used to validate the above hypotheses and explain the mixing characteristics that promoting algal coverage differences between these two events we further aimed to provide new insights into the mechanism by which anthropogenic physical processes in artificial reservoirs could cause ecological effects which could facilitate the development of algal bloom control strategies for similar reservoirs 2 study site and methods 2 1 study site the zipingpu reservoir zpp is located on the min river which is a major branch of the yangtze river and in the southwestern mountainous area of china fig 1 this reservoir 31 02 n 103 33 e is in the transition area from an alpine climate zone to a subtropical monsoon climate zone the zpp was designed mainly for irrigation and water supply and has the facility to achieve flood control and generate electric power dinoflagellate blooms have been observed in this reservoir every year since 2013 the height of the dam is 156 m the elevation of the dam top is 884 m a s l and the entrance bottom elevation of the outtake is 800 m a s l the water level of the zpp can fluctuate from an elevation of 817 m a s l to 877 m a s l according to the operation scheme while the allowed highest water level can be 883 1 m a s l under extreme flood conditions the length and water area can reach 24 km and 18 16 km2 respectively at a water level of 877 m and the total volume of the reservoir would be 9 8 108 m3 under the same conditions the annual mean volume of natural runoff of the river at the dam site is 148 108 m3 which means that the water in the reservoir could theoretically be replaced more than 10 times within one year but this depends on how the inflow water is mixed inside the reservoir 2 2 field work and data collection a water quality monitoring project was conducted in the zpp from april 2015 to march 2017 and surface water sample collection and field measurement were performed every month at fixed sites eight sites g1 g8 were arranged along the original river channel and an extra site lc was added since it was located in the tributary where algal blooms appeared every year fig 1 the location information of each monitoring site is shown in appendix table s1 the water samples for chlorophyll a analysis were fixed on site with 1 mgco3 and samples for algae species identification were stabilized on site with lugol s iodine solution 1 5 v v the samples for analysis of total phosphorus and total nitrogen were acidified on site using sulfuric acid until the ph value was less than 2 after collection these samples were stored at approximately 4 in a cooler and immediately sent to the laboratory for analysis of chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations all sample analyses were completed within 48 h algal species were classified according to hu and wei 2006 using an inverted microscope dp2 twain olympus the chlorophyll concentration was measured according to the acetone extraction spectrophotometric method arar 1997 total nitrogen tn was determined with the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method and total phosphorus tp was measured using the ammonium molybdate method wei et al 2002 all samples were tested in triplicate and the mean value was then calculated data measured on site include water temperature and dissolved oxygen surface temperature ts and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a 6600 v2 multiprobe meter ysi inc usa vertical temperature profile data were also collected during field work in the reservoir usually at sites g7 g5 and g3 and an exo2 multiparameter profiler ysi inc usa was used time series of water temperature were recorded every hour at two sites using zdr self recording equipment hangzhou zeda instrument co ltd china the temperature at site g1 was recorded to represent the inflow river temperature tin and that at site g8 was recorded to represent the outflow temperature tout remote sensing retrieval was used to directly show the spatial distribution of the two bloom events one multispectral satellite image was collected during each bloom event specific image collection information and a description of the processing methods for the satellite images can be found in appendix part 3 after being verified by in situ chl a data the spectral band reflectivity combination b4 b3 was chosen as the predictor for the algal spatial distribution in addition daily meteorological data from dujiangyan station a state station located 8 km away from the dam were downloaded from the china meteorological data network data cma cn including air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction precipitation and solar radiation data daily reservoir operation data including daily inflow outflow and water level were provided by the reservoir operator 2 3 numerical modeling 2 3 1 model setup ce qual w2 a laterally averaged two dimensional hydrodynamic model cole and wells 2015 was used in this study to simulate the hydrodynamic processes in the zpp the basic theoretical introduction and governing equations of the model are provided in appendix table s2 the simulation ran from may 1 2015 to september 30 2016 the initial temperature conditions were given according to the vertical profile data collected in the field daily mean discharge of both inflow and outflow were input as boundary conditions and the collected inflow temperature was interpreted on a daily basis before it was input meteorological data were also input to drive the surface heat budget calculations the simulation period was shorter than the field observation period due to some boundary data loss after september 2016 but it was long enough to cover the algal bloom periods in both years all boundary conditions inputted to drive the model are listed in appendix table s3 2 3 2 model validation li et al 2011 calibrated the model for the zpp during their previous research to assess the impact of the reservoir operation on the discharge water temperature they used field data from 2009 to 2010 for parameter calibration and sensitivity analysis and the calibration results are shown in appendix table s4 in this study to verify the validation of their calibrated parameters the collected field data during the study period 2015 2016 were used to evaluate the model performance the water level operation process during the simulation period as well as the collected vertical temperature profile and discharge temperature data were used for model result verification the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse were calculated to evaluate the model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was also used to assess the modeling performance on the time series of simulated variables 1 mae 1 n i 1 n x i o x i m 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i o x i m 2 3 nse 1 i 1 n x i o x i m 2 i 1 n x i o x o 2 where n is the number of samples xo i is the observed value of sample i xm i is the modeled value of sample i and xo is the mean observed value as shown in fig 2 a the simulated water level results agreed well with the real water level dynamics throughout the simulation period with an nse value of 0 998 and mae and rmse values of only 0 61 and 0 76 m respectively suggesting that the water mass balance was calculated properly in this simulation study fig 2 b compares the simulated discharge temperature to the measured data the mae and rmse were 0 61 and 0 81 respectively which were relatively satisfactory considering that the mean measured value for the simulation period was 13 9 and the nse value was 0 95 which showed that the model could properly simulate the outflow temperature processes fig 3 shows the comparison between the simulated results and measured data for the vertical water temperature structure on three different profiling dates at sites near the dam 1 km g7 and 4 km g6 there was a thermocline at the surface of the water column and a quasi mixed layer with a much smaller temperature gradient beneath it from summer to early autumn jun 15 and sep 22 2015 while there was another thermocline in spring apr 20 2016 under the height where the reservoir outtake was located the model simulated this dynamic process quite satisfactorily with mae and rmse values all smaller than 1 at these two sites on the three dates however the simulation underestimated the vertical heat transportation to the bottom water due to the hydrostatic pressure assumption used in the model and a bottom mixed layer could thus be observed in the simulation results where the temperature was approximately 2 lower than that in the measured data for the sites farther away from the dam 8 km g3 and 16 km a nonfixed profile site the modeling results also agreed with the measured data quite well although an obvious error of approximately 4 c appeared in the surface simulation results for june 15 2015 the mae and rmse on the first date were 1 21 and 1 56 respectively while the values for the other dates were 0 30 and 0 31 for sep 22 2015 and 0 59 and 0 65 for apr 20 2016 respectively an unsatisfactory result might have occurred because the area is closely located to the upstream inflow and inaccurate input boundary data might notably impact the simulation results for this area the verification results indicated that the model used herein was able to correctly simulate the mass balance and water temperature structure in the reservoir during the simulation period although an error occurred in the simulated water temperature of the bottom layer the upper layer simulation results suitably agreed with the field data and that is the area where we primarily focused on our subsequent discussion the hydrodynamic conditions were not verified directly by the field velocity data but the water temperature simulation results showed that the mixing process and heat budget were properly calculated in general in reservoir systems stratified layers generate buoyancy to inhibit vertical mixing upstream of the dam fischer et al 1979 the relationship between the buoyancy caused by the stratification and the vertical mixing caused by the discharge determined the interflow position anohin et al 2006 due to the stratified temperature structure outflow water was derived from multilayers upstream of the dam and flow field formed with a jet like velocity distribution near the water offtake he et al 2018 thus the outflow water feature revealed the flow characteristics inside the reservoir and the accuracy of the flow field distribution in the reservoir was also indirectly proved through the satisfactory performance of the outflow water temperature simulation 2 3 3 metric analysis to illustrate the horizontal mixing characteristics the transport of momentum by advection tma and transport of momentum by diffusion tma in horizontal direction were extracted from the two dimensional modeling results as follows cole and wells 2015 4 tma b h δ u 2 δ x 5 tmd a z b h δ u δ x 2 where b is the cell width h is the average cell layer thicnkness u is the horizontal velocity δx is the segment spacing and az is the vertical eddy viscosity both tma and tmd were expressed in m3 s2 to evaluate local water residence features the water age was simulated in the model as the concentration of a tracer following a zero order decay dynamic cole and wells 2015 during simulation the inflow boundary condition for water age was always set to 0 to represent the zero residence time of the inflow water by setting the zero order decay rate to 1 day 1 the water age increases by 1 per day when no mixing occurs the source term in the transportation equation for water age is defined as follows 6 s water a g e k k 1 day 1 the inflow densimetric froude number f0 a dimensionless parameter was used in this study to compare the inertial force of inflow to buoyancy inside the reservoir f0 can be calculated as follows fang and stefan 2000 7 f 0 u 0 g h 0 where u0 is the inflow velocity h0 is the depth of the inflow cross section and g is the reduced acceleration of gravity which can be calculated as follows 8 g g ρ 0 ρ a ρ a where g is the acceleration of gravity ρ 0 is the inflow water density and ρ a is the density of ambient water in the reservoir 2 4 statistical analysis an independent t test was used to identify the significance difference between collected field data from different years the two sample kolmogorov smirnov tests k s tests was used to compare the difference between time series the spearman correlation test was used to measure the association between two variables for all statistical analyses a p value of 0 05 was considered significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 algal bloom investigation the bloom event in 2015 was first reported in late may by a reservoir operator claiming that the color of surface water turned brown red and the area covered by algae extended from near the dam area to approximately 10 km upstream however the 2016 bloom event was noticed in late june and mostly occurred in a small tributary approximately 4 km upstream from the dam this difference could also be observed according to the remote sensing results for chlorophyll a as shown in fig 4 a and the color of the water where the algae accumulated turned red brown fig 4 b by preliminary morphospecies identification the dominant species in both bloom events was identified as peridiniopsis penardii a species from the dinoflagellate genus peridiniopsis fig 4 c and the algal cell density in the bloom area was 107 individuals l 3 2 environmental variable examination the environmental variables characterizing the physical status and nutrient content of the water body during the algal blooms each year are shown in fig 5 and the statistical analysis results are shown in table 1 in regard to the nutrient content no significant difference between these two events was observed in terms of content level or spatial pattern while both the tp and tn contents at all sites exceeded the critical value for algal bloom initiation namely 0 02 mg l for phosphorus and 0 5 mg l for nitrogen camargo and alonso 2006 tang et al 2018 similarly the surface water temperature ts exhibted no significant difference between these two events with a temperature of approximately 21 which matches the optimum temperature range for most dinoflagellates singh and singh 2015 the relatively high nutrient level and suitable temperature could be responsible for the onset of algal blooms in both years the significantly higher do in the 2015 bloom could be explained by the higher productivity from the algae community covering a larger area smith and piedrahita 1988 however the observed significant difference in algal bloom spatial pattern could still not be explained by the nutrient content and surface temperature however the water level variation was significantly different between the two events fig 5 b and table 1 water impoundment occurred during the algal bloom in 2015 with the water level increasing by approximately 25 m while the water level fluctuated slightly below 840 m and exhibited a slight decreasing trend during the same period in 2016 fig 5 c also shows that the inflow temperature was always lower water level variation is determined by the reservoir inflow and outflow discharge scheme which have been reported due to their impact on mixing processes in deep reservoirs he et al 2022 in addition the inflow was always cooler than the resident water within in reservoir as shown in fig 5 c indicating that the river inflow could intrude into the water body according to the simulation results of the vertical temperature structure in the reservoir form may 2015 to august 2016 fig 6 intrusion could be observed in may and june of each year and the river inflow intruded into the reservoir approximately 8 km away from the dam where vertical stratification initially emerged under this interflow pattern background the different water level changes could result in the intruded inflow generate distinct mixing features within the water body 3 3 identifying differences in mixing patterns between blooming events to further identify the potential impact of mixing processes on the spatial pattern of algal blooms the flow pattern information was extracted from the simulation results as shown in fig 7 the flow pattern showed a novel difference between the two years accompanying the water level increase in 2015 the streamline formed a closed circle above the offtake height with varying thickness during this blooming period extending from the dam to approximately 8 10 km upstream where it met the inflow while the flow streamlines all moved toward the water offtake during the event in the next year fig 8 shows the detailed flow field characteristics during the 2015 bloom event an upwelling in front of the dam was formed due to the rising water level pushing the original surface water flow back toward the dam until it was stopped by the intruded inflow thus creating a backflow pattern in the surface layer the inflow intruded downward to a deeper layer because its temperature was lower than the returning surface water moving directly toward the water offtake which kept the whole upper layer of water trapped above it in contrast the water above the reservoir outtake was sucked into it together with the intrusion flow when the water level remained essentially the same in 2016 leading to the absence of the same flow pattern as in the previous year the ambient water and intruding inflow jointly supplied the water discharged during the water offtake operation between these two events flow along the horizonal direction was sensitive to contrasting water level operations thus we compared the horizontal momentum transport process in surface water as shown in fig 9 and a significant difference in the mixing intensity was observed notable horizontal mixing was driven by the backflow pattern during the 2015 event while a weak mixing process was suggested by the almost zero momentum transport during the bloom event in the following year in addition mixing in both years was dominated by advection since the momentum advection degree was much higher than the momentum diffusion degree serra et al 2007 revealed that surface currents in a reservoir are responsible for phytoplankton transportation across the basin similarly the flow along the river channel direction in the 2015 case could also promote spatial transportation of the algal community to a larger area but in cases similar to 2016 event the absence of physical mixing could weaken horizontal algae transportation and the resulting blooms therefore did not spread to a larger area after they first occurred in the reservoir moreover surface water dilution due to discharge could wash algal populations from the reservoir further inhibiting bloom development in addition water residence feature is important for algae growth since it decides how much time is available for algal growth and reproduction thus offering another perspective to investigate the effect of mixing processes on algae to further explore the surface water residence feature under different water level operations the water age variation was extracted for the surface water at 1 km in front of the dam and the results also showed a consistent response fig 10 a a continuous increase in water age could be observed during late may and early june in 2015 while the water age exhibited a declining trend with fluctuations during the blooming period in 2016 an increase in water age indicates that the water had not been fully replaced or washed out after it entered the local area and the water age was almost always greater than 10 days during the 2015 blooming period based on day 0 on may 1 this result demonstrates that the water was trapped in its local area for a relatively long time as the water level continued to rise although it might have been diluted occasionally by the new inflowing young water as the growth rate was occasionally lower than 1 per day the water age has been shown to possibly indicate the spatial pattern of the phytoplankton distribution because this parameter is related to nutrient depletion and phytoplankton population growth li et al 2011 stumpner et al 2020 gao et al 2018 found a significant positive correlation between surface chlorophyll a and water age in a bay in the three gorges reservoir and similar results were also observed in a large shallow lake in china where the spatial pattern of water age highly matched the spatial distribution of chlorophyll a qi et al 2016 thus the simulation results of water age can provide us with information on how suspended particles such as algae were transported and expanded their populations within the reservoir during the two bloom events as shown in fig 10 b water age showed a significant positive correlation r 0 882 p less than 0 05 with the water level during the 2015 events when the reservoir was impounded indicating that the rising water level enhanced water residence and promoted algal spreading the nonsignificant correlation observed in the 2016 event also suggests that the flow toward reservoir outtakes as shown in fig 7 due to stable water levels with a slight decreasing trend could not support the spatial spreading of algae inside the reservoir 3 4 how water level operation drives the mixing processes from may to june each year as the watershed enters its wet season the upstream inflow into the zpp is sufficient carrying a large amount of kinetic energy into the reservoir during this time the reservoir also forms a relatively stable stratification structure and the buoyancy inside the reservoir thus represents the major resistance to the inertial force of inflow this confrontation was parameterized using the inflow densimetric froude number which estimates the initial dilution of the density inflow upon entering the reservoir by comparing the inertial force of the current to the buoyancy of the ambient stratified water cortés et al 2014 roberts et al 2018 when f0 1 the two forces are approximately equal when f0 1 inertial forces dominate and when f0 1 buoyancy dominates as shown in fig 11 for 2015 except for a sharp decrease on may 30 f0 exhibited a continuous increasing trend after the bloom occurred in late may and then reached a peak f0 20 1 in early june indicating that the inertial force of the inflow continuously strengthened in comparison to the resistance of the reservoir during the development of the algal bloom this could be explained by the rising water level during the same period since the inflow was larger than the outflow the extra kinetic energy inertial force of the inflow was transferred to potential energy buoyancy in the water column as it was lifting the water level in contrast after the occurrence of the bloom in late june 2016 f0 increased slightly from 5 7 to 10 8 but was followed by a sharp decrease to the lowest value of 1 5 on july 3 when the bloom dissipated the unchanged water level during this period indicated that the amount of outflow discharge was essentially the same as that of the inflow and thus the inertial force of the inflow was weakened by increasing entrainment and dilution from the ambient stratified water in the reservoir fig 12 further summarizes the flow regime during the 2015 bloom event the stratification structure of the reservoir and the temperature difference between the inflow and the reservoir surface water together determined that the inflow would plunge down to a specific depth as it intruded toward the dam during this process the inflow water near the upper boundary of the intrusion was mixed with the warmer water above it making it lighter and increasing its buoyancy furthermore when the water level of the reservoir steadily rose the inflow was larger than the discharge volume through the water offtake therefore the heated buoyant water gradually became entrained into the upper layers when it flowed toward the dam while the remaining heavier water was sufficient to supply the water offtake thereby supporting the increasing water level and forming a trapped water area in the reservoir surface layers after an algal bloom initially occurred in some limited space it extended to a larger area as the horizontal flow pattern continued in this trapped water area in addition to physically promoting the dispersal of the algal community within the trapping area the entrainment and mixing at the top of the intrusion current during the rising water level operation period could also facilitate the transport of nutrients from the river inflow to the reservoir surface where light and temperature are more suitable for algal growth rueda et al 2007 and cortés et al 2014 demonstrated that a significant part of the density inflow could be entrained into the surface layers in a reservoir resulting in river nutrients being loaded into the euphotic zone this type of entrainment is mainly affected by kelvin helmholtz instabilities and turbulence at the interface between the density current and ambient water he et al 2017 in this study the stratified reservoir was experiencing a rising water level when the algal bloom occurred in 2015 and the growing incoming kinetic energy from the inflow as shown in the inflow densimetric froude number results in fig 10 could help to intensify the instabilities along the layer boundary consequently enhancing the entrainment into the upper layers although this process was not directly assessed in this study because it was unexpected the potential effect of this mixing pattern on the water quality and aquatic environment of lakes and reservoirs deserves further study particularly the quantitative estimation of these fluxes 3 5 potential implications of water level operation for algal control to assess the impact of water level manipulation on water mixing features we set up a simulation where the water level remained unchanged during the 2015 bloom season the water age variation between the same spot in this simulation and in the field is shown in fig 13 compared to the actual observation a clear difference in the water age trend appeared in the simulation especially after may 20 when the water level started to rise in reality the water age in the simulation scenario gradually declined more than it did in the field by june 10 the water age under the simulation was about 4 5 days younger than that in reality and by the end of june the water age decreased to no more than 5 days old in the simulation while it was nearly 30 days old in reality while the rising water level trapped the surface water and promoted algal expansion in reality the simulation results suggested that by increasing the water release from the reservoir the dilution and replacement of surface water would be enhanced and these residence features could lead to the inhibition of algal dispersal processes in a reservoir manipulation of the water level scheme is the major operation strategy and the water level is usually determined according to the water supply flood control and power generation demands unlike the physical processes in closed lakes which are more likely to be driven by meteorological and thermal conditions water level changes in reservoirs with a range of tens of meters are also a powerful driving force affecting the mixing within them since they involve the conversion between kinetic energy and potential energy this could be an important connection between human operation and ecological outcome in reservoir systems in this study the evident change in algal distribution was related to water level operation due to its impact on the physical processes within the reservoir similar phenomena have also been noted in other reservoirs liu et al 2012 investigated algal blooms in xiangxi bay in the three gorges reservoir and found that the occurrence or disappearance of blooms was accompanied by different changes in mixing layer depth further related research by ji et al 2017 showed that the inversion of gravity flow from the water level in the main reservoir of the three gorges reservoir is the key to changing the mixing layer in xiangxi bay our study also suggested that water level operation has the potential to achieve algal control in artificial reservoirs by inducing mixing conditions that are not conducive to bloom development and such mixing patterns represent one of many possibilities and should be studied in more systems 4 conclusion in this study two algal bloom events occurring in the same reservoir were compared because of their notable spatial distribution differences data on major environmental variables collected in the field including the water temperature nutrient content and water level variation were examined to identify the driver of these differences the results indicated no significant difference in the water temperature or nutrient content between these two events however the water level continuously increased during the bloom event covering a large area and maintained a constant trend during the bloom event with a smaller coverage area hydrodynamic modeling was then conducted to simulate the mixing processes to determine whether the mixing processes due to water level variation were related to the observed bloom differences based on the simulation results a closed backflow pattern in the surface layer supported by inflow intrusion underneath during the rising water level operation was observed in the occurrence area of the algal bloom with a larger spatial scale in contrast the flow streamlines of surface water joined those of the intruding inflow and moved toward the water offtake during the other event when water impoundment did not occur in the reservoir the water age results also strongly indicated the occurrence of this mixing feature directly demonstrating that trapped water facilitated algal reproduction and that the backflow pattern promoted algae dispersal by comparing the inflow densimetric froude number between these two events it could be identified that when the water level in the reservoir was rising in the reservoir the kinetic energy of the inflowing water converted into potential energy as this supported water impoundment under this dynamic condition the original surface water near the dam was elevated trapped and displaced backward thus promoting algal bloom development after initial occurrence this water level operation associated mixing phenomenon

development and it has been reported that these factors can directly determine algal physiology processes such as photosynthesis guildford and hecky 2000 karlsson et al 2009 strzepek et al 2019 in addition hydrodynamic conditions has been recognized for their critical role in the development and maintenance of blooms lehman 2014 deng et al 2016 feng et al 2018 as it is the physical background that determines how dissolved materials and suspended particles such as algae are transported at spatial or temporal scales kalinin et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 mao and xia 2020 for example serra et al 2007 suggested that the distribution of phytoplankton populations in surface water was determined by combination of vertical convection and internal waves cyr et al 2012 2017 reported that wind driven processes in a stratified lake could lead to predictable differences in the spatial accumulation patterns of phytoplankton notably phytoplankton could suitably follow water mixing dynamics and be retained suggesting that algal blooms could potentially be prevented by regulating the mixing process which could feasibly be accomplished in systems such as artificial reservoirs and insight into the relationship between mixing processes and artificial operation is crucial in natural lakes mixing processes are commonly dominated by their stratification features and hydrological meteorological events artificial reservoirs show many differences because of the involvement of human operations which together with natural inflow variability cause high water level fluctuations and relevant hydrodynamic features inside the reservoir jørgensen et al 2005 hayes et al 2017 li et al 2020 duka et al 2021 certain researchers have used theories from physical limnology or fluid mechanics to interpret the specific flow patterns within reservoirs along with water level alterations bocaniov et al 2014 xie et al 2017 yang et al 2020 moreover water level fluctuations in reservoirs have been noted for their association with significant ecological outcomes carmignani and roy 2017 harrison et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 found that water mass mixing between a reservoir and its tributary resulting from water level manipulation caused the redistribution of nutrients guo et al 2021 also reported that the density currents due to water level operation would reduce nitrous oxide emissions in the bay of a reservoir furthermore a study by bordet et al 2017 revealed that water level scheduling is one of the most important factors affecting the vertical distribution of algae in a reservoir these previous studies provided different interpretations of the physical and ecological effects of water level changes the fluctuation amplitude of reservoirs can vary by up to tens of meters within a year and such a strong boundary force can obviously impact the water within them from the perspective of their physical limnological features reservoirs are usually considered similar to natural lakes but the unique pathway by which artificial water level operation influences the hydrodynamic conditions has rarely been discussed specifically and how it interacts with other ecological processes inside reservoirs still warrants further examination as reservoirs are an unignorable freshwater system and are growing rapidly in number zarfl et al 2014 the artificially controlled properties of reservoirs have gained increasing attention in regard to their use in alleviating the adverse ecological effects caused by reservoirs such as downstream river water temperature recovery weber et al 2017 hypolimnion dissolved oxygen supplementation carr et al 2020 and fish habitat protection li et al 2020 if algal control can be achieved through the implementation of reservoir operation strategies operating and environmental costs are expected to be saved there have been some attempts to schedule water level operations to control algal bloom problems in reservoirs ji et al 2017 jin et al 2019 however apart from theoretical analysis and simulation predictions rigosi and rueda 2012 xu et al 2019 only a few actual operation trials have been conducted to date chuo et al 2019 reported a case in the three gorges reservoir and proved that the chlorophyll a concentration in a tributary bay would respond significantly to water level manipulation which was related to the density current formation and stratification intensity in the bay these previous studies have illustrated that there is a potential to achieve algal bloom control in reservoirs by creating certain hydrodynamic conditions during reservoir water level operation although the information available for reference is scarce and more cases are needed to further interpret the underlying mechanism in this study two phytoplankton bloom events in a reservoir were investigated to identify the major factor inducing a notable difference in spatial coverage scale through the examination of field data it was determined that variables including the nutrient status and temperature were unrelated to the bloom coverage scale but the water level operation scheme exhibited a possible causality information extracted from hydrodynamic simulations was then used to validate the above hypotheses and explain the mixing characteristics that promoting algal coverage differences between these two events we further aimed to provide new insights into the mechanism by which anthropogenic physical processes in artificial reservoirs could cause ecological effects which could facilitate the development of algal bloom control strategies for similar reservoirs 2 study site and methods 2 1 study site the zipingpu reservoir zpp is located on the min river which is a major branch of the yangtze river and in the southwestern mountainous area of china fig 1 this reservoir 31 02 n 103 33 e is in the transition area from an alpine climate zone to a subtropical monsoon climate zone the zpp was designed mainly for irrigation and water supply and has the facility to achieve flood control and generate electric power dinoflagellate blooms have been observed in this reservoir every year since 2013 the height of the dam is 156 m the elevation of the dam top is 884 m a s l and the entrance bottom elevation of the outtake is 800 m a s l the water level of the zpp can fluctuate from an elevation of 817 m a s l to 877 m a s l according to the operation scheme while the allowed highest water level can be 883 1 m a s l under extreme flood conditions the length and water area can reach 24 km and 18 16 km2 respectively at a water level of 877 m and the total volume of the reservoir would be 9 8 108 m3 under the same conditions the annual mean volume of natural runoff of the river at the dam site is 148 108 m3 which means that the water in the reservoir could theoretically be replaced more than 10 times within one year but this depends on how the inflow water is mixed inside the reservoir 2 2 field work and data collection a water quality monitoring project was conducted in the zpp from april 2015 to march 2017 and surface water sample collection and field measurement were performed every month at fixed sites eight sites g1 g8 were arranged along the original river channel and an extra site lc was added since it was located in the tributary where algal blooms appeared every year fig 1 the location information of each monitoring site is shown in appendix table s1 the water samples for chlorophyll a analysis were fixed on site with 1 mgco3 and samples for algae species identification were stabilized on site with lugol s iodine solution 1 5 v v the samples for analysis of total phosphorus and total nitrogen were acidified on site using sulfuric acid until the ph value was less than 2 after collection these samples were stored at approximately 4 in a cooler and immediately sent to the laboratory for analysis of chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations all sample analyses were completed within 48 h algal species were classified according to hu and wei 2006 using an inverted microscope dp2 twain olympus the chlorophyll concentration was measured according to the acetone extraction spectrophotometric method arar 1997 total nitrogen tn was determined with the alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometric method and total phosphorus tp was measured using the ammonium molybdate method wei et al 2002 all samples were tested in triplicate and the mean value was then calculated data measured on site include water temperature and dissolved oxygen surface temperature ts and dissolved oxygen do were measured using a 6600 v2 multiprobe meter ysi inc usa vertical temperature profile data were also collected during field work in the reservoir usually at sites g7 g5 and g3 and an exo2 multiparameter profiler ysi inc usa was used time series of water temperature were recorded every hour at two sites using zdr self recording equipment hangzhou zeda instrument co ltd china the temperature at site g1 was recorded to represent the inflow river temperature tin and that at site g8 was recorded to represent the outflow temperature tout remote sensing retrieval was used to directly show the spatial distribution of the two bloom events one multispectral satellite image was collected during each bloom event specific image collection information and a description of the processing methods for the satellite images can be found in appendix part 3 after being verified by in situ chl a data the spectral band reflectivity combination b4 b3 was chosen as the predictor for the algal spatial distribution in addition daily meteorological data from dujiangyan station a state station located 8 km away from the dam were downloaded from the china meteorological data network data cma cn including air temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction precipitation and solar radiation data daily reservoir operation data including daily inflow outflow and water level were provided by the reservoir operator 2 3 numerical modeling 2 3 1 model setup ce qual w2 a laterally averaged two dimensional hydrodynamic model cole and wells 2015 was used in this study to simulate the hydrodynamic processes in the zpp the basic theoretical introduction and governing equations of the model are provided in appendix table s2 the simulation ran from may 1 2015 to september 30 2016 the initial temperature conditions were given according to the vertical profile data collected in the field daily mean discharge of both inflow and outflow were input as boundary conditions and the collected inflow temperature was interpreted on a daily basis before it was input meteorological data were also input to drive the surface heat budget calculations the simulation period was shorter than the field observation period due to some boundary data loss after september 2016 but it was long enough to cover the algal bloom periods in both years all boundary conditions inputted to drive the model are listed in appendix table s3 2 3 2 model validation li et al 2011 calibrated the model for the zpp during their previous research to assess the impact of the reservoir operation on the discharge water temperature they used field data from 2009 to 2010 for parameter calibration and sensitivity analysis and the calibration results are shown in appendix table s4 in this study to verify the validation of their calibrated parameters the collected field data during the study period 2015 2016 were used to evaluate the model performance the water level operation process during the simulation period as well as the collected vertical temperature profile and discharge temperature data were used for model result verification the mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse were calculated to evaluate the model performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse was also used to assess the modeling performance on the time series of simulated variables 1 mae 1 n i 1 n x i o x i m 2 rmse 1 n i 1 n x i o x i m 2 3 nse 1 i 1 n x i o x i m 2 i 1 n x i o x o 2 where n is the number of samples xo i is the observed value of sample i xm i is the modeled value of sample i and xo is the mean observed value as shown in fig 2 a the simulated water level results agreed well with the real water level dynamics throughout the simulation period with an nse value of 0 998 and mae and rmse values of only 0 61 and 0 76 m respectively suggesting that the water mass balance was calculated properly in this simulation study fig 2 b compares the simulated discharge temperature to the measured data the mae and rmse were 0 61 and 0 81 respectively which were relatively satisfactory considering that the mean measured value for the simulation period was 13 9 and the nse value was 0 95 which showed that the model could properly simulate the outflow temperature processes fig 3 shows the comparison between the simulated results and measured data for the vertical water temperature structure on three different profiling dates at sites near the dam 1 km g7 and 4 km g6 there was a thermocline at the surface of the water column and a quasi mixed layer with a much smaller temperature gradient beneath it from summer to early autumn jun 15 and sep 22 2015 while there was another thermocline in spring apr 20 2016 under the height where the reservoir outtake was located the model simulated this dynamic process quite satisfactorily with mae and rmse values all smaller than 1 at these two sites on the three dates however the simulation underestimated the vertical heat transportation to the bottom water due to the hydrostatic pressure assumption used in the model and a bottom mixed layer could thus be observed in the simulation results where the temperature was approximately 2 lower than that in the measured data for the sites farther away from the dam 8 km g3 and 16 km a nonfixed profile site the modeling results also agreed with the measured data quite well although an obvious error of approximately 4 c appeared in the surface simulation results for june 15 2015 the mae and rmse on the first date were 1 21 and 1 56 respectively while the values for the other dates were 0 30 and 0 31 for sep 22 2015 and 0 59 and 0 65 for apr 20 2016 respectively an unsatisfactory result might have occurred because the area is closely located to the upstream inflow and inaccurate input boundary data might notably impact the simulation results for this area the verification results indicated that the model used herein was able to correctly simulate the mass balance and water temperature structure in the reservoir during the simulation period although an error occurred in the simulated water temperature of the bottom layer the upper layer simulation results suitably agreed with the field data and that is the area where we primarily focused on our subsequent discussion the hydrodynamic conditions were not verified directly by the field velocity data but the water temperature simulation results showed that the mixing process and heat budget were properly calculated in general in reservoir systems stratified layers generate buoyancy to inhibit vertical mixing upstream of the dam fischer et al 1979 the relationship between the buoyancy caused by the stratification and the vertical mixing caused by the discharge determined the interflow position anohin et al 2006 due to the stratified temperature structure outflow water was derived from multilayers upstream of the dam and flow field formed with a jet like velocity distribution near the water offtake he et al 2018 thus the outflow water feature revealed the flow characteristics inside the reservoir and the accuracy of the flow field distribution in the reservoir was also indirectly proved through the satisfactory performance of the outflow water temperature simulation 2 3 3 metric analysis to illustrate the horizontal mixing characteristics the transport of momentum by advection tma and transport of momentum by diffusion tma in horizontal direction were extracted from the two dimensional modeling results as follows cole and wells 2015 4 tma b h δ u 2 δ x 5 tmd a z b h δ u δ x 2 where b is the cell width h is the average cell layer thicnkness u is the horizontal velocity δx is the segment spacing and az is the vertical eddy viscosity both tma and tmd were expressed in m3 s2 to evaluate local water residence features the water age was simulated in the model as the concentration of a tracer following a zero order decay dynamic cole and wells 2015 during simulation the inflow boundary condition for water age was always set to 0 to represent the zero residence time of the inflow water by setting the zero order decay rate to 1 day 1 the water age increases by 1 per day when no mixing occurs the source term in the transportation equation for water age is defined as follows 6 s water a g e k k 1 day 1 the inflow densimetric froude number f0 a dimensionless parameter was used in this study to compare the inertial force of inflow to buoyancy inside the reservoir f0 can be calculated as follows fang and stefan 2000 7 f 0 u 0 g h 0 where u0 is the inflow velocity h0 is the depth of the inflow cross section and g is the reduced acceleration of gravity which can be calculated as follows 8 g g ρ 0 ρ a ρ a where g is the acceleration of gravity ρ 0 is the inflow water density and ρ a is the density of ambient water in the reservoir 2 4 statistical analysis an independent t test was used to identify the significance difference between collected field data from different years the two sample kolmogorov smirnov tests k s tests was used to compare the difference between time series the spearman correlation test was used to measure the association between two variables for all statistical analyses a p value of 0 05 was considered significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 algal bloom investigation the bloom event in 2015 was first reported in late may by a reservoir operator claiming that the color of surface water turned brown red and the area covered by algae extended from near the dam area to approximately 10 km upstream however the 2016 bloom event was noticed in late june and mostly occurred in a small tributary approximately 4 km upstream from the dam this difference could also be observed according to the remote sensing results for chlorophyll a as shown in fig 4 a and the color of the water where the algae accumulated turned red brown fig 4 b by preliminary morphospecies identification the dominant species in both bloom events was identified as peridiniopsis penardii a species from the dinoflagellate genus peridiniopsis fig 4 c and the algal cell density in the bloom area was 107 individuals l 3 2 environmental variable examination the environmental variables characterizing the physical status and nutrient content of the water body during the algal blooms each year are shown in fig 5 and the statistical analysis results are shown in table 1 in regard to the nutrient content no significant difference between these two events was observed in terms of content level or spatial pattern while both the tp and tn contents at all sites exceeded the critical value for algal bloom initiation namely 0 02 mg l for phosphorus and 0 5 mg l for nitrogen camargo and alonso 2006 tang et al 2018 similarly the surface water temperature ts exhibted no significant difference between these two events with a temperature of approximately 21 which matches the optimum temperature range for most dinoflagellates singh and singh 2015 the relatively high nutrient level and suitable temperature could be responsible for the onset of algal blooms in both years the significantly higher do in the 2015 bloom could be explained by the higher productivity from the algae community covering a larger area smith and piedrahita 1988 however the observed significant difference in algal bloom spatial pattern could still not be explained by the nutrient content and surface temperature however the water level variation was significantly different between the two events fig 5 b and table 1 water impoundment occurred during the algal bloom in 2015 with the water level increasing by approximately 25 m while the water level fluctuated slightly below 840 m and exhibited a slight decreasing trend during the same period in 2016 fig 5 c also shows that the inflow temperature was always lower water level variation is determined by the reservoir inflow and outflow discharge scheme which have been reported due to their impact on mixing processes in deep reservoirs he et al 2022 in addition the inflow was always cooler than the resident water within in reservoir as shown in fig 5 c indicating that the river inflow could intrude into the water body according to the simulation results of the vertical temperature structure in the reservoir form may 2015 to august 2016 fig 6 intrusion could be observed in may and june of each year and the river inflow intruded into the reservoir approximately 8 km away from the dam where vertical stratification initially emerged under this interflow pattern background the different water level changes could result in the intruded inflow generate distinct mixing features within the water body 3 3 identifying differences in mixing patterns between blooming events to further identify the potential impact of mixing processes on the spatial pattern of algal blooms the flow pattern information was extracted from the simulation results as shown in fig 7 the flow pattern showed a novel difference between the two years accompanying the water level increase in 2015 the streamline formed a closed circle above the offtake height with varying thickness during this blooming period extending from the dam to approximately 8 10 km upstream where it met the inflow while the flow streamlines all moved toward the water offtake during the event in the next year fig 8 shows the detailed flow field characteristics during the 2015 bloom event an upwelling in front of the dam was formed due to the rising water level pushing the original surface water flow back toward the dam until it was stopped by the intruded inflow thus creating a backflow pattern in the surface layer the inflow intruded downward to a deeper layer because its temperature was lower than the returning surface water moving directly toward the water offtake which kept the whole upper layer of water trapped above it in contrast the water above the reservoir outtake was sucked into it together with the intrusion flow when the water level remained essentially the same in 2016 leading to the absence of the same flow pattern as in the previous year the ambient water and intruding inflow jointly supplied the water discharged during the water offtake operation between these two events flow along the horizonal direction was sensitive to contrasting water level operations thus we compared the horizontal momentum transport process in surface water as shown in fig 9 and a significant difference in the mixing intensity was observed notable horizontal mixing was driven by the backflow pattern during the 2015 event while a weak mixing process was suggested by the almost zero momentum transport during the bloom event in the following year in addition mixing in both years was dominated by advection since the momentum advection degree was much higher than the momentum diffusion degree serra et al 2007 revealed that surface currents in a reservoir are responsible for phytoplankton transportation across the basin similarly the flow along the river channel direction in the 2015 case could also promote spatial transportation of the algal community to a larger area but in cases similar to 2016 event the absence of physical mixing could weaken horizontal algae transportation and the resulting blooms therefore did not spread to a larger area after they first occurred in the reservoir moreover surface water dilution due to discharge could wash algal populations from the reservoir further inhibiting bloom development in addition water residence feature is important for algae growth since it decides how much time is available for algal growth and reproduction thus offering another perspective to investigate the effect of mixing processes on algae to further explore the surface water residence feature under different water level operations the water age variation was extracted for the surface water at 1 km in front of the dam and the results also showed a consistent response fig 10 a a continuous increase in water age could be observed during late may and early june in 2015 while the water age exhibited a declining trend with fluctuations during the blooming period in 2016 an increase in water age indicates that the water had not been fully replaced or washed out after it entered the local area and the water age was almost always greater than 10 days during the 2015 blooming period based on day 0 on may 1 this result demonstrates that the water was trapped in its local area for a relatively long time as the water level continued to rise although it might have been diluted occasionally by the new inflowing young water as the growth rate was occasionally lower than 1 per day the water age has been shown to possibly indicate the spatial pattern of the phytoplankton distribution because this parameter is related to nutrient depletion and phytoplankton population growth li et al 2011 stumpner et al 2020 gao et al 2018 found a significant positive correlation between surface chlorophyll a and water age in a bay in the three gorges reservoir and similar results were also observed in a large shallow lake in china where the spatial pattern of water age highly matched the spatial distribution of chlorophyll a qi et al 2016 thus the simulation results of water age can provide us with information on how suspended particles such as algae were transported and expanded their populations within the reservoir during the two bloom events as shown in fig 10 b water age showed a significant positive correlation r 0 882 p less than 0 05 with the water level during the 2015 events when the reservoir was impounded indicating that the rising water level enhanced water residence and promoted algal spreading the nonsignificant correlation observed in the 2016 event also suggests that the flow toward reservoir outtakes as shown in fig 7 due to stable water levels with a slight decreasing trend could not support the spatial spreading of algae inside the reservoir 3 4 how water level operation drives the mixing processes from may to june each year as the watershed enters its wet season the upstream inflow into the zpp is sufficient carrying a large amount of kinetic energy into the reservoir during this time the reservoir also forms a relatively stable stratification structure and the buoyancy inside the reservoir thus represents the major resistance to the inertial force of inflow this confrontation was parameterized using the inflow densimetric froude number which estimates the initial dilution of the density inflow upon entering the reservoir by comparing the inertial force of the current to the buoyancy of the ambient stratified water cortés et al 2014 roberts et al 2018 when f0 1 the two forces are approximately equal when f0 1 inertial forces dominate and when f0 1 buoyancy dominates as shown in fig 11 for 2015 except for a sharp decrease on may 30 f0 exhibited a continuous increasing trend after the bloom occurred in late may and then reached a peak f0 20 1 in early june indicating that the inertial force of the inflow continuously strengthened in comparison to the resistance of the reservoir during the development of the algal bloom this could be explained by the rising water level during the same period since the inflow was larger than the outflow the extra kinetic energy inertial force of the inflow was transferred to potential energy buoyancy in the water column as it was lifting the water level in contrast after the occurrence of the bloom in late june 2016 f0 increased slightly from 5 7 to 10 8 but was followed by a sharp decrease to the lowest value of 1 5 on july 3 when the bloom dissipated the unchanged water level during this period indicated that the amount of outflow discharge was essentially the same as that of the inflow and thus the inertial force of the inflow was weakened by increasing entrainment and dilution from the ambient stratified water in the reservoir fig 12 further summarizes the flow regime during the 2015 bloom event the stratification structure of the reservoir and the temperature difference between the inflow and the reservoir surface water together determined that the inflow would plunge down to a specific depth as it intruded toward the dam during this process the inflow water near the upper boundary of the intrusion was mixed with the warmer water above it making it lighter and increasing its buoyancy furthermore when the water level of the reservoir steadily rose the inflow was larger than the discharge volume through the water offtake therefore the heated buoyant water gradually became entrained into the upper layers when it flowed toward the dam while the remaining heavier water was sufficient to supply the water offtake thereby supporting the increasing water level and forming a trapped water area in the reservoir surface layers after an algal bloom initially occurred in some limited space it extended to a larger area as the horizontal flow pattern continued in this trapped water area in addition to physically promoting the dispersal of the algal community within the trapping area the entrainment and mixing at the top of the intrusion current during the rising water level operation period could also facilitate the transport of nutrients from the river inflow to the reservoir surface where light and temperature are more suitable for algal growth rueda et al 2007 and cortés et al 2014 demonstrated that a significant part of the density inflow could be entrained into the surface layers in a reservoir resulting in river nutrients being loaded into the euphotic zone this type of entrainment is mainly affected by kelvin helmholtz instabilities and turbulence at the interface between the density current and ambient water he et al 2017 in this study the stratified reservoir was experiencing a rising water level when the algal bloom occurred in 2015 and the growing incoming kinetic energy from the inflow as shown in the inflow densimetric froude number results in fig 10 could help to intensify the instabilities along the layer boundary consequently enhancing the entrainment into the upper layers although this process was not directly assessed in this study because it was unexpected the potential effect of this mixing pattern on the water quality and aquatic environment of lakes and reservoirs deserves further study particularly the quantitative estimation of these fluxes 3 5 potential implications of water level operation for algal control to assess the impact of water level manipulation on water mixing features we set up a simulation where the water level remained unchanged during the 2015 bloom season the water age variation between the same spot in this simulation and in the field is shown in fig 13 compared to the actual observation a clear difference in the water age trend appeared in the simulation especially after may 20 when the water level started to rise in reality the water age in the simulation scenario gradually declined more than it did in the field by june 10 the water age under the simulation was about 4 5 days younger than that in reality and by the end of june the water age decreased to no more than 5 days old in the simulation while it was nearly 30 days old in reality while the rising water level trapped the surface water and promoted algal expansion in reality the simulation results suggested that by increasing the water release from the reservoir the dilution and replacement of surface water would be enhanced and these residence features could lead to the inhibition of algal dispersal processes in a reservoir manipulation of the water level scheme is the major operation strategy and the water level is usually determined according to the water supply flood control and power generation demands unlike the physical processes in closed lakes which are more likely to be driven by meteorological and thermal conditions water level changes in reservoirs with a range of tens of meters are also a powerful driving force affecting the mixing within them since they involve the conversion between kinetic energy and potential energy this could be an important connection between human operation and ecological outcome in reservoir systems in this study the evident change in algal distribution was related to water level operation due to its impact on the physical processes within the reservoir similar phenomena have also been noted in other reservoirs liu et al 2012 investigated algal blooms in xiangxi bay in the three gorges reservoir and found that the occurrence or disappearance of blooms was accompanied by different changes in mixing layer depth further related research by ji et al 2017 showed that the inversion of gravity flow from the water level in the main reservoir of the three gorges reservoir is the key to changing the mixing layer in xiangxi bay our study also suggested that water level operation has the potential to achieve algal control in artificial reservoirs by inducing mixing conditions that are not conducive to bloom development and such mixing patterns represent one of many possibilities and should be studied in more systems 4 conclusion in this study two algal bloom events occurring in the same reservoir were compared because of their notable spatial distribution differences data on major environmental variables collected in the field including the water temperature nutrient content and water level variation were examined to identify the driver of these differences the results indicated no significant difference in the water temperature or nutrient content between these two events however the water level continuously increased during the bloom event covering a large area and maintained a constant trend during the bloom event with a smaller coverage area hydrodynamic modeling was then conducted to simulate the mixing processes to determine whether the mixing processes due to water level variation were related to the observed bloom differences based on the simulation results a closed backflow pattern in the surface layer supported by inflow intrusion underneath during the rising water level operation was observed in the occurrence area of the algal bloom with a larger spatial scale in contrast the flow streamlines of surface water joined those of the intruding inflow and moved toward the water offtake during the other event when water impoundment did not occur in the reservoir the water age results also strongly indicated the occurrence of this mixing feature directly demonstrating that trapped water facilitated algal reproduction and that the backflow pattern promoted algae dispersal by comparing the inflow densimetric froude number between these two events it could be identified that when the water level in the reservoir was rising in the reservoir the kinetic energy of the inflowing water converted into potential energy as this supported water impoundment under this dynamic condition the original surface water near the dam was elevated trapped and displaced backward thus promoting algal bloom development after initial occurrence this water level operation associated mixing phenomenon connects human operation to algal community promotion suggesting the promising application of water level operations in algal control in artificial reservoirs credit authorship contribution statement

al 2003 and gas formation kamolpornwijit and liang 2006 reardon 1995 williams et al 2007 since iron is not stable under environmental conditions iron corrosion occurs whenever a reactive iron specimen is immersed in an aqueous solution hu et al 2019 iron is corroded by protons from water and in the presence of oxidizing agents e g contaminants corrosion products fe2 and fe oh 2 can be oxidized to less soluble fe oh 3 fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 are polymerized and further transformed to various oxyhydroxides hu 2020 landolt 2007 all the possible corrosion products have much less density compared to the parent metal fe0 which means that iron corrosion is a volumetric expansive process and can constantly reduce the pore space within the system caré et al 2013 in addition iron corrosion leads to redox conditions and an increase in ph which induces the precipitation of secondary minerals phillips et al 2000 phillips et al 2003 wilkin et al 2005 the iron corrosion products and secondary minerals may precipitate within the fe0 prb pore space resulting in the reduction of porosity of the barrier medium moreover as another iron corrosion product hydrogen can be continuously generated during the operation of a fe0 prb the gas bubbles may be trapped within the porous medium and reduce the effective porosity of the barrier for groundwater flow vikesland et al 2003 zhang and gillham 2005 although the relationship between porosity loss and hydraulic conductivity loss may not necessarily be straightforward johnson et al 2005 previous studies generally applied kozeny carman formula to correlate porosity and hydraulic conductivity within the barrier li et al 2005 li et al 2006 mayer et al 2001 wu et al 2017 yabusaki et al 2001 the reduced hydraulic conductivity of a fe0 prb can result in the reorientation of groundwater flow changes in residence time and by passing li et al 2005 li et al 2006 for instance johnson et al johnson et al 2005 reported that although the fe0 prb continued to completely remove contaminants from the passing groundwater a portion of groundwater was being diverted beneath the fe0 prb at the cornhusker army ammunition plant after 20 months of operation field observations and column experiments reveal that pore space reduction within the barrier medium is spatially heterogeneously distributed johnson et al 2005 wilkin et al 2003 wilkin et al 2005 intensive secondary mineral precipitation which mainly consists of calcium carbonates caco3 and siderite feco3 occurs around the entrance face of the fe0 prb kamolpornwijit et al 2004 and iron corrosion products such as magnetite fe3o4 ferrous hydroxide fe oh 2 green rust feii 1 x feiii x oh 2 x x n an m n h2o x and iron oxyhydroxides feooh form throughout the fe0 prb wilkin et al 2003 moreover mineral precipitation can be affected by localized geochemical conditions and the groundwater flux for instance li et al li et al 2006 reported that a barrier section with a high groundwater flux shows a high degree of secondary mineral precipitation it is known that natural aquifers are heterogeneous and that aquifer heterogeneity causes preferential groundwater flow pathways which can result in heterogeneously distributed groundwater fluxes within the fe0 prb therefore although the barrier medium is homogeneous when installed spatially heterogeneous secondary mineral precipitation can cause a heterogeneous reduction of porosity and increasing heterogeneity in porosity of the barrier medium over time can influence the groundwater flow patterns which in turn will cause by passing flow around the prb and threat the long term effectiveness of the prb considerable interest exists regarding strategies to improve the long term performance of a fe0 prb li and benson 2010 one strategy is to install pea gravel equalization zones along the up gradient and down gradient faces of the prb the pea gravel zones have been used in several field prbs mcmahon et al 1999 sorel et al 2003 but the effectiveness is largely undocumented li and benson 2010 the effect of a pea gravel equalization zone is investigated in this study developing an assessment of the long term performance of fe0 prbs using field and laboratory data is limited by the long period over which mineral precipitation occurs vikesland et al 2003 and by the relatively short duration of laboratory experiments an alternative approach is conducting analyses with numerical model simulations in past decades numerous numerical reactive transport models have been established to simulate cantaminant degradations and mineral precipitation within fe0 prbs johnson et al 2005 li et al 2005 li et al 2006 mayer et al 2001 moraci et al 2016 wu et al 2017 yabusaki et al 2001 mayer et al mayer et al 2001 developed a kinetic geochemical algorithm and used the code min3p for modeling groundwater flow and mineral precipitation in the prb at the u s coast guard support center in their study the two dimensional simulations showed that the removal of contaminant and secondary mineral precipitation were unevenly distributed because of aquifer heterogeneities li et al li et al 2005 combined the codes modflow and rt3d to simulate geochemical reactions within prbs they concluded that the porosity reduction is sensitive to influent ion concentrations and that it is spatially variable in addition although different contaminant removal processes may require different reaction time the residence time of the groundwater within the barrier has been generally utilized to assess the effectiveness of fe0 prbs li et al 2005 li et al 2006 li et al li et al 2005 reported that the simulated groundwater residence time is decreasing over time which may result in an insufficient reaction time to completely remove the contaminant nonetheless the emphasis of previous models was mostly on the contaminant mass removal over time within the prbs and the long term effectiveness of prbs was estimated with one dimensional or two dimensional simulations mayer et al 2001 yabusaki et al 2001 to date few studies have been conducted to comprehensively investigate how heterogeneity variation of a prb may affect the groundwater flow and influence long term performance as explained above implementing a heterogeneous aquifer which can accurately represent a real geological situation is crucial for the simulations a practical approach is to make use of aquifer analogues which have been extensively employed for reservoir characterization in the petroleum industry bryant and flint 2009 such analogues are mainly derived by mapping outcrops and can provide a detailed representation of the natural heterogeneity of hydraulic properties hu et al 2011 huggenberger and aigner 1999 in this study a 3 d high resolution aquifer outcrop analogue developed by bayer bayer 2000 was utilized to represent aquifer heterogeneity the objective of this paper is to assess the possible impacts of porosity heterogeneity of a continuous wall fe0 prb on their long term effectiveness based on case studies a three dimensional 3 d groundwater transport model was developed to simulate the groundwater flow within the fe0 prb and its surrounding aquifer a 3 d high resolution aquifer outcrop analogue was adopted to set the hydraulic properties of the aquifer four individual scenarios were studied and the porosity and hydraulic conductivity reduction of the barrier medium redistribution of groundwater and by passing flows contaminant plume evolution as well as the residence time of groundwater were investigated 2 numerical modeling and case studies 2 1 conceptual model the conceptual model consists of a continuous wall prb and its surrounding aquifer the size of the simulation domain is 16 10 7 m the fe0 prb is set to be perpendicular to the main direction of groundwater flow x axis and is 7 m wide y axis 2 to 9 m 6 m deep z axis 1 to 7 m and 1 m thick x axis 7 to 8 m the whole prb is divided into two parts 1 the entrance domain and 2 the exit domain each portion is 50 cm in thickness the contaminant source is located at the upstream boundary as shown in fig 1 the prb is composed of zvi particles and its initial porosity and hydraulic conductivity are homogeneously distributed as groundwater flows through the prb the iron particles are corroded by the water causing secondary mineral precipitation which results in porosity reduction within the fe0 prb table 1 summarized the possible chemical reactions which may occur in the fe0 prb li et al 2005 li et al 2006 yang et al 2021 the effects of generated gas are not incorporated in this model since some previous studies have stated that gas accumulation can have a considerable influence on the hydraulic behavior of a fe0 prb parbs et al 2007 zhang and gillham 2005 the generated gas within the prb may exacerbate the effects predicted by the model studied herein important assumptions employed in this study are listed as follows a the porosity reduction within the entrance domain is caused by 1 iron corrosion products and 2 secondary mineral precipitation whereas the porosity reduction within the exit domain is only caused by iron corrosion products li et al 2006 b the porosity heterogeneity of the barrier medium results from 1 preferential flow in the aquifer and 2 the heterogeneously distributed secondary mineral precipitation within the barrier c if heterogeneous precipitation is considered the precipitation rate is proportional to the darcy flux li et al 2006 d the fe0 prb can totally remove the contaminant from the groundwater flowing through the barrier this assumption is based on the study of johnsen et al johnson et al 2005 which states that the prb can completely remove explosives when the water flows through the barrier after 20 months of operation and on a 22 year record of a fe0 prb site wilkin et al 2018 which reports the continuous degradation of chlorinated organic compounds the fe0 prb in this conceptual model follows the continuous wall design which contains a treatment barrier across the contaminant plume path thakur et al 2020 the continuous wall is the most favourable and common prb design because of its lower installation cost and less effect on the groundwater flow than other designs li et al 2005 obiri nyarko et al 2014 to focus on studying the impact of the porosity heterogeneity in prb other engineering designs such as cut off walls are not considered this study does not consider the specific geochemical processes of contaminant remediation the model presented here is the first attempt to simulate the redistribution of groundwater flow and contaminant transport caused by the porosity heterogeneity variation of the barrier with a three dimensional numerical model 2 2 numerical modeling approach the numerical simulations are conducted using the finite element software comsol multiphysics 2012 which is applicable for coupling variables of different physical fields specifically darcy s law and transport of diluted species in porous media modes were implemented to simulate groundwater flow and contaminant transport within the aquifer and the prb the ordinary differential equations mode was employed to simulate the porosity reduction within the prb over time the groundwater movement is governed by the darcy s law using the following equation nield and bejan 2006 1 s s h t k h q m where s s 1 m and k m s are the specific storage and hydraulic conductivity of the medium respectively h m is the hydraulic head which is defined as h z p ρ g where z m is the elevation p pa is the pressure ρ kg m3 is the density of the fluid and g m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration q m is a source sink term which equals to 0 in this study the transport of the contaminant within the fe0 prb is calculated as below bird et al 2006 2 t φ c d e d d c u c 0 3 d e φ t f d f where φ is the porosity of the medium c mol l is the contaminant concentration d e m2 s and d f m2 s are the effective diffusion coefficient and molecular diffusion coefficient respectively d d m2 s is the dispersion coefficient t f is the tortuosity of the contaminant specie which is defined as t f φ 1 3 u m s represents the darcy velocity field under assumption a in section 2 1 the porosity loss within prb over time can be described as 4 φ t n fecps t n precipitate t f o r t h e e n t r a n c e d o m a i n 5 φ t n fecps t f o r t h e e x i t d o m a i n where φ is the porosity of the prb n fecps is the volume fraction of the iron corrosion products n precipitate is the volume fraction of the secondary mineral precipitates the iron corrosion is assumed to occur uniformly within the whole fe0 prb equations 6 8 were utilized to simulate the porosity reduction caused by iron corrosion products equation 7 describes the variation of the iron surface area with the method introduced by mayer et al mayer et al 2001 6 n fe t r s fe 7 s fe s

surface area n fe 0 the initial iron volume fraction and η is the iron volumetric expansion coefficient caré et al 2008 there is an intensive porosity loss in the entrance domain resulting from secondary mineral precipitates a precipitation rate τ 1 y is utilized to calculate the porosity loss caused by the precipitation and is defined as 9 τ n precipitate t if homogeneous precipitation is considered the precipitation rate τ is a constant in the case of heterogeneous precipitation since the precipitation rate is assumed to be proportional to the darcy flux section 2 1 it can be described as 10 τ a b v where v m d is the darcy flux a and b are two constants and the values of a and b are calibrated with the field measurements from the work by sarr sarr 2001 which reports 0 02 per year porosity reduction the hydraulic conductivity of the fe0 prb was calculated following the kozeny carman formula as follows carman 1997 11 k c g v φ 3 1 φ 2 d 2 where k m s is hydraulic conductivity c an empirical coefficient equal to 1 180 g m s2 the gravitational acceleration v m2 s the viscosity of water and d m is the iron particle diameter particle tracking was applied and the advective travel times of groundwater particles within the barrier were estimated 100 water particles were released on the entrance boundary of the prb the particle density was set to be proportional to the darcy velocity the times when water particles leave the prb were recorded and the average residence time of water particles was calculated 2 2 1 boundary conditions for groundwater flow simulations the entrance and exit boundaries γ in and γ out in fig 1 were set to constant head boundaries the top boundary was set to a no flow boundary infinite element domains were established in all other directions outside the simulation domain in order to eliminate boundary effects for contaminant transport the source was set as a constant concentration c 0 01 m o l l other outer boundaries of the domain were set to open boundaries for contaminant remediation by the fe0 prb it is assumed that the contaminant can be completely removed when groundwater flows through the fe0 prb section 2 1 the assumption was realized by defining fe0 prb boundaries as 12 n d e c 0 where n denotes a unit normal vector towards outside 2 3 case studies the effect of the barrier porosity heterogeneity variation is investigated by simulating 3 individual scenarios case 1 case 2 and case 3 the effectiveness of a pea gravel equalization zone is assessed by case 4 table 2 represents the simulation strategy in case 1 the high resolution 3d aquifer outcrop analogue developed by bayer bayer 2000 is utilized as the heterogeneous aquifer around the prb heterogeneous secondary mineral precipitation is considered in case 1 for case 2 simulations the aquifer is set to be homogeneous and the hydraulic conductivity value of the aquifer is 2 11 10 3 m s the arithmetic mean value of the heterogeneous aquifer from case 1 heterogeneous mineral precipitation is taken into consideration and the precipitation rate is the same as in case 1 case 3 simulations utilized the identical heterogeneous aquifer as in case 1 and the porosity reduction of the barrier medium is assumed to be homogeneous over time which means the precipitation rate τ is a constant the value of the precipitation rate in case 3 is also calibrated using the field measurements by sarr sarr 2001 for case 4 simulations the heterogeneous aquifer and the heterogeneous mineral precipitation are the same as case 1 a 1 m think pea gravel equalization zone is added directly up gradient of the fe0 prb the gravel equalization zone had the same lateral and vertical dimensions as the fe0 prb 7 m wide and 6 m deep and had a constant porosity of 0 5 and hydraulic conductivity of 0 09 m s which is identical to the initial setting of the prb the constant hydraulic head values of the entrance and exit boundaries and the precipitation rates τ for four cases are calibrated parameters in this model to set meaningful values for hydraulic head of the boundaries a steady state simulation was conducted with the initial prb condition and the constant hydraulic head values were calibrated to ensure that the average darcy flux within the prb is 0 16 m d itrc 2005 the precipitation rate τ values for the case1 case 2 and case 3 were calibrated to fit the simulated average porosity loss within the prb to the measured porosity loss in sarr 2001 who reported a porosity reduction of 0 02 per year for case 3 since a homogeneous mineral precipitation was considered the precipitation rate within the prb is a constant and was calibrated to 0 02 1 y for case 1 and case 2 since a heterogeneous mineral precipitation was considered the precipitation rate τ was described by equation 9 and the constants a and b were calibrated as 0 006 and 0 14 respectively case 4 utilized the same precipitation rate as in case 1 as mentioned the porosity heterogeneity of the barrier strongly depends on the groundwater flow pattern and therefore on aquifer heterogeneity using the high resolution 3d aquifer outcrop analogue by bayer bayer 2000 an accurate representation of real natural aquifer conditions is obtained the hydraulic conductivity distribution of this analogue is illustrated in fig 2 it represents unconsolidated fluvial sediments in a gravel pit near the town of herten in southwest germany to obtain the analogue sequentially taken outcrop photographs were interpreted to yield lithology maps using sediment size texture information and gpr surveys based on the lithology description 10 cm scale resolution of hydraulic conductivity and porosity was obtained based on laboratory measurements the resulting 3d hydraulic parameter distribution model was further developed by maji and sudicky maji and sudicky 2008 using a transition probability markov chain based simulation method the size of the outcrop analogue is 16 10 7 m with a resolution of 5 5 5 cm the hydraulic conductivity varies from 6 10 7 to 1 m s the arithmetic mean value and standard deviation of hydraulic conductivity are 2 11 10 3 m s and 0 0274 m s respectively the specific storage is defined as a spatially uniform value of 1 10 4 1 m more details can be found in hu et al hu et al 2011 and liu et al liu et al 2020 the spatial variability of the geochemical parameters of the groundwater derived from the high heterogeneity of the aquifer analogue was not included in this study nonetheless it is worth noting that the aquifer heterogeneity can lead to a significant variation of water chemistry for instance the groundwater coming from the high hydraulic conductivity zones in the aquifer would contain higher amounts of dissolved oxygen and mineral forming ions than the water from low hydraulic conductivity zones the higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen and mineral forming ions may cause a more rapid porosity loss in the fe0 prb li et al 2005 thus the geochemical variation of the groundwater might aggravate the predicted effect based on this model the general input parameters for the numerical simulations are summarized in table 3 for all simulated scenarios the initial porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the fe0 prb are homogeneous the initial porosity is set to 0 5 and hydraulic conductivity is 0 09 m s 3 results 3 1 porosity and hydraulic conductivity reduction as stated in the description of the conceptual model the simulated fe0 prb is divided into two sections 1 the entrance domain and 2 the exit domain the porosity reduction within the entrance domain is caused by secondary mineral precipitation plus iron corrosion while the porosity of the exit domain is reduced merely because of the iron corrosion products 3 1 1 the entrance domain within the entrance zone both secondary mineral precipitation and iron corrosion are simulated numerically the relative average porosity and hydraulic conductivity reductions for the four cases are shown in fig 3 as stated above the precipitation rates for case 1 and case 3 are calibrated to make the simulated average porosity reduction within the prb entrance domain fit the field measurements reported by sarr sarr 2001 therefore the average porosity reduction as well as the average hydraulic conductivity reduction of two cases are identical over time the average porosity loss after ten years equals to 0 21 for case 1 and case 3 and 0 26 for case 2 this difference can be considered not significant the identical initial average darcy flux within the prb may account for the minor difference for case 1 and case 2 the mineral precipitation within the prb is heterogeneous and the precipitation rate is assumed to be proportional to the darcy flux the same initial average flux results in the same amount of mineral precipitation at the beginning and similar porosity reduction during the operation for case 4 the average porosity loss after ten years equals to 0 23 which is larger than that for case 1 nonetheless as shown in fig 3 although porosity reduction is around 50 the entrance domain of the fe0 prb loses over 90 of hydraulic conductivity after 10 years fig 4 shows the initial porosity distribution in the prb entrance domain and surrounding aquifer on a portion of a 2d section of the model domain y z section x 7 25 m and the porosity distribution after 5 and 10 years of operation for all four cases for case 1 the porosity of the entrance domain is highly heterogeneous because of the preferential flow in the heterogeneous aquifer and heterogeneously distributed mineral precipitation the heterogeneity in porosity increases with the operation time for case 2 the porosity of the medium within the entrance domain remains almost uniform through time except on the edges of the prb where larger porosity reduction occurs this larger porosity reduction is caused by the increased flux on the edges of the barrier as the initial hydraulic conductivity of the prb is higher than that of the aquifer for case 3 although the surrounding aquifer is heterogeneous the porosity distribution is homogeneous over time as the secondary mineral precipitation is homogeneously distributed within the barrier the simulation results of all cases differ substantially the maximum porosity reduction of case 1 0 37 after 10 years is larger than that of case 2 0 25 after 10 years the largest difference occurs in the zones with the highest initial darcy flux which are preferential flow paths nonetheless the porosity reduction for case 1 and case 3 are generally less than for case 2 except within preferential flow paths which is consistent with the average porosity reduction results shown in fig 3 for case 4 the simulated porosity distribution shows less heterogeneity compared to that of case 1 which indicates that the pea gravel zone can successfully equalize the groundwater flow and minimize the effect of preferential flow in the aquifer although the maximum porosity loss in case 4 0 32 after 10 years is smaller than that in case 1 the average porosity loss of the barrier in case 4 is greater than that in case 1 as shown in fig 3 3 1 2 the exit domain since the only consideration in the exit domain is the iron corrosion and it is assumed that the iron corrosion rate in mm y is not a function of the darcy flux the porosity and hydraulic conductivity reduction within the exit domain shown in fig 5 are the same for all studied cases as shown in the figure the porosity loss is 6 4 10 4 in a ten year period this result is consistent with the field measurement reported by wilkin et al 2003 which is less than 2 10 5 porosity reduction per year although the precipitation of iron corrosion products is the basic reason for porosity reduction in fe0 prbs hu 2020 the simulated porosity and hydraulic conductivity reductions caused by iron corrosion are relatively low the possible reason is the small iron corrosion rate used in this study which is derived from previous work on fe0 prbs jeen et al 2011 jeen et al 2007 mayer et al 2001 nonetheless the iron corrosion rate can vary over several orders of magnitude melchers and petersen 2018 and is especially dependent on the flow and chemical conditions if a larger iron corrosion rate is employed in a specific case the porosity reduction caused by iron corrosion can be enormous and have a significant influence on the long term performance of the prb 3 2 redistribution of groundwater flow and by passing fig 6 illustrates the initial horizontal darcy flux distribution in the prb and aquifer on a portion of the 2d section of the model domain y z section x 7 25 m and the darcy flux variations after 5 years and 10 years of operation for all cases the areas with higher flux caused by aquifer heterogeneity can be detected at the early stage of operation for case 1 and case 3 as the precipitation rate enhances with increasing the groundwater flux porosity reduction as well as hydraulic conductivity reduction of initially high flux zones are more significant which leads to the disappearance of these zones in case 1 and case 3 the decrease of fluid flux within initially high flux zones is more significant for case 1 than for case 3 in case 1 the initial high flux zone almost disappears after 10 years of operation for case 3 the flux within the initially high flux zones remains higher than within the surrounding area additionally for areas with initially low fluxes the simulated fluxes also decrease with time for case 3 however in case 1 simulations fluxes gradually increase in these areas moreover the generation of high fluxes right outside the prb is illustrated in fig 6 for case 1 and case 3 which indicates the by passing of groundwater flow around the prb case 1 shows a higher degree of by passing compared to case 3 for case 2 the preferential flow does not exist as the aquifer is homogeneous at the early stage high fluxes appear on the edges of the prb during the operation because of the precipitation caused by the high fluxes the porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the edges of the prb decrease rapidly which leads to the elimination of the relatively high flux zones for case 4 the initial high flux zones caused by aquifer heterogeneity cannot be clearly detected in the simulation results although a heterogeneous aquifer is considered the horizontal darcy flux becomes more evenly distributed over time fig 7 shows the temporal variation of average darcy flux within the fe0 prb for all cases as shown in fig 7 when the surrounding aquifer is homogeneous case 2 or the mineral precipitation is homogeneous case 3 the average flux within the prb continuously decreases in case 2 a more significant average flux reduction than in case 3 is observed after 10 years of operation on the contrary for the case with a pea gravel equalization zone in front of the prb case 4 the simulated average darcy flux within the fe0 prb keep increasing over time for case 1 in which the aquifer as well as the mineral precipitation are heterogeneous the average flux remains relatively stable over time except for the fluctuation between 1500 and 2000 days the different flux changes within the areas with low initial fluxes rates may explain the difference of average fluxes with time for case 1 and case 3 for case 3 the fluxes in all areas decrease over time which results in the continuously decreasing average flux for case 1 although the fluxes within the initially high flux zones decrease with time the fluxes increase in areas with initially low fluxes which yields a stable average flux for case 1 over time the total groundwater flow rate through the fe0 prb over time was simulated to investigate the occurrence of groundwater by passing the temporal percentage of the flow rate loss for the four cases is depicted in fig 8 the simulation shows that by passing occurs instantly after the prb installation for all cases after 10 years of simulation the total flow rate loss is 18 5 12 9 10 9 and 4 for case 1 case 2 case 3 and case 4 respectively the flow rate loss in case 1 is 30 and 41 larger than in case 2 and case 3 which means the by passing flow loss may be underestimated when porosity heterogeneity of the barrier is improperly considered case 2 and case 3 the flow rate loss in case 4 is remarkably smaller than that in case 1 which suggests that a pea gravel equalization zone can effectively minimize the amount of by passing flow during long term operation 3 3 contaminant plume migration fig 9 illustrates the contaminant plume migration over time for all cases for case 2 the homogeneous aquifer leads to a uniformly distributed groundwater flow the contaminant plume is spatially evenly distributed around the source since the size of the prb cannot cover the whole height of the model domain contaminant leakage passing around the prb occurs initially especially at the bottom of the prb after 10 years of simulation because of the reduction of hydraulic conductivity and porosity within the prb the untreated contaminant plume spreads along the direction of groundwater flow and migrates by passing the prb as shown in fig 9 for case 3 no significant contaminant plume can be detected after 10 years in case 1 since the prb covers the preferential flow paths caused by aquifer heterogeneity for the initial condition the prb can completely remove the contaminant plume nonetheless higher degrees of untreated contaminant plume spread and migration within the research domain can be seen after 10 years of operation in case 1 comparing to case 2 and case 3 for case 4 in which a pea gravel zone is added no evidence of contaminant plume leakage down gradient of the prb can be detected after ten years simulation 3 4 groundwater residence time fig 10 illustrates particle advective transport results at the cross section y 5 m of the model domain for case 1 and case 2 within the first 6 days of spreading since case 1 case 3 and case 4 assumed a similar heterogeneous aquifer the particle tracing results are identical within the first 6 days for those two cases as evident from fig 10 for case 1 the transport velocities of particles are significantly different particles with large velocity pass rapidly through the prb whereas those with low velocity scarcely migrate after 6 days in case 2 except for the high velocity particles at the edge of the prb released particles have an almost uniform transport velocity the time when each water particle leaves the prb was recorded and the simulated average residence times of particles within the fe0 prb over time are shown in fig 11 for the four cases the average residence times increase continuously after the installation of fe0 prb for case 2 in case 1 and case 3 the groundwater residence time remains almost constant for the first 4 and 10 years respectively and then increases no obvious reduction of groundwater residence time is observed for all cases which means that as long as the groundwater can flow through the prb there will be enough reaction time to remove the contaminant this finding is consistent with the field observation by wilkin et al wilkin et al 2018 who reported that a fe0 prb can continue to remove contaminants from groundwater after 22 years of operation for case 4 when a pea gravel zone is added in the model there is a minor decrease of average groundwater residence time between 4 and 6 years simulation which may be caused by the accelerated average darcy flux as shown in fig 7 the simulated average groundwater residence time of case 4 is smaller than that of case 1 4 summary and discussion the physical and chemical processes of contamiannts removal within the fe0 prb are very complex and related parameters such as porosity mineral precipitation rates are difficult to measure directly therefore a model fully validated based on field observations is currently hard to approach the model described in this study uses the well documented partial differential equations to simulate the groundwater flow and contamiant transport within the fe0 prb and its surrounding aquifer in order to make the model close to reality a 3 d high resolution aquifer outcrop analogue was utilized to implement aquifer heterogeneity we also set the parameters of the governing equations according to the literature and calibrated the values of constant head and precipitation rate in our model based on the field observations of sarr 2001 due to above considerations we believe that the established model in this study can reasonably simulate the reality in the field the simulation results show significant differences among the spatial porosity distributions inside the fe0 prb over time for all cases in case 1 the precipitation rate varies with the darcy flux the applied heterogeneous aquifer causes spatially variable fluxes within the fe0 prb which results in a highly heterogeneous porosity distribution within the barrier medium for case 2 the porosity of the barrier medium remains almost uniform over time because the aquifer is homogeneous as well as the groundwater flux the larger porosity reduction on the edge of the prb is caused by the accelerated flux as the initial hydraulic conductivity of the prb is higher than that of the aquifer higher fluxes lead to a larger precipitation rate increasing the porosity reduction for case 3 since a homogeneous porosity reduction is assumed the porosity of the barrier medium is homogeneous over time the difference of porosity distributions between case 1 case 2 and case 3 results in a different behaviour of groundwater flow for case 2 and case 3 the average darcy flux decreases continuously over time within the prb while the average darcy flux remains constant for case 1 the possible interpretation is that in case 1 although the fluxes within the initially high flux zones reduce rapidly fluxes within the areas with initially low fluxes increase over time the darcy flux distribution within the prb and the aquifer shows that for case 1 and case 3 an accelerated flow appears gradually outside of the prb which indicates the by passing of groundwater flow around the prb case 1 shows a higher degree of by passing compared to that of case 3 this implies an underestimation of by passing of a prb where the heterogeneity of the barrier medium is not taken into account this finding is consistent with the simulation results of flow rate loss over time for the three cases which show that if heterogeneity of the aquifer case 2 or heterogeneity of the barrier medium case 3 is not considered 30 or 41 of flow rate loss by passing in ten years simulation are underestimated the simulation results of case 1 show a significantly higher degree of contaminant plume spreading and migration over time compared to that of case 2 and case 3 therefore for the fe0 prb design and long term evaluation heterogeneity of the pore space is important for the evaluation of the long term plume migration where only a homogeneous surrounding aquifer is simulated or heterogeneous mineral precipitation is neglected the untreated contaminant plume spread over time may be underestimated particle tracing was applied to assess groundwater residence time within the prb for all cases the average residence time of particles tends to increase with time and no evidence of residence time reduction is observed in case 1 case 2 and case 3 therefore in this study the reduction of water residence time is not a concern of prb performance rather than the reduction of groundwater residence time by passing flow is the key factor influencing the long term performance of a continuous wall fe0 prb the effectiveness of a pea gravel equalization zone can be assessed by comparing the simulation results between case 1 and case 4 identical surrounding aquifer and mineral precipitation rates are utilized in case 1 and case 4 and the only difference between the two case studies is the addition of 1 m thick pea gravel equalization zone up gradient of the prb in case 4 the simulation results show that the porosity and horizontal darcy flux are more homogeneously distributed during operation in case 4 than in case 1 fig 4 and fig 6 the average porosity loss and the average darcy flux within the prb are larger when a pea gravel zone is considered it is consistent with the finding of li and benson 2010 who reported that pea gravel equalization zones result in an increasing average porosity reduction in their study the possible explanation for the increasing darcy flux and average porosity loss is that the highly permeable gravel zone can concentrate the groundwater flow in the surrounding area and constantly supply it to the prb due to the effect of the permeable gravel zone and less heterogeneous distributed barrier the simulation results show less flow rate loss and no contaminant plume leakage around the prb over ten years operation in case 4 thus it can be found in this study that the addition of a pea gravel equalization zone can effectively improve the long term performance of a continuous wall fe0 prb by equalizing the groundwater flow into the prb reducing the heterogeneity of the barrier medium and minimizing the by passing flow that may exist during long term operation however the particle tracking results show less average groundwater residence time within the prb when a pea gravel zone is added which may have a negative impact on contaminant removal in this case study the predicted results and findings are specific to a fe0 prb with a continuous wall design although the application of prbs with continuous wall design is the most common due to its low installation cost the fe0 prbs with this design may face some problems during long term operation e g the issue of by passing flow in this study in field applications a funnel and gate design can be utilized to eliminate the effect of by passing flow a funnel and gate design comprises funnels i e cut off walls around the barrier which can converge the contaminant plume to the prb thakur et al 2020 the cut off walls such as sheet piles and slurry walls have low permeability and can prevent the occurrence of the by passing flow around the prb obiri nyarko et al 2014 smith et al 2003 however the funnel and gate construction is more expensive than a continuous wall system which hampers its broad application prospects for projects with a limited budget in a real world scenario both the construction costs of a prb and its long term performance should be carefully considered in the design stage in addition the predicted effect described herein is based on case studies a more general investigation on the impact of porosity heterogeneity of the barrier considering statistics should be conducted in the future 5 conclusions a series of simulations were conducted using a 3 d groundwater flow and transport model to evaluate how porosity heterogeneity of the barrier medium may affect the groundwater flow and influence the long term performance of a continuous wall fe0 prb four cases were simulated where each considered 1 heterogeneous aquifer and heterogeneous mineral precipitation 2 homogeneous aquifer and heterogeneous mineral precipitation 3 heterogeneous aquifer and homogeneous mineral precipitation and 4 heterogeneous aquifer and heterogeneous mineral precipitation with a pea gravel equalization zone up gradient of the prb a 3 d high resolution aquifer outcrop analogue was adopted to set the hydraulic properties of the heterogeneous aquifer results from this study reveal the following preferential flow in heterogeneous aquifers and heterogeneously distributed mineral precipitation can cause a significant porosity heterogeneity of the barrier medium over time which results in a remarkable difference of groundwater flow behavior for all cases by passing occurs instantly after beginning of the operation if porosity heterogeneity of the barrier medium is not considered 30 41 of the by passing flow rates are underestimated in ten years simulation by passing is a key concern threatening the long term performance of a continuous wall fe0 prb for the transport of contaminants the long term contaminant plume migration is underrated if porosity heterogeneity of the barrier medium is neglected the residence time of groundwater within the fe0 prb increases over time obvious reduction of groundwater residence time is not observed in case studies installation of a pea gravel equalization zone can effectively improve the long term performance of a continuous wall fe0 prb by equalizing the groundwater flow into the prb reducing the heterogeneity of the barrier medium and minimizing the by passing flow that may exist during long term operation but the pea gravel equalization zone results in a smaller residence time that could have a negative effects on long term performance of a prb we recommend to properly consider the impact of porosity heterogeneity of the barrier on the prediction of a continuous wall fe0 prb longevity especially when the surrounding aquifer is highly heterogeneous the heterogeneity of the aquifer could form an unevenly porosity loss within the prb and cause a large amount of by passing flow during long term operation in addition the installation of a pea gravel equalization zone up gradient of the fe0 prb is recommended due to its effect to reduce the heterogeneity of the barrier and to minimize the by passing flow author contributions huichen yang established the numerical model and wrote the manuscript quan liu supervised the numerical model and manuscript writing rui hu supervised

3056,this paper presents a three dimensional 3 d numerical groundwater flow and transport model of a metallic iron based permeable reactive barrier fe0 prb to assess how porosity heterogeneity of the barrier medium may affect groundwater flow over time and influence the long term effectiveness of a fe0 prb a 3 d high resolution aquifer outcrop analogue was utilized to implement aquifer heterogeneity to evaluate the treatment performance of the prb the contaminant plume migration and groundwater residence time were investigated the findings demonstrate that heterogeneity of porosity reduction of the barrier medium is an important factor in estimating the long term performance of a continuous wall fe0 prb ignoring the porosity heterogeneity of the barrier medium leads to an underestimation of the by passing flow by 30 41 in ten years simulation and of contaminant plume spread over time groundwater residence time simulations shows no evident residence time reduction during the operation of the fe0 prb installation of a pea gravel equalization zone can effectively reduce the heterogeneity of the barrier medium and minimize the by passing flow keywords groundwater flow and transport model groundwater remediation long term effectiveness permeable reactive barrier zero valent iron 1 introduction metallic iron based permeable reactive barriers fe0 prbs can be considered an effective and economically feasible in situ technology for remediation of polluted groundwater gillham 1999 tratnyek et al 2002 wu et al 2017 polluted water with varieties of contaminants such as halogenated organics arnold and roberts 2000 nitroaromatics keum and li 2004 dyes nam and tratnyek 2000 phenolic compounds morales et al 2002 heavy metals rangsivek and jekel 2005 and various oxyanions neumann et al 2013 can be treated by fe0 h2o systems fe0 prbs can activate different physical and chemical mechanisms for contaminant removal including adsorption co precipitation and adsorptive size exclusion noubactep 2011 although the performance of applied fe0 prbs has been generally satisfactory agrawal and tratnyek 1995 keum and li 2004 phillips et al 2000 phillips et al 2003 wilkin et al 2018 wilkin et al 2005 the question still remains on estimating the long term effectiveness of fe0 prbs moraci et al 2016 two main concerns for fe0 prbs longevity evaluation are reactivity loss and porosity loss caré et al 2013 henderson and demond 2007 yang et al 2021 the reactivity loss of fe0 prbs has been well studied and is caused by the generated oxide scale in the vicinity of iron particles which is reported compromise the electron transfer from the iron body and decrease the reaction rates of the contaminants removal during long term operation hu 2020 jeen et al 2007 jeen et al 2008 weber et al 2013 the porosity loss of fe0 prbs is caused by clogging of the pore space due to mineral precipitation li et al 2005 phillips et al 2000 phillips et al 2003 and gas formation kamolpornwijit and liang 2006 reardon 1995 williams et al 2007 since iron is not stable under environmental conditions iron corrosion occurs whenever a reactive iron specimen is immersed in an aqueous solution hu et al 2019 iron is corroded by protons from water and in the presence of oxidizing agents e g contaminants corrosion products fe2 and fe oh 2 can be oxidized to less soluble fe oh 3 fe oh 2 and fe oh 3 are polymerized and further transformed to various oxyhydroxides hu 2020 landolt 2007 all the possible corrosion products have much less density compared to the parent metal fe0 which means that iron corrosion is a volumetric expansive process and can constantly reduce the pore space within the system caré et al 2013 in addition iron corrosion leads to redox conditions and an increase in ph which induces the precipitation of secondary minerals phillips et al 2000 phillips et al 2003 wilkin et al 2005 the iron corrosion products and secondary minerals may precipitate within the fe0 prb pore space resulting in the reduction of porosity of the barrier medium moreover as another iron corrosion product hydrogen can be continuously generated during the operation of a fe0 prb the gas bubbles may be trapped within the porous medium and reduce the effective porosity of the barrier for groundwater flow vikesland et al 2003 zhang and gillham 2005 although the relationship between porosity loss and hydraulic conductivity loss may not necessarily be straightforward johnson et al 2005 previous studies generally applied kozeny carman formula to correlate porosity and hydraulic conductivity within the barrier li et al 2005 li et al 2006 mayer et al 2001 wu et al 2017 yabusaki et al 2001 the reduced hydraulic conductivity of a fe0 prb can result in the reorientation of groundwater flow changes in residence time and by passing li et al 2005 li et al 2006 for instance johnson et al johnson et al 2005 reported that although the fe0 prb continued to completely remove contaminants from the passing groundwater a portion of groundwater was being diverted beneath the fe0 prb at the cornhusker army ammunition plant after 20 months of operation field observations and column experiments reveal that pore space reduction within the barrier medium is spatially heterogeneously distributed johnson et al 2005 wilkin et al 2003 wilkin et al 2005 intensive secondary mineral precipitation which mainly consists of calcium carbonates caco3 and siderite feco3 occurs around the entrance face of the fe0 prb kamolpornwijit et al 2004 and iron corrosion products such as magnetite fe3o4 ferrous hydroxide fe oh 2 green rust feii 1 x feiii x oh 2 x x n an m n h2o x and iron oxyhydroxides feooh form throughout the fe0 prb wilkin et al 2003 moreover mineral precipitation can be affected by localized geochemical conditions and the groundwater flux for instance li et al li et al 2006 reported that a barrier section with a high groundwater flux shows a high degree of secondary mineral precipitation it is known that natural aquifers are heterogeneous and that aquifer heterogeneity causes preferential groundwater flow pathways which can result in heterogeneously distributed groundwater fluxes within the fe0 prb therefore although the barrier medium is homogeneous when installed spatially heterogeneous secondary mineral precipitation can cause a heterogeneous reduction of porosity and increasing heterogeneity in porosity of the barrier medium over time can influence the groundwater flow patterns which in turn will cause by passing flow around the prb and threat the long term effectiveness of the prb considerable interest exists regarding strategies to improve the long term performance of a fe0 prb li and benson 2010 one strategy is to install pea gravel equalization zones along the up gradient and down gradient faces of the prb the pea gravel zones have been used in several field prbs mcmahon et al 1999 sorel et al 2003 but the effectiveness is largely undocumented li and benson 2010 the effect of a pea gravel equalization zone is investigated in this study developing an assessment of the long term performance of fe0 prbs using field and laboratory data is limited by the long period over which mineral precipitation occurs vikesland et al 2003 and by the relatively short duration of laboratory experiments an alternative approach is conducting analyses with numerical model simulations in past decades numerous numerical reactive transport models have been established to simulate cantaminant degradations and mineral precipitation within fe0 prbs johnson et al 2005 li et al 2005 li et al 2006 mayer et al 2001 moraci et al 2016 wu et al 2017 yabusaki et al 2001 mayer et al mayer et al 2001 developed a kinetic geochemical algorithm and used the code min3p for modeling groundwater flow and mineral precipitation in the prb at the u s coast guard support center in their study the two dimensional simulations showed that the removal of contaminant and secondary mineral precipitation were unevenly distributed because of aquifer heterogeneities li et al li et al 2005 combined the codes modflow and rt3d to simulate geochemical reactions within prbs they concluded that the porosity reduction is sensitive to influent ion concentrations and that it is spatially variable in addition although different contaminant removal processes may require different reaction time the residence time of the groundwater within the barrier has been generally utilized to assess the effectiveness of fe0 prbs li et al 2005 li et al 2006 li et al li et al 2005 reported that the simulated groundwater residence time is decreasing over time which may result in an insufficient reaction time to completely remove the contaminant nonetheless the emphasis of previous models was mostly on the contaminant mass removal over time within the prbs and the long term effectiveness of prbs was estimated with one dimensional or two dimensional simulations mayer et al 2001 yabusaki et al 2001 to date few studies have been conducted to comprehensively investigate how heterogeneity variation of a prb may affect the groundwater flow and influence long term performance as explained above implementing a heterogeneous aquifer which can accurately represent a real geological situation is crucial for the simulations a practical approach is to make use of aquifer analogues which have been extensively employed for reservoir characterization in the petroleum industry bryant and flint 2009 such analogues are mainly derived by mapping outcrops and can provide a detailed representation of the natural heterogeneity of hydraulic properties hu et al 2011 huggenberger and aigner 1999 in this study a 3 d high resolution aquifer outcrop analogue developed by bayer bayer 2000 was utilized to represent aquifer heterogeneity the objective of this paper is to assess the possible impacts of porosity heterogeneity of a continuous wall fe0 prb on their long term effectiveness based on case studies a three dimensional 3 d groundwater transport model was developed to simulate the groundwater flow within the fe0 prb and its surrounding aquifer a 3 d high resolution aquifer outcrop analogue was adopted to set the hydraulic properties of the aquifer four individual scenarios were studied and the porosity and hydraulic conductivity reduction of the barrier medium redistribution of groundwater and by passing flows contaminant plume evolution as well as the residence time of groundwater were investigated 2 numerical modeling and case studies 2 1 conceptual model the conceptual model consists of a continuous wall prb and its surrounding aquifer the size of the simulation domain is 16 10 7 m the fe0 prb is set to be perpendicular to the main direction of groundwater flow x axis and is 7 m wide y axis 2 to 9 m 6 m deep z axis 1 to 7 m and 1 m thick x axis 7 to 8 m the whole prb is divided into two parts 1 the entrance domain and 2 the exit domain each portion is 50 cm in thickness the contaminant source is located at the upstream boundary as shown in fig 1 the prb is composed of zvi particles and its initial porosity and hydraulic conductivity are homogeneously distributed as groundwater flows through the prb the iron particles are corroded by the water causing secondary mineral precipitation which results in porosity reduction within the fe0 prb table 1 summarized the possible chemical reactions which may occur in the fe0 prb li et al 2005 li et al 2006 yang et al 2021 the effects of generated gas are not incorporated in this model since some previous studies have stated that gas accumulation can have a considerable influence on the hydraulic behavior of a fe0 prb parbs et al 2007 zhang and gillham 2005 the generated gas within the prb may exacerbate the effects predicted by the model studied herein important assumptions employed in this study are listed as follows a the porosity reduction within the entrance domain is caused by 1 iron corrosion products and 2 secondary mineral precipitation whereas the porosity reduction within the exit domain is only caused by iron corrosion products li et al 2006 b the porosity heterogeneity of the barrier medium results from 1 preferential flow in the aquifer and 2 the heterogeneously distributed secondary mineral precipitation within the barrier c if heterogeneous precipitation is considered the precipitation rate is proportional to the darcy flux li et al 2006 d the fe0 prb can totally remove the contaminant from the groundwater flowing through the barrier this assumption is based on the study of johnsen et al johnson et al 2005 which states that the prb can completely remove explosives when the water flows through the barrier after 20 months of operation and on a 22 year record of a fe0 prb site wilkin et al 2018 which reports the continuous degradation of chlorinated organic compounds the fe0 prb in this conceptual model follows the continuous wall design which contains a treatment barrier across the contaminant plume path thakur et al 2020 the continuous wall is the most favourable and common prb design because of its lower installation cost and less effect on the groundwater flow than other designs li et al 2005 obiri nyarko et al 2014 to focus on studying the impact of the porosity heterogeneity in prb other engineering designs such as cut off walls are not considered this study does not consider the specific geochemical processes of contaminant remediation the model presented here is the first attempt to simulate the redistribution of groundwater flow and contaminant transport caused by the porosity heterogeneity variation of the barrier with a three dimensional numerical model 2 2 numerical modeling approach the numerical simulations are conducted using the finite element software comsol multiphysics 2012 which is applicable for coupling variables of different physical fields specifically darcy s law and transport of diluted species in porous media modes were implemented to simulate groundwater flow and contaminant transport within the aquifer and the prb the ordinary differential equations mode was employed to simulate the porosity reduction within the prb over time the groundwater movement is governed by the darcy s law using the following equation nield and bejan 2006 1 s s h t k h q m where s s 1 m and k m s are the specific storage and hydraulic conductivity of the medium respectively h m is the hydraulic head which is defined as h z p ρ g where z m is the elevation p pa is the pressure ρ kg m3 is the density of the fluid and g m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration q m is a source sink term which equals to 0 in this study the transport of the contaminant within the fe0 prb is calculated as below bird et al 2006 2 t φ c d e d d c u c 0 3 d e φ t f d f where φ is the porosity of the medium c mol l is the contaminant concentration d e m2 s and d f m2 s are the effective diffusion coefficient and molecular diffusion coefficient respectively d d m2 s is the dispersion coefficient t f is the tortuosity of the contaminant specie which is defined as t f φ 1 3 u m s represents the darcy velocity field under assumption a in section 2 1 the porosity loss within prb over time can be described as 4 φ t n fecps t n precipitate t f o r t h e e n t r a n c e d o m a i n 5 φ t n fecps t f o r t h e e x i t d o m a i n where φ is the porosity of the prb n fecps is the volume fraction of the iron corrosion products n precipitate is the volume fraction of the secondary mineral precipitates the iron corrosion is assumed to occur uniformly within the whole fe0 prb equations 6 8 were utilized to simulate the porosity reduction caused by iron corrosion products equation 7 describes the variation of the iron surface area with the method introduced by mayer et al mayer et al 2001 6 n fe t r s fe 7 s fe s fe 0 n fe n fe 0 2 3 8 n fecps t η 1 n fe t where n fe is the iron volume fraction r mm y the anaerobic iron corrosion rate s fe m2 m3 the iron specific surface area s fe 0 m2 m3 the initial iron surface area n fe 0 the initial iron volume fraction and η is the iron volumetric expansion coefficient caré et al 2008 there is an intensive porosity loss in the entrance domain resulting from secondary mineral precipitates a precipitation rate τ 1 y is utilized to calculate the porosity loss caused by the precipitation and is defined as 9 τ n precipitate t if homogeneous precipitation is considered the precipitation rate τ is a constant in the case of heterogeneous precipitation since the precipitation rate is assumed to be proportional to the darcy flux section 2 1 it can be described as 10 τ a b v where v m d is the darcy flux a and b are two constants and the values of a and b are calibrated with the field measurements from the work by sarr sarr 2001 which reports 0 02 per year porosity reduction the hydraulic conductivity of the fe0 prb was calculated following the kozeny carman formula as follows carman 1997 11 k c g v φ 3 1 φ 2 d 2 where k m s is hydraulic conductivity c an empirical coefficient equal to 1 180 g m s2 the gravitational acceleration v m2 s the viscosity of water and d m is the iron particle diameter particle tracking was applied and the advective travel times of groundwater particles within the barrier were estimated 100 water particles were released on the entrance boundary of the prb the particle density was set to be proportional to the darcy velocity the times when water particles leave the prb were recorded and the average residence time of water particles was calculated 2 2 1 boundary conditions for groundwater flow simulations the entrance and exit boundaries γ in and γ out in fig 1 were set to constant head boundaries the top boundary was set to a no flow boundary infinite element domains were established in all other directions outside the simulation domain in order to eliminate boundary effects for contaminant transport the source was set as a constant concentration c 0 01 m o l l other outer boundaries of the domain were set to open boundaries for contaminant remediation by the fe0 prb it is assumed that the contaminant can be completely removed when groundwater flows through the fe0 prb section 2 1 the assumption was realized by defining fe0 prb boundaries as 12 n d e c 0 where n denotes a unit normal vector towards outside 2 3 case studies the effect of the barrier porosity heterogeneity variation is investigated by simulating 3 individual scenarios case 1 case 2 and case 3 the effectiveness of a pea gravel equalization zone is assessed by case 4 table 2 represents the simulation strategy in case 1 the high resolution 3d aquifer outcrop analogue developed by bayer bayer 2000 is utilized as the heterogeneous aquifer around the prb heterogeneous secondary mineral precipitation is considered in case 1 for case 2 simulations the aquifer is set to be homogeneous and the hydraulic conductivity value of the aquifer is 2 11 10 3 m s the arithmetic mean value of the heterogeneous aquifer from case 1 heterogeneous mineral precipitation is taken into consideration and the precipitation rate is the same as in case 1 case 3 simulations utilized the identical heterogeneous aquifer as in case 1 and the porosity reduction of the barrier medium is assumed to be homogeneous over time which means the precipitation rate τ is a constant the value of the precipitation rate in case 3 is also calibrated using the field measurements by sarr sarr 2001 for case 4 simulations the heterogeneous aquifer and the heterogeneous mineral precipitation are the same as case 1 a 1 m think pea gravel equalization zone is added directly up gradient of the fe0 prb the gravel equalization zone had the same lateral and vertical dimensions as the fe0 prb 7 m wide and 6 m deep and had a constant porosity of 0 5 and hydraulic conductivity of 0 09 m s which is identical to the initial setting of the prb the constant hydraulic head values of the entrance and exit boundaries and the precipitation rates τ for four cases are calibrated parameters in this model to set meaningful values for hydraulic head of the boundaries a steady state simulation was conducted with the initial prb condition and the constant hydraulic head values were calibrated to ensure that the average darcy flux within the prb is 0 16 m d itrc 2005 the precipitation rate τ values for the case1 case 2 and case 3 were calibrated to fit the simulated average porosity loss within the prb to the measured porosity loss in sarr 2001 who reported a porosity reduction of 0 02 per year for case 3 since a homogeneous mineral precipitation was considered the precipitation rate within the prb is a constant and was calibrated to 0 02 1 y for case 1 and case 2 since a heterogeneous mineral precipitation was considered the precipitation rate τ was described by equation 9 and the constants a and b were calibrated as 0 006 and 0 14 respectively case 4 utilized the same precipitation rate as in case 1 as mentioned the porosity heterogeneity of the barrier strongly depends on the groundwater flow pattern and therefore on aquifer heterogeneity using the high resolution 3d aquifer outcrop analogue by bayer bayer 2000 an accurate representation of real natural aquifer conditions is obtained the hydraulic conductivity distribution of this analogue is illustrated in fig 2 it represents unconsolidated fluvial sediments in a gravel pit near the town of herten in southwest germany to obtain the analogue sequentially taken outcrop photographs were interpreted to yield lithology maps using sediment size texture information and gpr surveys based on the lithology description 10 cm scale resolution of hydraulic conductivity and porosity was obtained based on laboratory measurements the resulting 3d hydraulic parameter distribution model was further developed by maji and sudicky maji and sudicky 2008 using a transition probability markov chain based simulation method the size of the outcrop analogue is 16 10 7 m with a resolution of 5 5 5 cm the hydraulic conductivity varies from 6 10 7 to 1 m s the arithmetic mean value and standard deviation of hydraulic conductivity are 2 11 10 3 m s and 0 0274 m s respectively the specific storage is defined as a spatially uniform value of 1 10 4 1 m more details can be found in hu et al hu et al 2011 and liu et al liu et al 2020 the spatial variability of the geochemical parameters of the groundwater derived from the high heterogeneity of the aquifer analogue was not included in this study nonetheless it is worth noting that the aquifer heterogeneity can lead to a significant variation of water chemistry for instance the groundwater coming from the high hydraulic conductivity zones in the aquifer would contain higher amounts of dissolved oxygen and mineral forming ions than the water from low hydraulic conductivity zones the higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen and mineral forming ions may cause a more rapid porosity loss in the fe0 prb li et al 2005 thus the geochemical variation of the groundwater might aggravate the predicted effect based on this model the general input parameters for the numerical simulations are summarized in table 3 for all simulated scenarios the initial porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the fe0 prb are homogeneous the initial porosity is set to 0 5 and hydraulic conductivity is 0 09 m s 3 results 3 1 porosity and hydraulic conductivity reduction as stated in the description of the conceptual model the simulated fe0 prb is divided into two sections 1 the entrance domain and 2 the exit domain the porosity reduction within the entrance domain is caused by secondary mineral precipitation plus iron corrosion while the porosity of the exit domain is reduced merely because of the iron corrosion products 3 1 1 the entrance domain within the entrance zone both secondary mineral precipitation and iron corrosion are simulated numerically the relative average porosity and hydraulic conductivity reductions for the four cases are shown in fig 3 as stated above the precipitation rates for case 1 and case 3 are calibrated to make the simulated average porosity reduction within the prb entrance domain fit the field measurements reported by sarr sarr 2001 therefore the average porosity reduction as well as the average hydraulic conductivity reduction of two cases are identical over time the average porosity loss after ten years equals to 0 21 for case 1 and case 3 and 0 26 for case 2 this difference can be considered not significant the identical initial average darcy flux within the prb may account for the minor difference for case 1 and case 2 the mineral precipitation within the prb is heterogeneous and the precipitation rate is assumed to be proportional to the darcy flux the same initial average flux results in the same amount of mineral precipitation at the beginning and similar porosity reduction during the operation for case 4 the average porosity loss after ten years equals to 0 23 which is larger than that for case 1 nonetheless as shown in fig 3 although porosity reduction is around 50 the entrance domain of the fe0 prb loses over 90 of hydraulic conductivity after 10 years fig 4 shows the initial porosity distribution in the prb entrance domain and surrounding aquifer on a portion of a 2d section of the model domain y z section x 7 25 m and the porosity distribution after 5 and 10 years of operation for all four cases for case 1 the porosity of the entrance domain is highly heterogeneous because of the preferential flow in the heterogeneous aquifer and heterogeneously distributed mineral precipitation the heterogeneity in porosity increases with the operation time for case 2 the porosity of the medium within the entrance domain remains almost uniform through time except on the edges of the prb where larger porosity reduction occurs this larger porosity reduction is caused by the increased flux on the edges of the barrier as the initial hydraulic conductivity of the prb is higher than that of the aquifer for case 3 although the surrounding aquifer is heterogeneous the porosity distribution is homogeneous over time as the secondary mineral precipitation is homogeneously distributed within the barrier the simulation results of all cases differ substantially the maximum porosity reduction of case 1 0 37 after 10 years is larger than that of case 2 0 25 after 10 years the largest difference occurs in the zones with the highest initial darcy flux which are preferential flow paths nonetheless the porosity reduction for case 1 and case 3 are generally less than for case 2 except within preferential flow paths which is consistent with the average porosity reduction results shown in fig 3 for case 4 the simulated porosity distribution shows less heterogeneity compared to that of case 1 which indicates that the pea gravel zone can successfully equalize the groundwater flow and minimize the effect of preferential flow in the aquifer although the maximum porosity loss in case 4 0 32 after 10 years is smaller than that in case 1 the average porosity loss of the barrier in case 4 is greater than that in case 1 as shown in fig 3 3 1 2 the exit domain since the only consideration in the exit domain is the iron corrosion and it is assumed that the iron corrosion rate in mm y is not a function of the darcy flux the porosity and hydraulic conductivity reduction within the exit domain shown in fig 5 are the same for all studied cases as shown in the figure the porosity loss is 6 4 10 4 in a ten year period this result is consistent with the field measurement reported by wilkin et al 2003 which is less than 2 10 5 porosity reduction per year although the precipitation of iron corrosion products is the basic reason for porosity reduction in fe0 prbs hu 2020 the simulated porosity and hydraulic conductivity reductions caused by iron corrosion are relatively low the possible reason is the small iron corrosion rate used in this study which is derived from previous work on fe0 prbs jeen et al 2011 jeen et al 2007 mayer et al 2001 nonetheless the iron corrosion rate can vary over several orders of magnitude melchers and petersen 2018 and is especially dependent on the flow and chemical conditions if a larger iron corrosion rate is employed in a specific case the porosity reduction caused by iron corrosion can be enormous and have a significant influence on the long term performance of the prb 3 2 redistribution of groundwater flow and by passing fig 6 illustrates the initial horizontal darcy flux distribution in the prb and aquifer on a portion of the 2d section of the model domain y z section x 7 25 m and the darcy flux variations after 5 years and 10 years of operation for all cases the areas with higher flux caused by aquifer heterogeneity can be detected at the early stage of operation for case 1 and case 3 as the precipitation rate enhances with increasing the groundwater flux porosity reduction as well as hydraulic conductivity reduction of initially high flux zones are more significant which leads to the disappearance of these zones in case 1 and case 3 the decrease of fluid flux within initially high flux zones is more significant for case 1 than for case 3 in case 1 the initial high flux zone almost disappears after 10 years of operation for case 3 the flux within the initially high flux zones remains higher than within the surrounding area additionally for areas with initially low fluxes the simulated fluxes also decrease with time for case 3 however in case 1 simulations fluxes gradually increase in these areas moreover the generation of high fluxes right outside the prb is illustrated in fig 6 for case 1 and case 3 which indicates the by passing of groundwater flow around the prb case 1 shows a higher degree of by passing compared to case 3 for case 2 the preferential flow does not exist as the aquifer is homogeneous at the early stage high fluxes appear on the edges of the prb during the operation because of the precipitation caused by the high fluxes the porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the edges of the prb decrease rapidly which leads to the elimination of the relatively high flux zones for case 4 the initial high flux zones caused by aquifer heterogeneity cannot be clearly detected in the simulation results although a heterogeneous aquifer is considered the horizontal darcy flux becomes more evenly distributed over time fig 7 shows the temporal variation of average darcy flux within the fe0 prb for all cases as shown in fig 7 when the surrounding aquifer is homogeneous case 2 or the mineral precipitation is homogeneous case 3 the average flux within the prb continuously decreases in case 2 a more significant average flux reduction than in case 3 is observed after 10 years of operation on the contrary for the case with a pea gravel equalization zone in front of the prb case 4 the simulated average darcy flux within the fe0 prb keep increasing over time for case 1 in which the aquifer as well as the mineral precipitation are heterogeneous the average flux remains relatively stable over time except for the fluctuation between 1500 and 2000 days the different flux changes within the areas with low initial fluxes rates may explain the difference of average fluxes with time for case 1 and case 3 for case 3 the fluxes in all areas decrease over time which results in the continuously decreasing average flux for case 1 although the fluxes within the initially high flux zones decrease with time the fluxes increase in areas with initially low fluxes which yields a stable average flux for case 1 over time the total groundwater flow rate through the fe0 prb over time was simulated to investigate the occurrence of groundwater by passing the temporal percentage of the flow rate loss for the four cases is depicted in fig 8 the simulation shows that by passing occurs instantly after the prb installation for all cases after 10 years of simulation the total flow rate loss is 18 5 12 9 10 9 and 4 for case 1 case 2 case 3 and case 4 respectively the flow rate loss in case 1 is 30 and 41 larger than in case 2 and case 3 which means the by passing flow loss may be underestimated when porosity heterogeneity of the barrier is improperly considered case 2 and case 3 the flow rate loss in case 4 is remarkably smaller than that in case 1 which suggests that a pea gravel equalization zone can effectively minimize the amount of by passing flow during long term operation 3 3 contaminant plume migration fig 9 illustrates the contaminant plume migration over time for all cases for case 2 the homogeneous aquifer leads to a uniformly distributed groundwater flow the contaminant plume is spatially evenly distributed around the source since the size of the prb cannot cover the whole height of the model domain contaminant leakage passing around the prb occurs initially especially at the bottom of the prb after 10 years of simulation because of the reduction of hydraulic conductivity and porosity within the prb the untreated contaminant plume spreads along the direction of groundwater flow and migrates by passing the prb as shown in fig 9 for case 3 no significant contaminant plume can be detected after 10 years in case 1 since the prb covers the preferential flow paths caused by aquifer heterogeneity for the initial condition the prb can completely remove the contaminant plume nonetheless higher degrees of untreated contaminant plume spread and migration within the research domain can be seen after 10 years of operation in case 1 comparing to case 2 and case 3 for case 4 in which a pea gravel zone is added no evidence of contaminant plume leakage down gradient of the prb can be detected after ten years simulation 3 4 groundwater residence time fig 10 illustrates particle advective transport results at the cross section y 5 m of the model domain for case 1 and case 2 within the first 6 days of spreading since case 1 case 3 and case 4 assumed a similar heterogeneous aquifer the particle tracing results are identical within the first 6 days for those two cases as evident from fig 10 for case 1 the transport velocities of particles are significantly different particles with large velocity pass rapidly through the prb whereas those with low velocity scarcely migrate after 6 days in case 2 except for the high velocity particles at the edge of the prb released particles have an almost uniform transport velocity the time when each water particle leaves the prb was recorded and the simulated average residence times of particles within the fe0 prb over time are shown in fig 11 for the four cases the average residence times increase continuously after the installation of fe0 prb for case 2 in case 1 and case 3 the groundwater residence time remains almost constant for the first 4 and 10 years respectively and then increases no obvious reduction of groundwater residence time is observed for all cases which means that as long as the groundwater can flow through the prb there will be enough reaction time to remove the contaminant this finding is consistent with the field observation by wilkin et al wilkin et al 2018 who reported that a fe0 prb can continue to remove contaminants from groundwater after 22 years of operation for case 4 when a pea gravel zone is added in the model there is a minor decrease of average groundwater residence time between 4 and 6 years simulation which may be caused by the accelerated average darcy flux as shown in fig 7 the simulated average groundwater residence time of case 4 is smaller than that of case 1 4 summary and discussion the physical and chemical processes of contamiannts removal within the fe0 prb are very complex and related parameters such as porosity mineral precipitation rates are difficult to measure directly therefore a model fully validated based on field observations is currently hard to approach the model described in this study uses the well documented partial differential equations to simulate the groundwater flow and contamiant transport within the fe0 prb and its surrounding aquifer in order to make the model close to reality a 3 d high resolution aquifer outcrop analogue was utilized to implement aquifer heterogeneity we also set the parameters of the governing equations according to the literature and calibrated the values of constant head and precipitation rate in our model based on the field observations of sarr 2001 due to above considerations we believe that the established model in this study can reasonably simulate the reality in the field the simulation results show significant differences among the spatial porosity distributions inside the fe0 prb over time for all cases in case 1 the precipitation rate varies with the darcy flux the applied heterogeneous aquifer causes spatially variable fluxes within the fe0 prb which results in a highly heterogeneous porosity distribution within the barrier medium for case 2 the porosity of the barrier medium remains almost uniform over time because the aquifer is homogeneous as well as the groundwater flux the larger porosity reduction on the edge of the prb is caused by the accelerated flux as the initial hydraulic conductivity of the prb is higher than that of the aquifer higher fluxes lead to a larger precipitation rate increasing the porosity reduction for case 3 since a homogeneous porosity reduction is assumed the porosity of the barrier medium is homogeneous over time the difference of porosity distributions between case 1 case 2 and case 3 results in a different behaviour of groundwater flow for case 2 and case 3 the average darcy flux decreases continuously over time within the prb while the average darcy flux remains constant for case 1 the possible interpretation is that in case 1 although the fluxes within the initially high flux zones reduce rapidly fluxes within the areas with initially low fluxes increase over time the darcy flux distribution within the prb and the aquifer shows that for case 1 and case 3 an accelerated flow appears gradually outside of the prb which indicates the by passing of groundwater flow around the prb case 1 shows a higher degree of by passing compared to that of case 3 this implies an underestimation of by passing of a prb where the heterogeneity of the barrier medium is not taken into account this finding is consistent with the simulation results of flow rate loss over time for the three cases which show that if heterogeneity of the aquifer case 2 or heterogeneity of the barrier medium case 3 is not considered 30 or 41 of flow rate loss by passing in ten years simulation are underestimated the simulation results of case 1 show a significantly higher degree of contaminant plume spreading and migration over time compared to that of case 2 and case 3 therefore for the fe0 prb design and long term evaluation heterogeneity of the pore space is important for the evaluation of the long term plume migration where only a homogeneous surrounding aquifer is simulated or heterogeneous mineral precipitation is neglected the untreated contaminant plume spread over time may be underestimated particle tracing was applied to assess groundwater residence time within the prb for all cases the average residence time of particles tends to increase with time and no evidence of residence time reduction is observed in case 1 case 2 and case 3 therefore in this study the reduction of water residence time is not a concern of prb performance rather than the reduction of groundwater residence time by passing flow is the key factor influencing the long term performance of a continuous wall fe0 prb the effectiveness of a pea gravel equalization zone can be assessed by comparing the simulation results between case 1 and case 4 identical surrounding aquifer and mineral precipitation rates are utilized in case 1 and case 4 and the only difference between the two case studies is the addition of 1 m thick pea gravel equalization zone up gradient of the prb in case 4 the simulation results show that the porosity and horizontal darcy flux are more homogeneously distributed during operation in case 4 than in case 1 fig 4 and fig 6 the average porosity loss and the average darcy flux within the prb are larger when a pea gravel zone is considered it is consistent with the finding of li and benson 2010 who reported that pea gravel equalization zones result in an increasing average porosity reduction in their study the possible explanation for the increasing darcy flux and average porosity loss is that the highly permeable gravel zone can concentrate the groundwater flow in the surrounding area and constantly supply it to the prb due to the effect of the permeable gravel zone and less heterogeneous distributed barrier the simulation results show less flow rate loss and no contaminant plume leakage around the prb over ten years operation in case 4 thus it can be found in this study that the addition of a pea gravel equalization zone can effectively improve the long term performance of a continuous wall fe0 prb by equalizing the groundwater flow into the prb reducing the heterogeneity of the barrier medium and minimizing the by passing flow that may exist during long term operation however the particle tracking results show less average groundwater residence time within the prb when a pea gravel zone is added which may have a negative impact on contaminant removal in this case study the predicted results and findings are specific to a fe0 prb with a continuous wall design although the application of prbs with continuous wall design is the most common due to its low installation cost the fe0 prbs with this design may face some problems during long term operation e g the issue of by passing flow in this study in field applications a funnel and gate design can be utilized to eliminate the effect of by passing flow a funnel and gate design comprises funnels i e cut off walls around the barrier which can converge the contaminant plume to the prb thakur et al 2020 the cut off walls such as sheet piles and slurry walls have low permeability and can prevent the occurrence of the by passing flow around the prb obiri nyarko et al 2014 smith et al 2003 however the funnel and gate construction is more expensive than a continuous wall system which hampers its broad application prospects for projects with a limited budget in a real world scenario both the construction costs of a prb and its long term performance should be carefully considered in the design stage in addition the predicted effect described herein is based on case studies a more general investigation on the impact of porosity heterogeneity of the barrier considering statistics should be conducted in the future 5 conclusions a series of simulations were conducted using a 3 d groundwater flow and transport model to evaluate how porosity heterogeneity of the barrier medium may affect the groundwater flow and influence the long term performance of a continuous wall fe0 prb four cases were simulated where each considered 1 heterogeneous aquifer and heterogeneous mineral precipitation 2 homogeneous aquifer and heterogeneous mineral precipitation 3 heterogeneous aquifer and homogeneous mineral precipitation and 4 heterogeneous aquifer and heterogeneous mineral precipitation with a pea gravel equalization zone up gradient of the prb a 3 d high resolution aquifer outcrop analogue was adopted to set the hydraulic properties of the heterogeneous aquifer results from this study reveal the following preferential flow in heterogeneous aquifers and heterogeneously distributed mineral precipitation can cause a significant porosity heterogeneity of the barrier medium over time which results in a remarkable difference of groundwater flow behavior for all cases by passing occurs instantly after beginning of the operation if porosity heterogeneity of the barrier medium is not considered 30 41 of the by passing flow rates are underestimated in ten years simulation by passing is a key concern threatening the long term performance of a continuous wall fe0 prb for the transport of contaminants the long term contaminant plume migration is underrated if porosity heterogeneity of the barrier medium is neglected the residence time of groundwater within the fe0 prb increases over time obvious reduction of groundwater residence time is not observed in case studies installation of a pea gravel equalization zone can effectively improve the long term performance of a continuous wall fe0 prb by equalizing the groundwater flow into the prb reducing the heterogeneity of the barrier medium and minimizing the by passing flow that may exist during long term operation but the pea gravel equalization zone results in a smaller residence time that could have a negative effects on long term performance of a prb we recommend to properly consider the impact of porosity heterogeneity of the barrier on the prediction of a continuous wall fe0 prb longevity especially when the surrounding aquifer is highly heterogeneous the heterogeneity of the aquifer could form an unevenly porosity loss within the prb and cause a large amount of by passing flow during long term operation in addition the installation of a pea gravel equalization zone up gradient of the fe0 prb is recommended due to its effect to reduce the heterogeneity of the barrier and to minimize the by passing flow author contributions huichen yang established the numerical model and wrote the manuscript quan liu supervised the numerical model and manuscript writing rui hu supervised

3057,the overexploitation of groundwater gw and the associated environmental consequences are a cause for concern worldwide despite widespread unease about replenishing gw through for example water diversion schemes there have been few comprehensive impact assessments particularly for large urban areas that are undergoing rapid development to achieve regional goals using gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data we quantified the changes in gw storage from 2002 to 2017 and the reasons for the changes across a large scale urban agglomeration in china beijing tianjin hebei bth with a serious gw deficit we found that at the aggregate scale from 2002 to 2017 the gw storage over the entire bth declined at an average annual rate of 1 20 cm but the rate of decline decreased markedly after 2010 at the city scale the rates of decline in the gw storage between different cities varied but were strongly spatially correlated the spatial correlation pattern was inverted from north to south and corresponded with the unbalanced diversion of water between cities from the south to north water transfer project and was also affected by the policy of transferring industrial water from beijing to the central and southern plains of bth human related factors were the most significant drivers of the changes in gw storage and of these agricultural water consumption had the most effect on the changes in gw storage to protect gw supplies in large scale urban agglomerations regionally diverted water allocations should be coordinated with other development strategies such as the regional industry distribution and transfer policy and agricultural water use management keywords urban agglomeration groundwater depletion driving forces grace multiple scales 1 introduction there is great concern worldwide about the lack of water resources and the associated potential to limit socioeconomic development liu et al 2020 groundwater gw has emerged as the main source of fresh water because of excessive demand on the limited supply of surface water erler et al 2019 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b however with ongoing increases in the demand for water resources the gw supplies are experiencing unsustainable exploitation so that the demand exceeds recharge and gw storage is severely depleted over extensive areas with declines in the gw storage levels gw depression cones and land subsidence as evidence graaf et al 2019 panda and wahr 2016 long et al 2017 chen et al 2017 gong et al 2018 frappart and guillaume 2018 estimated that the annual gw depletion worldwide was approximately 4 14 1010 m3 year 1 between 1900 and 2008 the level of gw storage has dropped dramatically in many places worldwide and for example the gw storage levels have dropped by between 100 and 200 m in areas like the californian central valley in the us chen et al 2016 long et al 2020 in china gw overexploitation is particularly severe and covers a total area of more than 11 400 km2 and gw storage showed an annual decline of more than 50 mm in 2019 li et al 2021 the gw drawdown cones are particularly pronounced in intensively irrigated and urbanized regions such as the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration bth in the north china plain feng et al 2013 feng et al 2017 gong et al 2018 in recent decades there has been great concern about the depletion and about how to replenish the gw supplies by for example diverting water and controlling groundwater pumping huang et al 2015 long et al 2020 thus an understanding of how gw storage has changed over recent years is essential for effectively adjusting policies and decisions about gw protection han et al 2017 currently changes in gw storage are mainly investigated by combining local scale in situ data borehole data and satellite based grace gravity recovery and climate experiment data with hydrological models fu et al 2018 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b it is difficult to rely on in situ data from monitored boreholes for information about changes in gw storage across large spatial scales because of their sparse and uneven distribution ran et al 2013 koirala et al 2017 the grace satellite offers the opportunity to characterize the spatial and temporal changes in terrestrial water storage tws through very high precision measurements of changes in the gravity field the gw storage can be obtained by combining the grace measurements with data from other hydrological models such as gldas global land data assimilation system some studies have demonstrated that grace can be used to monitor changes in gw storage at the regional scale strassberg et al 2007 used grace satellite data to support their comparison of the seasonal variations in gw storage from grace satellite data with measurements of gw storage levels from the high plains aquifer usa and proved that grace could be used to monitor gw storage changes in semiarid regions rodell et al 2007 used grace data to supplement in situ monitoring data from a short period to investigate changes in gw across the mississippi river basin and its four major subbasins various researchers have demonstrated that the changes in the gw storage on the north china plain estimated by grace were strongly correlated more than 90 with in situ monitoring data gong et al 2018 shu et al 2018 li et al 2018a wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b proved that the quantitative results from grace were sufficiently reliable and robust to support evaluations of drought in the north china plain gong et al 2018 demonstrated that grace data were correlated with land subsidence across the north china plain while these studies have been useful in proving that grace can be used to estimate changes in gw storage most have focused on non urban watersheds and there are few studies of how gw storage has changed across densely populated urban areas where concentrated anthropogenic activities have considerable effects on gw levels liu et al 2019 changes in gw storage are generally related to climate change and human activities chang and bonnette 2016 fu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 some studies have investigated how gw changes in response to climate change or anthropogenic activities for instance sattari et al 2018 found that overexploitation of gw and decreases in precipitation and successive long term droughts were the main reasons for the decline in gw levels in watersheds on the ardebil plain in northwestern iran ojeda olivares et al 2019 identified that land use change and population growth were the main drivers of the gw level declines observed in the central valley basin of oaxaca mexico moreover some researchers reported that gw changes were strongly influenced by agricultural irrigation industrial production and engineering approaches such as water diversion schemes rojas et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 for example wu et al 2020 found that the gw depletion in a farming area in pingluo county china was mainly related to crop irrigation long et al 2020 indicated that engineering approaches such as water diversions effectively reduced the gw depletion in beijing china groundwater supplies in large scale urban agglomerations composed of several inter connected cities are subject to multiple stresses and few researchers have carried out integrated analyses that address the range of influences on gw storage chen et al 2017 to address this need we therefore carried out a comprehensive analysis of changes in gw storage and the main drivers of change in a large scale urban area we quantified the changes in gw storage and identified the drivers of change at different spatial scales for the bth an urban agglomeration in china using grace satellite data for the period from 2002 to 2017 we specifically explored how the gw storage changed at regional and subregional scales in the bth from 2002 to 2017 whether the changes in gw showed spatial variation and what the key drivers of change in gw were we first quantified the annual average changes in gw in the bth at both the aggregate and city scales we then assessed the relationships between the gw variations in different cities finally we investigated the forces driving the gw changes this study will provide important insights that will support the setting of management targets for gw in the bth and for reconciling the relationship between socioeconomic development and gw conservation 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the bth is the political economic and cultural centre of china it comprises 13 cities including the megacities of beijing and tianjin and 11 prefecture level cities in hebei province fig 1 the bth covers an area of 216 000 km2 and has a total population of approximately 110 million it has 8 of the population and 11 of the economy of china but is supported by 2 3 and 1 of the nation s territory and water resources respectively the bth in the haihe river basin on the north china plain faces the most severe water shortages in china due to natural conditions and high demand at the end of 2017 the total available water resources in the bth amounted to 18 11 billion m3 which accounted for 0 63 of china s water resources of this total amount gw storage was estimated at 14 22 billion m3 which was 1 71 of china s total gw storage severe water shortages in the bth mean that there is now a drastic gw deficit su et al 2021 reported that areas in the north china plain with a subsidence rate greater than 5 mm yr covered 108 700 km2 and that areas suffering severe settling with subsidence rates greater than 20 mm yr covered 41 800 km2 from 1990 to 2010 the annual subsidence in some areas reached 160 mm while this overexploitation of gw has serious implications for ecological and water security it also restricts sustainable development bao zou 2018 the south to north water diversion project was implemented in 2014 to alleviate the water shortage crisis in the bth and had recharged 880 million m3 of gw storage by 2018 webber et al 2017 hai et al 2018 however the water demand is still higher than the water supply and the water deficit across the entire bth has been estimated at 7 billion m3 therefore a comprehensive analysis of the spatial and temporal changes in gw storage in the bth and the forces driving them will help to support the development and implementation of initiatives to control the gw deficit 2 2 evaluation of grace derived changes in gw storage the grace mission launched in march 2002 by nasa and das deutsche zentrum für luft und raumfahrt dlr provides monthly gravity field solutions in the form of spherical harmonic coefficients that have been widely used to provide quantitative estimates of vertically integrated terrestrial water storage tws data from grace can be obtained from the center for space research s tellus website https www2 csr utexas edu grace in this study we used 183 monthly tws anomalies twsas from april 2002 to june 2017 measured at a resolution of 0 25 0 25 from the grace rl06 mascon note that each monthly twsa represents the deviation for that month relative to a baseline temporal average from january 2004 to december 2009 save et al 2016 save 2019 because of some problems with the grace satellite sensor there were no data for 20 months of the study period the missing values were therefore interpolated by averaging the values of the two months before and after the month without data long et al 2015 yin et al 2018 the gldas is a land surface modelling system that integrates satellite and ground based data products to drive advanced simulations for climate and hydrologic investigations at monthly time intervals at a 0 25 0 25 resolution rodell et al 2004 panda and wahr 2016 in this study the modelled soil moisture and snow water equivalent were obtained from gldas 2 noah table 1 for the period from april 2002 to june 2017 and so corresponded with the time span of the grace data the data were subtracted from the baseline average to obtain the corresponding terrestrial water component anomalies to ensure consistency the baselines of the gldas 2 noah model and the grace data were the same ren et al 2013 feng et al 2017 generally the tws is a measure of the total water content in surface stores soil layers ice including snow gw reservoirs and biomass negligible in most cases at monthly or longer timescales changes in soil moisture storage and gw storage account for the majority of tws changes in the bth region feng et al 2013 ren et al 2013 huang et al 2015 snow water storage and soil moisture storage can also be obtained from gldas noah so snow water storage was also considered in this study the gw storage anomalies gwsa i e the deviations from the baseline mean were derived by subtracting the snow water storage anomalies swsa and the soil moisture storage anomalies smsa simulated by hydrological models from the grace tws anomalies according to the principle of the regional land water balance eq 1 the gw storage change gwsc can be estimated via the backward difference based on the gwsa eq 2 1 gwsa t w s a s m s a s w s a 2 g w s c i where gwsc i is the change in gw storage in month i which is usually expressed as the equivalent water thickness cm 2 3 verifying the accuracy from the observed gw table depth the estimated gwsa was verified using the pearson correlation coefficient this approach provided an indicator of the cross correlation between the grace based values and the in situ observations of the gw water level chen et al 2019 we obtained data from 2005 to 2016 from 90 complete national level monitoring stations in the bth fig 1 from the china geological environmental monitoring institute to be consistent with grace deviations from the baseline mean were represented by anomalies the average anomaly of the gw level at all the stations was taken as the observation of the year we verified the accuracy of the gw changes derived from grace by comparing with the observation data to translate the observed changes in the gw table into changes in gw storage the specific yield was determined with eq 3 3 g w s c δ h s y where δh is the change in the gw depth and sy is the specific yield the specific yield is the water release capacity of the aquifer which represents the amount of water released under the action of gravity when the phreatic level drops by a unit of length per unit area the specific yield has a value between 0 and 1 we used the specific yield as the average specific yield of the basin with a reference value of 0 066 ran et al 2013 2 4 analysis of spatial relationships we analysed the spatial correlations with the spatial autocorrelation method to detect whether the changes in gw storage in the bth were spatially related spatial autocorrelations can be evaluated at global and local levels the global moran s i statistic was used to measure whether the change in the gw storage change was spatially correlated across the whole bth region this metric detects the similarity of the changes in gw storage in adjacent cities but cannot show if the clustering is for high or low changes in gw storage the global moran s i can be computed as eq 4 4 i n i 1 n j 1 n w i j i 1 n j 1 n w i j z i z j i 1 n z i 2 where z i is the deviation in the attribute of sample i gw storage change from its average value x i x wij is the spatial weight between the elements i and j and n is the total number of samples the moran s i index ranges from 1 to 1 where i 0 indicates clustered spatial patterns of gw storage change i 0 indicates a random distribution and i 0 indicates dispersion moran s i is usually transformed to a z score to determine if the observed autocorrelation is statistically significant feng et al 2019 the z score and p value indicate the spatial autocorrelation level and the corresponding significance level respectively when p 0 05 it can be assumed that the spatial distribution is not random and the z score is 1 96 or greater than 1 96 at this confidence interval level the zi score is calculated as follows 5 z i 1 e i e i 2 e i 2 where e i 1 n 1 at the local level the local indicator of spatial association lisa was used to assess whether there was a spatial correlation between the changes in the gw storage for a city and the surrounding cities this indicator classifies patterns into four groups namely high high hh high low hl low high lh and low low ll hh represents significant local spatial auto correlated clusters consisting of cities with low reductions in gw storage known as hot spots ll represents significant clusters consisting of cities with high reductions in gw storage known as cold spots hl represents a city with a high change in gw storage surrounded by cities with a low change in gw storage while lh represents a city with a low change in gw storage surrounded by cities with a high change in gw storage the lisa index is calculated as follows 6 l i s a i x i x σ 2 j 1 n w i j x i x i j where lisa i is the local moran index of sample i σ2 is the total variance in all samples and n xi x and wij are the same as eq 6 2 5 statistical analysis of factors driving changes in gw 2 5 1 selecting the factors driving change after referring to previous related studies we selected a range of factors mainly related to anthropogenic activities and climate change which may have contributed to changes in gw in the bth zhang et al 2017 chen et al 2017 hu et al 2019 we established a two level index system table 2 at level one we developed four indexes to describe demographic economic water consumption and natural factors individually from these indexes we identified 13 subfactors for level 2 table 2 the statistical data for these indicators were collected from the economy yearbook and the water resources bulletin we assembled a data set that spanned the period from 2002 to 2017 we used the annual mean city based precipitation measured in mm as the indicator then to be consistent with the other indicators e g the water consumption factors surface water resources the annual mean city based precipitation in mm was converted to the annual mean city based precipitation volume by multiplying by the area of the city the indicators had different domain values so to ensure they could be compared we used the min max normalization method to transfer every indicator from its domain to a specific range between 0 and 1 2 5 2 pearson correlations and grey relational analysis the factors driving change in gw storage were investigated using pearson correlations and grey relational analysis gra we explored the correlations between the changes in gw storage and the factors driving the change from the pearson correlation coefficients and then determined which factors had statistically significant impacts on the changes in gw storage we used gra to show the interrelationships between the changes in gw storage and multiple influencing factors gra is based on geometrical mathematics and complies with the principles of normality symmetry entirety and proximity thus gra can show similarities in the development of trends of different subsystems we applied gra to calculate the degree of correlation between the changes in gw storage and the drivers and identified the ranks from the magnitude of the effects we applied the procedure in a series of steps as follows 1 we determined the changes in the gw storage as the reference sequence x0 x0 1 x0 2 x0 n and used the 13 influential factors as the comparative sequences xi xi 1 xi 2 xi n i 1 2 13 2 we normalized the values of the original sequences onto the same scale to eliminate errors caused by different dimensions we then used the min max normalization method as follows 7 x i k x i k m i n x i k max x i k min x i k 3 we calculated the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of the comparative sequence and reference sequences 8 δx i k x i k x 0 k k 1 2 n 4 we calculated the grey relation coefficient 9 y i k m i n i m i n k δ x i k ρ m a x i m a x k δ x i k δ x i k ρ m a x i m a x k δ x i k where yi k is the grey relational coefficient minmin δxi k is the minimum value of the second level maxmax δxi k is the maximum value of the second level and ρ is the distinguishing coefficient which is generally between 0 and 1 and is usually 0 5 liu et al 2013 5 we obtained the grey relational grade 10 y i 1 n k 1 n y i k where y i is the grey relational grade n is the number of performances which for this study is the number of years spanning from 2002 to 2017 grey relational grade represents the level of correlation between reference and comparability sequences the larger grey relational grade the stronger correlation between the comparability and reference sequences we investigated the relationships between the gw storage and the drivers of change at the two spatial scales with gra for the whole bth urban agglomeration we conducted the gra between the total changes in gw storage in the bth and the corresponding drivers at the city level we assessed the changes in the gw storage of each city within the bth and the corresponding drivers with gra 3 results 3 1 verifying the grace based gw estimates with in situ observations the changes in the gw storage estimated from the grace data fitted well with the in situ monitoring data the highly significant correlation of 0 95 shows that there was good agreement between the grace based equivalent water thickness of the groundwater estimates and the in situ gw level change observations collected from monitoring wells in the bth region from 2005 to 2016 figs 2 3 3 2 spatial and temporal changes in gw storage in the bth 3 2 1 regional scale changes in gw storage overall the gw storage in the bth declined continuously from 2002 to 2007 at an average annual of 1 20 0 06 cm fig 4 a however the rate of decrease varied between years fig 4 b from 2004 to 2009 the rate of decrease increased and ranged from 0 2 cm a to 1 3 cm a after 2010 the rate of decrease slowed obviously but then increased after approximately 2014 fig 4 b it is worth noting that the derivative of the fitting curve before 2004 and after 2014 was biased because of the boundary effect that resulted when calculating the derivative of the fitting curve for gw storage change 3 2 2 city scale changes in gw storage the gw storage in all the cities in the bth decreased obviously from 2002 to 2017 but varied between different cities fig 5 a overall the declines in gw storage were highest in the cities in the south of the bth and were lower in the north eastern cities over the study period from 2002 to 2017 the gw depletion was highest in the southern part of the bth where xingtai shijiazhuang and handan experienced decreases of 29 88 29 04 and 28 80 cm in the gw levels respectively the declines in tangshan and qinhuangdao at 10 cm were relatively small the rates of change in the gw storage fig 5 b were greatest in handan in the south of the bth 1 93 cm a followed by xingtai 1 81 cm a and shijiazhuang 1 78 cm a in contrast the rates of decrease in the gw storage were 0 75 cm a in tangshan qinhuangdao and tianjin in the north of the bth 3 3 spatial correlations between the changes in gw storage in the bth at the regional level the changes in the gw storage of the bth tended to be positively correlated which shows that the changes in the gw storage across the entire bth were spatially aggregated table 3 at the city level all the local moran s i values from 2002 to 2017 were greater than 0 meaning that the changes in the gw storage in the different cities within the bth were significantly correlated fig 6 see table 4 the changes in the gw storage fell into two main categories hh and ll where a high h value represents a low reduction in gw storage and a low l value represents a high reduction in gw storage fig 5 before 2008 the central and southern regions shijiazhuang and hengshui was a hot spot with relatively low reductions in gw while the northeast chengde and tangshan was a cold spot with relatively large reductions in gw as an example the average annual reduction in gw in the hot spots in southern part of the bth e g shijiazhuang hengshui and xingtai from 2002 to 2007 was 0 34 cm but was 8 06 cm in the northern cold spots e g chengde qinhuangdao and beijing the hh and ll clustering patterns were inverted in a north south direction from 2002 to 2017 after 2011 the spatial distribution was reversed and the hot spots were concentrated in the northeast chengde tangshan and tianjin and cold spots were concentrated in the south xingtai for instance the gw in the hot spots in the northeast bth and in the cold spots in the south had annual average decreases of 0 44 and 7 48 cm respectively 3 4 drivers of changes in gw storage in the bth social and economic factors had significant effects on the changes in the gw storage in the bth at the regional scale there were significant negative correlations between the changes in the gw storage and the gdp of primary production total water consumption and agricultural water consumption p 0 01 at the city scale the changes in gw storage were significantly and negatively correlated with the population social economy and water consumption p 0 05 the natural drivers precipitation and surface water were generally negatively correlated with the gw storage changes and the correlations between the gw storage changes and precipitation and surface water in beijing and surface water in tangshan were significantly and negatively correlated p 0 05 the gra showed that water consumption was the strongest influence on the changes in the gw storage table 5 the six factors that were most relevant for changes in gw storage at both the regional and city scales are presented in table 5 at the regional or aggregate scale agricultural water consumption wa and total water consumption wt were the strongest influences agricultural water consumption wa was also the primary influence in most cities but industrial water consumption wi was the main influence in tianjin and tangshan moreover the changes in the gw storage were influenced by the total water consumption wt industrial water consumption wi and domestic water consumption wd other factors such as the total population pt urban population pu primary gdp gpri precipitation np and surface water resources ns also impacted on the changes in gw storage in some cities table 5 for instance the three most important drivers of changes in gw storage in beijing and tianjin were agricultural water consumption wa industrial water consumption wi and the total water consumption wt 4 discussion 4 1 sustained pressure on gw depletion during the development of large scale urban agglomerations storage of gw declined continuously over the entire bth region indicating that the development of large scale urban agglomerations placed sustained pressure on gw supplies the gw storage has declined because the water demand was higher than the natural surface water supply to the bth and gw supplies were exploited to compensate for water shortages for example until 2014 the gw supply accounted for 70 of the total water supply in the bth and there was already severe land subsidence the area of land subsidence across the bth almost doubled from 40 000 km2 to more than 70 000 km2 from 2000 to 2020 however the rate of decrease in gw storage slowed after 2010 suggesting that the stress on gw depletion had been mitigated and that the solutions put in place to restore depleted gw stores such as reducing gw extraction and water diversion were effective for example gw withdrawals across the entire bth decreased from 4 76 km3 in 2002 to 4 28 km3 in 2016 water supplied by diversion schemes such as the luanhe to tianjin and huang to tianjin water diversions replenished some of the depleted gw stores given the sustained stress on the already depleted gw supplies across the bth decision makers urgently need to take action to protect gw there were clear differences in the changes in gw storage between cities suggesting that the impacts on gw varied by city for instance the gw storage in xingtai and handan in hebei province fell by almost twice as much as in beijing and three times as much as in tianjin these differences reflect the variations in the gw demand between different cities for example from 2003 to 2017 the proportions of the total water consumption in beijing and tianjin comprising gw decreased significantly from 73 and 34 and from to 42 and 17 respectively while the proportion of the total water supply from gw in cities in hebei province decreased from 82 to 68 indirectly the impacts on gw also varied because of differences in the amounts of water allocated from diversion schemes to different cities different cities in the bth have different water allocations from the diversion schemes for instance the south north water diversion provided 1 05 billion m3 of water to beijing 0 816 billion m3 to tianjin and 3 billion m3 to 8 cities in hebei from 2008 to 2014 while other cities including zhangjiakou chengde and qinhuangdao in hebei province were not assigned any water therefore regional strategies or actions to protect gw across areas like the bth should take account of city specific variations 4 2 implications of the spatial variations in the changes in gw storage across the bth the spatial clustering of cold and hot spots of gw storage changes in the bth suggest that the gw exploitation of one city might also affect surrounding cities with regionally coordinated development goals cities within urban agglomerations interact and collaborate with each other this inter city collaboration in socioeconomic development leads to spatially similar effects on gw for example before 2007 we found that the cities in the north of the bth were cold spots reflecting the huge water demands of beijing and tianjin that accelerated the gw depletion and intensified the stress on the gw of the surrounding cities in hebei province the cities in hebei especially those around beijing and tianjin were required to meet their own development needs and supply 2 billion m3 of water for production and living per year for beijing and tianjin zhang 2018 it has been reported that beijing and tianjin depend on the cities in hebei for 93 7 of their domestic water moreover cities with high water consumption such as qinhuangdao received 393 million m3 of water annually from tangshan a neighbouring city during the period from 2002 to 2007 the annual gw depletion in the northern cold spots was 8 06 cm the southern cities developed more slowly than the northern cities and consequently there were relatively small changes in the gw depletion in the southern hot spots for instance the annual gw depletion in the southern hot spots which amounted to 0 34 cm from 2002 to 2007 was smaller than the depletion in the north it is noteworthy that the cold spots in the north became hot spots and the hot spots in the south became cold spots which highlights changes in the interactions between cities thereby altering the spatial relationships in the changes in gw storage between cities these shifts may reflect the outcomes from two regional strategies the east and middle routes of the south to north water diversion project opened in 2008 this project transfers large quantities of water to beijing and tianjin and has alleviated the serious water shortages in these two cities zhao et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 following this the cold spots in the northern cities became hot spots in 2011 for instance the implementation of the south to north water diversion meant that there was less demand on gw in beijing and tianjin and there was also less pressure on the gw withdrawals in the surrounding cities consequently the hot spots of gw storage changed low reductions in gw accordingly the annual gw level decline in the northern hot spot cities was 0 44 cm over the period from 2008 to 2017 at this time some of the southern cities became cold spots high reductions in gw the annual gw level decline in the southern cold spots at 7 48 cm was greater than the decline in the northern hot spots this switch mainly reflects the industrial transfer policy and the associated transfer of the water demand from beijing to the central and southern plains of hebei province zhao et al 2017 for example the industrial area in beijing decreased by 91 57 from 2007 to 2015 while the industrial area in the central and southern plain areas of the bth increased by 45 95 tian et al 2019 in addition the water use efficiency of cities in the south of the bth was lower than that in beijing for example despite improvements in the water efficiency use of all the cities the water efficiency was almost 7 times higher in beijing than in hengshui in the south of the bth in 2017 therefore to achieve integrated water resource protection across large scale urban agglomerations regionally specific policies need to consider the interactions between different cities 4 3 effects of natural and anthropogenic factors in the bth on groundwater we found that human activities were the most significant influence on gw storage at both the regional and city scales in the bth this is consistent with the findings from other studies and suggests that the changes in gw storage were shaped by anthropogenic activities e g agricultural irrigation industrial production and domestic water supplies li et al 2018b thus human activities should be managed carefully to reduce the impacts on gw the water demand population and economic output impacted significantly on the changes in gw storage while agricultural water consumption was the primary driver of changes in gw storage at the aggregate scale and in most cities this indicates that as large scale urban agglomerations have developed agricultural development in the bth has competed with urban development for water wang et al 2018 for instance from 2001 to 2017 primary industries accounted for on average 7 17 of the total gdp of the bth but the agricultural water use dominated the water use structure and accounted for on average 61 88 of the total water demand for the bth therefore agriculture should be managed to reduce the stress on water resources in recent decades the demand for agricultural water has decreased as various solutions have been implemented to improve the efficiency in agricultural water use in the bth for instance the proportion of water used for agriculture in the bth decreased from 67 16 to 56 48 from 2001 to 2017 while the agricultural water consumption per 10 000 rmb of the gdp decreased from 1568 m3 in 2001 to 402 m3 in 2017 however the water use efficiency varied widely between different cities in the bth with a difference of approximately 2 71 fold between the highest and lowest agricultural water consumption until 2017 this suggests that there is great potential to improve the agricultural water use efficiency therefore actions at both the regional and city scales should be coordinated and implemented there were some limitations in this study first because of data availability we neglected some factors that may have affected the changes in gw such as surface landforms underground infrastructure and sewer leakages foster 2001 han et al 2017 future studies should consider more potential influences on the changes in gw storage to gain improved insights into the drivers of change while the changes in the gw storage change from the grace satellite data were satisfactory at the regional scale the precision of the estimations of the changes of gw storage at smaller spatial scales may be low data from field investigations can be combined with the grace data to improve the accuracy of the small scale estimates 5 conclusions for dense urban areas with gw overexploitation scientists and decision makers face the challenge of determining how to utilize gw sustainably in dense urban areas where gw stores are overexploited in this study we quantitatively assessed the changes in gw storage across a large scale urban agglomeration in china at regional and city scales using grace data we also examined the spatial correlations in the changes in gw storage and identified the main causes of the changes we found that the grace data supported our assessment of changes in gw storage in the bth there were significant spatial correlations between the changes in the gw storage between the cities and the cities were affected by regional water diversion schemes and other interactions of the influences on the gw storage changes across the bth and in most cities the correlation was strongest between the agricultural water demand and the gw storage changes thus to protect gw in the bth allocations from water diversion schemes and agricultural water should be carefully managed and agricultural water use management at the city scale should be tailored to regionally coordinated development goals the relationships between different cities should be considered when deciding how to protect gw supplies in large scale urban agglomerations the results from this study supplement the findings of previous studies on gw storage changes and the drivers of change and may also contribute to promoting synergistic planning and management of water resource allocations at the large scale in similar regions credit authorship

3057,the overexploitation of groundwater gw and the associated environmental consequences are a cause for concern worldwide despite widespread unease about replenishing gw through for example water diversion schemes there have been few comprehensive impact assessments particularly for large urban areas that are undergoing rapid development to achieve regional goals using gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite data we quantified the changes in gw storage from 2002 to 2017 and the reasons for the changes across a large scale urban agglomeration in china beijing tianjin hebei bth with a serious gw deficit we found that at the aggregate scale from 2002 to 2017 the gw storage over the entire bth declined at an average annual rate of 1 20 cm but the rate of decline decreased markedly after 2010 at the city scale the rates of decline in the gw storage between different cities varied but were strongly spatially correlated the spatial correlation pattern was inverted from north to south and corresponded with the unbalanced diversion of water between cities from the south to north water transfer project and was also affected by the policy of transferring industrial water from beijing to the central and southern plains of bth human related factors were the most significant drivers of the changes in gw storage and of these agricultural water consumption had the most effect on the changes in gw storage to protect gw supplies in large scale urban agglomerations regionally diverted water allocations should be coordinated with other development strategies such as the regional industry distribution and transfer policy and agricultural water use management keywords urban agglomeration groundwater depletion driving forces grace multiple scales 1 introduction there is great concern worldwide about the lack of water resources and the associated potential to limit socioeconomic development liu et al 2020 groundwater gw has emerged as the main source of fresh water because of excessive demand on the limited supply of surface water erler et al 2019 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b however with ongoing increases in the demand for water resources the gw supplies are experiencing unsustainable exploitation so that the demand exceeds recharge and gw storage is severely depleted over extensive areas with declines in the gw storage levels gw depression cones and land subsidence as evidence graaf et al 2019 panda and wahr 2016 long et al 2017 chen et al 2017 gong et al 2018 frappart and guillaume 2018 estimated that the annual gw depletion worldwide was approximately 4 14 1010 m3 year 1 between 1900 and 2008 the level of gw storage has dropped dramatically in many places worldwide and for example the gw storage levels have dropped by between 100 and 200 m in areas like the californian central valley in the us chen et al 2016 long et al 2020 in china gw overexploitation is particularly severe and covers a total area of more than 11 400 km2 and gw storage showed an annual decline of more than 50 mm in 2019 li et al 2021 the gw drawdown cones are particularly pronounced in intensively irrigated and urbanized regions such as the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration bth in the north china plain feng et al 2013 feng et al 2017 gong et al 2018 in recent decades there has been great concern about the depletion and about how to replenish the gw supplies by for example diverting water and controlling groundwater pumping huang et al 2015 long et al 2020 thus an understanding of how gw storage has changed over recent years is essential for effectively adjusting policies and decisions about gw protection han et al 2017 currently changes in gw storage are mainly investigated by combining local scale in situ data borehole data and satellite based grace gravity recovery and climate experiment data with hydrological models fu et al 2018 wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b it is difficult to rely on in situ data from monitored boreholes for information about changes in gw storage across large spatial scales because of their sparse and uneven distribution ran et al 2013 koirala et al 2017 the grace satellite offers the opportunity to characterize the spatial and temporal changes in terrestrial water storage tws through very high precision measurements of changes in the gravity field the gw storage can be obtained by combining the grace measurements with data from other hydrological models such as gldas global land data assimilation system some studies have demonstrated that grace can be used to monitor changes in gw storage at the regional scale strassberg et al 2007 used grace satellite data to support their comparison of the seasonal variations in gw storage from grace satellite data with measurements of gw storage levels from the high plains aquifer usa and proved that grace could be used to monitor gw storage changes in semiarid regions rodell et al 2007 used grace data to supplement in situ monitoring data from a short period to investigate changes in gw across the mississippi river basin and its four major subbasins various researchers have demonstrated that the changes in the gw storage on the north china plain estimated by grace were strongly correlated more than 90 with in situ monitoring data gong et al 2018 shu et al 2018 li et al 2018a wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b proved that the quantitative results from grace were sufficiently reliable and robust to support evaluations of drought in the north china plain gong et al 2018 demonstrated that grace data were correlated with land subsidence across the north china plain while these studies have been useful in proving that grace can be used to estimate changes in gw storage most have focused on non urban watersheds and there are few studies of how gw storage has changed across densely populated urban areas where concentrated anthropogenic activities have considerable effects on gw levels liu et al 2019 changes in gw storage are generally related to climate change and human activities chang and bonnette 2016 fu et al 2018 hu et al 2019 some studies have investigated how gw changes in response to climate change or anthropogenic activities for instance sattari et al 2018 found that overexploitation of gw and decreases in precipitation and successive long term droughts were the main reasons for the decline in gw levels in watersheds on the ardebil plain in northwestern iran ojeda olivares et al 2019 identified that land use change and population growth were the main drivers of the gw level declines observed in the central valley basin of oaxaca mexico moreover some researchers reported that gw changes were strongly influenced by agricultural irrigation industrial production and engineering approaches such as water diversion schemes rojas et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 for example wu et al 2020 found that the gw depletion in a farming area in pingluo county china was mainly related to crop irrigation long et al 2020 indicated that engineering approaches such as water diversions effectively reduced the gw depletion in beijing china groundwater supplies in large scale urban agglomerations composed of several inter connected cities are subject to multiple stresses and few researchers have carried out integrated analyses that address the range of influences on gw storage chen et al 2017 to address this need we therefore carried out a comprehensive analysis of changes in gw storage and the main drivers of change in a large scale urban area we quantified the changes in gw storage and identified the drivers of change at different spatial scales for the bth an urban agglomeration in china using grace satellite data for the period from 2002 to 2017 we specifically explored how the gw storage changed at regional and subregional scales in the bth from 2002 to 2017 whether the changes in gw showed spatial variation and what the key drivers of change in gw were we first quantified the annual average changes in gw in the bth at both the aggregate and city scales we then assessed the relationships between the gw variations in different cities finally we investigated the forces driving the gw changes this study will provide important insights that will support the setting of management targets for gw in the bth and for reconciling the relationship between socioeconomic development and gw conservation 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the bth is the political economic and cultural centre of china it comprises 13 cities including the megacities of beijing and tianjin and 11 prefecture level cities in hebei province fig 1 the bth covers an area of 216 000 km2 and has a total population of approximately 110 million it has 8 of the population and 11 of the economy of china but is supported by 2 3 and 1 of the nation s territory and water resources respectively the bth in the haihe river basin on the north china plain faces the most severe water shortages in china due to natural conditions and high demand at the end of 2017 the total available water resources in the bth amounted to 18 11 billion m3 which accounted for 0 63 of china s water resources of this total amount gw storage was estimated at 14 22 billion m3 which was 1 71 of china s total gw storage severe water shortages in the bth mean that there is now a drastic gw deficit su et al 2021 reported that areas in the north china plain with a subsidence rate greater than 5 mm yr covered 108 700 km2 and that areas suffering severe settling with subsidence rates greater than 20 mm yr covered 41 800 km2 from 1990 to 2010 the annual subsidence in some areas reached 160 mm while this overexploitation of gw has serious implications for ecological and water security it also restricts sustainable development bao zou 2018 the south to north water diversion project was implemented in 2014 to alleviate the water shortage crisis in the bth and had recharged 880 million m3 of gw storage by 2018 webber et al 2017 hai et al 2018 however the water demand is still higher than the water supply and the water deficit across the entire bth has been estimated at 7 billion m3 therefore a comprehensive analysis of the spatial and temporal changes in gw storage in the bth and the forces driving them will help to support the development and implementation of initiatives to control the gw deficit 2 2 evaluation of grace derived changes in gw storage the grace mission launched in march 2002 by nasa and das deutsche zentrum für luft und raumfahrt dlr provides monthly gravity field solutions in the form of spherical harmonic coefficients that have been widely used to provide quantitative estimates of vertically integrated terrestrial water storage tws data from grace can be obtained from the center for space research s tellus website https www2 csr utexas edu grace in this study we used 183 monthly tws anomalies twsas from april 2002 to june 2017 measured at a resolution of 0 25 0 25 from the grace rl06 mascon note that each monthly twsa represents the deviation for that month relative to a baseline temporal average from january 2004 to december 2009 save et al 2016 save 2019 because of some problems with the grace satellite sensor there were no data for 20 months of the study period the missing values were therefore interpolated by averaging the values of the two months before and after the month without data long et al 2015 yin et al 2018 the gldas is a land surface modelling system that integrates satellite and ground based data products to drive advanced simulations for climate and hydrologic investigations at monthly time intervals at a 0 25 0 25 resolution rodell et al 2004 panda and wahr 2016 in this study the modelled soil moisture and snow water equivalent were obtained from gldas 2 noah table 1 for the period from april 2002 to june 2017 and so corresponded with the time span of the grace data the data were subtracted from the baseline average to obtain the corresponding terrestrial water component anomalies to ensure consistency the baselines of the gldas 2 noah model and the grace data were the same ren et al 2013 feng et al 2017 generally the tws is a measure of the total water content in surface stores soil layers ice including snow gw reservoirs and biomass negligible in most cases at monthly or longer timescales changes in soil moisture storage and gw storage account for the majority of tws changes in the bth region feng et al 2013 ren et al 2013 huang et al 2015 snow water storage and soil moisture storage can also be obtained from gldas noah so snow water storage was also considered in this study the gw storage anomalies gwsa i e the deviations from the baseline mean were derived by subtracting the snow water storage anomalies swsa and the soil moisture storage anomalies smsa simulated by hydrological models from the grace tws anomalies according to the principle of the regional land water balance eq 1 the gw storage change gwsc can be estimated via the backward difference based on the gwsa eq 2 1 gwsa t w s a s m s a s w s a 2 g w s c i where gwsc i is the change in gw storage in month i which is usually expressed as the equivalent water thickness cm 2 3 verifying the accuracy from the observed gw table depth the estimated gwsa was verified using the pearson correlation coefficient this approach provided an indicator of the cross correlation between the grace based values and the in situ observations of the gw water level chen et al 2019 we obtained data from 2005 to 2016 from 90 complete national level monitoring stations in the bth fig 1 from the china geological environmental monitoring institute to be consistent with grace deviations from the baseline mean were represented by anomalies the average anomaly of the gw level at all the stations was taken as the observation of the year we verified the accuracy of the gw changes derived from grace by comparing with the observation data to translate the observed changes in the gw table into changes in gw storage the specific yield was determined with eq 3 3 g w s c δ h s y where δh is the change in the gw depth and sy is the specific yield the specific yield is the water release capacity of the aquifer which represents the amount of water released under the action of gravity when the phreatic level drops by a unit of length per unit area the specific yield has a value between 0 and 1 we used the specific yield as the average specific yield of the basin with a reference value of 0 066 ran et al 2013 2 4 analysis of spatial relationships we analysed the spatial correlations with the spatial autocorrelation method to detect whether the changes in gw storage in the bth were spatially related spatial autocorrelations can be evaluated at global and local levels the global moran s i statistic was used to measure whether the change in the gw storage change was spatially correlated across the whole bth region this metric detects the similarity of the changes in gw storage in adjacent cities but cannot show if the clustering is for high or low changes in gw storage the global moran s i can be computed as eq 4 4 i n i 1 n j 1 n w i j i 1 n j 1 n w i j z i z j i 1 n z i 2 where z i is the deviation in the attribute of sample i gw storage change from its average value x i x wij is the spatial weight between the elements i and j and n is the total number of samples the moran s i index ranges from 1 to 1 where i 0 indicates clustered spatial patterns of gw storage change i 0 indicates a random distribution and i 0 indicates dispersion moran s i is usually transformed to a z score to determine if the observed autocorrelation is statistically significant feng et al 2019 the z score and p value indicate the spatial autocorrelation level and the corresponding significance level respectively when p 0 05 it can be assumed that the spatial distribution is not random and the z score is 1 96 or greater than 1 96 at this confidence interval level the zi score is calculated as follows 5 z i 1 e i e i 2 e i 2 where e i 1 n 1 at the local level the local indicator of spatial association lisa was used to assess whether there was a spatial correlation between the changes in the gw storage for a city and the surrounding cities this indicator classifies patterns into four groups namely high high hh high low hl low high lh and low low ll hh represents significant local spatial auto correlated clusters consisting of cities with low reductions in gw storage known as hot spots ll represents significant clusters consisting of cities with high reductions in gw storage known as cold spots hl represents a city with a high change in gw storage surrounded by cities with a low change in gw storage while lh represents a city with a low change in gw storage surrounded by cities with a high change in gw storage the lisa index is calculated as follows 6 l i s a i x i x σ 2 j 1 n w i j x i x i j where lisa i is the local moran index of sample i σ2 is the total variance in all samples and n xi x and wij are the same as eq 6 2 5 statistical analysis of factors driving changes in gw 2 5 1 selecting the factors driving change after referring to previous related studies we selected a range of factors mainly related to anthropogenic activities and climate change which may have contributed to changes in gw in the bth zhang et al 2017 chen et al 2017 hu et al 2019 we established a two level index system table 2 at level one we developed four indexes to describe demographic economic water consumption and natural factors individually from these indexes we identified 13 subfactors for level 2 table 2 the statistical data for these indicators were collected from the economy yearbook and the water resources bulletin we assembled a data set that spanned the period from 2002 to 2017 we used the annual mean city based precipitation measured in mm as the indicator then to be consistent with the other indicators e g the water consumption factors surface water resources the annual mean city based precipitation in mm was converted to the annual mean city based precipitation volume by multiplying by the area of the city the indicators had different domain values so to ensure they could be compared we used the min max normalization method to transfer every indicator from its domain to a specific range between 0 and 1 2 5 2 pearson correlations and grey relational analysis the factors driving change in gw storage were investigated using pearson correlations and grey relational analysis gra we explored the correlations between the changes in gw storage and the factors driving the change from the pearson correlation coefficients and then determined which factors had statistically significant impacts on the changes in gw storage we used gra to show the interrelationships between the changes in gw storage and multiple influencing factors gra is based on geometrical mathematics and complies with the principles of normality symmetry entirety and proximity thus gra can show similarities in the development of trends of different subsystems we applied gra to calculate the degree of correlation between the changes in gw storage and the drivers and identified the ranks from the magnitude of the effects we applied the procedure in a series of steps as follows 1 we determined the changes in the gw storage as the reference sequence x0 x0 1 x0 2 x0 n and used the 13 influential factors as the comparative sequences xi xi 1 xi 2 xi n i 1 2 13 2 we normalized the values of the original sequences onto the same scale to eliminate errors caused by different dimensions we then used the min max normalization method as follows 7 x i k x i k m i n x i k max x i k min x i k 3 we calculated the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of the comparative sequence and reference sequences 8 δx i k x i k x 0 k k 1 2 n 4 we calculated the grey relation coefficient 9 y i k m i n i m i n k δ x i k ρ m a x i m a x k δ x i k δ x i k ρ m a x i m a x k δ x i k where yi k is the grey relational coefficient minmin δxi k is the minimum value of the second level maxmax δxi k is the maximum value of the second level and ρ is the distinguishing coefficient which is generally between 0 and 1 and is usually 0 5 liu et al 2013 5 we obtained the grey relational grade 10 y i 1 n k 1 n y i k where y i is the grey relational grade n is the number of performances which for this study is the number of years spanning from 2002 to 2017 grey relational grade represents the level of correlation between reference and comparability sequences the larger grey relational grade the stronger correlation between the comparability and reference sequences we investigated the relationships between the gw storage and the drivers of change at the two spatial scales with gra for the whole bth urban agglomeration we conducted the gra between the total changes in gw storage in the bth and the corresponding drivers at the city level we assessed the changes in the gw storage of each city within the bth and the corresponding drivers with gra 3 results 3 1 verifying the grace based gw estimates with in situ observations the changes in the gw storage estimated from the grace data fitted well with the in situ monitoring data the highly significant correlation of 0 95 shows that there was good agreement between the grace based equivalent water thickness of the groundwater estimates and the in situ gw level change observations collected from monitoring wells in the bth region from 2005 to 2016 figs 2 3 3 2 spatial and temporal changes in gw storage in the bth 3 2 1 regional scale changes in gw storage overall the gw storage in the bth declined continuously from 2002 to 2007 at an average annual of 1 20 0 06 cm fig 4 a however the rate of decrease varied between years fig 4 b from 2004 to 2009 the rate of decrease increased and ranged from 0 2 cm a to 1 3 cm a after 2010 the rate of decrease slowed obviously but then increased after approximately 2014 fig 4 b it is worth noting that the derivative of the fitting curve before 2004 and after 2014 was biased because of the boundary effect that resulted when calculating the derivative of the fitting curve for gw storage change 3 2 2 city scale changes in gw storage the gw storage in all the cities in the bth decreased obviously from 2002 to 2017 but varied between different cities fig 5 a overall the declines in gw storage were highest in the cities in the south of the bth and were lower in the north eastern cities over the study period from 2002 to 2017 the gw depletion was highest in the southern part of the bth where xingtai shijiazhuang and handan experienced decreases of 29 88 29 04 and 28 80 cm in the gw levels respectively the declines in tangshan and qinhuangdao at 10 cm were relatively small the rates of change in the gw storage fig 5 b were greatest in handan in the south of the bth 1 93 cm a followed by xingtai 1 81 cm a and shijiazhuang 1 78 cm a in contrast the rates of decrease in the gw storage were 0 75 cm a in tangshan qinhuangdao and tianjin in the north of the bth 3 3 spatial correlations between the changes in gw storage in the bth at the regional level the changes in the gw storage of the bth tended to be positively correlated which shows that the changes in the gw storage across the entire bth were spatially aggregated table 3 at the city level all the local moran s i values from 2002 to 2017 were greater than 0 meaning that the changes in the gw storage in the different cities within the bth were significantly correlated fig 6 see table 4 the changes in the gw storage fell into two main categories hh and ll where a high h value represents a low reduction in gw storage and a low l value represents a high reduction in gw storage fig 5 before 2008 the central and southern regions shijiazhuang and hengshui was a hot spot with relatively low reductions in gw while the northeast chengde and tangshan was a cold spot with relatively large reductions in gw as an example the average annual reduction in gw in the hot spots in southern part of the bth e g shijiazhuang hengshui and xingtai from 2002 to 2007 was 0 34 cm but was 8 06 cm in the northern cold spots e g chengde qinhuangdao and beijing the hh and ll clustering patterns were inverted in a north south direction from 2002 to 2017 after 2011 the spatial distribution was reversed and the hot spots were concentrated in the northeast chengde tangshan and tianjin and cold spots were concentrated in the south xingtai for instance the gw in the hot spots in the northeast bth and in the cold spots in the south had annual average decreases of 0 44 and 7 48 cm respectively 3 4 drivers of changes in gw storage in the bth social and economic factors had significant effects on the changes in the gw storage in the bth at the regional scale there were significant negative correlations between the changes in the gw storage and the gdp of primary production total water consumption and agricultural water consumption p 0 01 at the city scale the changes in gw storage were significantly and negatively correlated with the population social economy and water consumption p 0 05 the natural drivers precipitation and surface water were generally negatively correlated with the gw storage changes and the correlations between the gw storage changes and precipitation and surface water in beijing and surface water in tangshan were significantly and negatively correlated p 0 05 the gra showed that water consumption was the strongest influence on the changes in the gw storage table 5 the six factors that were most relevant for changes in gw storage at both the regional and city scales are presented in table 5 at the regional or aggregate scale agricultural water consumption wa and total water consumption wt were the strongest influences agricultural water consumption wa was also the primary influence in most cities but industrial water consumption wi was the main influence in tianjin and tangshan moreover the changes in the gw storage were influenced by the total water consumption wt industrial water consumption wi and domestic water consumption wd other factors such as the total population pt urban population pu primary gdp gpri precipitation np and surface water resources ns also impacted on the changes in gw storage in some cities table 5 for instance the three most important drivers of changes in gw storage in beijing and tianjin were agricultural water consumption wa industrial water consumption wi and the total water consumption wt 4 discussion 4 1 sustained pressure on gw depletion during the development of large scale urban agglomerations storage of gw declined continuously over the entire bth region indicating that the development of large scale urban agglomerations placed sustained pressure on gw supplies the gw storage has declined because the water demand was higher than the natural surface water supply to the bth and gw supplies were exploited to compensate for water shortages for example until 2014 the gw supply accounted for 70 of the total water supply in the bth and there was already severe land subsidence the area of land subsidence across the bth almost doubled from 40 000 km2 to more than 70 000 km2 from 2000 to 2020 however the rate of decrease in gw storage slowed after 2010 suggesting that the stress on gw depletion had been mitigated and that the solutions put in place to restore depleted gw stores such as reducing gw extraction and water diversion were effective for example gw withdrawals across the entire bth decreased from 4 76 km3 in 2002 to 4 28 km3 in 2016 water supplied by diversion schemes such as the luanhe to tianjin and huang to tianjin water diversions replenished some of the depleted gw stores given the sustained stress on the already depleted gw supplies across the bth decision makers urgently need to take action to protect gw there were clear differences in the changes in gw storage between cities suggesting that the impacts on gw varied by city for instance the gw storage in xingtai and handan in hebei province fell by almost twice as much as in beijing and three times as much as in tianjin these differences reflect the variations in the gw demand between different cities for example from 2003 to 2017 the proportions of the total water consumption in beijing and tianjin comprising gw decreased significantly from 73 and 34 and from to 42 and 17 respectively while the proportion of the total water supply from gw in cities in hebei province decreased from 82 to 68 indirectly the impacts on gw also varied because of differences in the amounts of water allocated from diversion schemes to different cities different cities in the bth have different water allocations from the diversion schemes for instance the south north water diversion provided 1 05 billion m3 of water to beijing 0 816 billion m3 to tianjin and 3 billion m3 to 8 cities in hebei from 2008 to 2014 while other cities including zhangjiakou chengde and qinhuangdao in hebei province were not assigned any water therefore regional strategies or actions to protect gw across areas like the bth should take account of city specific variations 4 2 implications of the spatial variations in the changes in gw storage across the bth the spatial clustering of cold and hot spots of gw storage changes in the bth suggest that the gw exploitation of one city might also affect surrounding cities with regionally coordinated development goals cities within urban agglomerations interact and collaborate with each other this inter city collaboration in socioeconomic development leads to spatially similar effects on gw for example before 2007 we found that the cities in the north of the bth were cold spots reflecting the huge water demands of beijing and tianjin that accelerated the gw depletion and intensified the stress on the gw of the surrounding cities in hebei province the cities in hebei especially those around beijing and tianjin were required to meet their own development needs and supply 2 billion m3 of water for production and living per year for beijing and tianjin zhang 2018 it has been reported that beijing and tianjin depend on the cities in hebei for 93 7 of their domestic water moreover cities with high water consumption such as qinhuangdao received 393 million m3 of water annually from tangshan a neighbouring city during the period from 2002 to 2007 the annual gw depletion in the northern cold spots was 8 06 cm the southern cities developed more slowly than the northern cities and consequently there were relatively small changes in the gw depletion in the southern hot spots for instance the annual gw depletion in the southern hot spots which amounted to 0 34 cm from 2002 to 2007 was smaller than the depletion in the north it is noteworthy that the cold spots in the north became hot spots and the hot spots in the south became cold spots which highlights changes in the interactions between cities thereby altering the spatial relationships in the changes in gw storage between cities these shifts may reflect the outcomes from two regional strategies the east and middle routes of the south to north water diversion project opened in 2008 this project transfers large quantities of water to beijing and tianjin and has alleviated the serious water shortages in these two cities zhao et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 following this the cold spots in the northern cities became hot spots in 2011 for instance the implementation of the south to north water diversion meant that there was less demand on gw in beijing and tianjin and there was also less pressure on the gw withdrawals in the surrounding cities consequently the hot spots of gw storage changed low reductions in gw accordingly the annual gw level decline in the northern hot spot cities was 0 44 cm over the period from 2008 to 2017 at this time some of the southern cities became cold spots high reductions in gw the annual gw level decline in the southern cold spots at 7 48 cm was greater than the decline in the northern hot spots this switch mainly reflects the industrial transfer policy and the associated transfer of the water demand from beijing to the central and southern plains of hebei province zhao et al 2017 for example the industrial area in beijing decreased by 91 57 from 2007 to 2015 while the industrial area in the central and southern plain areas of the bth increased by 45 95 tian et al 2019 in addition the water use efficiency of cities in the south of the bth was lower than that in beijing for example despite improvements in the water efficiency use of all the cities the water efficiency was almost 7 times higher in beijing than in hengshui in the south of the bth in 2017 therefore to achieve integrated water resource protection across large scale urban agglomerations regionally specific policies need to consider the interactions between different cities 4 3 effects of natural and anthropogenic factors in the bth on groundwater we found that human activities were the most significant influence on gw storage at both the regional and city scales in the bth this is consistent with the findings from other studies and suggests that the changes in gw storage were shaped by anthropogenic activities e g agricultural irrigation industrial production and domestic water supplies li et al 2018b thus human activities should be managed carefully to reduce the impacts on gw the water demand population and economic output impacted significantly on the changes in gw storage while agricultural water consumption was the primary driver of changes in gw storage at the aggregate scale and in most cities this indicates that as large scale urban agglomerations have developed agricultural development in the bth has competed with urban development for water wang et al 2018 for instance from 2001 to 2017 primary industries accounted for on average 7 17 of the total gdp of the bth but the agricultural water use dominated the water use structure and accounted for on average 61 88 of the total water demand for the bth therefore agriculture should be managed to reduce the stress on water resources in recent decades the demand for agricultural water has decreased as various solutions have been implemented to improve the efficiency in agricultural water use in the bth for instance the proportion of water used for agriculture in the bth decreased from 67 16 to 56 48 from 2001 to 2017 while the agricultural water consumption per 10 000 rmb of the gdp decreased from 1568 m3 in 2001 to 402 m3 in 2017 however the water use efficiency varied widely between different cities in the bth with a difference of approximately 2 71 fold between the highest and lowest agricultural water consumption until 2017 this suggests that there is great potential to improve the agricultural water use efficiency therefore actions at both the regional and city scales should be coordinated and implemented there were some limitations in this study first because of data availability we neglected some factors that may have affected the changes in gw such as surface landforms underground infrastructure and sewer leakages foster 2001 han et al 2017 future studies should consider more potential influences on the changes in gw storage to gain improved insights into the drivers of change while the changes in the gw storage change from the grace satellite data were satisfactory at the regional scale the precision of the estimations of the changes of gw storage at smaller spatial scales may be low data from field investigations can be combined with the grace data to improve the accuracy of the small scale estimates 5 conclusions for dense urban areas with gw overexploitation scientists and decision makers face the challenge of determining how to utilize gw sustainably in dense urban areas where gw stores are overexploited in this study we quantitatively assessed the changes in gw storage across a large scale urban agglomeration in china at regional and city scales using grace data we also examined the spatial correlations in the changes in gw storage and identified the main causes of the changes we found that the grace data supported our assessment of changes in gw storage in the bth there were significant spatial correlations between the changes in the gw storage between the cities and the cities were affected by regional water diversion schemes and other interactions of the influences on the gw storage changes across the bth and in most cities the correlation was strongest between the agricultural water demand and the gw storage changes thus to protect gw in the bth allocations from water diversion schemes and agricultural water should be carefully managed and agricultural water use management at the city scale should be tailored to regionally coordinated development goals the relationships between different cities should be considered when deciding how to protect gw supplies in large scale urban agglomerations the results from this study supplement the findings of previous studies on gw storage changes and the drivers of change and may also contribute to promoting synergistic planning and management of water resource allocations at the large scale in similar regions credit authorship

3058,modelling hydrological processes with fully distributed models based on the shallow water equations implies a high computational cost which often limits the resolution of the computational mesh therefore in practice modellers need to find a compromise between spatial resolution numerical accuracy and computational cost moreover this balance is probably related to the accuracy and resolution of the underlying digital terrain model dtm in this work it is studied the effect of the dtm resolution and the size of the computational mesh on the results and on the runtime of a hydrological model based on the 2d shallow water equations seven rainfall events in four different basins have been modelled using 3 dtms and 3 different mesh resolutions the results obtained highlight the relevance of the vertical accuracy versus the horizontal resolution of the dtms furthermore it has been observed that mesh resolutions greater than 25 m together with lidar based dtms with horizontal resolution greater than 25 m provide comparable outflow hydrographs keywords srtm ign digital elevation model iber mesh size runoff data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction hydrological models are commonly used to reproduce and understand the water fluxes that compose the hydrological cycle of a basin refsgaard and storm 1990 schaake et al 1996 the birth of this type of models took place in the 1960s and since then there have been a large number of improvements both in the development of new numerical methods and in the physical representation of the numerical model perumal and price 2017 pham and tsai 2017 singh 2018 among the most important advances one can highlight the flourishing of remote sensing systems particularly satellites and radars together with the progress of geographic information systems gis the combination of the two has made it possible to work with spatial data on climate morphology geology land use or inter alia topography muhadi et al 2020 mujumdar and nagesh kumar 2012 the development of gis has in turn driven the growth of databases incorporating high spatial resolution information berhanu et al 2013 lehner and döll 2004 tsangaratos et al 2017 uuemaa et al 2020 this coupled with the recent advances in high performance computing has led to the fact that spatially distributed models are gaining momentum against lumped and semi distributed models chen et al 2017 fraga et al 2019 kang and sridhar 2017 laiolo et al 2016 one of the basic input data whose use is ubiquitous in all hydrological models are digital terrain models dtm dtms represent the continuously varying topographic surface of the earth and provide hydraulic modelers with an efficient tool to extract the hydrological characteristics of a watershed terrain slope drainage networks etc nevertheless its applicability in distributed models raises a question that was already stated by quinn et al 1991 but which is still a matter of research bomers et al 2019 caviedes voullième et al 2012 costabile and costanzo 2021 fernández pato et al 2016 hou et al 2018a namely what dtm resolution is needed to achieve a correct representation of the relevant hydrological processes this question goes hand in hand with the following what is the most appropriate mesh size for a given dtm resolution these questions become even more complex if we consider studies such as marsh et al 2018 where it is indicated that the mesh configuration is not only constrained by topography but must also correctly represent surface and sub surface features along with landscape variability moreover the dtm resolution should be related to the spatial scale of the hydrological processes that we want to represent on the other hand for a proper exploitation of the dtm resolution the cell size of the computational mesh should be equal to or smaller than the dtm cell size however in large scale fully distributed models the computational cost of a very fine mesh may be unaffordable moreover in addition to the spatial resolution of the dtm and the mesh the vertical accuracy of the dtm is also relevant since it can lead to significant inaccuracies in model predictions undoubtedly the accuracy and resolution of dtms must be taken into account in the calculation processes and authors such as habtezion et al 2016 have long since reflected on whether hydrological modelers are fully aware of the limitations of dtms there are many studies that have explored the impact of the dtm quality in different kinds of hydrological models vaze et al 2010 studied the impact of dtm accuracy and resolution on topographic indices using as a case study a 32 000 ha catchment located in australia it was concluded that the quality of dtm derived hydrological features is very sensitive to dtm accuracy and resolution their results suggest that the dtm with the highest resolution available should be used and in those cases where computational time constraints do not allow its use a resampling to a lower resolution should be done instead of directly taking a dtm with a lower resolution other authors such as mukherjee et al 2012 or courty et al 2019 directly analysed the accuracy of different freely available dtms helping to better understand the limitation of such products zhao et al 2021 in contrast several authors have focused on analysing the role of the grid size in hydro morphological studies dietrich et al 1995 gómez gutiérrez et al 2015 kienzle 2004 wilson et al 2000 in order to compute topographic characteristics claessens et al 2005 looked at the impact of using different grid sizes 10 25 50 and 100 m while paulin et al 2010 investigated how different grid sizes 1 5 10 and 30 m affected the cartographic depiction of small and deep landslides however works such as tarolli and tarboton 2006 where the relation between mesh sizes and dtm resolution is studied are less common the application of hydrological models based on the 2d shallow water equations is becoming a common approach in rainfall runoff simulations at the catchment scale bellos et al 2020 caviedes voullième et al 2012 cea and bladé 2015 costabile et al 2012 fernández pato et al 2018 hou et al 2018b liang et al 2015 ni et al 2020 simons et al 2014 uber et al 2021 one of the most valued features of such complex models is the fact that they allow hydrodynamic calculations to be carried out on a basin scale but taking into account local flow phenomena in order to capture the potential effects that hydraulic structures such as bridges or weirs have on the propagation of the flood it is required a high resolution numerical model e g macchione and lombardo 2021 although at the local scale the hydrostatic pressure approximation essential assumption in 2d swe models is not valid in the surroundings of these structures these models still provide reliable results at the catchment scale garcía alén et al 2021 luis et al 2022 in the definition of the computational mesh of the model despite recent advances in high performance computing hpc garcía feal et al 2018 lacasta et al 2015 petaccia et al 2016 sanders and schubert 2019 vacondio et al 2014 xia et al 2019 modellers often have to make a balance between a fine mesh that correctly reproduces the topography of the terrain costabile and macchione 2015 and a feasible computational cost some authors have analysed the optimisation of the computational domain by exploring the advantages of mixed mesh bomers et al 2019 hoch et al 2018 and adaptive grids hu et al 2019 savant et al 2019 other authors have explored the mesh refinement by the detection of key topographic features costabile and costanzo 2021 ferraro et al 2020 hou et al 2018a in this paper we study the interactions between the dtm and computational mesh resolutions on rainfall runoff simulation with a fully distributed hydrodynamic model based on the 2d swe this analysis is carried out by studying the degeneracy of the output hydrograph observed with several dtms and mesh resolutions together with the analysis of the different runtimes the output hydrograph obtained with the best resolution mesh and dtm was used as reference result synthetic true the results obtained in 7 rainfall events occurring in 4 hydrological basins are studied for each rainfall event 9 model configurations were run by combining 3 freely distributed dtms with 3 different mesh sizes regarding the dtms the horizontal resolutions used were 5 25 and 30 m the 5 and 25 m dtms are lidar based products offered by the spanish national geographic institute ign and therefore only available for spain while the 30 m dtm is product provided by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm and global coverage as for the computational meshes used 3 different resolutions have been defined for each basin and their element size has been adapted to the size of each basin always maintaining a ratio between element sizes of 1 2 5 and 10 2 case studies and available data 2 1 description of the watersheds four river basins located in spain were selected to undertake this study izas caldo landro and genil river basins fig 1 in the choice of the study cases priority has been given to the selection of basins of different size from 0 33 to 3750 km2 mean slope from 7 to 20 and precipitation regime their maximum daily precipitation varies from 36 to 142 8 mm a summary of the main characteristics of each watershed is included in table 1 the genil river basin represents a large low sloped watershed marked by a mediterranean climate with a low base flow during most of the year but with intense rainfall events that produce strong peak flows on the other hand the caldo and landro basins have a steeper topography and are located in an atlantic climate region characterized by a more uniform rainfall regime finally the izas basin is a small mountain catchment located in the pyrenees with steep slopes and a very low concentration time the izas catchment is located in the central spain pyrenees in the upper gállego valley near the spain france border the catchment occupies an extension of 0 33 km2 and is located at an altitude of over 2000 m a s l the catchment is predominantly east orientated with some areas also facing north or south the main ravine is a tributary of the escarra river which in turn is a tributary of the gállego river which finally debouches into the ebro river the entire catchment is located above the upper forest limit and exemplifies the general conditions of subalpine areas of the pyrenees subalpine and alpine grassland domain the landscape although some rocky outcrops are also present in the upper and steeper slopes lana renault et al 2014 lópez moreno et al 2013 revuelto et al 2017 rainy season in this basin is between october and may alvera and garcía ruiz 2000 the caldo river catchment with an area of 38 km2 is located in north west spain in the border with portugal land coverage is dominated by grasslands coniferous and leaf forest and different kind of crops meléndez asensio and del pozo tejado 2019 the region is located in the transition between the mediterranean and eurosiberian biogeographic zones therefore the climate is temperate oceanic sub mediterranean ninyerola et al 2005 the landro river is located in north western spain the total area of its basin is 199 km2 and its mean altitude is below 1000 m a s l this river is born in the gistral mountain range and flows into the cantabrian sea in the viveiro estuary the watershed is covered by eucalyptus and pine forests and scrublands with only a small proportion of cultivated areas in the river floodplains the soil permeability of the basin is low barja and lestegas 1992 rainfall is quite regular throughout the year which reflects an oceanic rainfall regime with maximum flows in winter and minimum flows in summer the genil river basin is located in southern spain and its catchment covers an area of 8200 km2 in its central area is located the iznájar reservoir 981 hm3 which is one of the largest reservoirs in spain this reservoir was designed to absorb the ordinary floods of the river and it completely controls the downstream discharge thus it divides the genil river basin into two subbasins upper and lower genil only the lower genil subbasin has been analysed in this study this basin begins at the iznájar reservoir and ends in the municipality of écija the study area has a total surface of 3750 km2 it is a typical mediterranean landscape with fragile natural ecosystems and insufficient rainfall to allow for quick vegetation regeneration and long term human use the climate is arid with an annual rainfall of 500 mm there is a wide range of vegetation cover including annual crops grassland bushes and woodland however given that the main economic activity in the area is agriculture irrigated crops and rainfed olive groves account for a significant area of the basin 2 2 rainfall events seven rainfall events have been modelled in the study basins 1 event in the izas basin and 2 events in the caldo landro and genil basins all of these are isolated rainfall events that produced high peak flows in the river the observed precipitation and flow data were obtained from different sources for each catchment in the izas basin data were provided by the pyrenean institute of ecology ipe in the caldo basin data were provided by the miño sil river basin management authority chms in the landro basin data were provided by the galician meteorological agency meteogalicia finally in the genil basin data were provided by the guadalquivir river basin management authority chg main characteristics of the rainfall events along with the peak discharge and volume of the observed hydrograph are listed in table 2 due to the small size of the izas and caldo catchments a spatially homogeneous rainfall was assumed in these two basins in the case of the landro and genil basins the spatial distribution of rainfall was estimated from rain gauge and radar data 3 methodology 3 1 digital terrain models the three dtms used in this study are the following 1 the dtm provided by the spanish national geographic institute ign at a 5 m resolution ign cnig 2021 2 the dtm provided by the spanish ign at a 25 m resolution and 3 the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dtm with a grid size of 1 arc second approximately 30 m farr et al 2007 werner 2001 the different spatial resolutions of the 3 dtms are visually compared in fig 2 hereafter these dtms will be referred to as dmt05 dtm25 and dtm30 respectively the first two dtms are derived from the spanish aerial orthophotography national plan in spain pnoa and are freely distributed by the spanish national geographic institute ign ign cnig 2021 dtm05 was obtained by automatic correlation and interactive stereoscopic debugging for the pnoa initiative its rmse in the vertical direction is estimated to be lower than 50 cm pnoa 2015 dtm25 was generated by interpolation of the dtm05 maintaining a rmse value for the elevation differences of 2 9 m martínez et al 2004 nasa shuttle radar topography mission srtm datasets were obtained from a collaborative effort by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the national geospatial intelligence agency nga as well as the participation of the german and italian space agencies with the purpose of generating a near global dtm of the earth using radar interferometry the dtm30 srtm v3 0 1arcsec farr et al 2007 is a near global dtm with a 1 arc second 30 m resolution comprising a combination of data from the srtm and the u s geological survey s gtopo30 data set the primary goal of creating the version 3 data was to eliminate voids that were present in earlier versions of srtm data the global and free availability nasa jpl 2013 of the srtm dtms has led to its application in multiple hydrological studies alsdorf et al 2007 hancock et al 2006 sreedevi et al 2009 according to its mission objectives srtm dtms are expected to have a vertical rmse of 10 m chen et al 2020 farr et al 2007 kellndorfer et al 2004 mukul et al 2015 even though validation studies reported a vertical rmse in europe of 3 8 m carrera hernandez 2021 mukul et al 2017 santillan and makinano santillan 2016 szabó et al 2015 regardless of their origin all these dtms can include sinks that originate from an inadequate elevation precision and closed topographic depressions o callaghan and mark 1984 the majority of depressions in dtms are singularities caused by a failure of the source data to capture the topography s natural break lines insufficient grid resolution random errors that create flow blockages and a surface model s inability to properly represent infrastructure such as culverts and bridges lindsay 2016 most hydrological applications of dtms begin with sink removal to ensures continuous flow paths by flow enforcement techniques including filling and breaching methods martz and garbrecht 1998 this is a commonly used technique as not all hydrological models are able to work with dtms that include depressions or even flat bottom also knowing that such depression filling algorithms have been criticised in the academic literature for their greater impact on dtms lindsay 2016 the authors have avoided using such techniques in order to prevent disturbing the comparison between dtms therefore raw digital models have been used without applying any type of sink filling treatment 3 2 numerical model surface runoff was simulated using the numerical model iber garcía feal et al 2018 which is a gpu parallelized version of the iber model bladé et al 2014 iber is a 2d numerical model for simulating free surface flow and transport processes in shallow waters iber allows calculating rainfall runoff hydrological and inundation hydraulic processes in a coupled way and it has been validated for rainfall runoff modelling in multiple previous works cea et al 2014 2010 cea and bladé 2015 fraga et al 2019 2016 sanz ramos et al 2021 its reliability and computational efficiency has even led iber to be recently incorporated in several flood early warning systems fernández nóvoa et al 2020 fraga et al 2020 gonzález cao et al 2019 the mass and momentum conservation equations solved by the model can be written as follows 1 h t q x x q y y r i 2 q x t x q x 2 h g h 2 2 y q x q y h g h z b x g n 2 h 7 3 q q x 3 q y t x q x q y h y q y 2 h g h 2 2 g h z b y g n 2 h 7 3 q q y where h is the water depth q x q y and q are the two components of the unit discharge and its modulus z b is the bed elevation n is the manning coefficient g is the gravity acceleration r is the rainfall intensity and i the infiltration rate the source terms of precipitation and infiltration can vary in space and time and since both terms are included independently in the hydrodynamic equations infiltration can occur even in the absence of precipitation as long as there is a positive water depth over a mesh element therefore the possible effect of local topographic features on the infiltration rate is implicitly included in the equations however the numerical representation of this process will be dependent on the resolution of the dtm and computational mesh since recent studies have shown that low resolution models tend to poorly represent land surface features and therefore eliminate depressions and barriers that interrupt and retain flow leading to a decrease in cumulative infiltration habtezion et al 2016 the hydrodynamic equations are solved using an unstructured finite volume solver which includes a specific numerical scheme for hydrological applications cea and bladé 2015 this numerical scheme is first order accurate in space and time the geometry of the four catchments was discretized using an unstructured and uniform mesh of triangular elements generated in gid coll et al 2018a 2018b gid adapts the mesh size to the geometry of the model by approximating the element sizes to the value indicated by the modeler the maximum relative error in this size approximation was set at 10 the chosen element size is not constant in all catchments and is detailed in section 3 3 regarding the temporal accuracy of the models the discretization used in this work is explicit in time which implies that the computational time step is constrained by a stability condition cfl condition in addition the dry wet limit has been set equal to 0 1 mm in all simulations in iber the dtm values are interpolated to the nodes of the computational mesh using a bilinear interpolation method the elevation value at each mesh vertex is interpolated using the 4 dtm elevation values closest to the vertex being interpolated bottom friction is modelled in iber with the manning s formula bladé et al 2014 in this work the manning coefficient was defined according to the land use map of the european project corine land cover 2018 clc2018 european union copernicus land monitoring service 2018 and the recommendations of the methodological guide for the development of the national floodplain mapping system ministerio de medio ambiente y medio rural y marino 2011 which proposes a manning coefficient for each of the corine land uses infiltration was modelled following the scs cn methodology mockus 1964 the single parameter of the model the curve number cn was defined according to the rainfall registered the days prior to the start of the event distinguishing between dry cn i normal cn ii or wet cn iii antecedent moisture conditions finally it is worth mentioning that in all simulations a warm up period of the model has been set until the base flow at the beginning of the event is reached table 3 shows the curve number used for each event and the manning coefficient values used for each basin due to the small size of the izas basin a constant cn value has been taken for the whole watershed the genil basin is characterised by low surface runoff coefficients table 2 while for the rest of the basins the surface runoff coefficient remains above 60 in the events of the genil river basin these values drop to 46 and 9 respectively for events 6 and 7 table 1 reveals that the genil catchment is the basin with the lowest annual precipitation but with the highest maximum daily precipitation the lowest value of cn is also found in this basin table 3 with respect to the rest of the watersheds a coherence is observed between the curve number and the runoff coefficient for the analysed events 3 3 spatial discretization as previously mentioned the spatial resolutions of the dtms used in this study are 5 25 and 30 m to achieve a full exploitation of the dtm resolution the cell size of the numerical mesh should be equal to or lower than the resolution of the dtm however the computational cost of using a very fine mesh in models that cover large areas can result in calculation times that are prohibitive for most practical applications especially when using fully distributed hydrological models based on the 2d swe which leads to the use of element sizes larger than the dtm resolution and results in a loss of topographical information this can be partially improved by the use of non uniform meshes with smaller element sizes in the river network and larger sizes in the hillslopes costabile and costanzo 2021 ferraro et al 2020 uber et al 2021 this might improve the accuracy of the results without increasing too much the total number of elements in order to simplify the analysis in this work unstructured uniform meshes were considered implementing a subgrid modelling approach can include some topographical information in the equations when the dtm resolution is much higher than the computational mesh resolution in order to improve the results without affecting too much the computational time such kind of subgrid modelling approaches have been applied to the shallow water equations in previous studies platzek et al 2016 sanders and schubert 2019 shen et al 2015 shustikova et al 2019 volp et al 2013 but have not been used in the present model since they are not implemented in most shallow water models the different size of the catchments analysed in this work from 0 33 to 3750 km2 made it impossible to use the same cell size in all the models due to computational cost limitations in the caldo and landro basins with an area of approximately 40 and 200 km2 the element sizes were 10 25 and 100 m smaller element sizes were not used since they would imply a very high computational cost not affordable in practical applications in the izas basin 0 33 km2 the element sizes used were 1 2 5 and 10 m in order to have some grids with a higher resolution than the finest dtms in the genil basin 3750 km2 it was not possible to reach the mesh resolutions used in the caldo and landro finest meshes so the mesh sizes used were 25 62 5 and 250 m table 4 summarises the main characteristics of the computational grids used a triangular unstructured uniform mesh was used in all cases in the following the mesh sizes will be denoted according to its resolution as fine medium and coarse 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation in order to analyse the degradation of the model output when working with a coarser mesh and a lower resolution dtm the hydrographs computed with the fine mesh and the highest resolution dtm dtm05 were taken as a reference value fig 3 compares for each event the observed hydrograph with the simulated reference hydrograph the visual comparison depicted in fig 3 and the values of mae nse and relative error for hydrograph volume obtained for each case show a reasonably good agreement between numerical results and field data mae of each event has been normalised to the peak flow of the corresponding observed hydrograph to allow a comparison between the different events obtaining an average mae value of 7 of the peak flow the values of the mae qp and nse indicators are satisfactory however it can be observed that the adjustment of the hydrograph volumes in some events is not accurate due to mismatches in the base flow of the numerical model 4 2 effect of the computational mesh and dtm resolutions fig 4 shows the nse coefficient obtained for each of the rainfall events and the overall performance of the different mesh sizes the 3 dtms have very different characteristics so the results of each dtm have been represented in different subplots to help the further analysis regarding the differences between the results obtained for the dtm05 and the dtm25 the nse values are practically analogous between both dtms for all element sizes knowing that the dtm25 is a product created by the ign from the dtm05 the results indicate that the vertical accuracy of the data is more relevant than the spatial horizontal resolution of the dtm itself furthermore it can be seen that at the same mesh resolution fine dtm25 provides comparable results to dtm05 this finding would not follow the trend identified by habtezion et al 2016 who noted that the dtm resolution threshold above which similar results are obtained is equal to 10 m but in the comparison of the different dtms what is most remarkable is the poor results of the dtm30 in the larger catchments events 4 5 6 and 7 although its spatial horizontal resolution is not much higher than that of the dtm25 the nse values in the landro and genil basins are low even for the finest meshes moving on to compare the results of the different mesh sizes fig 4 shows remarkable good outcomes for the izas basin where independently of the dtm used the nse values are always practically equal to 1 regarding the results obtained in caldo and landro where the element sizes are shared the similarity of results between the fine mesh 10 m and the medium mesh 25 m is patent this result is particularly interesting in the case of the dtm05 where the element size of the fine mesh could take advantage of the spatial resolution of the dtm the differences obtained between the fine 10 m and coarse 100 m mesh leaving aside the bad behaviour of the dtm30 in the case of the landro acquire a relative relevance in some cases such as event 4 for the dtm05 and dtm25 where the value of the nse reaches 0 556 and 0 552 respectively the differences in mesh element sizes lead to slightly different results in the genil river basin in the dtm05 and dtm25 again the dtm30 results do not seem to correspond to their lower resolution counterparts the medium mesh 62 5 m obtains results very close to those of the fine mesh 25 m with values still above 0 716 however a strong reduction of the nse is perceived with the coarse mesh 250 m particularly in event 7 this degradation of the result as a function of element size is clearer in fig 5 this figure shows the nse normalized centred root mean square difference e n taylor 2001 and mae results obtained for the different dtms and in relation to the element size of each catchment regarding e n values below 0 5 are assumed to be good as this limit has already been used as a reference in the analysis of streamflow series with this parameter gonzález cao et al 2019 in the case of mae the result has been normalised to the peak flow of the reference hydrograph to facilitate the comparison between the different events the correlation of the results has been estimated with pearson s and spearman s coefficients and their value is indicated for each of the subplots rp and rs respectively again we find here a clear analogy between the nse values obtained for the dtm05 and dtm25 and it is seen how this result holds with the e n and mae qp values too also the dtm30 differs from the dtm05 and dtm25 especially for the landro and genil basins the largest ones a larger surface area in these catchment favours the appearance of outlier points with low accuracy which together with the low runoff depth value of the events in landro and genil relative to the izas and caldo events intensifies the degradation of the outflow hydrograph regarding the results obtained for the mesh sizes although the number of data is not high a quasi linear relationship is observed in the metrics corresponding to the dtm05 and dtm25 in particular for both dtms the good results obtained from a threshold close to 25 m stand out since all nse values are above 0 913 e n values are below 0 293 and mae qp values are below 0 028 apart from this the results obtained with the dtm05 and dtm25 for the fine meshes are also remarkable as a representative example fig 6 includes the hydrographs obtained for event 5 landro river basin in this figure it can be seen how visually the results obtained with the dtm05 and dtm25 for the fine and medium meshes are similar and very close to the reference hydrograph finest mesh and dtm05 another significant result is that dtm25 and especially the dtm30 for fine and medium mesh tend to underestimate the peak of the hydrograph this pattern has been repeated in the rest of the events these results are in line with what was highlighted by habtezion et al 2016 where it was observed that coarse resolution dtms 10 m tend to overestimate ponded areas and therefore to reduce and delay the peak of the hydrograph however in view of the results obtained where there is a large underestimation of the peak flow by the dtm30 at a different magnitude than the dtm25 it could be deduced that this trend is not only linked to the horizontal resolution of the dtm but also to its vertical accuracy the outflow hydrograph can be affected by the water retention capacity of the dtm used the effect that the study dtms have on this accumulation of water on the model surface is shown in fig 7 taking as representative example the event 4 registered in the landro river basin fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of the maximum depths obtained for the 3 dtms and the finest mesh the model s runoff volume at each timestep has also been added the results observed at fig 7 confirm the relevance of the dtm change in the model outcome when the results obtained for the three dtms are compared it can be seen that despite maintaining the same mesh resolution fine and despite having a dtm horizontal resolution close to the dtm25 dtm30 notably increase the surface storage capacity of the model this increase in storage capacity is less relevant in the izas and caldo basins in addition this increase in storage capacity is also related to the increase in the size of the mesh elements this effect influences the poor results of coarse meshes and as caviedes voullième et al 2012 has already indicated it is in part due to the poor topographic representation of the terrain since local minima and maxima may be poorly represented with coarse meshes which results in static ponded water which cannot flow further this effect is enhanced in events that have much lower peak flows e g event 7 with lower peak flow than event 6 for a better understanding of the differences obtained with the dtm30 regarding the dtm25 and dtm05 it is necessary to look at the origin of the dtms themselves the dtm05 and dtm25 are lidar derived dtms however dtm30 is created via insar i e active sensor even though active sensors have its advantages over passive sensors e g active sensors are considered to penetrate more the vegetation than an active sensor it is a technique that cannot compete with the precision of lidar in fact in works such as courty et al 2019 where the accuracy of different open access dtms including a srtm product in flood modelling is compared the lidar derived dtm values are taken as a reference for the evaluation criteria in order to analyse the effect of the different dtms on the computational mesh fig 8 shows the comparison between some cross sections belonging again to the landro river basin reproduced with the different calculation meshes used in the numerical simulations in particular as an example three cross sections have been considered in line with previous statements compared to the reference case dtm05 and fine mesh the performance of the dtm25 is remarkable together with the less accurate reproduction of dtm30 in the results obtained with the fine mesh a mae of less than 0 7 m has been obtained in the 3 sections related to dtm25 and however this value rises to more than 12 m in sections 1 and 2 corresponding to the dtm30 furthermore for dtm05 and dtm25 the results obtained with the medium mesh reproduce reasonably well the profile obtained with the fine mesh the maximum mae is obtained in section 2 for dtm25 and is equal to 4 27 m nevertheless with the coarse mesh the obtained profiles are visibly far from a correct representation of the reference profile greatly limiting the drainage capacity of the section for example the mae resulted for dtm05 and coarse mesh in section 3 is equal to 10 62 m 4 3 runtime the runtime increment of each simulation with respect to the runtime obtained with the dtm05 and the fine mesh is represented in fig 9 in general the runtimes obtained with the dtm25 tend to be equal or slightly lower than those of the dtm05 this result is affected by the fact that the dtm25 is smoother than the dtm05 which results in somewhat higher depths or velocities being generated in some areas of the model in the latter case since the temporal discretization of the numerical model is subject to a courant friedrichs lewy cfl stability constraint over the computational time step cea and bladé 2015 numerically and under a constant element size the increase in water velocity and depth is compensated by a reduction in the time step this implies a smaller computational time step in the simulations performed with the dtm05 so its computation time is in general equal to or higher than that obtained in the dtm25 simulations something similar is also true for the dtm30 the runtimes obtained with this dtm tend to be always equal to or higher than the rest of the dtms dtm30 has a lower quality than the rest of dtms which causes significant water accumulations in the model that affect its runtime in some cases the difference in runtime increment of dtm30 is particularly relevant e g event 6 and fine mesh in these cases the resolution of the mesh aggravates the imperfections of the dtm30 and has an effect on this increase in the runtime the size of the mesh elements has a direct implication on the cfl condition a larger element size leads to an increase in computational time step and therefore a decrease of the runtime overall the use of the medium mesh with elements 2 5 times larger than those of fine mesh instead of the fine mesh results in a reduction of approximately 90 of the calculation time the simulations carried out with the coarse mesh with elements 10 times larger than those of fine mesh further reduce the calculation time reaching a reduction of more than 99 in izas landro and genil basins 5 conclusions with the recent development of fully distributed hydrological models and their application to large catchments the spatial resolution of the mesh and model inputs becomes highly relevant this study was intended to understand the effects that different dtm and mesh resolutions have on the simulation results both output hydrographs and runtimes thus seven observed rainfall events corresponding to 4 basins have been selected to be modelled using the iber numerical model each of the events was simulated for 3 different mesh sizes and for 3 different dtms making a total of 63 simulations 9 per event the hydrographs obtained for the higher resolution dtm and the finest mesh have been taken as a reference synthetic observation the results obtained indicate that under the same mesh resolution the vertical accuracy of the dtm has a greater effect on the outflow hydrograph of the model than the horizontal resolution of the dtm despite a five fold increase in spatial resolution the results obtained with the 25 m dtm dtm25 were very similar to those obtained with the 5 m dtm dtm05 results that have not been correctly reproduced by the 30 m dtm dtm30 in addition it has also been shown that mesh resolutions up to a threshold of 25 m together with a lidar based dtm with a horizontal resolution higher than 25 m did provide comparable results with regard to the outlet hydrograph the values obtained with a 25 m resolution mesh have achieved a minimum value of 0 913 in terms of nse maximum value of 0 293 of normalized centred root mean square difference e n and 0 028 of mae normalised to the peak flow along with a 90 saving in runtime compared the result of a 2 5 times higher resolution mesh in the application of fully distributed hydrological models based on the 2d shallow water equations the use of global datasets should be limited only to those locations where lidar data are not available in the case of using a lower resolution than the lidar based dtm the topography should be defined from a resampling of this product rather than from global datasets these conclusions are consistent at least for fully distributed hydrological models based on the shallow water equations with a uniform unstructured computational mesh and only with regard to the outflow hydrograph of the basin the possible degradation of other distributed hydrological outputs such as depth and velocity maps has not been analysed in this article but will be considered for further work credit authorship contribution statement gonzalo garcía alén conceptualization methodology writing original draft jose gonzález

3058,modelling hydrological processes with fully distributed models based on the shallow water equations implies a high computational cost which often limits the resolution of the computational mesh therefore in practice modellers need to find a compromise between spatial resolution numerical accuracy and computational cost moreover this balance is probably related to the accuracy and resolution of the underlying digital terrain model dtm in this work it is studied the effect of the dtm resolution and the size of the computational mesh on the results and on the runtime of a hydrological model based on the 2d shallow water equations seven rainfall events in four different basins have been modelled using 3 dtms and 3 different mesh resolutions the results obtained highlight the relevance of the vertical accuracy versus the horizontal resolution of the dtms furthermore it has been observed that mesh resolutions greater than 25 m together with lidar based dtms with horizontal resolution greater than 25 m provide comparable outflow hydrographs keywords srtm ign digital elevation model iber mesh size runoff data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction hydrological models are commonly used to reproduce and understand the water fluxes that compose the hydrological cycle of a basin refsgaard and storm 1990 schaake et al 1996 the birth of this type of models took place in the 1960s and since then there have been a large number of improvements both in the development of new numerical methods and in the physical representation of the numerical model perumal and price 2017 pham and tsai 2017 singh 2018 among the most important advances one can highlight the flourishing of remote sensing systems particularly satellites and radars together with the progress of geographic information systems gis the combination of the two has made it possible to work with spatial data on climate morphology geology land use or inter alia topography muhadi et al 2020 mujumdar and nagesh kumar 2012 the development of gis has in turn driven the growth of databases incorporating high spatial resolution information berhanu et al 2013 lehner and döll 2004 tsangaratos et al 2017 uuemaa et al 2020 this coupled with the recent advances in high performance computing has led to the fact that spatially distributed models are gaining momentum against lumped and semi distributed models chen et al 2017 fraga et al 2019 kang and sridhar 2017 laiolo et al 2016 one of the basic input data whose use is ubiquitous in all hydrological models are digital terrain models dtm dtms represent the continuously varying topographic surface of the earth and provide hydraulic modelers with an efficient tool to extract the hydrological characteristics of a watershed terrain slope drainage networks etc nevertheless its applicability in distributed models raises a question that was already stated by quinn et al 1991 but which is still a matter of research bomers et al 2019 caviedes voullième et al 2012 costabile and costanzo 2021 fernández pato et al 2016 hou et al 2018a namely what dtm resolution is needed to achieve a correct representation of the relevant hydrological processes this question goes hand in hand with the following what is the most appropriate mesh size for a given dtm resolution these questions become even more complex if we consider studies such as marsh et al 2018 where it is indicated that the mesh configuration is not only constrained by topography but must also correctly represent surface and sub surface features along with landscape variability moreover the dtm resolution should be related to the spatial scale of the hydrological processes that we want to represent on the other hand for a proper exploitation of the dtm resolution the cell size of the computational mesh should be equal to or smaller than the dtm cell size however in large scale fully distributed models the computational cost of a very fine mesh may be unaffordable moreover in addition to the spatial resolution of the dtm and the mesh the vertical accuracy of the dtm is also relevant since it can lead to significant inaccuracies in model predictions undoubtedly the accuracy and resolution of dtms must be taken into account in the calculation processes and authors such as habtezion et al 2016 have long since reflected on whether hydrological modelers are fully aware of the limitations of dtms there are many studies that have explored the impact of the dtm quality in different kinds of hydrological models vaze et al 2010 studied the impact of dtm accuracy and resolution on topographic indices using as a case study a 32 000 ha catchment located in australia it was concluded that the quality of dtm derived hydrological features is very sensitive to dtm accuracy and resolution their results suggest that the dtm with the highest resolution available should be used and in those cases where computational time constraints do not allow its use a resampling to a lower resolution should be done instead of directly taking a dtm with a lower resolution other authors such as mukherjee et al 2012 or courty et al 2019 directly analysed the accuracy of different freely available dtms helping to better understand the limitation of such products zhao et al 2021 in contrast several authors have focused on analysing the role of the grid size in hydro morphological studies dietrich et al 1995 gómez gutiérrez et al 2015 kienzle 2004 wilson et al 2000 in order to compute topographic characteristics claessens et al 2005 looked at the impact of using different grid sizes 10 25 50 and 100 m while paulin et al 2010 investigated how different grid sizes 1 5 10 and 30 m affected the cartographic depiction of small and deep landslides however works such as tarolli and tarboton 2006 where the relation between mesh sizes and dtm resolution is studied are less common the application of hydrological models based on the 2d shallow water equations is becoming a common approach in rainfall runoff simulations at the catchment scale bellos et al 2020 caviedes voullième et al 2012 cea and bladé 2015 costabile et al 2012 fernández pato et al 2018 hou et al 2018b liang et al 2015 ni et al 2020 simons et al 2014 uber et al 2021 one of the most valued features of such complex models is the fact that they allow hydrodynamic calculations to be carried out on a basin scale but taking into account local flow phenomena in order to capture the potential effects that hydraulic structures such as bridges or weirs have on the propagation of the flood it is required a high resolution numerical model e g macchione and lombardo 2021 although at the local scale the hydrostatic pressure approximation essential assumption in 2d swe models is not valid in the surroundings of these structures these models still provide reliable results at the catchment scale garcía alén et al 2021 luis

schubert 2019 vacondio et al 2014 xia et al 2019 modellers often have to make a balance between a fine mesh that correctly reproduces the topography of the terrain costabile and macchione 2015 and a feasible computational cost some authors have analysed the optimisation of the computational domain by exploring the advantages of mixed mesh bomers et al 2019 hoch et al 2018 and adaptive grids hu et al 2019 savant et al 2019 other authors have explored the mesh refinement by the detection of key topographic features costabile and costanzo 2021 ferraro et al 2020 hou et al 2018a in this paper we study the interactions between the dtm and computational mesh resolutions on rainfall runoff simulation with a fully distributed hydrodynamic model based on the 2d swe this analysis is carried out by studying the degeneracy of the output hydrograph observed with several dtms and mesh resolutions together with the analysis of the different runtimes the output hydrograph obtained with the best resolution mesh and dtm was used as reference result synthetic true the results obtained in 7 rainfall events occurring in 4 hydrological basins are studied for each rainfall event 9 model configurations were run by combining 3 freely distributed dtms with 3 different mesh sizes regarding the dtms the horizontal resolutions used were 5 25 and 30 m the 5 and 25 m dtms are lidar based products offered by the spanish national geographic institute ign and therefore only available for spain while the 30 m dtm is product provided by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm and global coverage as for the computational meshes used 3 different resolutions have been defined for each basin and their element size has been adapted to the size of each basin always maintaining a ratio between element sizes of 1 2 5 and 10 2 case studies and available data 2 1 description of the watersheds four river basins located in spain were selected to undertake this study izas caldo landro and genil river basins fig 1 in the choice of the study cases priority has been given to the selection of basins of different size from 0 33 to 3750 km2 mean slope from 7 to 20 and precipitation regime their maximum daily precipitation varies from 36 to 142 8 mm a summary of the main characteristics of each watershed is included in table 1 the genil river basin represents a large low sloped watershed marked by a mediterranean climate with a low base flow during most of the year but with intense rainfall events that produce strong peak flows on the other hand the caldo and landro basins have a steeper topography and are located in an atlantic climate region characterized by a more uniform rainfall regime finally the izas basin is a small mountain catchment located in the pyrenees with steep slopes and a very low concentration time the izas catchment is located in the central spain pyrenees in the upper gállego valley near the spain france border the catchment occupies an extension of 0 33 km2 and is located at an altitude of over 2000 m a s l the catchment is predominantly east orientated with some areas also facing north or south the main ravine is a tributary of the escarra river which in turn is a tributary of the gállego river which finally debouches into the ebro river the entire catchment is located above the upper forest limit and exemplifies the general conditions of subalpine areas of the pyrenees subalpine and alpine grassland domain the landscape although some rocky outcrops are also present in the upper and steeper slopes lana renault et al 2014 lópez moreno et al 2013 revuelto et al 2017 rainy season in this basin is between october and may alvera and garcía ruiz 2000 the caldo river catchment with an area of 38 km2 is located in north west spain in the border with portugal land coverage is dominated by grasslands coniferous and leaf forest and different kind of crops meléndez asensio and del pozo tejado 2019 the region is located in the transition between the mediterranean and eurosiberian biogeographic zones therefore the climate is temperate oceanic sub mediterranean ninyerola et al 2005 the landro river is located in north western spain the total area of its basin is 199 km2 and its mean altitude is below 1000 m a s l this river is born in the gistral mountain range and flows into the cantabrian sea in the viveiro estuary the watershed is covered by eucalyptus and pine forests and scrublands with only a small proportion of cultivated areas in the river floodplains the soil permeability of the basin is low barja and lestegas 1992 rainfall is quite regular throughout the year which reflects an oceanic rainfall regime with maximum flows in winter and minimum flows in summer the genil river basin is located in southern spain and its catchment covers an area of 8200 km2 in its central area is located the iznájar reservoir 981 hm3 which is one of the largest reservoirs in spain this reservoir was designed to absorb the ordinary floods of the river and it completely controls the downstream discharge thus it divides the genil river basin into two subbasins upper and lower genil only the lower genil subbasin has been analysed in this study this basin begins at the iznájar reservoir and ends in the municipality of écija the study area has a total surface of 3750 km2 it is a typical mediterranean landscape with fragile natural ecosystems and insufficient rainfall to allow for quick vegetation regeneration and long term human use the climate is arid with an annual rainfall of 500 mm there is a wide range of vegetation cover including annual crops grassland bushes and woodland however given that the main economic activity in the area is agriculture irrigated crops and rainfed olive groves account for a significant area of the basin 2 2 rainfall events seven rainfall events have been modelled in the study basins 1 event in the izas basin and 2 events in the caldo landro and genil basins all of these are isolated rainfall events that produced high peak flows in the river the observed precipitation and flow data were obtained from different sources for each catchment in the izas basin data were provided by the pyrenean institute of ecology ipe in the caldo basin data were provided by the miño sil river basin management authority chms in the landro basin data were provided by the galician meteorological agency meteogalicia finally in the genil basin data were provided by the guadalquivir river basin management authority chg main characteristics of the rainfall events along with the peak discharge and volume of the observed hydrograph are listed in table 2 due to the small size of the izas and caldo catchments a spatially homogeneous rainfall was assumed in these two basins in the case of the landro and genil basins the spatial distribution of rainfall was estimated from rain gauge and radar data 3 methodology 3 1 digital terrain models the three dtms used in this study are the following 1 the dtm provided by the spanish national geographic institute ign at a 5 m resolution ign cnig 2021 2 the dtm provided by the spanish ign at a 25 m resolution and 3 the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dtm with a grid size of 1 arc second approximately 30 m farr et al 2007 werner 2001 the different spatial resolutions of the 3 dtms are visually compared in fig 2 hereafter these dtms will be referred to as dmt05 dtm25 and dtm30 respectively the first two dtms are derived from the spanish aerial orthophotography national plan in spain pnoa and are freely distributed by the spanish national geographic institute ign ign cnig 2021 dtm05 was obtained by automatic correlation and interactive stereoscopic debugging for the pnoa initiative its rmse in the vertical direction is estimated to be lower than 50 cm pnoa 2015 dtm25 was generated by interpolation of the dtm05 maintaining a rmse value for the elevation differences of 2 9 m martínez et al 2004 nasa shuttle radar topography mission srtm datasets were obtained from a collaborative effort by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the national geospatial intelligence agency nga as well as the participation of the german and italian space agencies with the purpose of generating a near global dtm of the earth using radar interferometry the dtm30 srtm v3 0 1arcsec farr et al 2007 is a near global dtm with a 1 arc second 30 m resolution comprising a combination of data from the srtm and the u s geological survey s gtopo30 data set the primary goal of creating the version 3 data was to eliminate voids that were present in earlier versions of srtm data the global and free availability nasa jpl 2013 of the srtm dtms has led to its application in multiple hydrological studies alsdorf et al 2007 hancock et al 2006 sreedevi et al 2009 according to its mission objectives srtm dtms are expected to have a vertical rmse of 10 m chen et al 2020 farr et al 2007 kellndorfer et al 2004 mukul et al 2015 even though validation studies reported a vertical rmse in europe of 3 8 m carrera hernandez 2021 mukul et al 2017 santillan and makinano santillan 2016 szabó et al 2015 regardless of their origin all these dtms can include sinks that originate from an inadequate elevation precision and closed topographic depressions o callaghan and mark 1984 the majority of depressions in dtms are singularities caused by a failure of the source data to capture the topography s natural break lines insufficient grid resolution random errors that create flow blockages and a surface model s inability to properly represent infrastructure such as culverts and bridges lindsay 2016 most hydrological applications of dtms begin with sink removal to ensures continuous flow paths by flow enforcement techniques including filling and breaching methods martz and garbrecht 1998 this is a commonly used technique as not all hydrological models are able to work with dtms that include depressions or even flat bottom also knowing that such depression filling algorithms have been criticised in the academic literature for their greater impact on dtms lindsay 2016 the authors have avoided using such techniques in order to prevent disturbing the comparison between dtms therefore raw digital models have been used without applying any type of sink filling treatment 3 2 numerical model surface runoff was simulated using the numerical model iber garcía feal et al 2018 which is a gpu parallelized version of the iber model bladé et al 2014 iber is a 2d numerical model for simulating free surface flow and transport processes in shallow waters iber allows calculating rainfall runoff hydrological and inundation hydraulic processes in a coupled way and it has been validated for rainfall runoff modelling in multiple previous works cea et al 2014 2010 cea and bladé 2015 fraga et al 2019 2016 sanz ramos et al 2021 its reliability and computational efficiency has even led iber to be recently incorporated in several flood early warning systems fernández nóvoa et al 2020 fraga et al 2020 gonzález cao et al 2019 the mass and momentum conservation equations solved by the model can be written as follows 1 h t q x x q y y r i 2 q x t x q x 2 h g h 2 2 y q x q y h g h z b x g n 2 h 7 3 q q x 3 q y t x q x q y h y q y 2 h g h 2 2 g h z b y g n 2 h 7 3 q q y where h is the water depth q x q y and q are the two components of the unit discharge and its modulus z b is the bed elevation n is the manning coefficient g is the gravity acceleration r is the rainfall intensity and i the infiltration rate the source terms of precipitation and infiltration can vary in space and time and since both terms are included independently in the hydrodynamic equations infiltration can occur even in the absence of precipitation as long as there is a positive water depth over a mesh element therefore the possible effect of local topographic features on the infiltration rate is implicitly included in the equations however the numerical representation of this process will be dependent on the resolution of the dtm and computational mesh since recent studies have shown that low resolution models tend to poorly represent land surface features and therefore eliminate depressions and barriers that interrupt and retain flow leading to a decrease in cumulative infiltration habtezion et al 2016 the hydrodynamic equations are solved using an unstructured finite volume solver which includes a specific numerical scheme for hydrological applications cea and bladé 2015 this numerical scheme is first order accurate in space and time the geometry of the four catchments was discretized using an unstructured and uniform mesh of triangular elements generated in gid coll et al 2018a 2018b gid adapts the mesh size to the geometry of the model by approximating the element sizes to the value indicated by the modeler the maximum relative error in this size approximation was set at 10 the chosen element size is not constant in all catchments and is detailed in section 3 3 regarding the temporal accuracy of the models the discretization used in this work is explicit in time which implies that the computational time step is constrained by a stability condition cfl condition in addition the dry wet limit has been set equal to 0 1 mm in all simulations in iber the dtm values are interpolated to the nodes of the computational mesh using a bilinear interpolation method the elevation value at each mesh vertex is interpolated using the 4 dtm elevation values closest to the vertex being interpolated bottom friction is modelled in iber with the manning s formula bladé et al 2014 in this work the manning coefficient was defined according to the land use map of the european project corine land cover 2018 clc2018 european union copernicus land monitoring service 2018 and the recommendations of the methodological guide for the development of the national floodplain mapping system ministerio de medio ambiente y medio rural y marino 2011 which proposes a manning coefficient for each of the corine land uses infiltration was modelled following the scs cn methodology mockus 1964 the single parameter of the model the curve number cn was defined according to the rainfall registered the days prior to the start of the event distinguishing between dry cn i normal cn ii or wet cn iii antecedent moisture conditions finally it is worth mentioning that in all simulations a warm up period of the model has been set until the base flow at the beginning of the event is reached table 3 shows the curve number used for each event and the manning coefficient values used for each basin due to the small size of the izas basin a constant cn value has been taken for the whole watershed the genil basin is characterised by low surface runoff coefficients table 2 while for the rest of the basins the surface runoff coefficient remains above 60 in the events of the genil river basin these values drop to 46 and 9 respectively for events 6 and 7 table 1 reveals that the genil catchment is the basin with the lowest annual precipitation but with the highest maximum daily precipitation the lowest value of cn is also found in this basin table 3 with respect to the rest of the watersheds a coherence is observed between the curve number and the runoff coefficient for the analysed events 3 3 spatial discretization as previously mentioned the spatial resolutions of the dtms used in this study are 5 25 and 30 m to achieve a full exploitation of the dtm resolution the cell size of the numerical mesh should be equal to or lower than the resolution of the dtm however the computational cost of using a very fine mesh in models that cover large areas can result in calculation times that are prohibitive for most practical applications especially when using fully distributed hydrological models based on the 2d swe which leads to the use of element sizes larger than the dtm resolution and results in a loss of topographical information this can be partially improved by the use of non uniform meshes with smaller element sizes in the river network and larger sizes in the hillslopes costabile and costanzo 2021 ferraro et al 2020 uber et al 2021 this might improve the accuracy of the results without increasing too much the total number of elements in order to simplify the analysis in this work unstructured uniform meshes were considered implementing a subgrid modelling approach can include some topographical information in the equations when the dtm resolution is much higher than the computational mesh resolution in order to improve the results without affecting too much the computational time such kind of subgrid modelling approaches have been applied to the shallow water equations in previous studies platzek et al 2016 sanders and schubert 2019 shen et al 2015 shustikova et al 2019 volp et al 2013 but have not been used in the present model since they are not implemented in most shallow water models the different size of the catchments analysed in this work from 0 33 to 3750 km2 made it impossible to use the same cell size in all the models due to computational cost limitations in the caldo and landro basins with an area of approximately 40 and 200 km2 the element sizes were 10 25 and 100 m smaller element sizes were not used since they would imply a very high computational cost not affordable in practical applications in the izas basin 0 33 km2 the element sizes used were 1 2 5 and 10 m in order to have some grids with a higher resolution than the finest dtms in the genil basin 3750 km2 it was not possible to reach the mesh resolutions used in the caldo and landro finest meshes so the mesh sizes used were 25 62 5 and 250 m table 4 summarises the main characteristics of the computational grids used a triangular unstructured uniform mesh was used in all cases in the following the mesh sizes will be denoted according to its resolution as fine medium and coarse 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation in order to analyse the degradation of the model output when working with a coarser mesh and a lower resolution dtm the hydrographs computed with the fine mesh and the highest resolution dtm dtm05 were taken as a reference value fig 3 compares for each event the observed hydrograph with the simulated reference hydrograph the visual comparison depicted in fig 3 and the values of mae nse and relative error for hydrograph volume obtained for each case show a reasonably good agreement between numerical results and field data mae of each event has been normalised to the peak flow of the corresponding observed hydrograph to allow a comparison between the different events obtaining an average mae value of 7 of the peak flow the values of the mae qp and nse indicators are satisfactory however it can be observed that the adjustment of the hydrograph volumes in some events is not accurate due to mismatches in the base flow of the numerical model 4 2 effect of the computational mesh and dtm resolutions fig 4 shows the nse coefficient obtained for each of the rainfall events and the overall performance of the different mesh sizes the 3 dtms have very different characteristics so the results of each dtm have been represented in different subplots to help the further analysis regarding the differences between the results obtained for the dtm05 and the dtm25 the nse values are practically analogous between both dtms for all element sizes knowing that the dtm25 is a product created by the ign from the dtm05 the results indicate that the vertical accuracy of the data is more relevant than the spatial horizontal resolution of the dtm itself furthermore it can be seen that at the same mesh resolution fine dtm25 provides comparable results to dtm05 this finding would not follow the trend identified by habtezion et al 2016 who noted that the dtm resolution threshold above which similar results are obtained is equal to 10 m but in the comparison of the different dtms what is most remarkable is the poor results of the dtm30 in the larger catchments events 4 5 6 and 7 although its spatial horizontal resolution is not much higher than that of the dtm25 the nse values in the landro and genil basins are low even for the finest meshes moving on to compare the results of the different mesh sizes fig 4 shows remarkable good outcomes for the izas basin where independently of the dtm used the nse values are always practically equal to 1 regarding the results obtained in caldo and landro where the element sizes are shared the similarity of results between the fine mesh 10 m and the medium mesh 25 m is patent this result is particularly interesting in the case of the dtm05 where the element size of the fine mesh could take advantage of the spatial resolution of the dtm the differences obtained between the fine 10 m and coarse 100 m mesh leaving aside the bad behaviour of the dtm30 in the case of the landro acquire a relative relevance in some cases such as event 4 for the dtm05 and dtm25 where the value of the nse reaches 0 556 and 0 552 respectively the differences in mesh element sizes lead to slightly different results in the genil river basin in the dtm05 and dtm25 again the dtm30 results do not seem to correspond to their lower resolution counterparts the medium mesh 62 5 m obtains results very close to those of the fine mesh 25 m with values still above 0 716 however a strong reduction of the nse is perceived with the coarse mesh 250 m particularly in event 7 this degradation of the result as a function of element size is clearer in fig 5 this figure shows the nse normalized centred root mean square difference e n taylor 2001 and mae results obtained for the different dtms and in relation to the element size of each catchment regarding e n values below 0 5 are assumed to be good as this limit has already been used as a reference in the analysis of streamflow series with this parameter gonzález cao et al 2019 in the case of mae the result has been normalised to the peak flow of the reference hydrograph to facilitate the comparison between the different events the correlation of the results has been estimated with pearson s and spearman s coefficients and their value is indicated for each of the subplots rp and rs respectively again we find here a clear analogy between the nse values obtained for the dtm05 and dtm25 and it is seen how this result holds with the e n and mae qp values too also the dtm30 differs from the dtm05 and dtm25 especially for the landro and genil basins the largest ones a larger surface area in these catchment favours the appearance of outlier points with low accuracy which together with the low runoff depth value of the events in landro and genil relative to the izas and caldo events intensifies the degradation of the outflow hydrograph regarding the results obtained for the mesh sizes although the number of data is not high a quasi linear relationship is observed in the metrics corresponding to the dtm05 and dtm25 in particular for both dtms the good results obtained from a threshold close to 25 m stand out since all nse values are above 0 913 e n values are below 0 293 and mae qp values are below 0 028 apart from this the results obtained with the dtm05 and dtm25 for the fine meshes are also remarkable as a representative example fig 6 includes the hydrographs obtained for event 5 landro river basin in this figure it can be seen how visually the results obtained with the dtm05 and dtm25 for the fine and medium meshes are similar and very close to the reference hydrograph finest mesh and dtm05 another significant result is that dtm25 and especially the dtm30 for fine and medium mesh tend to underestimate the peak of the hydrograph this pattern has been repeated in the rest of the events these results are in line with what was highlighted by habtezion et al 2016 where it was observed that coarse resolution dtms 10 m tend to overestimate ponded areas and therefore to reduce and delay the peak of the hydrograph however in view of the results obtained where there is a large underestimation of the peak flow by the dtm30 at a different magnitude than the dtm25 it could be deduced that this trend is not only linked to the horizontal resolution of the dtm but also to its vertical accuracy the outflow hydrograph can be affected by the water retention capacity of the dtm used the effect that the study dtms have on this accumulation of water on the model surface is shown in fig 7 taking as representative example the event 4 registered in the landro river basin fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of the maximum depths obtained for the 3 dtms and the finest mesh the model s runoff volume at each timestep has also been added the results observed at fig 7 confirm the relevance of the dtm change in the model outcome when the results obtained for the three dtms are compared it can be seen that despite maintaining the same mesh resolution fine and despite having a dtm horizontal resolution close to the dtm25 dtm30 notably increase the surface storage capacity of the model this increase in storage capacity is less relevant in the izas and caldo basins in addition this increase in storage capacity is also related to the increase in the size of the mesh elements this effect influences the poor results of coarse meshes and as caviedes voullième et al 2012 has already indicated it is in part due to the poor topographic representation of the terrain since local minima and maxima may be poorly represented with coarse meshes which results in static ponded water which cannot flow further this effect is enhanced in events that have much lower peak flows e g event 7 with lower peak flow than event 6 for a better understanding of the differences obtained with the dtm30 regarding the dtm25 and dtm05 it is necessary to look at the origin of the dtms themselves the dtm05 and dtm25 are lidar derived dtms however dtm30 is created via insar i e active sensor even though active sensors have its advantages over passive sensors e g active sensors are considered to penetrate more the vegetation than an active sensor it is a technique that cannot compete with the precision of lidar in fact in works such as courty et al 2019 where the accuracy of different open access dtms including a srtm product in flood modelling is compared the lidar derived dtm values are taken as a reference for the evaluation criteria in order to analyse the effect of the different dtms on the computational mesh fig 8 shows the comparison between some cross sections belonging again to the landro river basin reproduced with the different calculation meshes used in the numerical simulations in particular as an example three cross sections have been considered in line with previous statements compared to the reference case dtm05 and fine mesh the performance of the dtm25 is remarkable together with the less accurate reproduction of dtm30 in the results obtained with the fine mesh a mae of less than 0 7 m has been obtained in the 3 sections related to dtm25 and however this value rises to more than 12 m in sections 1 and 2 corresponding to the dtm30 furthermore for dtm05 and dtm25 the results obtained with the medium mesh reproduce reasonably well the profile obtained with the fine mesh the maximum mae is obtained in section 2 for dtm25 and is equal to 4 27 m nevertheless with the coarse mesh the obtained profiles are visibly far from a correct representation of the reference profile greatly limiting the drainage capacity of the section for example the mae resulted for dtm05 and coarse mesh in section 3 is equal to 10 62 m 4 3 runtime the runtime increment of each simulation with respect to the runtime obtained with the dtm05 and the fine mesh is represented in fig 9 in general the runtimes obtained with the dtm25 tend to be equal or slightly lower than those of the dtm05 this result is affected by the fact that the dtm25 is smoother than the dtm05 which results in somewhat higher depths or velocities being generated in some areas of the model in the latter case since the temporal discretization of the numerical model is subject to a courant friedrichs lewy cfl stability constraint over the computational time step cea and bladé 2015 numerically and under a constant element size the increase in water velocity and depth is compensated by a reduction in the time step this implies a smaller computational time step in the simulations performed with the dtm05 so its computation time is in general equal to or higher than that obtained in the dtm25 simulations something similar is also true for the dtm30 the runtimes obtained with this dtm tend to be always equal to or higher than the rest of the dtms dtm30 has a lower quality than the rest of dtms which causes significant water accumulations in the model that affect its runtime in some cases the difference in runtime increment of dtm30 is particularly relevant e g event 6 and fine mesh in these cases the resolution of the mesh aggravates the imperfections of the dtm30 and has an effect on this increase in the runtime the size of the mesh elements has a direct implication on the cfl condition a larger element size leads to an increase in computational time step and therefore a decrease of the runtime overall the use of the medium mesh with elements 2 5 times larger than those of fine mesh instead of the fine mesh results in a reduction of approximately 90 of the calculation time the simulations carried out with the coarse mesh with elements 10 times larger than those of fine mesh further reduce the calculation time reaching a reduction of more than 99 in izas landro and genil basins 5 conclusions with the recent development of fully distributed hydrological models and their application to large catchments the spatial resolution of the mesh and model inputs becomes highly relevant this study was intended to understand the effects that different dtm and mesh resolutions have on the simulation results both output hydrographs and runtimes thus seven observed rainfall events corresponding to 4 basins have been selected to be modelled using the iber numerical model each of the events was simulated for 3 different mesh sizes and for 3 different dtms making a total of 63 simulations 9 per event the hydrographs obtained for the higher resolution dtm and the finest mesh have been taken as a reference synthetic observation the results obtained indicate that under the same mesh resolution the vertical accuracy of the dtm has a greater effect on the outflow hydrograph of the model than the horizontal resolution of the dtm despite a five fold increase in spatial resolution the results obtained with the 25 m dtm dtm25 were very similar to those obtained with the 5 m dtm dtm05 results that have not been correctly reproduced by the 30 m dtm dtm30 in addition it has also been shown that mesh resolutions up to a threshold of 25 m together with a lidar based dtm with a horizontal resolution higher than 25 m did provide comparable results with regard to the outlet hydrograph the values obtained with a 25 m resolution mesh have achieved a minimum value of 0 913 in terms of nse maximum value of 0 293 of normalized centred root mean square difference e n and 0 028 of mae normalised to the peak flow along with a 90 saving in runtime compared the result of a 2 5 times higher resolution mesh in the application of fully distributed hydrological models based on the 2d shallow water equations the use of global datasets should be limited only to those locations where lidar data are not available in the case of using a lower resolution than the lidar based dtm the topography should be defined from a resampling of this product rather than from global datasets these conclusions are consistent at least for fully distributed hydrological models based on the shallow water equations with a uniform unstructured computational mesh and only with regard to the outflow hydrograph of the basin the possible degradation of other distributed hydrological outputs such as depth and velocity maps has not been analysed in this article but will be considered for further work credit authorship contribution statement gonzalo garcía alén conceptualization methodology writing original draft jose gonzález

3059,the contribution of geogenic phosphorus p in groundwater to surface water eutrophication has become a major concern for aquatic environment protection but the differences in groundwater p sources in different geological settings are less concerned in this study three areas in the central yangtze river basin under various geological conditions were selected for the identification of groundwater p sources and key factors affecting p enrichment using hydrogeochemical and geostatistical methods it was found that p in groundwater of middle and upper pleistocene aquifers is mainly geogenic and is little affected by anthropogenic activities in the lower reaches of the han river an area with phosphate mining upstream the dissolution of phosphate minerals such as apatite from p rich strata is the main source of groundwater p feature importance of ca2 39 along the jingjiang river an area with widespread peat deposition in paleo channels and ancient lakes the mineralization of organic p op is the dominant groundwater p source feature importance of nh4 n 46 with the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides as a secondary source feature importance of fe2 26 in the western part of the dongting plain an area with iron rich sedimentary rocks and granites in the surrounding mountains the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides is the main source of p in groundwater feature importance of fe2 34 with mineralization of organic p as a secondary but important source feature importance of nh4 n 25 the differences in groundwater p sources in different subareas are clearly linked to specific geological conditions this study provides new insights into the dependence of p source and enrichment in groundwater systems on regional geology and highlights the importance of using a wide range of research methods for understanding the extremely complex processes in the subsurface environment keywords phosphorus groundwater geology central yangtze river data availability i have shared the link to my data at the attach file step 1 introduction eutrophication of water bodies is a global environmental problem and phosphorus p as a limiting nutrient is often a key factor controlling this phenomenon in freshwater water bodies ala aho et al 2013 worsfold et al 2016 ostad ali askari et al 2017 charlton et al 2018 in recent years numerous studies have demonstrated that the input of p rich groundwater an important p source of surface water results in an increased risk of surface water eutrophication holman et al 2010 meinikmann et al 2015 javadinejad et al 2019 kazmierczak et al 2020 förster et al 2021 consequently there is an urgent need to enhance our understanding of the sources of p in groundwater heiberg et al 2010 prem et al 2015 the increase in p concentrations in groundwater has been commonly attributed to anthropogenic activities such as the application of fertilizers and pesticides and the discharge of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater lewandowski et al 2015 ančić et al 2020 huang et al 2020 nafchi et al 2021 however the importance of natural i e geogenic p in groundwater has received little attention water quality monitoring in new zealand indicated that high p concentrations were only observed in old groundwater presumably affected by specific geological or hydrogeological conditions morgenstern and daughney 2012 other studies have attributed the p enrichment in groundwater primarily to complex geochemical processes such as the mineralization of organic p and the desorption and dissolution of p containing minerals carlyle and hill 2001 lewandowski and nutzmann 2010 neidhardt et al 2018 yu et al 2018 kazmierczak et al 2020 tao et al 2020 tao et al 2022 the enrichment of geogenic p in groundwater should be definitely associated with specific geological or hydrogeological settings however no work has been done on the differences in the sources of p in pristine groundwater under different geological conditions the central yangtze river basin is characterized by abundant water resources and has critical eco environmental functions within the whole yangtze catchment previous investigations have identified high concentrations of arsenic ammonium and p in the porous aquifer in the basin where high p concentrations 1 mg l were mainly distributed along the jingjiang river and the han river deng et al 2018 huang et al 2021 du et al 2020a tao et al 2020 moreover recent studies have found that groundwater in the western part of the dongting plain also exhibits a high p concentration up to 3 58 mg l tao et al 2022 groundwater with high p concentrations may be a source of elevated nutrient levels in rivers and lakes in the central yangtze river basin due to groundwater discharge sun et al 2021a the vast central yangtze river basin has a rather complex geological history and consequently the geological and hydrogeological settings differ considerably among subareas however the link between the sources of groundwater p and different geological settings within the central yangtze river basin is still poorly understood multivariate geostatistical methods are effective tools for studying the spatial and temporal changes in water quality or identifying sources of contamination nolan and hitt 2006 kazakis et al 2017 podgorski and berg 2020 and are able to reveal intrinsical relationships between geological data and data on the groundwater environment principal component analysis pca and multiple linear regression mlr are commonly used in hydrogeochemical studies to identify sources of contamination and geochemical factors affecting groundwater quality by reducing dimensionality and extracting variables thereby helping to explain various hydrochemical processes

field of hydrogeochemistry rf is extensively applied to establish transport models of groundwater contaminants and accurately identify key geochemical factors that affect water quality rodriguez galiano et al 2014 knoll et al 2020 podgorski and berg 2020 it is particularly useful for multi source studies with high dimensional data and non linear relationships this study targeted three high p

affecting the groundwater p concentrations using a combination of water chemistry analysis ion ratio analysis pca mlr and rf this study not only provides a more comprehensive understanding of geogenic p enrichment in groundwater from a geological standpoint but also highlights the importance of using a wide range of research methods for understanding the extremely complex processes in the subsurface environment 2 study areas the study areas are located in the jianghan dongting plain of the central yangtze river basin fig 1 belonging to a subtropical humid monsoon climate precipitation occurs mostly from april to september the annual average precipitation is 1100 1400 mm and the annual average temperature is 15 17 c the geomorphology in the basin mainly consists of the surrounding hilly plain area and the central low plain area the abundant groundwater resources in the basin are mainly stored in the thick quaternary strata the strata have wide distribution with a total area of 5 104 km2 and a maximum depth of 200 300 m and strong water storage capacity with groundwater exploitable resources of 168 108 m3 a the groundwater flow in the jianghan plain is generally from west northwest to east south and eventually flows to the han river and yangtze river in the dongting plain groundwater flows southward from the north and eventually is discharged into the dongting lake fig s1 the quaternary aquifer systems are mainly divided into porous phreatic aquifer of holocene porous confined aquifer of middle and upper pleistocene and porous fissured confined aquifer of lower pleistocene fig s2 the porous confined aquifer is the main extraction layer of groundwater in the basin due to its wide distribution and the abundance of water gan et al 2014 however owing to the influence of the paleogeography and depositional environment the quaternary aquifers in different subareas have contrasting characteristics yin et al 2007 duan et al 2015 table 1 the lower reaches of the han river lhr the transition zone of hilly plains at the northern edge of the jianghan plain is adjacent to the lhr the quaternary strata in the transition zone of hilly plains are dominated by alluvial and lacustrine sediments and the phreatic aquifer is about 10 m thick mainly clay silty clay and silt with low permeability the thickness of the porous confined aquifer ranges from 50 to 60 m and the aquifer medium primarily consists of a thick layer of gravel and sandy gravel gu et al 2018 sun et al 2021b controlled by the regional topography groundwater generally flows from west northwest to southeast the geological background in this subarea is affected by the adjacent p rich mining area a number of large or small p rich mining sites are distributed in the northwest hilly area of the lhr of which the most notable is jingxiang phosphate mine the p bearing rock system of the doushantuo formation is characterized by stable distribution small variation and high capacity the phosphorite accounts for 19 of the p bearing rocks xiao et al 2015 the jingjiang river reach jjr the jingjiang section of the yangtze river flows through the jianghan dongting plain from west to east the plain was formed along the riverbank due to alluviation the lithology of the porous phreatic aquifer is mainly silty clay and silt with low permeability the porous confined aquifer as the main layer for local groundwater extraction is mainly composed of silty sand sand and gravel with a thickness of 20 50 m during the late pleistocene incised valleys were formed along the jingjiang river section due to the decline in sea level since the last deglaciation the incised valleys were rapidly filled due to the rapid increase in sea level zhou 1994 wang et al 2018 as a result there are a number of buried paleo channels along the meandering bank of the jingjiang river and the channels were deposited with peat layers yang 1959 since the holocene the ancient yunmeng swamp known as a vast ancient lake was formed where the aquatic plants flourished to facilitate the formation of peat yang 1986 zhou 1994 liu et al 2020 the western part of the dongting plain wdtp the dongting plain is an alluvial lacustrine plain formed by the alluviation of the yangtze river and four large inflowing rivers xiang river zi river yuan river li river to the yangtze river as well as widespread lacustrine deposition since the holocene zhang et al 2007 the porous phreatic aquifer consists of silty clay sandy clay and fine sand the porous confined aquifer is composed of alluvial lacustrine sediments silt fine sand medium coarse sand gravel with a thickness of 50 100 m when the incised valleys of the jingjiang river were formed in the late pleistocene the four large rivers flowing to the yangtze river also formed tributary incised valleys accordingly in the western part of the dongting plain the incised valley of the yuan river was the most extensive and widespread thus the sediments filled in this incised valley constituted the main provenance of the aquifer medium the upper reach of the yuan river is distributed in xuefeng mountain where sedimentary rocks and granite bodies dominated by monzonitic granite are developed in the holocene the climate was warm and swamps developed so peat layers were extensively formed yin et al 2007 xu and lai 2019 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection a total of 127 groundwater samples and 13 surface water samples were collected in the central yangtze river basin during wet seasons july and august from 2018 to 2020 the groundwater samples were taken from private tube wells with a small diameter including hand pumped and irrigation pumped wells that are frequently used the sampling depth is 14 50 m which are all screened in the middle and upper pleistocene porous confined aquifer fig 1 prior to sampling the wells were purged for about 10 15 min until the redox potential eh electrical conductivity ec dissolved

analysis pca can reduce the dimension of a dataset by analyzing the relationships among multiple variables to illustrate the main information extracted by many variables with fewer representative factors jolliffe and cadima 2016 when the parameters in the same principal component potentially have the same origin or similar geochemical behaviors in analyzing groundwater quality the water quality factors are described based on a prior understanding of the spatial distribution and hydrogeochemical processes so as to find out the relationships among groundwater quality factors and determine the corresponding controls zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 yang et al 2021 the kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s test were performed to assess the suitability of the data and the independence of the variables kmo is a measure of sampling adequacy that indicates whether the variables can be grouped in a smaller set of potential factors field 2013 and a higher kmo value close to 1 indicates that pca could be useful kotowski et al 2020 bartlett s test of sphericity shows whether the correlation matrix is an identity matrix which can indicate that the variables are not correlated a very low value 0 05 close to 0 of significance for bartlett s test of sphericity indicates that there could be some relationship between variables to satisfy the condition for pca in this study pca was used to generate a biplot to analyze and determine the hydrogeochemical behavior of p in groundwater the analysis was conducted by ibm spss statistical package version 26 3 3 2 multiple linear regression mlr is a classical parametric method to explain the greatest variability in the dependent variable with the least independent variables lachniet and patterson 2006 ouedraogo et al 2019 ordinary least squares are usually used to solve the minimum loss parameters of a model and expressed as a linear equation ibn ali et al 2017 1 y b 0 x 1 b 1 x n b n ε x j j 1 n xi i 1 n represents the independent variable of the regression equation bj j 1 n represents the regression coefficient of the regression equation i e the independent contribution of each independent variable to the dependent variable and ε represents the error term of the regression model which has an expected value of 0 lachniet and patterson 2006 standardized regression coefficients are commonly used to describe the effect degree of the independent variables on the dependent variables and the variables with the greatest impact on the dependent variables can be directly identified the means of residuals in three subareas were close to 0 and the standard deviations were 0 987 lhr 0 963 jjr and 0 975 wdtp thus the residual tests of the dataset were normally distributed prior to establishing models in addition the durbin watson d w statistic was used to check the autocorrelation of residuals which is one of the most common methods for testing first order autocorrelation in statistical analysis ibn ali et al 2017 the stepwise regression for mlr modeling was conducted using ibm spss statistical package version 26 3 3 3 random forest rf is a machine learning algorithm and has been effectively and successfully used in feature selection which can measure the importance of explanatory variables to predictive variable using importance ranking breiman 2001 podgorski and berg 2020 islam et al 2021 the mean decrease in accuracy index based on out of bag oob data to calculate mean square error mse measures the importance of a variable wei et al 2015 knoll et al 2020 if the variable is very important the mse obtained after randomly sampling oob will be very large resulting in a high feature importance value in the rf model the oob data is a random subset of data that is not involved in the tree building process feature selection was embedded in the training process of the integration method then all variables were ranked in descending order to select the most important variables the determined geochemical parameters were selected as potential influencing variables for p and applied to the rf model to determine the most important variable groups in this study the sklearn module was used on the python platform for rf regression and the parameter n estimators was the number of decision trees n estimators 200 criterion mse 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemistry occurring environment of p in groundwater the statistical results of the main hydrogeochemical parameters can be found in table 2 the ph values in three subareas varied within a range of 6 02 7 89 median ph of lhr 6 78 0 02 n 41 median ph of jjr 7 23 0 05 n 42 median ph of wdtp 6 80 0 06 n 41 and the coefficient of variation of ph was the lowest among the groundwater chemistry parameters indicating that the groundwater ph was relatively consistent in all three subareas the variation range of eh showed a weak moderate reducing environment in lhr median eh 52 40 7 81 mv n 41 and wdtp median eh 76 15 0 99 mv n 42 whereas a stronger reducing environment prevailed in jjr median eh 116 95 0 85 mv n 44 table 3 the piper s diagram showed that the main hydrochemical types in the three sampling subareas were primarily hco3 ca mg fig s1 hco3 was the main anion in all three subareas and the average milligram equivalent percentages were 92 75 lhr 92 69 jjr and 98 04 wdtp the main cation was ca2 and the average milligram equivalent percentages were 59 44 lhr 62 66 jjr and 46 75 wdtp a significant positive correlation was observed between ca2 and hco3 in the groundwater of three subareas fig 2 indicating the dominant influence of carbonate mineral weathering on the chemical composition of the groundwater although ion exchange with clay minerals cannot be ruled out the concentrations of cl so4 2 and no3 in all samples in wdtp and most samples in lhr and jjr were quite low although a few samples in lhr and jjr had elevated concentrations of these components moreover the samples in the confined aquifer were quite concentrated in piper s diagram and only a few groundwater samples with relatively shallow depth were overlapped with surface water samples these suggested that the target aquifers in the three subareas were not significantly influenced by anthropogenic activities because there were no evaporates such as gypsum and halite in the quaternary sediments du et al 2018 groundwater tdp in lhr had the widest range of concentrations 0 04 51 14 mg l median value 0 38 3 14 mg l n 41 jjr had the second widest tdp concentration range 0 03 4 31 mg l median value 0 25 1 46 mg l n 42 while groundwater tdp concentrations in wdtp had the smallest variation 0 12 3 58 mg l median value 1 00 0 70 mg l the high tdp concentrations corresponded to low concentrations of cl so4 2 and no3 indicating that the high p in groundwater of the middle and upper pleistocene aquifers should not result from anthropogenic activities the highest average concentration of nh4 n 8 86 mg l was observed in jjr the highest average concentration of fe 11 4 mg l was observed in the groundwater of wdtp table 2 4 2 correlation and principal component analysis potential sources of p in groundwater to identify the main sources of p in groundwater of the middle and upper pleistocene aquifers the relationship between tdp and other components in different sampling subareas was described using correlation analysis ca and pca figs 2 3 we selected 13 chemical parameters tds ca2 mg2 k na cl hco3 eh ph doc as fe2 and nh4 n that were major components of groundwater chemistry or had been found to be related to the fate of p in previous studies griffioen 2006 fendorf et al 2010 martins et al 2014 lewandowski et al 2015 gao et al 2020 neidhardt et al 2021 the kmo of all three sampling subareas exceeded 0 5 indicating that the data were suitable for pca bartlett s test yielded a significance level 0 05 near 0 indicating that there could be a statistically significant interrelationship between these variables the relationship between each parameter and tdp was plotted figs 2 3 for lhr the variable tdp was distributed in the upper right quadrant of the pca biplot fig 3a and tds ca2 mg2 na cl and doc exhibited similar trends on the same principal component besides tdp showed a significant positive correlation with ca2 and mg2 indicating that p enrichment may be related to water rock interaction fig 2a in jjr pca showed that tdp was closely related to as fe2 k cl doc and nh4 n for pc1 fig 3b tdp was significantly positively correlated with the variables nh4 n fe2 and doc fig 2b particularly with nh4 n indicating there may be two processes controlling p release in groundwater i e the reductive dissolution of feooh and the mineralization of organic p du et al 2020b tao et al 2020 in wdtp tdp was consistent with as fe2 k doc and nh4 n for pc1 fig 3c tdp was significantly positively correlated with fe2 nh4 n k and doc and especially with fe2 which may indicate that processes controlling p enrichment were similar to jjr but with a different order of importance kazmierczak et al 2020 fig 2c based on the results from the correlation analysis and pca and understanding about hydrogeochemical processes martins et al 2014 lewandowski et al 2015 tao et al 2020 the p in groundwater in the three sampling subareas may be associated with multiple sources including phosphate mineral dissolution mineralization of organic p and iron redox processes table 4 4 2 1 dissolution of calcium p minerals phosphate minerals such as fluorapatite hydroxyapatite and carbonate fluorapatite are widely distributed in geological environments most of phosphate minerals are apatite fayiga and nwoke 2016 which is a general term for phosphate minerals containing calcium calcium bearing phosphate minerals tend to occur as impurities in authigenic calcium carbonate minerals at quite low levels and contribute little to p enrichment in aquifers orihel et al 2017 however in p rich strata calcium phosphate minerals could considerably affect groundwater p concentrations harned et al 1998 shand et al 2007 proposed that apatite in aquifer matrices is an important natural source of p the p is released by the weathering of apatite minerals equation 2 filippelli 2001 dorozhkin 2012 ca5 po4 3 oh h 5ca2 3po4 3 h2o 2 this process is mainly affected by factors such as ph t and alkalinity and is insensitive to the precipitation and dissolution processes driven by redox changes orihel et al 2017 the solubility of hydroxyapatite increases as ph decreases and the precipitation of hydroxyapatite is triggered at ph 7 guidry and mackenzie 2003 in addition groundwater p can be enriched by the dissolution of calcite kazmierczak et al 2020 correlation plots and pca plots figs 2a and 3a indicated that the dissolution of calcium p minerals may be the main process responsible for p mobilization in lhr 4 2 2 mineralization of organic p the aquifer matrices consisted of alluvial lacustrine sediments containing buried peat layers and abundant biodegradable organic matter xu and lai 2019 liu et al 2020 the significant positive correlation between tdp and nh4 n suggested the enrichment of p was closely related to nh4 n mobilization fig 2b c fig 3b c previous studies found that the mineralization of organic matter led to the release of nh4 n in groundwater systems du et al 2020b huang et al 2021 thus the process leading to p release could be closely related to the mineralization of organic matter especially in jjr and wdtp the release of p can be described via the following reaction equation 3 tao et al 2020 ch2onxpy hco3 aq yhpo4 2 h2po4 aq xnh4 n aq other components 3 the terminal electron acceptors required for the mineralization of organic matter are typically o2 aerobic respiration nitrate denitrification mn iv fe iii sulfate etc lovley et al 2004 himmelheber et al 2009 in anoxic environments p containing organic matter generally takes mn iv fe iii sulfate etc as electron acceptors canavan et al 2006 katsev and dittrich 2013 phosphates are directly produced from the mineralization of organic matter during the aforementioned processes increasing the tdp concentrations in the groundwater of jjr and wdtp 4 2 3 reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides p rich iron minerals are important p reservoirs in groundwater because p is associated with redox sensitive iron oxyhydr oxides by forming mineral crystals or adsorption afforded by their high specific surface area kraal et al 2015 neidhardt et al 2018 nisbeth et al 2019 in anoxic environments the fe iii of iron oxyhydr oxides are used as electron acceptors and reduced by organic matter followed by the release of p bound to iron oxyhydr oxides into groundwater heiberg et al 2010 katsev and dittrich 2013 prem et al 2015 neidhardt et al 2018 rakhimbekova et al 2021 under reducing conditions the reaction is as follows equation 4 tao et al 2020 po4 fe o fe2 aq hpo4 2 aq h2po4 aq 4 eh and fe2 are two important chemical parameters associated with p mobilization in groundwater due to the negative correlation trend between eh and tdp fig 3b c and the significant positive correlation between fe2 and tdp fig 2b c this indicated that the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides was an important contributor to groundwater p enrichment in jjr and wdtp 4 2 4 anthropogenic activities groundwater tdp was weakly correlated with cl and k figs 2 3 which may be related to domestic sewage and agricultural activities du et al 2020a kazmierczak et al 2020 however clayey sediments 10 m thick were deposited in the uppermost layer of the study area forming a hydraulic barrier that prevented the direct infiltration of anthropogenic p at the surface therefore although the possibility that anthropogenic activities contribute to groundwater p concentrations cannot be excluded in the study area the extensive input from anthropogenic activities is impossible the sources and processes leading to p enrichment in the middle and upper pleistocene aquifer of the study area are determined to be related to the weathering of calcium p minerals mineralization of organic matter and reductive dissolution of p rich iron minerals however the relative contributions of the three processes have not yet been determined 4 3 ion ratio multiple linear regression and random forest relative importance of p sources in groundwater 4 3 1 source apportionment using ion ratios the nh4 n p 16 1 ratio is known as the redfield ratio in wetland vegetation redfield 1963 bedford et al 1999 slomp and van cappellen 2004 the redfield ratio may be varied by the limitation of n and p in different spatial scales slomp and van cappellen 2004 sterner et al 2008 however the ratio will eventually reach a stable range during biogeochemical cycles because microbial communities or other organisms tend to get rid of excess proportions elser et al 2005 fitter and hillebrand 2009 when the nh4 n p ratio is equal to the redfield ratio tdp is almost derived from the mineralization of organic p slomp and van cappellen 2004 which releases ammonium and p and ammonium is rarely oxidized in the anoxic aquifer du et al 2020a changes in the ratio can be used to identify p sources especially to distinguish between the effects of organic p mineralization and those of other processes such as mineral dissolution and desorption slomp and van cappellen 2004 tao et al 2020 tao et al 2022 additional p input from other sources will result in nh4 n p staying below 16 when there is a contribution from other p sources i e dissolution of calcium p minerals reductive dissolution of p rich iron minerals the amount of p from other p sources is compared with the amount of p released from the mineralization of organic p based on the redfield ratio and nh4 n concentration in the sample if the former is less than the latter i e 8 nh4 n p 16 mineralization of organic p still dominates if the former is greater than the latter i e nh4 n p 8 the other sources are the controlling process for p enrichment in groundwater tao et al 2020 the nh4 n p results of the groundwater samples in the three subareas can be seen in fig 4 a b c in lhr p was dominated by other sources in 68 29 of groundwater samples fig 4a the relatively low iron concentrations and the weak relationship between iron and p concentrations in this subarea suggested that the dissolution of calcium p minerals was the primary source of p table 2 figs 2 3 on the other hand the significant positive correlation between ca2 and tdp indicated that p was derived from the weathering and dissolution of calcium p minerals griffioen 2006 the saturation index si calculated by phreeqc is a parameter that can characterize the saturation state of minerals relative to groundwater and helps to predict whether minerals tend to dissolve or precipitate into groundwater the si values of 58 54 of groundwater samples in lhr median si of 0 48 n 41 were 0 suggesting hydroxyapatite tends to be continuously dissolved to release p moreover a super saturated state of hydroxyapatite does not indicate precipitation because a ph above 7 triggers its precipitation guidry and mackenzie 2003 lewandowski et al 2015 fig 5 a the positive si values of calcite median si of 0 12 n 41 indicated the precipitation of minerals which could impose a negative impact on p concentrations table s3 in summary the dissolution of primary calcium phosphate minerals was the main source of p in the groundwater of lhr and the contributions of organic p mineralization and dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides were relatively small similarly the geogenic p of groundwater samples in jjr was mainly derived from the mineralization of organic p because 76 19 of groundwater samples were equal to the redfield ratio fig 4b this was further supported by the significantly positive correlation between nh4 n and tdp fig 2b because these two components may have similar sources of organic matter du et al 2018 huang et al 2021 in wdtp p in 20 45 of the groundwater samples were only derived from organic p mineralization in 68 18 of the samples p was primarily released by other sources fig 4c among which the reductive dissolution of p rich iron minerals was dominant this is because correlation analysis and pca reveal a close association between tdp and fe2 fig 2c fig 3c the groundwater environment in wdtp is highly reducing and weakly acidic neutral which can favor the reductive dissolution of secondary iron oxyhydr oxides pan et al 2019 the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides is sensitive to redox related factors and other parameters such as ph and ionic strength meanwhile the mineralization of organic matter can lead to changes in these parameters and then affect the precipitation of minerals and result in the adsorption of the released p the ratio of tdp to fe2 provides another perspective on the p mobilization driven by the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides and the mineralization of organic matter i e immobilization neidhardt et al 2018 kazmierczak et al 2020 the fe2 p ratio of 2 in pore water could effectively immobilize the released p which in turn would affect the concentration of p in groundwater davis and kent 1990 ma et al 2017 in jjr and wdtp 83 33 and 70 45 of groundwater samples had fe2 p 2 respectively fig 4e f this suggested that more p tends to be immobilized by newly formed iron minerals in jjr which is consistent with the redfield ratio in other words the mineralization of organic p was a dominant process and reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides was a secondary process in jjr the potential factors that affect p concentrations in groundwater were identified using ca pca and ion ratios these geochemical parameters were applied in mlr and rf as potential influencing variables to further elucidate the key factors affecting p concentrations in groundwater the initial 13 indicators refined by ca and pca were applied in the following methods 4 3 2 using mlr and rf to identify key factors controlling p in groundwater mlr aims to use the fewest explanatory variables to explain the maximum change in the response variable i e extract the relevant variables that control p enrichment in groundwater based on the aforementioned understanding of p geochemical processes ca2 eh ph doc hco3 as fe2 and nh4 n were selected as independent variables xi and the dependent variable y was tdp during data processing the inherent nonlinear properties of p enrichment may reduce the applicability of linear models however mlr aims to obtain a satisfactory explanation of the geochemical effects based on the level of correlation between multiple variables and p rather than the univariate level of p therefore the predictive accuracy of the model is not a major consideration the d w values of the residuals of the regression model ranged between 1 664 and 1 953 table s2 in the range of 1 to 3 and close to 2 indicating there was no significant correlation between the residuals i e independent residuals field 2013 all of these indicate that models satisfied the basic assumptions of mlr applications courville and thompson 2001 all three mlr models meet the basic assumptions of mlr application statistical fitting of the regression model f 10 p 0 001 indicated that the f test in the regression model yielded good statistical significance analysis of the t value and standardized coefficient b value analysis was performed to investigate each input variable on the accurate impact of groundwater tdp for the regression equation in lhr only the variable ca2 passed the t test with the b value of 0 486 thus tdp may be primarily changed with ca2 the weathering of phosphate minerals formed from the combination of calcium and phosphate can explain the enrichment of dissolved phosphate in groundwater mcginley et al 2016 in jjr three variables passed the t test namely nh4 n hco3 and eh the standardized coefficient for nh4 n 0 941 was the highest so these three variables jointly affected tdp the close association among nh4 n eh and p can be explained by the mineralization of organic matter resulting in p release nh4 n enrichment and enhanced reducing environment in groundwater tao et al 2020 furthermore the negative sign on hco3 was commonly explained by the competitive adsorption between the two on kaolinite and montmorillonite yang and tang 1999 orihel et al 2017 which was possibly occurring in groundwater of jjr due to the wide occurrence of clay minerals in aquifer medium qiu et al 2022 the maximum b value of the equation indicates that nh4 n exerts the greatest influence on tdp and organic matter mineralization could be the main source of tdp in wdtp fe2 and nh4 n passed the t test with the b values of 0 517 and 0 390 respectively fe2 may have been more significantly affecting groundwater p compared with nh4 n thus groundwater p may be more susceptible to the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides and mineralization of organic matter stays a secondary contribution in the environment of sluggish groundwater flow in wdtp kraal et al 2015 neidhardt et al 2018 mlr can only explain the partial variance of independent variables and express the linear relationship between independent and dependent variables in contrast rf is non parametric and can deal with nonlinear and hierarchical relationships that mlr cannot handle variable importance can be used as an indicator to support p source identification the higher the mse value the higher the indicative importance explanatory variables were selected as eh ca2 fe2 doc nh4 n and as based on statistical analyses including ca pca and mlr while the predictor was tdp the larger the value of the feature important function the greater the influence of the explanatory variable on tdp fig 6 the most important feature in lhr was ca2 0 39 consistent with the analysis of mlr as well as ca and pca which indicated the dominant influence of the weathering of calcium containing phosphate minerals doc and fe2 ranked the second and third respectively with much smaller values 0 18 and 0 16 indicating that mineralization of organic matter and reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides had certain contributions to p enrichment but were not the controlling processes in lhr in the second and third groups of features the redox sensitive variables fe2 and nh4 n had higher ranks indicating that the redox conditions had a significant influence on groundwater p concentrations in jjr and wdtp fig 6 specifically nh4 n came in first importance as well as the strongest positive correlation with tdp in jjr fig 2b 6 furthermore nh4 n and doc were significantly positively correlated indicating organic matter mineralization fig 2b it suggested that the mineralization of organic matter occurred directly responsible for p enrichment in addition this process may promote the dissolution of iron minerals and further release p supported by a significant correlation between tdp and fe2 fig 2b in contrast fe2 has a dominant influence on tdp in wdtp consistent with the biggest correlation coefficient between them fig 2c 6 the same second rank of nh4 n in ca mlr and rf compared with fe2 indicated that reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides may be the main mechanism responsible for p enrichment in groundwater and mineralization of organic matter also participates as an important process fig 2c 6 in addition based on the results of mlr and rf as which may be competitively adsorbed with p and widely distributed in groundwater of the study area fendorf et al 2010 gan et al 2014 deng et al 2018 did not affect p fate clearly the results of the most significant variables on tdp in two models are highly consistent which are confirmed in both simple linear relationships and complex nonlinear relationships rf offers the absolute advantage of reliability and stability in a real environment making it suitable for the complex environment of groundwater knoll et al 2020 islam et al 2021 4 4 linking p sources in groundwater to the geological background the results of ca and pca showed that the dissolution of calcium phosphate mineral mineralization of organic matter and reductive dissolution of p rich iron oxyhydr oxides were mainly responsible for the enrichment of groundwater p in the three sampling subareas within the central yangtze river basin subsequently the differences in the relationships of the geochemical parameters among the three sampling subareas were identified based on the comparison of the ion ratio characteristics and the selection of mlr and rf features these analyses together suggested that the differential sources and enrichment of p in groundwater of the middle and upper pleistocene aquifers were largely controlled by geological settings the sampling subarea in lhr is located downstream of the famous jingxiang phosphate ore belt in china where phosphate ore resources are concentrated and the apatite content is high xiao et al 2015 some small phosphate mines belonging to the jingxiang phosphate ore belt are located in the northwest hills and close to the sampling subarea in lhr with a distance of about 20 km the upstream phosphate mining areas have been subjected to weathering and phosphate minerals affected by long term weathering may accumulate in nearby strata downstream making the strata rich in p apatite has poor solubility which reduces as ph increases so neutral groundwater may not provide a favorable environment for apatite dissolution guidry and mackenzie 2003 nevertheless the long term interactions between water and phosphate minerals induced by the abundant rainfall in the region can result in a high tdp in environments where common minerals continue to be dissolved elevated p concentrations in groundwater persist high phosphorus concentrations were also detected in groundwater in contact with phosphate minerals such as apatite in the coastal plain of north carolina harned et al 1998 the high tdp concentrations 1 mg l in jjr are densely distributed along the meandering bank where the thick paleo channel sediments were deposited historically the jingjiang river valley was incised due to the colder climate during the last glacial period and the incised valley was later rapidly filled where the buried plant debris is conducive to the deposition of organic matter zhou 1994 wang et al 2018 the plant debris buried in these sediments provided the source for the mineralization of organic matter which formed the main source of groundwater p in jjr later in addition the thick clayey sediments deposited since the holocene formed an anaerobic and reducing environment which further favored p enrichment furthermore the accumulation of carbonate minerals and granite from the upper reaches of the yangtze river provided iron oxyhydr oxides for groundwater and the reducing environment resulted in the reductive dissolution of these iron oxyhydr oxides which also favored p enrichment in groundwater yang and tang 1999 the adjacent wdtp was mainly influenced by the xiang river zi river yuan river and li river which originated in the surrounding mountains especially the yuan river studies of the sand and gravel layer components showed that the gravel composition was mainly composed of veined quartz siliceous minerals etc and that the upper clayey layer contained ferromanganese nodules zhang et al 2007 heavy mineral analysis of quaternary sediments in wdtp found that stable minerals such as magnetite hematite and siderite in the sediments occurred more commonly mainly from the weathering of rocks such as granites and shales along the yuan river and zi river during the period of expansion of the dongting lake zhou 1994 bai et al 2010 these could indicate that the reductive dissolution of iron minerals was the primary source of p in groundwater moreover the organic matter deposited in different periods coupled with the reducing environment provided favorable conditions for microbially mediated reductive dissolution of iron oxide and organic matter mineralization resulting in elevated p concentrations in summary the pristine geological environment inherently causes differences in p sources in the p rich groundwater of the middle and upper pleistocene aquifers of different subareas within the central yangtze river basin 5 conclusions geostatistical analysis of hydrogeochemical data was made to identify the main sources of groundwater p in the middle and upper pleistocene aquifers in three typical areas within the central yangtze river basin under different geological settings ca and pca indicate that p in groundwater is mainly geogenic and is little affected by anthropogenic activities dissolution of phosphate minerals mineralization of organic matter and reductive dissolution of iron minerals are potential sources of groundwater p subsequently ion ratios mlr and rf models indicated that the most representative characteristic variables for p were ca2 in lhr nh4 n in jjr and fe2 in wdtp in the lower reaches of the han river subarea 1 with phosphate mining upstream the dissolution of phosphate minerals such as apatite from p rich strata is the main source of groundwater p along the jingjiang river subarea 2 with widespread peat deposition in paleo channels and ancient lakes the mineralization of organic p is the dominant source of the groundwater p and the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides is a secondary source in the western dongting plain subarea 3 with iron rich sedimentary rocks and granites in surrounding mountains the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides is the main source of p in groundwater and the mineralization of organic p is a secondary but important source of p enrichment the differences in the main p sources in the groundwater of different subareas could be fundamentally linked to the pristine geological settings the joint use of multiple statistical methods to identify geogenic p sources in groundwater in this study can be applied to other similar study areas with regional hydrochemical data while detailed regional geological data can better support the understanding of geogenic p sources in future research some advanced analytical technologies on the compositions or species of calcium organic matter and iron are recommended to deeply unravel the detailed mechanisms for geogenic p enrichment in groundwater such as the stable calcium carbon iron isotopes and the dissolved organic p characterization by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr credit authorship contribution statement jun zhou

3059,the contribution of geogenic phosphorus p in groundwater to surface water eutrophication has become a major concern for aquatic environment protection but the differences in groundwater p sources in different geological settings are less concerned in this study three areas in the central yangtze river basin under various geological conditions were selected for the identification of groundwater p sources and key factors affecting p enrichment using hydrogeochemical and geostatistical methods it was found that p in groundwater of middle and upper pleistocene aquifers is mainly geogenic and is little affected by anthropogenic activities in the lower reaches of the han river an area with phosphate mining upstream the dissolution of phosphate minerals such as apatite from p rich strata is the main source of groundwater p feature importance of ca2 39 along the jingjiang river an area with widespread peat deposition in paleo channels and ancient lakes the mineralization of organic p op is the dominant groundwater p source feature importance of nh4 n 46 with the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides as a secondary source feature importance of fe2 26 in the western part of the dongting plain an area with iron rich sedimentary rocks and granites in the surrounding mountains the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides is the main source of p in groundwater feature importance of fe2 34 with mineralization of organic p as a secondary but important source feature importance of nh4 n 25 the differences in groundwater p sources in different subareas are clearly linked to specific geological conditions this study provides new insights into the dependence of p source and enrichment in groundwater systems on regional geology and highlights the importance of using a wide range of research methods for understanding the extremely complex processes in the subsurface environment keywords phosphorus groundwater geology central yangtze river data availability i have shared the link to my data at the attach file step 1 introduction eutrophication of water bodies is a global environmental problem and phosphorus p as a limiting nutrient is often a key factor controlling this phenomenon in freshwater water bodies ala aho et al 2013 worsfold et al 2016 ostad ali askari et al 2017 charlton et al 2018 in recent years numerous studies have demonstrated that the input of p rich groundwater an important p source of surface water results in an increased risk of surface water eutrophication holman et al 2010 meinikmann et al 2015 javadinejad et al 2019 kazmierczak et al 2020 förster et al 2021 consequently there is an urgent need to enhance our understanding of the sources of p in groundwater heiberg et al 2010 prem et al 2015 the increase in p concentrations in groundwater has been commonly attributed to anthropogenic activities such as the application of fertilizers and pesticides and the discharge of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater lewandowski et al 2015 ančić et al 2020 huang et al 2020 nafchi et al 2021 however the importance of natural i e geogenic p in groundwater has received little attention water quality monitoring in new zealand indicated that high p concentrations were only observed in old groundwater presumably affected by specific geological or hydrogeological conditions morgenstern and daughney 2012 other studies have attributed the p enrichment in groundwater primarily to complex geochemical processes such as the mineralization of organic p and the desorption and dissolution of p containing minerals carlyle and hill 2001 lewandowski and nutzmann 2010 neidhardt et al 2018 yu et al 2018 kazmierczak et al 2020 tao et al 2020 tao et al 2022 the enrichment of geogenic p in groundwater should be definitely associated with specific geological or hydrogeological settings however no work has been done on the differences in the sources of p in pristine groundwater under different geological conditions the central yangtze river basin is characterized by abundant water resources and has critical eco environmental functions within the whole yangtze catchment previous investigations have identified high concentrations of arsenic ammonium and p in the porous aquifer in the basin where high p concentrations 1 mg l were mainly distributed along the jingjiang river and the han river deng et al 2018 huang et al 2021 du et al 2020a tao et al 2020 moreover recent studies have found that groundwater in the western part of the dongting plain also exhibits a high p concentration up to 3 58 mg l tao et al 2022 groundwater with high p concentrations may be a source of elevated nutrient levels in rivers and lakes in the central yangtze river basin due to groundwater discharge sun et al 2021a the vast central yangtze river basin has a rather complex geological history and consequently the geological and hydrogeological settings differ considerably among subareas however the link between the sources of groundwater p and different geological settings within the central yangtze river basin is still poorly understood multivariate geostatistical methods are effective tools for studying the spatial and temporal changes in water quality or identifying sources of contamination nolan and hitt 2006 kazakis et al 2017 podgorski and berg 2020 and are able to reveal intrinsical relationships between geological data and data on the groundwater environment principal component analysis pca and multiple linear regression mlr are commonly used in hydrogeochemical studies to identify sources of contamination and geochemical factors affecting groundwater quality by reducing dimensionality and extracting variables thereby helping to explain various hydrochemical processes kazakis et al 2017 ibn ali et al 2017 ouedraogo et al 2019 yang et al 2021 random forest rf as a powerful tool for nonlinear system identification is independent of collinearity breiman 2001 in the field of hydrogeochemistry rf is extensively applied to establish transport models of groundwater contaminants and accurately identify key geochemical factors that affect water quality rodriguez galiano et al 2014 knoll et al 2020 podgorski and berg 2020 it is particularly useful for multi source studies with high dimensional data and non linear relationships this study targeted three high p 1 mg l groundwater areas within the central yangtze river basin namely the lower reaches of the han river lhr the jingjiang river reach of the central yangtze jjr and the west part of the dongting plain wdtp our work aims to identify the sources of groundwater p in middle and upper pleistocene aquifers in these three subareas with different geological settings and elucidate the main factors affecting the groundwater p concentrations using a combination of water chemistry analysis ion ratio analysis pca mlr and rf this study not only provides a more comprehensive understanding of geogenic p enrichment in groundwater from a geological standpoint but also highlights the importance of using a wide range of research methods for understanding the extremely complex processes in the subsurface environment 2 study areas the study areas are located in the jianghan dongting plain of the central yangtze river basin fig 1 belonging to a subtropical humid monsoon climate precipitation occurs mostly from april to september the annual average precipitation is 1100 1400 mm and the annual average temperature is 15 17 c the geomorphology in the basin mainly consists of the surrounding hilly plain area and the central low plain area the abundant groundwater resources in the basin are mainly stored in the thick quaternary strata the strata have wide distribution with a total area of 5 104 km2 and a maximum depth of 200 300 m and strong water storage capacity with groundwater exploitable resources of 168 108 m3 a the groundwater flow in the jianghan plain is generally from west northwest to east south and eventually flows to the han river and yangtze river in the dongting plain groundwater flows southward from the north and eventually is discharged into the dongting lake fig s1 the quaternary aquifer systems are mainly divided into porous phreatic aquifer of holocene porous confined aquifer of middle and upper pleistocene and porous fissured confined aquifer of lower pleistocene fig s2 the porous confined aquifer is the main extraction layer of groundwater in the basin due to its wide distribution and the abundance of water gan et al 2014 however owing to the influence of the paleogeography and depositional environment the quaternary aquifers in different subareas have contrasting characteristics yin et al 2007 duan et al 2015 table 1 the lower reaches of the han river lhr the transition zone of hilly plains at the northern edge of the jianghan plain is adjacent to the lhr the quaternary strata in the transition zone of hilly plains are dominated by alluvial and lacustrine sediments and the phreatic aquifer is about 10 m thick mainly clay silty clay and silt with low permeability the thickness of the porous confined aquifer ranges from 50 to 60 m and the aquifer medium primarily consists of a thick layer of gravel and sandy gravel gu et al 2018 sun et al 2021b controlled by the regional topography groundwater generally flows from west northwest to southeast the geological background in this subarea is affected by the adjacent p rich mining area a number of large or small p rich mining sites are distributed in the northwest hilly area of the lhr of which the most notable is jingxiang phosphate mine the p bearing rock system of the doushantuo formation is characterized by stable distribution small variation and high capacity the phosphorite accounts for 19 of the p bearing rocks xiao et al 2015 the jingjiang river reach jjr the jingjiang section of the yangtze river flows through the jianghan dongting plain from west to east the plain was formed along the riverbank due to alluviation the lithology of the porous phreatic aquifer is mainly silty clay and silt with low permeability the porous confined aquifer as the main layer for local groundwater extraction is mainly composed of silty sand sand and gravel with a thickness of 20 50 m during the late pleistocene incised valleys were formed along the jingjiang river section due to the decline in sea level since the last deglaciation the incised valleys were rapidly filled due to the rapid increase in sea level zhou 1994 wang et al 2018 as a result there are a number of buried paleo channels along the meandering bank of the jingjiang river and the channels were deposited with peat layers yang 1959 since the holocene the ancient yunmeng swamp known as a vast ancient lake was formed where the aquatic plants flourished to facilitate the formation of peat yang 1986 zhou 1994 liu et al 2020 the western part of the dongting plain wdtp the dongting plain is an alluvial lacustrine plain formed by the alluviation of the yangtze river and four large inflowing rivers xiang river zi river yuan river li river to the yangtze river as well as widespread lacustrine deposition since the holocene zhang et al 2007 the porous phreatic aquifer consists of silty clay sandy clay and fine sand the porous confined aquifer is composed of alluvial lacustrine sediments silt fine sand medium coarse sand gravel with a thickness of 50 100 m when the incised valleys of the jingjiang river were formed in the late pleistocene the four large rivers flowing to the yangtze river also formed tributary incised valleys accordingly in the western part of the dongting plain the incised valley of the yuan river was the most extensive and widespread thus the sediments filled in this incised valley constituted the main provenance of the aquifer medium the upper reach of the yuan river is distributed in xuefeng mountain where sedimentary rocks and granite bodies dominated by monzonitic granite are developed in the holocene the climate was warm and swamps developed so peat layers were extensively formed yin et al 2007 xu and lai 2019 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection a total of 127 groundwater samples and 13 surface water samples were collected in the central yangtze river basin during wet seasons july and august from 2018 to 2020 the groundwater samples were taken from private tube wells with a small diameter including hand pumped and irrigation pumped wells that are frequently used the sampling depth is 14 50 m which are all screened in the middle and upper pleistocene porous confined aquifer fig 1 prior to sampling the wells were purged for about 10 15 min until the redox potential eh electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do temperature t and ph were stable this was confirmed when the last three testing results were approximate i e changes of ph ec eh or do 10 changes of t 0 2 c to reduce the effects of exposure to atmospheric conditions on the physio chemical characteristics of water samples those parameters were determined through flowing groundwater sampling whereafter the sampling bottles were rinsed at least three times with extracted water and the water samples were filtered with the 0 45 μm membrane filters and filled with bottles with no bubble samples for routine anion analysis were directly collected in 30 ml polyethylene bottles without adding any reagent samples for routine cation and trace element analysis were collected into 30 ml polyethylene bottles and acidified to ph 2 with concentrated hno3 samples for doc analysis were stored in 20 ml brown glass bottles and acidified with 200 μl concentrated h3po4 another 500 ml of unfiltered water samples were taken for alkalinity titration all samples were stored and refrigerated at 4 c and the subsequent analysis was conducted within 7 days of sampling 3 2 analysis of water chemistry parameters including t ph ec do and eh were measured in situ using a multi parameter portable meter hach hq40d usa which had been calibrated using standard solutions the concentrations of nh4 n and fe2 were measured in situ using a hach 2800 portable spectrophotometer and the instrument detection limit is 0 01 mg l alkalinity measured as hco3 was determined within 24 h of sampling via hcl titration using methyl orange or

analysis pca can reduce the dimension of a dataset by analyzing the relationships among multiple variables to illustrate the main information extracted by many variables with fewer representative factors jolliffe and cadima 2016 when the parameters in the same principal component potentially have the same origin or similar geochemical behaviors in analyzing groundwater quality the water quality factors are described based on a prior understanding of the spatial distribution and hydrogeochemical processes so as to find out the relationships among groundwater quality factors and determine the corresponding controls zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 yang et al 2021 the kaiser meyer olkin kmo and bartlett s test were performed to assess the suitability of the data and the independence of the variables kmo is a measure of sampling adequacy that indicates whether the variables can be grouped in a smaller set of potential factors field 2013 and a higher kmo value close to 1 indicates that pca could be useful kotowski et al 2020 bartlett s test of sphericity shows whether the correlation matrix is an identity matrix which can indicate that the variables are not correlated a very low value 0 05 close to 0 of significance for bartlett s test of sphericity indicates that there could be some relationship between variables to satisfy the condition for pca in this study pca was used to generate a biplot to analyze and determine the hydrogeochemical behavior of p in groundwater the analysis was conducted by ibm spss statistical package version 26 3 3 2 multiple linear regression mlr is a classical parametric method to explain the greatest variability in the dependent variable with the least independent variables lachniet and patterson 2006 ouedraogo et al 2019 ordinary least squares are usually used to solve the minimum loss parameters of a model and expressed as a linear equation ibn ali et al 2017 1 y b 0 x 1 b 1 x n b n ε x j j 1 n xi i 1 n represents the independent variable of the regression equation bj j 1 n represents the regression coefficient of the regression equation i e the independent contribution of each independent variable to the dependent variable and ε represents the error term of the regression model which has an expected value of 0 lachniet and patterson 2006 standardized regression coefficients are commonly used to describe the effect degree of the independent variables on the dependent variables and the variables with the greatest impact on the dependent variables can be directly identified the means of residuals in three subareas were close to 0 and the standard deviations were 0 987 lhr 0 963 jjr and 0 975 wdtp thus the residual tests of the dataset were normally distributed prior to establishing models in addition the durbin watson d w statistic was used to check the autocorrelation of residuals which is one of the most common methods for testing first order autocorrelation in statistical analysis ibn ali et al 2017 the stepwise regression for mlr modeling was conducted using ibm spss statistical package version 26 3 3 3 random forest rf is a machine learning algorithm and has been effectively and successfully used in feature selection which can measure the importance of explanatory variables to predictive variable using importance ranking breiman 2001 podgorski and berg 2020 islam et al 2021 the mean decrease in accuracy index based on out of bag oob data to calculate mean square error mse measures the importance of a variable wei et al 2015 knoll et al 2020 if the variable is very important the mse obtained after randomly sampling oob will be very large resulting in a high feature importance value in the rf model the oob data is a random subset of data that is not involved in the tree building process feature selection was embedded in the training process of the integration method then all variables were ranked in descending order to select the most important variables the determined geochemical parameters were selected as potential influencing variables for p and applied to the rf model to determine the most important variable groups in this study the sklearn module was used on the python platform for rf regression and the parameter n estimators was the number of decision trees n estimators 200 criterion mse 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeochemistry occurring environment of p in groundwater the statistical results of the main hydrogeochemical parameters can be found in table 2 the ph values in three subareas varied within a range of 6 02 7 89 median ph of lhr 6 78 0 02 n 41 median ph of jjr 7 23 0 05 n 42 median ph of wdtp 6 80 0 06 n 41 and the coefficient of variation of ph was the lowest among the groundwater chemistry parameters indicating that the groundwater ph was relatively consistent in all three subareas the variation range of eh showed a weak moderate reducing environment in lhr median eh 52 40 7 81 mv n 41 and wdtp median eh 76 15 0 99 mv n 42 whereas a stronger reducing environment prevailed in jjr median eh 116 95 0 85 mv n 44 table 3 the piper s diagram showed that the main hydrochemical types in the three sampling subareas were primarily hco3 ca mg fig s1 hco3 was the main anion in all three subareas and the average milligram equivalent percentages were 92 75 lhr 92 69 jjr and 98 04 wdtp the main cation was ca2 and the average milligram equivalent percentages were 59 44 lhr 62 66 jjr and 46 75 wdtp a significant positive correlation was observed between ca2 and hco3 in the groundwater of three subareas fig 2 indicating the dominant influence of carbonate mineral weathering on the chemical composition of the groundwater although ion exchange with clay minerals cannot be ruled out the concentrations of cl so4 2 and no3 in all samples in wdtp and most samples in lhr and jjr were quite low although a few samples in lhr and jjr had elevated concentrations of these components moreover the samples in the confined aquifer were quite concentrated in piper s diagram and only a few groundwater samples with relatively shallow depth were overlapped with surface water samples these suggested that the target aquifers in the three subareas were not significantly influenced by anthropogenic activities because there were no evaporates such as gypsum and halite in the quaternary sediments du et al 2018 groundwater tdp in lhr had the widest range of concentrations 0 04 51 14 mg l median value 0 38 3 14 mg l n 41 jjr had the second widest tdp concentration range 0 03 4 31 mg l median value 0 25 1 46 mg l n 42 while groundwater tdp concentrations in wdtp had the smallest variation 0 12 3 58 mg l median value 1 00 0 70 mg l the high tdp concentrations corresponded to low concentrations of cl so4 2 and no3 indicating that the high p in groundwater of the middle and upper pleistocene aquifers should not result from anthropogenic activities the highest average concentration of nh4 n 8 86 mg l was observed in jjr the highest average concentration of fe 11 4 mg l was observed in the groundwater of wdtp table 2 4 2 correlation and principal component analysis potential sources of p in groundwater to identify the main sources of p in groundwater of the middle and upper pleistocene aquifers the relationship between tdp and other components in different sampling subareas was described using correlation analysis ca and pca figs 2 3 we selected 13 chemical parameters tds ca2 mg2 k na cl hco3 eh ph doc as fe2 and nh4 n that were major components of groundwater chemistry or had been found to be related to the fate of p in previous studies griffioen 2006 fendorf et al 2010 martins et al 2014 lewandowski et al 2015 gao et al 2020 neidhardt et al 2021 the kmo of all three sampling subareas exceeded 0 5 indicating that the data were suitable for pca bartlett s test yielded a significance level 0 05 near 0 indicating that there could be a statistically significant interrelationship between these variables the relationship between each parameter and tdp was plotted figs 2 3 for lhr the variable tdp was distributed in the upper right quadrant of the pca biplot fig 3a and tds ca2 mg2 na cl and doc exhibited similar trends on the same principal component besides tdp showed a significant positive correlation with ca2 and mg2 indicating that p enrichment may be related to water rock interaction fig 2a in jjr pca showed that tdp was closely related to as fe2 k cl doc and nh4 n for pc1 fig 3b tdp was significantly positively correlated with the variables nh4 n fe2 and doc fig 2b particularly with nh4 n indicating there may be two processes controlling p release in groundwater i e the reductive dissolution of feooh and the mineralization of organic p du et al 2020b tao et al 2020 in wdtp tdp was consistent with as fe2 k doc and nh4 n for pc1 fig 3c tdp was significantly positively correlated with fe2 nh4 n k and doc and especially with fe2 which may indicate that processes controlling p enrichment were similar to jjr but with a different order of importance kazmierczak et al 2020 fig 2c based on the results from the correlation analysis and pca and understanding about hydrogeochemical processes martins et al 2014 lewandowski et al 2015 tao et al 2020 the p in groundwater in the three sampling subareas may be associated with multiple sources including phosphate mineral dissolution mineralization of organic p and iron redox processes table 4 4 2 1 dissolution of calcium p minerals phosphate minerals such as fluorapatite hydroxyapatite and carbonate fluorapatite are widely distributed in geological environments most of phosphate minerals are apatite fayiga and nwoke 2016 which is a general term for phosphate minerals containing calcium calcium bearing phosphate minerals tend to occur as impurities in authigenic calcium carbonate minerals at quite low levels and contribute little to p enrichment in aquifers orihel et al 2017 however in p rich strata calcium phosphate minerals could considerably affect groundwater p concentrations harned et al 1998 shand et al 2007 proposed that apatite in aquifer matrices is an important natural source of p the p is released by the weathering of apatite minerals equation 2 filippelli 2001 dorozhkin 2012 ca5 po4 3 oh h 5ca2 3po4 3 h2o 2 this process is mainly affected by factors such as ph t and alkalinity and is insensitive to the precipitation and dissolution processes driven by redox changes orihel et al 2017 the solubility of hydroxyapatite increases as ph decreases and the precipitation of hydroxyapatite is triggered at ph 7 guidry and mackenzie 2003 in addition groundwater p can be enriched by the dissolution of calcite kazmierczak et al 2020 correlation plots and pca plots figs 2a and 3a indicated that the dissolution of calcium p minerals may be the main process responsible for p mobilization in lhr 4 2 2 mineralization of organic p the aquifer matrices consisted of alluvial lacustrine sediments containing buried peat layers and abundant biodegradable organic matter xu and lai 2019 liu et al 2020 the significant positive correlation between tdp and nh4 n suggested the enrichment of p was closely related to nh4 n mobilization fig 2b c fig 3b c previous studies found that the mineralization of organic matter led to the release of nh4 n in groundwater systems du et al 2020b huang et al 2021 thus the process leading to p release could be closely related to the mineralization of organic matter especially in jjr and wdtp the release of p can be described via the following reaction equation 3 tao et al 2020 ch2onxpy hco3 aq yhpo4 2 h2po4 aq xnh4 n aq other components 3 the terminal electron acceptors required for the mineralization of organic matter are typically o2 aerobic respiration nitrate denitrification mn iv fe iii sulfate etc lovley et al 2004 himmelheber et al 2009 in anoxic environments p containing organic matter generally takes mn iv fe iii sulfate etc as electron acceptors canavan et al 2006 katsev and dittrich 2013 phosphates are directly produced from the mineralization of organic matter during the aforementioned processes increasing the tdp concentrations in the groundwater of jjr and wdtp 4 2 3 reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides p rich iron minerals are important p reservoirs in groundwater because p is associated with redox sensitive iron oxyhydr oxides by forming mineral crystals or adsorption afforded by their high specific surface area kraal et al 2015 neidhardt et al 2018 nisbeth et al 2019 in anoxic environments the fe iii of iron oxyhydr oxides are used as electron acceptors and reduced by organic matter followed by the release of p bound to iron oxyhydr oxides into groundwater heiberg et al 2010 katsev and dittrich 2013 prem et al 2015 neidhardt et al 2018 rakhimbekova et al 2021 under reducing conditions the reaction is as follows equation 4 tao et al 2020 po4 fe o fe2 aq hpo4 2 aq h2po4 aq 4 eh and fe2 are two important chemical parameters associated with p mobilization in groundwater due to the negative correlation trend between eh and tdp fig 3b c and the significant positive correlation between fe2 and tdp fig 2b c this indicated that the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides was an important contributor to groundwater p enrichment in jjr and wdtp 4 2 4 anthropogenic activities groundwater tdp was weakly correlated with cl and k figs 2 3 which may be related to domestic sewage and agricultural activities du et al 2020a kazmierczak et al 2020 however clayey sediments 10 m thick were deposited in the uppermost layer of the study area forming a hydraulic barrier that prevented the direct infiltration of anthropogenic p at the surface therefore although the possibility that anthropogenic activities contribute to groundwater p concentrations cannot be excluded in the study area the extensive input from anthropogenic activities is impossible the sources and processes leading to p enrichment in the middle and upper pleistocene aquifer of the study area are determined to be related to the weathering of calcium p minerals mineralization of organic matter and reductive dissolution of p rich iron minerals however the relative contributions of the three processes have not yet been determined 4 3 ion ratio multiple linear regression and random forest relative importance of p sources in groundwater 4 3 1 source apportionment using ion ratios the nh4 n p 16 1 ratio is known as the redfield ratio in wetland vegetation redfield 1963 bedford et al 1999 slomp and van cappellen 2004 the redfield ratio may be varied by the limitation of n and p in different spatial scales slomp and van cappellen 2004 sterner et al 2008 however the ratio will eventually reach a stable range during biogeochemical cycles because microbial communities or other organisms tend to get rid of excess proportions elser et al 2005 fitter and hillebrand 2009 when the nh4 n p ratio is equal to the redfield ratio tdp is almost derived from the mineralization of organic p slomp and van cappellen 2004 which releases ammonium and p and ammonium is rarely oxidized in the anoxic aquifer du et al 2020a changes in the ratio can be used to identify p sources especially to distinguish between the effects of organic p mineralization and those of other processes such as mineral dissolution and desorption slomp and van cappellen 2004 tao et al 2020 tao et al 2022 additional p input from other sources will result in nh4 n p staying below 16 when there is a contribution from other p sources i e dissolution of calcium p minerals reductive dissolution of p rich iron minerals the amount of p from other p sources is compared with the amount of p released from the mineralization of organic p based on the redfield ratio and nh4 n concentration in the sample if the former is less than the latter i e 8 nh4 n p 16 mineralization of organic p still dominates if the former is greater than the latter i e nh4 n p 8 the other sources are the controlling process for p enrichment in groundwater tao et al 2020 the nh4 n p results of the groundwater samples in the three subareas can be seen in fig 4 a b c in lhr p was dominated by other sources in 68 29 of groundwater samples fig 4a the relatively low iron concentrations and the weak relationship between iron and p concentrations in this subarea suggested that the dissolution of calcium p minerals was the primary source of p table 2 figs 2 3 on the other hand the significant positive correlation between ca2 and tdp indicated that p was derived from the weathering and dissolution of calcium p minerals griffioen 2006 the saturation index si calculated by phreeqc is a parameter that can characterize the saturation state of minerals relative to groundwater and helps to predict whether minerals tend to dissolve or precipitate into groundwater the si values of 58 54 of groundwater samples in lhr median si of 0 48 n 41 were 0 suggesting hydroxyapatite tends to be continuously dissolved to release p moreover a super saturated state of hydroxyapatite does not indicate precipitation because a ph above 7 triggers its precipitation guidry and mackenzie 2003 lewandowski et al 2015 fig 5 a the positive si values of calcite median si of 0 12 n 41 indicated the precipitation of minerals which could impose a negative impact on p concentrations table s3 in summary the dissolution of primary calcium phosphate minerals was the main source of p in the groundwater of lhr and the contributions of organic p mineralization and dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides were relatively small similarly the geogenic p of groundwater samples in jjr was mainly derived from the mineralization of organic p because 76 19 of groundwater samples were equal to the redfield ratio fig 4b this was further supported by the significantly positive correlation between nh4 n and tdp fig 2b because these two components may have similar sources of organic matter du et al 2018 huang et al 2021 in wdtp p in 20 45 of the groundwater samples were only derived from organic p mineralization in 68 18 of the samples p was primarily released by other sources fig 4c among which the reductive dissolution of p rich iron minerals was dominant this is because correlation analysis and pca reveal a close association between tdp and fe2 fig 2c fig 3c the groundwater environment in wdtp is highly reducing and weakly acidic neutral which can favor the reductive dissolution of secondary iron oxyhydr oxides pan et al 2019 the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides is sensitive to redox related factors and other parameters such as ph and ionic strength meanwhile the mineralization of organic matter can lead to changes in these parameters and then affect the precipitation of minerals and result in the adsorption of the released p the ratio of tdp to fe2 provides another perspective on the p mobilization driven by the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides and the mineralization of organic matter i e immobilization neidhardt et al 2018 kazmierczak et al 2020 the fe2 p ratio of 2 in pore water could effectively immobilize the released p which in turn would affect the concentration of p in groundwater davis and kent 1990 ma et al 2017 in jjr and wdtp 83 33 and 70 45 of groundwater samples had fe2 p 2 respectively fig 4e f this suggested that more p tends to be immobilized by newly formed iron minerals in jjr which is consistent with the redfield ratio in other words the mineralization of organic p was a dominant process and reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides was a secondary process in jjr the potential factors that affect p concentrations in groundwater were identified using ca pca and ion ratios these geochemical parameters were applied in mlr and rf as potential influencing variables to further elucidate the key factors affecting p concentrations in groundwater the initial 13 indicators refined by ca and pca were applied in the following methods 4 3 2 using mlr and rf to identify key factors controlling p in groundwater mlr aims to use the fewest explanatory variables to explain the maximum change in the response variable i e extract the relevant variables that control p enrichment in groundwater based on the aforementioned understanding of p geochemical processes ca2 eh ph doc hco3 as fe2 and nh4 n were selected as independent variables xi and the dependent variable y was tdp during data processing the inherent nonlinear properties of p enrichment may reduce the applicability of linear models however mlr aims to obtain a satisfactory explanation of the geochemical effects based on the level of correlation between multiple variables and p rather than the univariate level of p therefore the predictive accuracy of the model is not a major consideration the d w values of the residuals of the regression model ranged between 1 664 and 1 953 table s2 in the range of 1 to 3 and close to 2 indicating there was no significant correlation between the residuals i e independent residuals field 2013 all of these indicate that models satisfied the basic assumptions of mlr applications courville and thompson 2001 all three mlr models meet the basic assumptions of mlr application statistical fitting of the regression model f 10 p 0 001 indicated that the f test in the regression model yielded good statistical significance analysis of the t value and standardized coefficient b value analysis was performed to investigate each input variable on the accurate impact of groundwater tdp for the regression equation in lhr only the variable ca2 passed the t test with the b value of 0 486 thus tdp may be primarily changed with ca2 the weathering of phosphate minerals formed from the combination of calcium and phosphate can explain the enrichment of dissolved phosphate in groundwater mcginley et al 2016 in jjr three variables passed the t test namely nh4 n hco3 and eh the standardized coefficient for nh4 n 0 941 was the highest so these three variables jointly affected tdp the close association among nh4 n eh and p can be explained by the mineralization of organic matter resulting in p release nh4 n enrichment and enhanced reducing environment in groundwater tao et al 2020 furthermore the negative sign on hco3 was commonly explained by the competitive adsorption between the two on kaolinite and montmorillonite yang and tang 1999 orihel et al 2017 which was possibly occurring in groundwater of jjr due to the wide occurrence of clay minerals in aquifer medium qiu et al 2022 the maximum b value of the equation indicates that nh4 n exerts the greatest influence on tdp and organic matter mineralization could be the main source of tdp in wdtp fe2 and nh4 n passed the t test with the b values of 0 517 and 0 390 respectively fe2 may have been more significantly affecting groundwater p compared with nh4 n thus groundwater p may be more susceptible to the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides and mineralization of organic matter stays a secondary contribution in the environment of sluggish groundwater flow in wdtp kraal et al 2015 neidhardt et al 2018 mlr can only explain the partial variance of independent variables and express the linear relationship between independent and dependent variables in contrast rf is non parametric and can deal with nonlinear and hierarchical relationships that mlr cannot handle variable importance can be used as an indicator to support p source identification the higher the mse value the higher the indicative importance explanatory variables were selected as eh ca2 fe2 doc nh4 n and as based on statistical analyses including ca pca and mlr while the predictor was tdp the larger the value of the feature important function the greater the influence of the explanatory variable on tdp fig 6 the most important feature in lhr was ca2 0 39 consistent with the analysis of mlr as well as ca and pca which indicated the dominant influence of the weathering of calcium containing phosphate minerals doc and fe2 ranked the second and third respectively with much smaller values 0 18 and 0 16 indicating that mineralization of organic matter and reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides had certain contributions to p enrichment but were not the controlling processes in lhr in the second and third groups of features the redox sensitive variables fe2 and nh4 n had higher ranks indicating that the redox conditions had a significant influence on groundwater p concentrations in jjr and wdtp fig 6 specifically nh4 n came in first importance as well as the strongest positive correlation with tdp in jjr fig 2b 6 furthermore nh4 n and doc were significantly positively correlated indicating organic matter mineralization fig 2b it suggested that the mineralization of organic matter occurred directly responsible for p enrichment in addition this process may promote the dissolution of iron minerals and further release p supported by a significant correlation between tdp and fe2 fig 2b in contrast fe2 has a dominant influence on tdp in wdtp consistent with the biggest correlation coefficient between them fig 2c 6 the same second rank of nh4 n in ca mlr and rf compared with fe2 indicated that reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides may be the main mechanism responsible for p enrichment in groundwater and mineralization of organic matter also participates as an important process fig 2c 6 in addition based on the results of mlr and rf as which may be competitively adsorbed with p and widely distributed in groundwater of the study area fendorf et al 2010 gan et al 2014 deng et al 2018 did not affect p fate clearly the results of the most significant variables on tdp in two models are highly consistent which are confirmed in both simple linear relationships and complex nonlinear relationships rf offers the absolute advantage of reliability and stability in a real environment making it suitable for the complex environment of groundwater knoll et al 2020 islam et al 2021 4 4 linking p sources in groundwater to the geological background the results of ca and pca showed that the dissolution of calcium phosphate mineral mineralization of organic matter and reductive dissolution of p rich iron oxyhydr oxides were mainly responsible for the enrichment of groundwater p in the three sampling subareas within the central yangtze river basin subsequently the differences in the relationships of the geochemical parameters among the three sampling subareas were identified based on the comparison of the ion ratio characteristics and the selection of mlr and rf features these analyses together suggested that the differential sources and enrichment of p in groundwater of the middle and upper pleistocene aquifers were largely controlled by geological settings the sampling subarea in lhr is located downstream of the famous jingxiang phosphate ore belt in china where phosphate ore resources are concentrated and the apatite content is high xiao et al 2015 some small phosphate mines belonging to the jingxiang phosphate ore belt are located in the northwest hills and close to the sampling subarea in lhr with a distance of about 20 km the upstream phosphate mining areas have been subjected to weathering and phosphate minerals affected by long term weathering may accumulate in nearby strata downstream making the strata rich in p apatite has poor solubility which reduces as ph increases so neutral groundwater may not provide a favorable environment for apatite dissolution guidry and mackenzie 2003 nevertheless the long term interactions between water and phosphate minerals induced by the abundant rainfall in the region can result in a high tdp in environments where common minerals continue to be dissolved elevated p concentrations in groundwater persist high phosphorus concentrations were also detected in groundwater in contact with phosphate minerals such as apatite in the coastal plain of north carolina harned et al 1998 the high tdp concentrations 1 mg l in jjr are densely distributed along the meandering bank where the thick paleo channel sediments were deposited historically the jingjiang river valley was incised due to the colder climate during the last glacial period and the incised valley was later rapidly filled where the buried plant debris is conducive to the deposition of organic matter zhou 1994 wang et al 2018 the plant debris buried in these sediments provided the source for the mineralization of organic matter which formed the main source of groundwater p in jjr later in addition the thick clayey sediments deposited since the holocene formed an anaerobic and reducing environment which further favored p enrichment furthermore the accumulation of carbonate minerals and granite from the upper reaches of the yangtze river provided iron oxyhydr oxides for groundwater and the reducing environment resulted in the reductive dissolution of these iron oxyhydr oxides which also favored p enrichment in groundwater yang and tang 1999 the adjacent wdtp was mainly influenced by the xiang river zi river yuan river and li river which originated in the surrounding mountains especially the yuan river studies of the sand and gravel layer components showed that the gravel composition was mainly composed of veined quartz siliceous minerals etc and that the upper clayey layer contained ferromanganese nodules zhang et al 2007 heavy mineral analysis of quaternary sediments in wdtp found that stable minerals such as magnetite hematite and siderite in the sediments occurred more commonly mainly from the weathering of rocks such as granites and shales along the yuan river and zi river during the period of expansion of the dongting lake zhou 1994 bai et al 2010 these could indicate that the reductive dissolution of iron minerals was the primary source of p in groundwater moreover the organic matter deposited in different periods coupled with the reducing environment provided favorable conditions for microbially mediated reductive dissolution of iron oxide and organic matter mineralization resulting in elevated p concentrations in summary the pristine geological environment inherently causes differences in p sources in the p rich groundwater of the middle and upper pleistocene aquifers of different subareas within the central yangtze river basin 5 conclusions geostatistical analysis of hydrogeochemical data was made to identify the main sources of groundwater p in the middle and upper pleistocene aquifers in three typical areas within the central yangtze river basin under different geological settings ca and pca indicate that p in groundwater is mainly geogenic and is little affected by anthropogenic activities dissolution of phosphate minerals mineralization of organic matter and reductive dissolution of iron minerals are potential sources of groundwater p subsequently ion ratios mlr and rf models indicated that the most representative characteristic variables for p were ca2 in lhr nh4 n in jjr and fe2 in wdtp in the lower reaches of the han river subarea 1 with phosphate mining upstream the dissolution of phosphate minerals such as apatite from p rich strata is the main source of groundwater p along the jingjiang river subarea 2 with widespread peat deposition in paleo channels and ancient lakes the mineralization of organic p is the dominant source of the groundwater p and the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides is a secondary source in the western dongting plain subarea 3 with iron rich sedimentary rocks and granites in surrounding mountains the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydr oxides is the main source of p in groundwater and the mineralization of organic p is a secondary but important source of p enrichment the differences in the main p sources in the groundwater of different subareas could be fundamentally linked to the pristine geological settings the joint use of multiple statistical methods to identify geogenic p sources in groundwater in this study can be applied to other similar study areas with regional hydrochemical data while detailed regional geological data can better support the understanding of geogenic p sources in future research some advanced analytical technologies on the compositions or species of calcium organic matter and iron are recommended to deeply unravel the detailed mechanisms for geogenic p enrichment in groundwater such as the stable calcium carbon iron isotopes and the dissolved organic p characterization by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms and nuclear magnetic resonance nmr credit authorship contribution statement jun zhou
