24300,toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tktd models are essential tools to close the gap between laboratory toxicity tests and impacts on individuals under field conditions for sub lethal effects on life history traits dynamic energy budget deb theory provides a solid basis for tktd modelling various deb based tktd models have been presented ranging from complex and comprehensive to simple and reduced here we present a complete and up to date model formulation at the complex end of the range the basic part of the model governing the life cycle of the species without toxicant stress is formed by the standard deb animal model this part can directly use the species specific model parameters from the add my pet amp library additionally we cover one extension of the standard model with metabolic acceleration for some time after birth the abj model the basic deb model is augmented by a tktd model that explicitly considers damage as driving force for the toxic effects and which considers various feedbacks from life history traits to damage dynamics e g dilution by growth several choices are needed in this linkage which are made explicit a matlab based toolbox is presented to support the model analyses which is illustrated with a case study for the springtail folsomia candida exposed to chlorpyrifos in food graphical abstract keywords dynamic energy budget toxicokinetic toxicodynamic modelling debtox ecotoxicity standard deb animal data availability matlab code and data are published as part of the stddebtktd package on the byom web page link provided in the manuscript 1 introduction laboratory toxicity testing is a mainstay of ecotoxicological effects assessment both for scientific and regulatory purposes however the purpose of such experimental tests is not to say something about the laboratory situation but rather to infer impacts on populations of individuals under field conditions the classical dose response analysis is unable to close the gap between the lab and the field because it cannot consider the factor time nor deal with extrapolation across exposure patterns or environmental conditions jager 2011 closing the gap requires toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tktd modelling ashauer and escher 2010 jager et al 2006 that explicitly considers time as a factor next to the exposure scenario and builds on mechanistic principles a model calibrated on a laboratory data set thereby offers the possibility to provide meaningful extrapolations to field conditions this potential was recognised by the regulatory community in 2018 the european food safety authority released a scientific opinion on the potential application of tktd models for risk assessment of pesticides for aquatic organisms efsa 2018 for sub lethal effects on animals models based on dynamic energy budget deb theory jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2010 are the tools of choice routine application of deb tktd models is however hampered by the fact that there is no single unique model instead there is a family of models all closely related ranging from complex and comprehensive to simple and reduced sherborne et al 2020 the simplest deb tktd model is based on a reduced theoretical framework debkiss jager et al 2013 a complete and up to date presentation of this model version was presented by jager 2020 this model is the last incarnation in a long line of simplified so called debtox models e g billoir et al 2008 jager and zimmer 2012 kooijman and bedaux 1996 at the other end of the scale we can find the standard deb animal model sousa et al 2010 this model has mainly found application outside of ecotoxicology such as in marine aquaculture and fisheries alunno bruscia et al 2009 and forms the basis of the add my pet amp library of parameter values marques et al 2018 this library contains a complete set of parameter values for a wide range of species at the time of writing over 3700 including many of the popular test species used for environmental risk assessment the standard model has had several applications in ecotoxicology notably jager et al 2010 jager and selck 2011 augustine et al 2012 zimmer et al 2018 the tktd module was in these cases based on the earlier debtox models kooijman and bedaux 1996 focussing on an internal concentration of the compound as driver of toxic effects this module is outdated and requires revision to bring it in line with the developments in survival modelling see jager 2020 recognising the importance of considering damage as the driving force of toxicity furthermore the earlier work on standard deb suffered from a lack of detail regarding the actual model equations how they were implemented and the underlying assumptions the purpose of this work is first to provide a complete set of equations for the standard deb animal model using the same parameters as provided in the amp library and including the links between model variables and measurable properties auxiliary theory we will include one model extension namely metabolic acceleration from birth to metamorphosis the abj model see marques et al 2018 secondly we will link the standard deb model to the updated tktd module of jager 2020 this requires a number of choices which we will make explicitly we will refer to this model version as stddeb tktd thirdly we present a matlab based toolbox for model calibration and model predictions which will be illustrated with a case study finally we discuss the open questions of the resulting model as well as the challenges in parametrising it 2 model description 2 1 structure of the stddeb tktd model the general structure of stddeb tktd is shown in fig 1 the model is build up from three modules the standard deb animal model holds a central position flanked by a tktd module and a module for auxiliary hypotheses and statistics this latter module deals with the translation of the abstract state variables of the model to measurable properties and the statistical model needed to fit the model to observations the tktd module is a so called reduced model see jager 2020 in which toxicokinetics and damage dynamics are represented by a single compartment scaled damage the full set of model equations is rather extensive and its implementation also requires some explanation for example the initial values for the state variables and the costs for an egg are implicit and need to be found by simulation therefore we present the modelling details and the underlying assumptions in the supporting information in the main text we focus on the structure of the model and the case study this is warranted as the equations of stddeb tktd are not by themselves new although they have never been published in this combination and with this level of completeness 2 2 standard deb model the energy flows in the standard deb animal are schematically shown in fig 2 this model has been extensively discussed elsewhere e g kooijman 2010 jusup et al 2017 sousa et al 2010 so we keep the description to a minimum here and focus on the key aspects for tktd modelling and the open questions that need to be addressed the model is phrased in terms of powers energy fluxes j d and volumetric body length cubic root of structural volume cm so that it can directly use the energy based parameters from the amp library marques et al 2018 this model represents an animal that does not change in shape with a single reserve compartment additionally we implemented one extension of the standard model namely the abj model for metabolic acceleration marques et al 2018 as an option many species accelerate their growth in early life and this extension provides an explanation accelerating metabolism between birth and metamorphosis which occurs before or at puberty the start of investment into reproduction please note that we still refer to this model extension as a standard deb model to contrast it with the simplified debtox model versions within the amp context the abj model would be seen as an alternative to the standard model as in that context simplified models are not considered in the current formulation a reproduction buffer is not considered instead the allocated flux for reproduction is instantly converted into eggs the reasons to exclude the buffer are pragmatic the amp entries currently do not consider the reproduction buffer and using these parameters in a model with buffer would lead to bias see jager et al 2022 furthermore dealing with the build up of the buffer and the discontinuities in the model at spawning events poses a range of problems for model implementation as well as for the interpretation of data particularly when following a cohort of animals in a toxicity test see jager et al 2022 nevertheless good examples of deb models with explicit consideration of the reproduction buffer are available specifically for vertebrates e g augustine et al 2012 marn et al 2022 table 1 gives the basic model parameters those that do not depend on the toxicant this list contains a few non standard parameters that need to be explained firstly the maturity efficiency Îº h does not appear in standard deb formulations this parameter is by default set to 1 so it has no effect however it is needed to provide a handle for potential toxicant stress on the maturation process koch and de schamphelaere 2021 the additional parameter for the starvation module y p is explained in the following section 2 3 starvation strategy it is important for any tktd model for sub lethal effects to consider periodic situations of starvation this is obvious when simulating situations with time varying food availability but toxicant stress can also lead to starvation especially under pulsed exposure jager 2020 starvation is the situation where the somatic maintenance needs cannot be met with the standard set of rules in the model this situation can occur even under abundant food with chemicals that affect the energy fluxes for assimilation or maintenance in contrast to the simplified model jager 2020 the standard deb animal has a reserve to buffer the resource requiring processes from rapid changes in food availability and toxicant effects on assimilation and maintenance however it is good to note that this buffering can only help animals that are not yet fully grown for a fully grown adult even a tiny decrease in assimilation or a tiny increase in somatic maintenance costs would trigger a starvation response see also van der meer 2016 under starvation the animal needs to deviate from the standard rules in the model the exact strategy that is followed is species specific kooijman 2010 page 118 for the current formulation we selected the same strategy as used in the simplified model jager 2020 when somatic maintenance needs cannot be met from the mobilisation flux allocated to the soma the Îº flux in fig 2 growth stops and the required resources for somatic maintenance are recovered from the 1 Îº flux maturity maintenance is paid as long as possible so reproduction may stop before the entire 1 Îº flux is needed for somatic maintenance when the 1 Îº flux decreases even further maturity maintenance is not being fully covered anymore this is in line with the suggestion of kooijman 2010 page 50 that maturity maintenance is more facultative than somatic maintenance we assume that within the context of ecotoxicological questions this reduction in maturity maintenance has no negative consequences for the individual when even the entire mobilisation flux is insufficient to pay somatic maintenance costs the animal will pay these costs from structure and thereby shrink an additional yield parameter y p is needed for shrinking under starvation the transformation of reserve into structure comes with a certain loss of energy which is included into the growth costs e g however these overheads are not recovered when structure is used for maintenance in fact we need to account for additional overhead costs the value of y p in table 1 assumes that both transformations have an 80 yield following jager 2020 this set of starvation rules has the benefit that it allows somatic maintenance to be paid in full under all circumstances and that it leaves the reserve dynamics intact given the proposed surface limited mechanism for reserve mobilisation maino et al 2014 modifying reserve dynamics under starvation seemed less plausible to us this set of rules has the possibly unrealistic property than an animal will shrink while still possessing a substantial reserve compartment different starvation strategies can be put forward but it is good to realise that the details of the starvation module are unlikely to become important in a tktd context starvation will usually be limited to pulse exposure conditions where it will be intermittent only 2 4 tktd module for stddeb tktd the standard deb model is linked to the tktd module as presented in jager 2020 this module explicitly considers that effects are driven by damage rather than an internal concentration furthermore it provides a series of optional feedbacks broken arrow in fig 1 these feedbacks represent the influence of changes in life history traits on toxicokinetics or damage dynamics three types of feedbacks are considered dilution by growth modification of rate constant due to changes in surface volume ratio with growth and losses with reproduction which feedbacks are relevant will depend on the compound and on the species here we only consider the so called reduced tktd module where toxicokinetics and damage dynamics are lumped into a single compartment see fig 1 in a full tktd module separate compartments would be used which generally requires measurements of body residues for a successful calibration the tk part of such a full model may range from a simple one compartment model to full fledged physiologically based models e g mavroudis et al 2018 it is important to stress that the single damage compartment of the reduced module does not necessarily represent an internal concentration of the toxicant depending on the relative speeds of toxicokinetics and damage dynamics it may represent an internal concentration of the parent compound or a transformation product or a form of damage the feedback process of growth dilution is always relevant for internal concentrations but not necessarily for damage therefore these feedbacks are optional and various configurations make sense jager 2020 sub lethal and lethal effects are considered and by default both are assumed to be driven by the same damage level for sub lethal effects damage affects one or more primary parameters of the energy budget model with a linear with threshold relationship for lethal effects damage affects the hazard rate also with a linear with threshold relationship but with different parameters from the sub lethal effects following jager 2020 we thus assume the stochastic death interpretation for mortality and ignore the alternative of individual tolerance see supporting information mortality in the control is covered by a constant background hazard rate h b a constant hazard rate is often a reasonable assumption since many standard toxicity tests are too short to see age related mortality however there are exceptions e g multi generation studies where addition of a dedicated ageing module may be considered in such cases care is needed as toxicant effects may interfere with senescence e g jager et al 2007 the tktd module was originally developed for the simplified model jager 2020 in that model version all body mass is treated as structure in contrast in stddeb tktd body mass is made up of structure and reserve since structure and reserve have their own dynamics this requires some explicit choices regarding the feedbacks to damage dynamics clearly this is an aspect where more detailed experimental work is needed complicated by the uncertainty regarding the nature of damage as outlined above for now we propose to use structural size for all feedbacks relying on body surface area and volume and thus ignore the potential role of reserve in other words the module from jager 2020 is used as is using structural length measures for the feedback processes the resulting module is simple to use but its mechanistic interpretation in the presence of a substantial reserve compartment is rather awkward and can easily lead to inconsistencies see supporting information section 2 1 fully mechanistic alternatives will involve more parameters and thereby require more information for model calibration for example it is possible to use a tk module that explicitly partitions the toxicant over structure and reserve e g augustine et al 2012 supporting such an extension would require additional information such as measured internal concentrations over time however if we cannot be sure that an internal concentration is driving the toxic effects we also need to consider damage dynamics and how damage partitions over structure and reserve for now we therefore propose to keep this module simple 2 5 physiological modes of action in deb tktd models the physiological mode of action pmoa specifies the basic parameter s of the energy budget that are changed due to the damage caused by the toxicant for the simplified model jager 2020 a selection was made partly based on consistency with previous work billoir et al 2008 jager and zimmer 2012 kooijman and bedaux 1996 and partly based on limitations owing to the simplifications of the model for example the allocation fraction Îº is hidden in simplified models combined with other parameters into compound parameters therefore there is no pmoa for changes in this allocation fraction in these models additionally in simplified models the pmoa maintenance increases both somatic and maturity maintenance to the same extent this was done to guard consistency with deb models that explicitly include a maturity state variable simplified models use body length rather than maturity to switch between life stages and when somatic and maturity maintenance are changed by the same factor body length remains a good proxy for maturity status in stddeb tktd we do not have to worry about these limitations we can assume that the toxicant affects Îº or only somatic maintenance see jager et al 2010 and watch length at puberty shift under stress the stddeb tktd model is phrased in primary parameters which makes it easy to apply stress to fundamental processes in the energy budget the energy flows in fig 2 we can thus dream up a long list of potential pmoas as in principle any deb parameter may be modified by a stressor and even combinations can be plausible i e a toxicant affecting more than one parameter however we propose to start from the classical limited set analogous to the pmoas used in the various simplified models table 2 to ensure that the pmoa costs for growth does not produce large shifts in length at puberty we need to also apply the stress factor to the costs for maturation this was not necessary in simplified models as they do not follow maturity as a state variable in principle all pmoas in table 2 lead to a rather constant length at puberty however exact constancy is only guaranteed for a specific choice of the model parameters governing somatic and maturity maintenance 2 6 auxiliary theory and statistics the state variables of the basic deb model i e excluding the tktd module are reserve j volumetric structural length cm maturity level j and cumulative egg production eggs body size in experimental toxicity tests is commonly determined as body length in those cases we can use the shape correction coefficient Î´ m to translate volumetric length of the model into actual length the use of a constant Î´ m is warranted when the organism does not change in shape over ontogeny at least that part of ontogeny that is relevant to the model analysis and when the actual length measure is not affected by the individual s reserve density determining body size as volume or wet weight is generally more robust though the calculations are slightly more complicated since these metrics have a contribution from both structure and reserve the energy in the reserve thus has to be translated into a volume or weight and added to the contribution from structure this translation is presented in detail in the supporting information the cumulative egg production in the model can be directly compared to observed cumulated eggs under the assumption that the transformation from allocated reserve to egg is instantaneous and continuous special care is needed for species that spawn clutches of eggs at considerable time intervals and for species that incubate the eggs in a brood pouch jager et al 2022 for the statistical treatment we can follow the likelihood principles laid out in jager and zimmer 2012 and see supporting information for survival data the multinomial distribution is used while for sub lethal data the residuals are assumed to follow independent normal distributions if needed after transformation in general it is advisable to apply transformations for sub lethal endpoints to bring the error structure more in line with a normal distribution i e correcting residual variance increasing with the mean however it is good to realise that independence is usually violated for growth and reproduction data the log likelihood contributions from different traits i e survival growth and reproduction are added again assuming independence the overall likelihood function can subsequently be used in optimisation and uncertainty analysis in a bayesian or frequentist framework 2 7 implementation in code the stddeb tktd model was implemented into the byom platform under matlab http www debtox info byom html byom is a flexible framework for simulating and fitting models and includes various methods for optimisation uncertainty analysis and uncertainty propagation to model predictions the integration of the stddeb tktd model into byom implies that all of the code developed for other types of models can be used including advanced statistical treatment jager 2021 and moving time window extrapolations for complex exposure scenarios sherborne et al 2020 2022 this code is freely available from the byom web page and the stddeb tktd package version 1 0 includes the code to re run the case study presented in section 4 3 open questions turning the standard deb animal model into a tktd model leads to a number of questions that still remain to be addressed in section 2 4 we already pointed at limitations in the tktd module due to ignoring the role of reserve in toxicokinetics and damage dynamics in section 2 5 we discussed that stddeb tktd allows for a much wider range of potential pmoas than the simplified debtox models in this section two additional issues are discussed 3 1 maternal effects and initial states the maternal effects rule in deb theory states that a mother tunes the cost of a single egg in such a way that it leads to an offspring that at birth has the same reserve density that its mother had at egg formation this rule implies that egg costs depend on reserve density of the mother and thus on food availability mothers in poor conditions produce eggs with less reserve that yield offspring in poor condition this rule dictates the egg costs and thereby affects the reproduction rate in eggs d but also the initial values for the state variables regarding the latter we would need to make assumptions about the feeding status of the mothers that produced the eggs that spawned the individuals that were used to start the toxicity test unfortunately there is no explicit relationship between the egg costs and the mother s reserve density so application of this rule requires implementing some search algorithm this rule however requires further discussion firstly for some species it is at odds with biological observations for example for daphnia magna poorly fed mothers actually produce larger offspring and offspring size also increases over consecutive broods gabsi et al 2014 secondly applying the maternal effects rule strictly implies that we continuously need to recalculate the egg costs over the course of the experimental test as reserve density of the mother may change over time specifically when the toxicant affects assimilation or when the toxicant stress induces starvation furthermore we need to consider whether the embryo is affected by the toxicant stress as well and whether the mother then compensates for that stress by adapting the egg costs to maintain the maternal effects rule to test the maternal effects rule in ecotoxicological practice would require following the energy content or size of eggs or offspring in toxicity tests at least for invertebrate test species this is not common practice at this moment the byom code includes various options to deal with the maternal effects rule so that the user can try different interpretations there are three options for egg costs calculate egg costs from food level f in the toxicity test or always from f 1 or using the actual reserve density e of the mother toxicant stress on the embryo is not considered for the egg cost calculation for the initial states at the start of the toxicity experiment there are similarly two options calculate the states from the food level f in the toxicity test or always from f 1 which of these options is most realistic will depend on the specific culturing and testing conditions for the species in each case in general we should not expect model results to be substantially affected by this choice as long as f is not extremely low and the test starts with neonates we should rapidly see a steady state for the reserve density with the food level in the test nevertheless this is a choice that needs to be made explicitly for both egg costs and initial states we suggest using f for the toxicity test as default often we will start the model at birth but the code also offers the possibility to start at a specified body size after birth this is needed for toxicity tests that do not start with early neonates 3 2 use of amp entries contrary to simplified models the standard deb model cannot be completely parametrised from the controls of a toxicity test information on growth and reproduction is simply insufficient to identify all model parameters for this reason the add my pet amp library marques et al 2018 has been proposed to support tktd modelling with standard deb baas et al 2018 zimmer et al 2018 the quality and quantity of the data underlying the entries varies which is reflected in several marks provided with each entry for the standard test species in aquatic risk assessment the entries are generally of high quality entries can be updated at any time to reflect new knowledge subject to evaluation by the curators and version control is in place despite the obvious scientific value of this library there is an important limitation in its application to tktd analysis this limitation results from the fact that each amp entry is a compromise attempting to reconcile various data sets from different sources for tktd analysis in contrast we need to represent the specific cohort of individuals in a specific toxicity test even for the highest quality entries it is safe to predict that the generic amp parameter values for a species will not provide a precise correspondence to the control of a specific toxicity test given the variation in control response between experimental tests even from the same lab mismatch is almost guaranteed however a close correspondence to the controls is crucial for tktd modelling since toxic effects need to be identified as deviations from the modelled control situation firstly it is important to tune the environmental scenario in the deb model food availability via f and temperature via t see table 1 to match the conditions in the toxicity test as closely as possible for temperature this should not cause too many problems since temperature can be measured unambiguously for f however the situation is less clear since this is a scaled parameter scaled to some maximum achievable assimilation rate and because f also depends on food quality therefore it is not such a stretch of the imagination to assume that f in a specific toxicity test differs from the value used to construct the amp entry even under presumed ad libitum food conditions the first step to address a mismatch would thus be to see if fitting only f to the control data of a toxicity test suffices to capture the observations this strategy was followed for a fish early life stage test by zimmer et al 2018 however in that case the data set only contained body size measurement at the end of the test which is insufficient to evaluate the adequacy of this strategy if a change in f is not sufficient to fit the control data the amp parameters would need to be modified to some extent since the control data by themselves are insufficient to refit all parameters we either need to add more data e g taken from the amp entry or re fit only a selection of parameters adding more data is a troublesome procedure also because data from other labs may not necessarily be consistent with the specific data set that we want to analyse fitting a selection of parameters may easily produce a good fit to growth and reproduction in the control for the wrong reason for example yielding a parameter set implying unrealistic properties for unmeasured endpoints such as egg size egg incubation time body weight ingestion rate etcetera at this moment there is no single strategy that we can advise for tktd analysis when modification of an amp entry is needed to analyse results from a specific toxicity test due care is needed and the procedure would need to be properly documented it is currently unclear to what extent tktd model calibration and prediction would actually be affected by wrong values for the basic parameters it is conceivable that a good description for control growth and reproduction suffices for a proper calibration to toxicity test data irrespective of the details of the underlying parameters however extrapolations to different exposure scenarios or environmental conditions may suffer more from an unrealistic basic parametrisation finally it is good to note that amp entries do not yet account for a reproduction buffer and brood pouch incubation for some species this can easily cause timing mismatches between the model and the observations resulting in bias in the model parametrisation see jager et al 2022 4 case study to illustrate the model its implementation and potential application we use a toxicity test with the springtail folsomia candida exposed to chlorpyrifos in food this data set originates from crommentuijn et al 1997 and was analysed with a simplified model in full detail by jager et al 2007 and in a more limited form by jager 2020 here we use the reduced data set as used in jager 2020 which implies that the data for reproduction and survival are truncated to the first 45 days of the test these endpoints were affected by old age after longer durations including interactions with the toxicant which would require additional modules to deal with for this case study we use frequentist likelihood based inference for body weight and cumulative reproduction normal distributions are used as approximation for the residuals so we also need to consider applying transformations of model and data for body weight data we decided to use log transformation and for cumulative egg production square root transformation in jager 2020 square root transformation was used for both endpoints but body size was expressed in that study on a length basis as cubic root of wet weight for body weight a stronger transformation is thus appropriate regarding the maternal effects rule we decided to calculate both egg costs and initial states from the food level as established for the toxicity test f 0 9 and to start the model at birth the initial body weight of the animals at the start of the test 1 day old is included as observation into the data set finally control and solvent control are kept separate shown with different symbols but are both used for the control fits the model calibration is performed in three steps first several of the basic model parameters are fitted to the controls for growth and reproduction this is done by simplex optimisation followed by likelihood profiling next the background hazard rate is fitted to the controls for survival this is done separately from the sub lethal controls since background mortality is treated as an independent endpoint independent from the energy budget finally the control parameters table 1 and background hazard from table 3 are kept fixed while fitting the toxicity related parameters table 3 to the full data set this latter optimisation is performed using the parameter space algorithm laid out in jager 2021 yielding optimised values parameter confidence intervals and a sample for uncertainty propagation 4 1 re fitting amp parameters the amp parametrisation for f candida hamda et al 2016 is given in table 1 the amp entry also included controls from crommentuijn et al 1997 and sets f 0 9 for those data we therefore use the same value in this study the toxicity test was conducted at the reference temperature and therefore no temperature corrections were needed the amp parameter set provides a very poor correspondence to the control for the case study fig 3 clearly a change in f would be insufficient to obtain a good fit the correspondence is so poor that identification of toxicant effects will be compromised therefore we need to re fit some of the basic model parameters to improve the fit for this case study we settled on re fitting p m Îº e h b e h j e h p and v to the control response for growth and reproduction this selection was inspired by the advice in kooijman et al 2008 and turns out to provide an excellent fit with all fitted parameters properly identifiable from the data see table 1 and likelihood profiles in supporting information as explained in section 3 2 the strategy for re fitting amp parameters requires further thought however for the case study this selection suffices to demonstrate the functioning of the model the size of an egg is not a model parameter itself but rather a consequence of the parameters in table 1 to avoid re fitting to establish a parameter set implying biologically unrealistic egg sizes we use the egg dry weight of 0 41 Î¼ g as reported by hamda 2014 as a constraint the byom platform has a simple facility to include such constraints similar to the use of zero variate data in the amp entries marques et al 2018 it requires the definition of a normal distribution for the data point here a mean egg weight of 0 41 Î¼ g with an arbitrary s d of 5 of the mean the byom platform will apply this distribution as an additional independent likelihood function combined with the other likelihood functions 4 2 fitting tktd parameters firstly the background hazard rate h b is fitted to the control survival over time table 3 next the five toxicity related parameters are fitted on the full data set table 3 for this case study we focus on the pmoa s that provide a direct effect on reproduction and on the four most obvious feedback configurations jager 2020 the resulting goodness of fit is shown in table 4 results for more pmoa feedback configurations are provided in the supporting information for this selection of pmoa feedback configurations the best fit is provided by hazards to the embryo without any feedbacks however the fit is visually and statistically very similar to the fit with costs for reproduction also without feedbacks this latter configuration was used in jager 2020 where the hazards pmoa was not considered the difference in aic between the two pmoas is very small and unlikely to be meaningful for the best fitting configuration the overall fit to the data is very good fig 4 the fit is almost identical to the one for the simplified model jager 2020 though the visual comparison is hampered by the different expression for body size wet weight versus volumetric length and the fact that the simplified model was fitted without acceleration of metabolism more details on the model calibration are presented in the si including the parameter space plot see jager 2021 and sensitivity analyses the optimisation yields a sample from parameter space that can subsequently be used to propagate uncertainty in the parameter estimates to model predictions such as model curves see fig 4 ec x values at different time points or multiplication factors for exposure profiles derived from fate models sherborne et al 2022 5 discussion deb tktd encompasses a family of closely related models ranging from simple to complex sherborne et al 2020 a fully consistent and up to date model at the simple end of the range was presented recently jager 2020 here we present an up to date model formulation at the complex end of the range based on the standard deb animal model since these two model versions now use the same tktd module this facilitates comparison of their performance comparability is further facilitated by the fact that both model versions are now implemented into the same byom framework and can thereby use the same numerical routines for calibration prediction and uncertainty propagation at this moment it is not clear which applications require stddeb tktd and for which applications a simplified model version would suffice in general selection of the most suitable model depends on the purpose for which the model is to be used in the model formulation and implementation we made a number of choices to apply the standard deb animal model to tktd analysis see supporting information this includes decisions on how to interpret the maternal effects rule how to derive initial values for the state variables how to include feedbacks on damage dynamics and selecting a strategy for toxicant induced starvation different choices are possible and defensible but it is important to make these choices explicit as the case study illustrates application of stddeb tktd also requires a number of explicit decisions to be made the main issue here is the uncertainty of how to modify the amp entry to fit the controls of the specific toxicity data set clearly there is the risk of obtaining a good fit for the wrong reasons streamlining this step of the analysis would facilitate more routine use of the model many questions in ecotoxicology both scientific and regulatory are best addressed by tktd modelling with our presentation of stddeb tktd and its implementation and by making the underlying design choices explicit we hope to contribute to and inspire further development of this field credit authorship contribution statement tjalling jager methodology software formal analysis

between the lab and the field because it cannot consider the factor time nor deal with extrapolation across exposure patterns or environmental conditions jager 2011 closing the gap requires toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tktd modelling ashauer and escher 2010 jager et al 2006 that explicitly considers time as a factor next to the exposure scenario and builds on mechanistic principles a model calibrated on a laboratory data set thereby offers the possibility to provide meaningful extrapolations to field conditions this potential was recognised by the regulatory community in 2018 the european food safety authority released a scientific opinion on the potential application of tktd models for risk assessment of pesticides for aquatic organisms efsa 2018 for sub lethal effects on animals models based on dynamic energy budget deb theory jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2010 are the tools of choice routine application of deb tktd models is however hampered by the fact that there is no single unique model instead there is a family of models all closely related ranging from complex and comprehensive to simple and reduced sherborne et al 2020 the simplest deb tktd model is based on a reduced theoretical framework debkiss jager et al 2013 a complete and up to date presentation of this model version was presented by jager 2020 this model is the last incarnation in a long line of simplified so called debtox models e g billoir et al 2008 jager and zimmer 2012 kooijman and bedaux 1996 at the other end of the scale we can find the standard deb animal model sousa et al 2010 this model has mainly found application outside of ecotoxicology such as in marine aquaculture and fisheries alunno bruscia et al 2009 and forms the basis of the add my pet amp library of parameter values marques et al 2018 this library contains a complete set of parameter values for a wide range of species at the time of writing over 3700 including many of the popular test species used for environmental risk assessment the standard model has had several applications in ecotoxicology notably jager et al 2010 jager and selck 2011 augustine et al 2012 zimmer et al 2018 the tktd module was in these cases based on the earlier debtox models kooijman and bedaux 1996 focussing on an internal concentration of the compound as driver of toxic effects this module is outdated and requires revision to bring it in line with the developments in survival modelling see jager 2020 recognising the importance of considering damage as the driving force of toxicity furthermore the earlier work on standard deb suffered from a lack of detail regarding the actual model equations how they were implemented and the underlying assumptions the purpose of this work is first to provide a complete set of equations for the standard deb animal model using the same parameters as provided in the amp library and including the links between model variables and measurable properties auxiliary theory we will include one model extension namely metabolic acceleration from birth to metamorphosis the abj model see marques et al 2018 secondly we will link the standard deb model to the updated tktd module of jager 2020 this requires a number of choices which we will make explicitly we will refer to this model version as stddeb tktd thirdly we present a matlab based toolbox for model calibration and model predictions which will be illustrated with a case study finally we discuss the open questions of the resulting model as well as the challenges in parametrising it 2 model description 2 1 structure of the stddeb tktd model the general structure of stddeb tktd is shown in fig 1 the model is build up from three modules the standard deb animal model holds a central position flanked by a tktd module and a module for auxiliary hypotheses and statistics this latter module deals with the translation of the abstract state variables of the model to measurable properties and the statistical model needed to fit the model to observations the tktd module is a so called reduced model see jager 2020 in which toxicokinetics and damage dynamics are represented by a single compartment scaled damage the full set of model equations is rather extensive and its implementation also requires some explanation for example the initial values for the state variables and the costs for an egg are implicit and need to be found by simulation therefore we present the modelling details and the underlying assumptions in the supporting information in the main text we focus on the structure of the model and the case study this is warranted as the equations of stddeb tktd are not by themselves new although they have never been published in this combination and with this level of completeness 2 2 standard deb model the energy flows in the standard deb animal are schematically shown in fig 2 this model has been extensively discussed elsewhere e g kooijman 2010 jusup et al 2017 sousa et al 2010 so we keep the description to a minimum here and focus on the key aspects for tktd modelling and the open questions that need to be addressed the model is phrased in terms of powers energy fluxes j d and volumetric body length cubic root of structural volume cm so that it can directly use the energy based parameters from the amp library marques et al 2018 this model represents an animal that does not change in shape with a single reserve compartment additionally we implemented one extension of the standard model namely the abj model for metabolic acceleration marques et al 2018 as an option many species accelerate their growth in early life and this extension provides an explanation accelerating metabolism between birth and metamorphosis which occurs before or at puberty the start of investment into reproduction please note that we still refer to this model extension as a standard deb model to contrast it with the simplified debtox model versions within the amp context the abj model would be seen as an alternative to the standard model as in that context simplified models are not considered in the current formulation a reproduction buffer is not considered instead the allocated flux for reproduction is instantly converted into eggs the reasons to exclude the buffer are pragmatic the amp entries currently do not consider the reproduction buffer and using these parameters in a model with buffer would lead to bias see jager et al 2022 furthermore dealing with the build up of the buffer and the discontinuities in the model at spawning events poses a range of problems for model implementation as well as for the interpretation of data particularly when following a cohort of animals in a toxicity test see jager et al 2022 nevertheless good examples of deb models with explicit consideration of the reproduction buffer are available specifically for vertebrates e g augustine et al 2012 marn et al 2022 table 1 gives the basic model parameters those that do not depend on the toxicant this list contains a few non standard parameters that need to be explained firstly the maturity efficiency Îº h does not appear in standard deb formulations this parameter is by default set to 1 so it has no effect however it is needed to provide a handle for potential toxicant stress on the maturation process koch and de schamphelaere 2021 the additional parameter for the starvation module y p is explained in the following section 2 3 starvation strategy it is important for any tktd model for sub lethal effects to consider periodic situations of starvation this is obvious when simulating situations with time varying food availability but toxicant stress can also lead to starvation especially under pulsed exposure jager 2020 starvation is the situation where the somatic maintenance needs cannot be met with the standard set of rules in the model this situation can occur even under abundant food with chemicals that affect the energy fluxes for assimilation or maintenance in contrast to the simplified model jager 2020 the standard deb animal has a reserve to buffer the resource requiring processes from rapid changes in food availability and toxicant effects on assimilation and maintenance however it is good to note that this buffering can only help animals that are not yet fully grown for a fully grown adult even a tiny decrease in assimilation or a tiny increase in somatic maintenance costs would trigger a starvation response see also van der meer 2016 under starvation the animal needs to deviate from the standard rules in the model the exact strategy that is followed is species specific kooijman 2010 page 118 for the current formulation we selected the same strategy as used in the simplified model jager 2020 when somatic maintenance needs cannot be met from the mobilisation flux allocated to the soma the Îº flux in fig 2 growth stops and the required resources for somatic maintenance are recovered from the 1 Îº flux maturity maintenance is paid as long as possible so reproduction may stop before the entire 1 Îº flux is needed for somatic maintenance when the 1 Îº flux decreases even further maturity maintenance is not being fully covered anymore this is in line with the suggestion of kooijman 2010 page 50 that maturity maintenance is more facultative than somatic maintenance we assume that within the context of ecotoxicological questions this reduction in maturity maintenance has no negative consequences for the individual when even the entire mobilisation flux is insufficient to pay somatic maintenance costs the animal will pay these costs from structure and thereby shrink an additional yield parameter y p is needed for shrinking under starvation the transformation of reserve into structure comes with a certain loss of energy which is included into the growth costs e g however these overheads are not recovered when structure is used for maintenance in fact we need to account for additional overhead costs the value of y p in table 1 assumes that both transformations have an 80 yield following jager 2020 this set of starvation rules has the benefit that it allows somatic maintenance to be paid in full under all circumstances and that it leaves the reserve dynamics intact given the proposed surface limited mechanism for reserve mobilisation maino et al 2014 modifying reserve dynamics under starvation seemed less plausible to us this set of rules has the possibly unrealistic property than an animal will shrink while still possessing a substantial reserve compartment different starvation strategies can be put forward but it is good to realise that the details of the starvation module are unlikely to become important in a tktd context starvation will usually be limited to pulse exposure conditions where it will be intermittent only 2 4 tktd module for stddeb tktd the standard deb model is linked to the tktd module as presented in jager 2020 this module explicitly considers that effects are driven by damage rather than an internal concentration furthermore it provides a series of optional feedbacks broken arrow in fig 1 these feedbacks represent the influence of changes in life history traits on toxicokinetics or damage dynamics three types of feedbacks are considered dilution by growth modification of rate constant due to changes in surface volume ratio with growth and losses with reproduction which feedbacks are relevant will depend on the compound and on the species here we only consider the so called reduced tktd module where toxicokinetics and damage dynamics are lumped into a single compartment see fig 1 in a full tktd module separate compartments would be used which generally requires measurements of body residues for a successful calibration the tk part of such a full model may range from a simple one compartment model to full fledged physiologically based models e g mavroudis et al 2018 it is important to stress that the single damage compartment of the reduced module does not necessarily represent an internal concentration of the toxicant depending on the relative speeds of toxicokinetics and damage dynamics it may represent an internal concentration of the parent compound or a transformation product or a form of damage the feedback process of growth dilution is always relevant for internal concentrations but not necessarily for damage therefore these feedbacks are optional and various configurations make sense jager 2020 sub lethal and lethal effects are considered and by default both are assumed to be driven by the same damage level for sub lethal effects damage affects one or more primary parameters of the energy budget model with a linear with threshold relationship for lethal effects damage affects the hazard rate also with a linear with threshold relationship but with different parameters from the sub lethal effects following jager 2020 we thus assume the stochastic death interpretation for mortality and ignore the alternative of individual tolerance see supporting information mortality in the control is covered by a constant background hazard rate h b a constant hazard rate is often a reasonable assumption since many standard toxicity tests are too short to see age related mortality however there are exceptions e g multi generation studies where addition of a dedicated ageing module may be considered in such cases care is needed as toxicant effects may interfere with senescence e g jager et al 2007 the tktd module was originally developed for the simplified model jager 2020 in that model version all body mass is treated as structure in contrast in stddeb tktd body mass is made up of structure and reserve since structure and reserve have their own dynamics this requires some explicit choices regarding the feedbacks to damage dynamics clearly this is an aspect where more detailed experimental work is needed complicated by the uncertainty regarding the nature of damage as outlined above for now we propose to use structural size for all feedbacks relying on body surface area and volume and thus ignore the potential role of reserve in other words the module from jager 2020 is used as is using structural length measures for the feedback processes the resulting module is simple to use but its mechanistic interpretation in the presence of a substantial reserve compartment is rather awkward and can easily lead to inconsistencies see supporting information section 2 1 fully mechanistic alternatives will involve more parameters and thereby require more information for model calibration for example it is possible to use a tk module that explicitly partitions the toxicant over structure and reserve e g augustine et al 2012 supporting such an extension would require additional information such as measured internal concentrations over time however if we cannot be sure that an internal concentration is driving the toxic effects we also need to consider damage dynamics and how damage partitions over structure and reserve for now we therefore propose to keep this module simple 2 5 physiological modes of action in deb tktd models the physiological mode of action pmoa specifies the basic parameter s of the energy budget that are changed due to the damage caused by the toxicant for the simplified model jager 2020 a selection was made partly based on consistency with previous work billoir et al 2008 jager and zimmer 2012 kooijman and bedaux 1996 and partly based on limitations owing to the simplifications of the model for example the allocation fraction Îº is hidden in simplified models combined with other parameters into compound parameters therefore there is no pmoa for changes in this allocation fraction in these models additionally in simplified models the pmoa maintenance increases both somatic and maturity maintenance to the same extent this was done to guard consistency with deb models that explicitly include a maturity state variable simplified models use body length rather than maturity to switch between life stages and when somatic and maturity maintenance are changed by the same factor body length remains a good proxy for maturity status in stddeb tktd we do not have to worry about these limitations we can assume that the toxicant affects Îº or only somatic maintenance see jager et al 2010 and watch length at puberty shift under stress the stddeb tktd model is phrased in primary parameters which makes it easy to apply stress to fundamental processes in the energy budget the energy flows in fig 2 we can thus dream up a long list of potential pmoas as in principle any deb parameter may be modified by a stressor and even combinations can be plausible i e a toxicant affecting more than one parameter however we propose to start from the classical limited set analogous to the pmoas used in the various simplified models table 2 to ensure that the pmoa costs for growth does not produce large shifts in length at puberty we need to also apply the stress factor to the costs for maturation this was not necessary in simplified models as they do not follow maturity as a state variable in principle all pmoas in table 2 lead to a rather constant length at puberty however exact constancy is only guaranteed for a specific choice of the model parameters governing somatic and maturity maintenance 2 6 auxiliary theory and statistics the state variables of the basic deb model i e excluding the tktd module are reserve j volumetric structural length cm maturity level j and cumulative egg production eggs body size in experimental toxicity tests is commonly determined as body length in those cases we can use the shape correction coefficient Î´ m to translate volumetric length of the model into actual length the use of a constant Î´ m is warranted when the organism does not change in shape over ontogeny at least that part of ontogeny that is relevant to the model analysis and when the actual length measure is not affected by the individual s reserve density determining body size as volume or wet weight is generally more robust though the calculations are slightly more complicated since these metrics have a contribution from both structure and reserve the energy in the reserve thus has to be translated into a volume or weight and added to the contribution from structure this translation is presented in detail in the supporting information the cumulative egg production in the model can be directly compared to observed cumulated eggs under the assumption that the transformation from allocated reserve to egg is instantaneous and continuous special care is needed for species that spawn clutches of eggs at considerable time intervals and for species that incubate the eggs in a brood pouch jager et al 2022 for the statistical treatment we can follow the likelihood principles laid out in jager and zimmer 2012 and see supporting information for survival data the multinomial distribution is used while for sub lethal data the residuals are assumed to follow independent normal distributions if needed after transformation in general it is advisable to apply transformations for sub lethal endpoints to bring the error structure more in line with a normal distribution i e correcting residual variance increasing with the mean however it is good to realise that independence is usually violated for growth and reproduction data the log likelihood contributions from different traits i e survival growth and reproduction are added again assuming independence the overall likelihood function can subsequently be used in optimisation and uncertainty analysis in a bayesian or frequentist framework 2 7 implementation in code the stddeb tktd model was implemented into the byom platform under matlab http www debtox info byom html byom is a flexible framework for simulating and fitting models and includes various methods for optimisation uncertainty analysis and uncertainty propagation to model predictions the integration of the stddeb tktd model into byom implies that all of the code developed for other types of models can be used including advanced statistical treatment jager 2021 and moving time window extrapolations for complex exposure scenarios sherborne et al 2020 2022 this code is freely available from the byom web page and the stddeb tktd package version 1 0 includes the code to re run the case study presented in section 4 3 open questions turning the standard deb animal model into a tktd model leads to a number of questions that still remain to be addressed in section 2 4 we already pointed at limitations in the tktd module due to ignoring the role of reserve in toxicokinetics and damage dynamics in section 2 5 we discussed that stddeb tktd allows for a much wider range of potential pmoas than the simplified debtox models in this section two additional issues are discussed 3 1 maternal effects and initial states the maternal effects rule in deb theory states that a mother tunes the cost of a single egg in such a way that it leads to an offspring that at birth has the same reserve density that its mother had at egg formation this rule implies that egg costs depend on reserve density of the mother and thus on food availability mothers in poor conditions produce eggs with less reserve that yield offspring in poor condition this rule dictates the egg costs and thereby affects the reproduction rate in eggs d but also the initial values for the state variables regarding the latter we would need to make assumptions about the feeding status of the mothers that produced the eggs that spawned the individuals that were used to start the toxicity test unfortunately there is no explicit relationship between the egg costs and the mother s reserve density so application of this rule requires implementing some search algorithm this rule however requires further discussion firstly for some species it is at odds with biological observations for example for daphnia magna poorly fed mothers actually produce larger offspring and offspring size also increases over consecutive broods gabsi et al 2014 secondly applying the maternal effects rule strictly implies that we continuously need to recalculate the egg costs over the course of the experimental test as reserve density of the mother may change over time specifically when the toxicant affects assimilation or when the toxicant stress induces starvation furthermore we need to consider whether the embryo is affected by the toxicant stress as well and whether the mother then compensates for that stress by adapting the egg costs to maintain the maternal effects rule to test the maternal effects rule in ecotoxicological practice would require following the energy content or size of eggs or offspring in toxicity tests at least for invertebrate test species this is not common practice at this moment the byom code includes various options to deal with the maternal effects rule so that the user can try different interpretations there are three options for egg costs calculate egg costs from food level f in the toxicity test or always from f 1 or using the actual reserve density e of the mother toxicant stress on the embryo is not considered for the egg cost calculation for the initial states at the start of the toxicity experiment there are similarly two options calculate the states from the food level f in the toxicity test or always from f 1 which of these options is most realistic will depend on the specific culturing and testing conditions for the species in each case in general we should not expect model results to be substantially affected by this choice as long as f is not extremely low and the test starts with neonates we should rapidly see a steady state for the reserve density with the food level in the test nevertheless this is a choice that needs to be made explicitly for both egg costs and initial states we suggest using f for the toxicity test as default often we will start the model at birth but the code also offers the possibility to start at a specified body size after birth this is needed for toxicity tests that do not start with early neonates 3 2 use of amp entries contrary to simplified models the standard deb model cannot be completely parametrised from the controls of a toxicity test information on growth and reproduction is simply insufficient to identify all model parameters for this reason the add my pet amp library marques et al 2018 has been proposed to support tktd modelling with standard deb baas et al 2018 zimmer et al 2018 the quality and quantity of the data underlying the entries varies which is reflected in several marks provided with each entry for the standard test species in aquatic risk assessment the entries are generally of high quality entries can be updated at any time to reflect new knowledge subject to evaluation by the curators and version control is in place despite the obvious scientific value of this library there is an important limitation in its application to tktd analysis this limitation results from the fact that each amp entry is a compromise attempting to reconcile various data sets from different sources for tktd analysis in contrast we need to represent the specific cohort of individuals in a specific toxicity test even for the highest quality entries it is safe to predict that the generic amp parameter values for a species will not provide a precise correspondence to the control of a specific toxicity test given the variation in control response between experimental tests even from the same lab mismatch is almost guaranteed however a close correspondence to the controls is crucial for tktd modelling since toxic effects need to be identified as deviations from the modelled control situation firstly it is important to tune the environmental scenario in the deb model food availability via f and temperature via t see table 1 to match the conditions in the toxicity test as closely as possible for temperature this should not cause too many problems since temperature can be measured unambiguously for f however the situation is less clear since this is a scaled parameter scaled to some maximum achievable assimilation rate and because f also depends on food quality therefore it is not such a stretch of the imagination to assume that f in a specific toxicity test differs from the value used to construct the amp entry even under presumed ad libitum food conditions the first step to address a mismatch would thus be to see if fitting only f to the control data of a toxicity test suffices to capture the observations this strategy was followed for a fish early life stage test by zimmer et al 2018 however in that case the data set only contained body size measurement at the end of the test which is insufficient to evaluate the adequacy of this strategy if a change in f is not sufficient to fit the control data the amp parameters would need to be modified to some extent since the control data by themselves are insufficient to refit all parameters we either need to add more data e g taken from the amp entry or re fit only a selection of parameters adding more data is a troublesome procedure also because data from other labs may not necessarily be consistent with the specific data set that we want to analyse fitting a selection of parameters may easily produce a good fit to growth and reproduction in the control for the wrong reason for example yielding a parameter set implying unrealistic properties for unmeasured endpoints such as egg size egg incubation time body weight ingestion rate etcetera at this moment there is no single strategy that we can advise for tktd analysis when modification of an amp entry is needed to analyse results from a specific toxicity test due care is needed and the procedure would need to be properly documented it is currently unclear to what extent tktd model calibration and prediction would actually be affected by wrong values for the basic parameters it is conceivable that a good description for control growth and reproduction suffices for a proper calibration to toxicity test data irrespective of the details of the underlying parameters however extrapolations to different exposure scenarios or environmental conditions may suffer more from an unrealistic basic parametrisation finally it is good to note that amp entries do not yet account for a reproduction buffer and brood pouch incubation for some species this can easily cause timing mismatches between the model and the observations resulting in bias in the model parametrisation see jager et al 2022 4 case study to illustrate the model its implementation and potential application we use a toxicity test with the springtail folsomia candida exposed to chlorpyrifos in food this data set originates from crommentuijn et al 1997 and was analysed with a simplified model in full detail by jager et al 2007 and in a more limited form by jager 2020 here we use the reduced data set as used in jager 2020 which implies that the data for reproduction and survival are truncated to the first 45 days of the test these endpoints were affected by old age after longer durations including interactions with the toxicant which would require additional modules to deal with for this case study we use frequentist likelihood based inference for body weight and cumulative reproduction normal distributions are used as approximation for the residuals so we also need to consider applying transformations of model and data for body weight data we decided to use log transformation and for cumulative egg production square root transformation in jager 2020 square root transformation was used for both endpoints but body size was expressed in that study on a length basis as cubic root of wet weight for body weight a stronger transformation is thus appropriate regarding the maternal effects rule we decided to calculate both egg costs and initial states from the food level as established for the toxicity test f 0 9 and to start the model at birth the initial body weight of the animals at the start of the test 1 day old is included as observation into the data set finally control and solvent control are kept separate shown with different symbols but are both used for the control fits the model calibration is performed in three steps first several of the basic model parameters are fitted to the controls for growth and reproduction this is done by simplex optimisation followed by likelihood profiling next the background hazard rate is fitted to the controls for survival this is done separately from the sub lethal controls since background mortality is treated as an independent endpoint independent from the energy budget finally the control parameters table 1 and background hazard from table 3 are kept fixed while fitting the toxicity related parameters table 3 to the full data set this latter optimisation is performed using the parameter space algorithm laid out in jager 2021 yielding optimised values parameter confidence intervals and a sample for uncertainty propagation 4 1 re fitting amp parameters the amp parametrisation for f candida hamda et al 2016 is given in table 1 the amp entry also included controls from crommentuijn et al 1997 and sets f 0 9 for those data we therefore use the same value in this study the toxicity test was conducted at the reference temperature and therefore no temperature corrections were needed the amp parameter set provides a very poor correspondence to the control for the case study fig 3 clearly a change in f would be insufficient to obtain a good fit the correspondence is so poor that identification of toxicant effects will be compromised therefore we need to re fit some of the basic model parameters to improve the fit for this case study we settled on re fitting p m Îº e h b e h j e h p and v to the control response for growth and reproduction this selection was inspired by the advice in kooijman et al 2008 and turns out to provide an excellent fit with all fitted parameters properly identifiable from the data see table 1 and likelihood profiles in supporting information as explained in section 3 2 the strategy for re fitting amp parameters requires further thought however for the case study this selection suffices to demonstrate the functioning of the model the size of an egg is not a model parameter itself but rather a consequence of the parameters in table 1 to avoid re fitting to establish a parameter set implying biologically unrealistic egg sizes we use the egg dry weight of 0 41 Î¼ g as reported by hamda 2014 as a constraint the byom platform has a simple facility to include such constraints similar to the use of zero variate data in the amp entries marques et al 2018 it requires the definition of a normal distribution for the data point here a mean egg weight of 0 41 Î¼ g with an arbitrary s d of 5 of the mean the byom platform will apply this distribution as an additional independent likelihood function combined with the other likelihood functions 4 2 fitting tktd parameters firstly the background hazard rate h b is fitted to the control survival over time table 3 next the five toxicity related parameters are fitted on the full data set table 3 for this case study we focus on the pmoa s that provide a direct effect on reproduction and on the four most obvious feedback configurations jager 2020 the resulting goodness of fit is shown in table 4 results for more pmoa feedback configurations are provided in the supporting information for this selection of pmoa feedback configurations the best fit is provided by hazards to the embryo without any feedbacks however the fit is visually and statistically very similar to the fit with costs for reproduction also without feedbacks this latter configuration was used in jager 2020 where the hazards pmoa was not considered the difference in aic between the two pmoas is very small and unlikely to be meaningful for the best fitting configuration the overall fit to the data is very good fig 4 the fit is almost identical to the one for the simplified model jager 2020 though the visual comparison is hampered by the different expression for body size wet weight versus volumetric length and the fact that the simplified model was fitted without acceleration of metabolism more details on the model calibration are presented in the si including the parameter space plot see jager 2021 and sensitivity analyses the optimisation yields a sample from parameter space that can subsequently be used to propagate uncertainty in the parameter estimates to model predictions such as model curves see fig 4 ec x values at different time points or multiplication factors for exposure profiles derived from fate models sherborne et al 2022 5 discussion deb tktd encompasses a family of closely related models ranging from simple to complex sherborne et al 2020 a fully consistent and up to date model at the simple end of the range was presented recently jager 2020 here we present an up to date model formulation at the complex end of the range based on the standard deb animal model since these two model versions now use the same tktd module this facilitates comparison of their performance comparability is further facilitated by the fact that both model versions are now implemented into the same byom framework and can thereby use the same numerical routines for calibration prediction and uncertainty propagation at this moment it is not clear which applications require stddeb tktd and for which applications a simplified model version would suffice in general selection of the most suitable model depends on the purpose for which the model is to be used in the model formulation and implementation we made a number of choices to apply the standard deb animal model to tktd analysis see supporting information this includes decisions on how to interpret the maternal effects rule how to derive initial values for the state variables how to include feedbacks on damage dynamics and selecting a strategy for toxicant induced starvation different choices are possible and defensible but it is important to make these choices explicit as the case study illustrates application of stddeb tktd also requires a number of explicit decisions to be made the main issue here is the uncertainty of how to modify the amp entry to fit the controls of the specific toxicity data set clearly there is the risk of obtaining a good fit for the wrong reasons streamlining this step of the analysis would facilitate more routine use of the model many questions in ecotoxicology both scientific and regulatory are best addressed by tktd modelling with our presentation of stddeb tktd and its implementation and by making the underlying design choices explicit we hope to contribute to and inspire further development of this field credit authorship contribution statement tjalling jager methodology software formal analysis

24301,catch and distribution of tuna in the ocean are typically investigated with ocean basin scale models due to their large scale such models must greatly simplify tuna behaviour occurring at a scale below 100 km despite interactions at this level potentially being important to both catch and distribution of tuna for example the associative behaviour of tuna with man made floating objects that are deployed by fishers to improve their catch rates fish aggregating devices fads are usually ignored or simplified here we present a model that can be used to investigate the influence of tuna dynamics below the 100 km scale on larger scales it is an individual based model ibm of a hypothetical tuna like species that includes their interactions with each other free floating fads and prey in this ibm both tuna and fads are represented by lagrangian particles that are advected by an ocean flow field with tuna also exhibiting active swimming based on internal states such as stomach fullness we apply the ibm in multiple configurations of idealized flow and prey fields alongside differing interaction strengths between agents when tuna swimming behaviour is influenced equally by prey and fads we find that the model simulations compare well with observations at the 100 km scale for instance compared to observations tuna particles have a similar stomach fullness when associated or non associated to a fad tuna colonize at similar timescales at fads after their deployment and tuna particles exhibit similar variations in continuous residence times however we find large differences in emergent dynamics such as residence and catch among different flow configurations because the flow determines the time scale at which tuna encounter fads these findings are discussed in the context of directing future research and an improved interpretation of tuna catch and other data for the sustainable management of these economically important species keywords tuna fish aggregating devices individual based model particle particle interaction data availability the code used for this work is distributed under the mit license nooteboom 2022 1 introduction tropical tuna species provide some of the largest catches of high trophic fish in the world and as such the assessment and management of the fisheries they support are critical to ensuring sustainable stocks food security and livelihoods sharma et al 2020 langley et al 2009 fao sofia in the case of tropical tunas the use of drifting fish aggregating devices fads by industrial purse seiner fisheries has markedly changed the

increases the knowledge of where fish are most abundant therefore fads act as a peculiar trait of a predator by attracting tuna and other fish where after tuna are caught by purse seiners on or near the fads while it remains unclear whether tuna species are directly or indirectly attracted towards fads castro et al 2002 it is clear that they impact tuna behaviour and distribution girard et al 2004 leroy et al 2013 dagorn et al 2000 hallier and gaertner 2008 moreno et al 2007 to predict the distribution and abundance of tuna biomass in the oceans models are often used typically integrating catch and other fisheries data and they are even coupled to ocean biogeochemical models in some cases lehodey et al 2008 hampton and fournier 2001 fournier et al 1998 petrik et al 2019 kearney et al 2021 these population dynamics models use density dependent functions as an abstraction of individual tuna behaviour such as their foraging behaviour lehodey et al 2008 petrik et al 2019 predator prey equations or trophic functions that describe how the density of multiple species grows or declines in relation to one predating the other lotka 1925 volterra 1926 holling 1959 or density dependent catchability describing the relationship between the abundance of a fish population and how easy it is to catch them for a given effort arreguÃ­n sÃ¡nchez 1996 although fads have a substantial impact on tuna behaviour distribution and catch leroy et al 2013 most tuna distribution models do not consider the direct interaction of tuna with fads lehodey et al 2008 hampton and fournier 2001 fournier et al 1998 petrik et al 2019 kearney et al 2021 in contrast these models simplify this effect of fads through separated fisheries with differing units of effort an assumed catchability and selectivity parameters moreover these assumptions cannot be tested due to a lack of observations at the sub grid scale of the tuna models i e 100 km at which fads introduce relevant dynamics for the distribution of tuna observations of individual tuna pÃ©rez et al 2020 schaefer and fuller 2010 scutt phillips et al 2017 robert et al 2013 and aggregated biomass baidai et al 2018 precioso et al 2021 lopez et al 2017 show variable patterns of colonization and residence around fads and some of these dynamics have been replicated in simulation experiments of individual based models dagorn and frÃ©on 1999 dagorn et al 2000 which can have included the interaction between fish and fads dagorn et al 2000 in contrast to eulerian models lehodey et al 2008 hampton and fournier 2001 fournier et al 1998 petrik et al 2019 kearney et al 2021 individual based models ibms allow for an individual based quantification of tuna behaviour that can be compared to individual based observed data scutt phillips et al 2018 although often computationally more expensive compared to eulerian models ibms provide a bottom up approach which implements the behaviour of individuals below the 100 km scale to obtain a better understanding on the emergence of complex predator prey dynamics at large spatial scales grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2012 furthermore trophic functions have been shown to emerge from individual predator prey dynamics tyutyunov et al 2008 arditi et al 2001 and be responsible for complex and chaotic behaviour when involving multiple groups castellanos and chan lÃ³pez 2017 recent development of particle particle and particle field interaction functionalities in the parcels lagrangian framework kehl et al 2021 allows us to extend the approach of previous tropical tuna ibms dagorn and frÃ©on 1999 kirby et al 2004 scutt phillips et al 2019 to include the interaction of tuna with prey fads and ocean flow here we present a specific type of ibm where the individual represents a group of tuna organisms becher et al 2014 meyer et al 2017 the ibm considers those dynamics that impact the distribution of tuna below the 100 km scale and we apply the ibm in idealized configurations the ibm enables us to test whether these interactions are relevant to explain specific observations that occur at this scale such as the colonization and residence times at fads and tuna stomach fullness and the extent to which their observed variability can be caused by ocean flow prey dynamics and fishing strategies this information could be used to improve population dynamics models and the decisions that managers base on their simulations we explore potential mechanisms that lead to the simulated emergence of these dynamics 2 methods 2 1 biological assumptions the temporal and spatial scales of observed tuna fad interactions are typically days to weeks and sub 1 1 respectively robert et al 2013 cabral et al 2014 capello et al 2012 it is therefore not necessary to include all dynamics that are relevant for the distribution of tuna in the ocean basin scale but rather to capture the local scale interactions that may be responsible for the patterns observed to create a minimally appropriate behavioural model for a tuna like species around floating objects we have drawn on in situ observations and assumed that tuna are motivated by feeding and avoiding predators stephens and krebs 1978 tropical tuna at the size classes that typically associate with fads are a schooling and aggregating species leroy et al 2013 here we consider only those species and size classes of tuna that interact with fads in the surface epipelagic layer and hence do not include their vertical behaviour schooling provides fitness benefits from increased foraging success genetic diversity and protection from predators pitcher 2012 rather than include schooling dynamics directly here we include attraction between tuna particles as a mechanism by which aggregations of schools may form in the absence of other drivers tuna foraging behaviour and its dependence on the temporal evolution of their stomach fullness are complex dagorn et al 2000 however alongside survival and reproduction feeding is a fundamental driver of animal movement viswanathan et al 2011 potentially impacting tuna fad dynamics at the school level leroy et al 2013 and so simple foraging and hunger driven mechanisms are included in our model for foraging we assume that tuna are attracted by the presence of their prey following local gradients of prey density scutt phillips et al 2018 okubo and levin 2001 prey are consumed by tuna allowing density dependent feedback mechanisms every tuna particle has a stomach fullness which represents the average stomach fullness of the tuna organisms that a particle represents we assume that tuna particles forage when their stomach fullness is less than approximately 40 their stomach fills with a linear rate of 1 2 h 1 if food is available and their linear gastric evacuation rate is 1 12 h 1 which broadly matches controlled experiments on tropical tuna species magnuson and magnuson 1969 brill 1996 likewise tuna association near any type of object is complex and their mechanisms have so far remained unclear leroy et al 2013 however empirical indications exist that fads attract tuna particles when their distance is below 10 km moreno et al 2007 girard et al 2004 therefore we simplify and base the attraction of our tuna to fads on this value moreover we neglect the potential association of tuna with swimming objects edwards 1992 apart from prey the model presented in this paper does not include the effect of abiotic habitat on the tuna behaviour this implies that we assume that habitat such as temperature is suitable for the tuna to survive throughout the studied domain moreover we assume that tuna birth and mortality do not play a relevant role at the simulation timescale i e 100 days applied here the size of tuna may have an influence at these scales i e 100 days since different sizes of tuna may have a different attraction strength towards fads although fad attraction strength is a parameter in the model for simplicity we assume that there are no ontogenetic changes to tuna behaviour during the course of a simulation 2 2 model in the two dimensional model we use a rectangular domain Ï 0 l x 0 l y we consider two types of particles representing tuna and fads and one type of field that represents prey the tuna particles interact with the prey field the fads and with each other the prey field passively interacts with tuna particles through depletion fad particles interact with tuna particles through attraction and depletion in order to reduce computational costs of simulations a tuna particle is not an individual tuna fish but rather a so called super individual an entity representing a minimum group of tuna scutt phillips et al 2018 similarly we abstract individual prey to a eulerian field to minimize computational overhead this field drives the active searching behaviour of individual tuna through random and directed movements which have been shown to result in similar density evolution through time to diffusion and taxis like processes used to model the movement of animals lehodey et al 2008 faugeras and maury 2007 scutt phillips et al 2018 okubo and levin 2001 each fad particle j j 0 f is passively advected by horizontal ocean currents it is displaced every time step Î´ t 1 x j t 1 f x j t f v c Î´ t where x j t f is the two dimensional location of fad j at time t t 1 t and v c is the ocean flow velocity every tuna particle i i 1 n is also advected by ocean currents similarly to the fads however tuna particles also swim overall their trajectories are governed by 2 x i t 1 n x i t n v c v i t n v i t n v 0 Î´ t where x i t n is the location of tuna particle i at time t similarly to faugeras and maury 2007 the magnitude of the swimming velocity is deterministic given by v 0 v 0 x i t n v m a x 1 h x i t n where v m a x determines the maximum magnitude of the swimming velocity and h x is the prey index at location x which is nearest interpolated from the prey index field h Ï 0 t 0 1 having a resolution of Î´ x as a result of this implementation tuna particles swim faster if the prey abundance index h is lower the swimming direction of tuna particles is determined by 3 v i t n Îº i v i t i Îº f v i t f Îº p v i t p Îº t v i t t where v i t i x i t n x i t 1 n x i t n x i t 1 n represents inertia tyutyunov et al 2008 tuna are more likely to keep swimming in the same direction compared to other directions the parameter values Îº i Îº f Îº p Îº t 0 determine the relative contributions to the tuna swimming direction from inertia fads prey and other tuna particles respectively hence the most dominant dynamics that determine the swimming direction of tuna can be easily tuned with these four parameters of which the latter three are described below first the tuna swimming direction towards fads is given by 4 v i t f j i i j r b l n j c p k f n 0 f l f x j t x i t x j t x i t where n j is the number of tuna that are closer than a distance r a to fad j these tuna particles are associated with fad j l n c k n 0 l c l 1 e k n n 0 is the logistic function hence the more tuna particles are associated with a fad j the stronger the swimming direction of tuna particles is determined by fad j compared to other neighbouring fads creating a positive feedback for attraction to fads robert et al 2014 the value of r b is the interaction distances between tuna and fad particles i m n r 1 if x m t x n t r 0 otherwise second the trajectories of tuna particles depend on the interactive prey index field h the interaction between tuna particles and the prey field imply that tuna depletes the prey field every time step if prey is locally available with the value i min Ïµ p Î´ t h x i t n the total number of prey in the domain remains constant since depleted prey is redistributed at another location in the domain this location is determined by a probability density function such that it is more likely that prey is added at a location where the prey index was large at t 0 as a tuna particle i depletes the prey field it reduces the stomach emptiness s t i t 0 1 at time t dagorn et al 2000 5 s t i t s t i t 1 Î² i e here e min Ïµ e Î´ t 1 s t i t is the evacuation rate of the stomach tuna swim towards high concentrations of the prey field through a taxis behaviour according to faugeras and maury 2007 6 v i t p l s t i t c p k p n 0 p l p cos Î¸ i t p sin Î¸ i t p here Î¸ i t p is drawn from the von mises distribution with mean Î¸ 0 which has the same direction as the gradient of the prey field h and concentration parameter Îº m Î± h hence the standard deviation of the von mises distribution is lower if h is higher the logistic function l s t i t in eq 6 implies that the swimming direction of tuna is more strongly determined by the prey index gradient if their stomach is emptier dagorn et al 2000 third tuna particles are attracted towards each other if Îº t 0 7 v i t t cos Î¸ i t t sin Î¸ i t t where Î¸ i t t is drawn from the von mises distribution with mean the direction of d i t k i i k r c x k t x i t and concentration parameter Î³ d i t where r c determines the interaction distance between tuna particles to summarize stochasticity is included to the model in three ways first the level of stochasticity of the tuna swimming towards high prey abundance is controlled by Îº m second stochasticity of the tuna swimming direction towards other tuna is determined by Î³ third the initial location of both fads and tuna particles is random 2 3 fishing strategies to examine the effect of differing model configurations on an idealized catch of tuna fishing effort was kept constant at a single fishing event each day in the simulations if a tuna particle is caught during such an event it is removed and released at a random location in the domain in order to keep the tuna density constant in the domain tyutyunov et al 2008 four contrasting fishing strategies were implemented table 1 the first strategy fs1 is based on fishing of fad unassociated tuna in this strategy fishers have no information about any fad but they use sonar and sometimes helicopters to locate tuna tolentino zonderva et al 2018 hence we assume for our simulations that they simply search the domain to locate schools of tuna performing a single fishing event near a random tuna particle each day i e all tuna particles are caught with a probability Ïµ t if their distance with the randomly picked tuna particle is lower than r a the second type of fishing strategy assumes that fishers know the location of all fads they choose a fad to set their nets and catch every associated tuna particle with a probability Ïµ t a parameter p 0 1 determines the extend of the fisher s information on which fad has most tuna associated with it we order the fads j 0 f from high to low number of associated tuna the probability that a fishing event occurs at fad j is given by the geometric distribution 8 p j 1 p j p j 0 f 1 p j p hence for p 1 fishers have complete information on the number of associated tuna at all fads and always set at the fad that has most associated tuna for p 0 the fishers have no information about the number of associated tuna at fads and choose a fad with equal i e uniform probability in this paper we test fishing strategies p 0 fs2 and p 0 95 fs3 we also use a reference fishing strategy fs0 in fs0 no fishing events occur and no tuna particles are caught in the simulations 2 4 particle particle interaction in lagrangian simulations parcels is a framework for computing virtual lagrangian particle trajectories in ocean flow delandmeter and van sebille 2019 for this study we developed a novel ibm method with the lagrangian particle advection for physical oceanography which includes the interaction between these virtual particles i e tuna and fads inspired by established procedures for smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph for particle based fluid flow mÃ¼ller et al 2005 liu and liu 2010 a specialized procedure of three dimensional kd tree construction kehl et al 2021 as is common also for sph simulations linsen et al 2008 was integrated into the parcels framework the focus of the developed method is on rapid rebuild and particle indexing in a three dimensional geospatial coordinate frame in global ocean simulations over long time spans the arbitrary timestamp of particle insertion or removal makes fixed periodic tree rebuilding impractical parcels thus performs smart local branch rebuilds at the time where particle indices in the ordering tree change specific challenges are the change of particle coordinates and therefore indices in a chain of per particle kernels as well as the proper construction of an unambiguous hitlist of closest particles in short the first challenge is addressed with the design decision to evaluate all advective kernels prior to any interaction thus preventing index changes amid a single pass kernel evaluation the second challenge is addressed by the decision of symmetric ordering i e m 0 q i q j m 0 q j q i with m y q z being y th closest neighbour of particle q z those conditions are mandatory to resolve for particle particle interaction to work in the oceanographic setting this specialized kd tree which manages particle association in the background facilitates relatively fast adjacency queries of particles without excessive memory overhead this in terms enables us to model interactive behaviour between homogeneous and heterogeneous types of particles such as the fad s and tuna super individuals in this study additionally the computational method would in principle also facilitate direct predator prey behaviour through using particles for both the tuna and their prey however the modelling and evaluation of prey as a field quantity reduces the computational demand to a tenable level as the presented study interest is the tuna their prey is just consumed and thus requires no ibm or tracing in itself future studies can exploit the technical interaction possibilities even further by modelling dedicated swarm intelligence and group aware behaviour which is beyond the scope of this study in terms of constraints the method as designed so far still requires tree rebuilding after each particle integration step with a o 3 n log n complexity where n represents the number of particles hence imposing significant computational costs for massive particle sets n 1 0 5 in a parallel and distributed computing setup the kd tree construction and management needs to be globally consistent and thus needs to remain in full on one individual computing node implementation wise the method currently does not support multi processing or distributed computing related method extensions need to address the significant communication overhead at each integration step which is unavoidable due to the non local nature of the algorithm lastly the flexible particle definition and its various possible coordinate systems in oceanography makes a fast c c style implementation infeasible hence all interaction related kernels are evaluated in a computational setting based on python and scipy virtanen et al 2020 exclusively 2 5 ocean flow configurations our model framework was run in several configurations across different idealized flow fields table 1 although these flow fields are idealized they contain specific properties of realistic flows first we use a configuration where the flow is given by a random walk rw v c Îº r Î¾ here Î¾ is a unit random vector such that the value of Îº r constant throughout the whole domain determines the variance of the random walk in this configuration we use reflective boundary conditions for the particles the initial prey field is uniformly distributed and with a value of 0 4 depleted prey is redistributed at a uniformly random location the rw flow represents an isotropically diffusive process second we use a double gyre flow shadden et al 2005 which we here refer to as the double eddy de flow due to the scale at which it is applied fig 1a the double eddy flow has closed boundary conditions and we use reflective boundary conditions for the particles prey abundance is initialized as being large in the middle of one of the two eddies the initialized prey field also provides the probability density function for the redistribution of depleted prey depleted prey is more likely to be redistributed in the middle of this eddy the de flow has the property that passively advected particles accumulate in the middle of the two eddies over time and hence represent meso scale eddies that occur in the ocean third we use the bickley jet bj flow bickley 1937 fig 1b at the spatial scale that is used here the bickley jet flow resembles an oceanic front the bickley jet has a zonal periodic boundary and a meridional closed boundary which are also imposed as boundary conditions on the particles the prey field is initialized to be large in the middle and low in the north and south of the domain the latter two flow configurations are often used when studying the dispersion of advected lagrangian particles conti and badin 2017 del castillo negrete and morrison 1992 the flow was scaled in these configurations such that it fits on the fixed domain that we use in this paper and the maximum flow velocity was set to the Îº r value of the random walk configuration nooteboom 2022 in every configuration the average prey index per grid box is set to the value p a v g 0 1 the simulations are run for 100 days Îº i 0 01 and one tuna density n 500 hence we do not consider any tuna fad dynamics that may act on longer timescales than 100 days see supporting information table s1 for other parameter values that are fixed in this paper we will present the sensitivity of simulations on four different types of parameters first we will test the effect of tuna behaviour Îº t 0 0 01 Îº f 0 0 5 1 and Îº p 0 0 5 1 for clarity we summarize those parameter values under four behaviour hypotheses 1 Îº f Îº p and Îº f Îº p 0 i e fad and prey attraction behaviour are equal 2 Îº f Îº p and Îº f Îº p 0 i e fad dominant attraction behaviour 3 Îº f Îº p and Îº f Îº p 0 i e prey dominant attraction behaviour 4 Îº f 0 or Îº p 0 i e one attraction behaviour switched off second we test the four fishing strategies i e fs0 fs1 fs2 fs3 third we test the outcomes for different fad densities f 0 2 5 10 15 20 30 40 fourth we compare differences between the rw de and bj configurations the total number of simulations presented in this paper is 1728 2 6 data we present the results of our simulations across a suite of metrics ranging from the internal state of individuals to the emergent dynamics of aggregated individuals within the domain the patterns we compare our simulations with are first relative trends in numbers of tuna accumulated at fads over time prior to fishing events and thereafter compared to observations of tuna biomass made by echo sounder equipped fads escalle et al 2021 second the fullness of individuals stomachs comparing to those from tuna caught and examined in the western central pacific ocean machful et al 2021 third the length of time that tuna spend associated with fads comparing to electronic tagging experiments of tuna around fads scutt phillips et al 2019 pÃ©rez et al 2020 we have chosen these metrics so as to permit comparison to observed patterns and test the configurations of our model at multiple ecological scales both spatiotemporal and hierarchical simultaneously such an approach helps to constrain the high degrees of freedom inherent in individual based models for example by eliminating model configurations or structures that fail to produce the observed properties of a system at all levels grimm et al 2005 since we applied the ibm only in idealized and not in realistic configurations we cannot set specific criteria on model performance therefore we only compare whether these measures are of similar order of magnitude and represent similar patterns compared to observations 3 results 3 1 colonization of fads by tuna unsurprisingly more tuna become associated at fads when tuna behaviour was fad dominant compared to prey dominant fig 2 since tuna are less likely to move away from fads to forage tuna tuna attraction had little influence on these dynamics supporting information fig s1 fishing strategies had a major influence on the distribution of tuna particles among fads as it governs how fish are depleted and redistributed throughout the domain for a given behavioural configuration fishing strategies that catch tuna more efficiently e g fs3 compared to other fishing strategies generally reduce the number of associated tuna at fads during their initial colonization fig 2a c e in the days leading up to fishing events there was generally a larger number of associated tuna at the targeted fad under fishing strategy fs3 compared to fs2 under the rw and bj configurations fig 2b f due to its more consistent targeting of large associations this strategy prevents a buildup of large tuna numbers at several fads at the same time before the number of associated tuna can grow substantially a fishing event takes place at the fad resulting in a sudden halving of the number of associated tuna in the case of the de flow configuration where both tuna and fad particles tend to accumulate in the centre of the eddies this can result in many tuna associated at fads close to each other such associations can be repeatedly targeted for fishing under fs3 which results in an apparent decrease of biomass through time prior to fishing see below when averaged across the duration of a simulation the distribution of tuna among fads does not change much in the days after a fishing event in part driven by the reduction in density dependent negative feedback from prey depletion fig 2d f of which the strength is partly controlled by the relative Îº p and Îº f values colonization dynamics only weakly depend on fad density supporting information fig s2 on average it takes longer for tuna particles to get near a fad if the fad density is relatively low as a result it also takes longer for the colonization of tuna at fads to stabilize after their deployment moreover at relatively low fad densities less instances of large aggregations switch from one fad to another prior to fishing resulting in a smaller buildup of tuna particles at fads before a fishing event fad colonization and association dynamics differed strongly between different flow configurations fig 2 in the rw configuration tuna associate with nearby fads in a few days after deployment fig 2a the distribution of the number of associated tuna at fads does not change afterwards even if large associations could be expected to build up under fs0 where no fishing events occur this implies that tuna swim towards fads if their stomach is full where they subsequently deplete the local prey field when the prey field gets depleted near the fad due to the presence of many tuna particles and their stomach becomes empty tuna start foraging and move away from the fad while this process repeats the average number of tuna that associate with the fads does not change as the distribution of fads is governed by a brownian motion like random walk if tuna behaviour is fad dominant the build up of tuna at fads takes somewhat longer 10 days since tuna are less likely to swim away from a fad if tuna behaviour is prey dominant few tuna associate with fads as a nonzero gradient of prey density can be easily found throughout the domain for the directed flow configurations de and bj fads are more likely to meet tuna particles compared to the rw flow under the de flow fads are rapidly advected through either the westward or eastward eddy and tuna are attracted towards the prey rich area in the westward eddy where part of the fads accumulate numbers of fad associated tuna increase after deployment and stabilize after 50 80 days fig 2c when the fads accumulate in the middle of the two eddies on average the build up of tuna at fads does not occur before a fishing event in the de configuration fig 2d because the fads accumulate in the middle of the two gyres and fishing events are very likely to occur at the same fads every few days which results in little associated tuna the day before these catch events the bj domain averaged flow has a clear eastward component similarly to the rw configuration a rapid build up of associated tuna occurs in the first few days after deployment fig 2e however the distribution is still changing until day 60 after which it stabilizes observations from echo sounder biomass estimates indicate that tuna colonization at fads after their deployment follows a log normal distribution where the amount of fad associated tuna increases up to approximately 60 80 days after deployment fig 12 in escalle et al 2021 after which it stabilizes this number reduces again on a time scale longer than the 100 day simulations presented in this paper both the bj and de configurations fig 2c e compare better with these observations of tuna accumulation around fads compared to the rw configuration because the flow has a clear direction in bj and de which is also often the case in reality in the rw case on the other hand the time mean flow direction is 0 everywhere in the domain moreover observations indicate a buildup of tuna at fads before a fishing event and a stable number of associated tuna afterwards fig 13 in escalle et al 2021 similar to the rw and bj configurations fig 2b f overall we find that the ocean flow configuration has a major influence on the colonization of tuna particles at fads chiefly due to fads covering more distance over a given time within the domain which aids in their collection of tuna 3 2 stomach fullness tuna behaviour has implications for simulated stomach fullness as more tuna particles become associated with a fad due to fad dominant behaviour they deplete the prey locally fig 3 as a consequence the competition among tuna for food near them results in a lower stomach fullness of fad associated tuna compared to unassociated tuna when tuna particle swimming direction is only determined by the prey field Îº f 0 tuna either associate with fads incidentally if the fad is located in the prey rich area e g western eddy in the de flow or if the flow field is responsible for the accumulation of both fad and tuna particles in the same area if no prey is available e g in the eastern eddy in the de flow unsurprisingly stomach fullness is high if the tuna behaviour is not influenced by fads Îº f 0 indicating that tuna particles are more likely to end up in prey rich areas when their swimming behaviour is only determined by prey although absolute stomach fullness does not change much when this is the case Îº f 0 compared to Îº f 0 almost no difference exists between fad associated and unassociated tuna in contrast when tuna swimming behaviour is only determined by fads Îº p 0 those tuna that associate with a fad stay near the fad until they are caught at a fishing event tuna tuna attraction increases tuna stomach fullness Îº t 0 01 versus Îº t 0 on average a difference of 0 02 and 0 20 for de and bj configurations respectively tuna tuna attraction may lead to a snowballing effect castro et al 2002 where tuna may end up near a prey rich area by following other tuna for instance if tuna particles are located in the north or south of the domain in the bj configuration in the absence of any prey gradient or fads their swimming direction is arbitrary for Îº t 0 and they are likely to remain here with an empty stomach if Îº t 0 on the other hand it increases their ability to move to a prey rich area in the middle of the domain by following other tuna as a result tuna tuna attraction results in less tuna particles near the northern or southern boundary of the domain where prey abundance is low hence tuna stomach fullness is generally higher if tuna tuna attraction is included while fad density has no clear effect on the stomach fullness supporting information fig s3 the influence of fishing strategies on stomach fullness is only weak on average tuna stomach fullness is 0 02 and 0 14 lower for fishing strategy fs0 compared to other fishing strategies for the de and bj configuration respectively fishing strategies determine the amount of depletion and subsequent redistribution of tuna particles more efficient fishing strategies imply that more tuna are caught and redistributed at a location without the presence of a fad which relieves the tuna density dependent reduction of prey near the fad as a result stomach fullness is generally higher for these efficient fishing strategies in the bj flow configuration stomach fullness is generally higher and its difference between fad associated and non associated tuna is more sensitive to tuna behaviour compared to the de configuration fig 3 the dominant flow direction in this configuration also helps to continuously transport fad associated tuna through the richest areas of the prey field reducing local depletion and resulting in generally higher stomach fullness we also tested the tuna stomach fullness in the rw flow configuration not shown in this configuration stomach fullness is generally low 3 any tuna swimming behaviour results in a heterogeneous distribution of tuna particles which focuses the depletion of the homogeneously distributed prey field as a result tuna particles are more often located in areas where the prey field is locally depleted since no dominant flow direction exists this situation does not change hence the tuna stomachs are generally low in this configuration observations of tuna stomach contents indicate a lower stomach fullness for tuna that are caught near a fad compared to tuna that are caught while not associated to a fad fig 3 15 hallier and gaertner 2008 mÃ©nard et al 2000 allain and leroy 2006 machful et al 2021 note that it is mainly the comparison of the relative difference between fad associated and non associated tuna stomach fullness that is of importance here since the observed stomach fullness itself is an indirect measure varying with a number of covariates and difficult to compare with the stomach fullness in our simulations both absolute and relative stomach fullness match well with observations in both the de and bj configuration fig 3 especially for equal fad and prey driven behaviour Îº p Îº f 3 3 continuous residence times tuna leave a fad either when they are caught when another fad pulls them away or when they are foraging and move away towards an area with high prey abundance hence we find that stronger fad dominant behaviour increases continuous residence times crt and prey dominant behaviour decreases crt since the former increases the attraction strength of the fads and the latter causes abandonment of the fad to hunt prey the impact of tuna tuna attraction Îº t 0 on crt is weak tuna tuna attraction only has a relevant influence on crt under fishing strategy fs0 no fishing in the bj configuration fig 4d for fs0 where no tuna is caught and redistributed the median crt depends on how many tuna particles end up in the middle of the domain at the beginning of the simulation where prey abundance is high and cause the tuna to leave fads while foraging tuna tuna attraction may result in a higher tuna abundance in the middle of the domain through a snowballing effect and subsequent greater depletion of local prey castro et al 2002 fishing strategies decrease crt in our simulations as removal of individuals from around fads necessarily cuts short their residence at that fad fig 4d f however this effect is distinctly different between ocean flow configurations in the case of the bj configuration median crt can be relatively long in the absence of fishing fs0 crts are shorter in fs3 compared to fs2 because fishing is more efficient in fs3 and more fish are caught which shortens the median crt fishing strategies fs1 and fs2 do not deviate much because clustering of tuna mostly occurs near fads and hence the fishing events also often occur near fads under both strategies there appeared to be little impact of fishing strategy on crts under the de configuration where resident times remained very short due to the accumulation of tuna and fads in small areas driving frequent switching between fads by tuna supporting information fig s4 crt decreases at higher fad densities fig 4a c in particular when tuna behaviour is either prey or fad dominant Îº f Îº p this pattern occurs because the increasing probability that groups of tuna particles move from one fad to another this switching of tuna from one fad to another can occur either a because the other fad which has more associated tuna is located nearby and is more attractive or b the prey field is locally depleted near the current fad and tuna decide to look for prey elsewhere due to a low stomach fullness and associated with a new fad in a nearby and more prey rich area crts varied by flow field being the longest in the bj configuration compared to the rw and de configurations where the flow has a clear eastward direction keeping tuna associated while continually moving into prey rich areas as a consequence tuna are unlikely to move away from a fad to forage as they move into prey rich areas while remaining associated with a fad rw is the configuration with shortest crt because tuna are most often forced to forage away from fads in this configuration median absolute crt of tuna at fads are mostly between 1 10 days in the simulations fig 4 but can be several tens of days in some configurations e g fig 4c f which conforms to observations pÃ©rez et al 2020 scutt phillips et al 2019 scutt phillips et al 2017 supporting information fig s5 observations in drifting supporting information fig s5 and coastal anchored fad arrays pÃ©rez et al 2020 show an increasing crt at higher fad densities in our simulations increasing crt for higher fad densities only occurs for a few fad densities in the de and bj configurations fig 4b c although these do broadly match with fad densities present in crt observations crt can increase with fad density first because more fads cover a larger part of the domain and will associate more tuna particles second the same number of fishing events is distributed among more fads hence the probability reduces that a fishing event occurs at a specific fad if the fad density is higher and the crt of tuna associated with this fad increases 3 4 tuna catch we find that tuna catch is also sensitive to different behavioural parameters flow configurations and fishing strategies in our simulations fig 5 catch is generally higher in those configurations that result in a more heterogeneous distribution of tuna particles as our fishing strategies generally target aggregations this is particularly the case for fad dominant tuna behaviour fig 5 hence fad dominant behaviour results in a higher catch compared to prey dominant behaviour if it adds to the heterogeneity of the tuna distribution especially for the rw flow fig 5d however tuna tuna attraction influenced catch only weakly the effect of fishing strategy varies markedly with ocean flow configuration within the bj and rw flow targeting of fads with many associated tuna fs3 always results in higher catch than targeting of random fads fs2 however this relationship is reversed in the de simulations fig 5e due to the concentration of particles in the centre of the eddies and the density dependant attraction towards fads with many associated tuna becomes very strong since the fs3 strategy reduces the number of associated tuna at densely populated fads before associations can grow to a substantial number the attraction strength of fads is reduced compared to the attraction strength of the prey field as a result mean catch actually decreases compared to evenly targeting fads throughout the domain interestingly the targeting of random tuna particles in the domain fs1 often results in a higher catch than random fad fishing fs2 since fs1 picks a tuna particle at random to determine the fishing location when tuna are heterogeneously distributed it is likely that the fishing event occurs in an area with a lot of aggregated tuna independently of whether those fish are associated with a fad or not an optimal fad density often exists where catch is maximized under the fs2 strategy fig 5a c when fad density is very low only a fraction of the available tuna particles in the domain associate and are exposed to fishing with the maximum possible aggregation limited by local depletion of prey at very high fad densities on the other hand all available tuna particles are likely to associate with a fad but will be distributed over more fads and the probability that a fishing event occurs on a large aggregation is reduced this optimum fad density does not occur under the de flow configuration as this scenario results in very dense accumulation of fads between which tuna switch frequently targeting any fad in the domain is likely to yield the same catch as with our other results the impact of tuna having generally emptier stomachs in the rw configuration reduces the time they associate and aggregate at fads due to their increased need for foraging under greater competition which subsequently reduces the total catch fig 5a d we do not compare the catch in our simulations with observations because the number of tuna particles themselves cannot directly be compared to caught tuna biomass hence if these simulations are compared to catch data it can only be compared to the relative catch in different configurations however observed catch data represents many configurations of e g ocean flow fad density at the same time and tuna catch is highly variable as a result moreover general catch dynamics e g the dependence of catch on fad density as with continuous residence times crt are not known 4 discussion and outlook using the new particle particle and particle field interaction functionalities of the parcels framework we have developed an individual based model ibm of tuna behaviour in this ibm tuna is advected by ocean flow while interacting with drifting fish aggregating devices fads prey and other tuna the ibm presented here can be described by a small number of rules but which allow for both direct and indirect interactions between components in the system to occur the model was able to simultaneously produce many of the dynamics observed in the real ocean such as the distribution of tuna among different fads their stomach fullness and the tuna continuous residence time near fads these emergent properties most consistently matched observations when simulated tuna behaviour was driven equally by both fads and prey Îº f Îº p however testing the ibm in several idealized configurations of oceanic regime we found that the flow and prey field configuration has a major impact on these emergent metrics for instance the dominant flow direction in the bickley jet scenario helps to reduce local prey depletion by large associated aggregations of tuna allowing for a longer residence in the area around fads without hunger causing dispersal due to foraging conversely when there is an accumulation of particles due to flow as is the case in our double eddy scenario concentration of both tuna and fads occurs with high levels of prey depletion and switching by aggregations in the centre of these eddies hence the flow configuration determines the timescales at which tuna get close enough to a fad to associate with it in contrast our simulations under a null random walk flow configuration unrepresentative of the equatorial areas where tuna interact with fads resulted in far fewer of the real world patterns being replicated great variability has been observed in the dynamics of tropical tunas around fish aggregating devices causing suggestions of behavioural modes switching robert et al 2013 high day to day variability in biomass detected by echosounder equipped buoys escalle et al 2021 and mass abandonment of fads by fish at the same time moreno et al 2007 here we have shown that such variation can occur at similar magnitudes purely as a function of changes to the flow field in which tuna and fads find themselves an oceanographic feature rarely incorporated into fisheries analyses vidal et al 2020 the highly interactive nature of our agents mean that many of the emergent properties are highly sensitive to the fishing strategy beyond simply the depletion of tuna causing a reduction in the number of associated particles at a fad fishing events also relieve the density dependent negative feedback of those associations which deplete their surrounding prey field whilst simultaneously reducing the positive feedback of fad attraction caused by those large associations this leads to counter intuitive dynamics such as targeting of tuna associating with fads for fishing actually increasing the mean residence time of fish as it supports the remaining fish to stay associated for longer with lesser depletion of local prey around the fad forcing a large association to fragment away from the fad in search of food the ibm we have presented in this study remains idealized and with few parameters directly informed by data however such simulation models could be considered opaque thought experiments di paolo et al 2000 capable of exploring the potential mechanisms that lead to observed patterns and bracketing their uncertainty here we have shown that for the set of biologically plausible assumptions we have structured our model on realistic flow and prey fields are a requirement for observed dynamics to emerge however we also include a considerable flexibility in the behavioural parameters that can be used to examine more specific cases similarly the real world data that we have used for comparison of these dynamics have likely been observed across a range of ocean flow fields tuna prey distributions fad densities and possibly even behavioural modes our ibm remains a hypothesis testing tool where each of these components can be controlled for example tropical tuna behave differently among different species and size classes bigeye tuna thunnus obesus associate with fads during their small juvenile stage and slowly spend less time doing so as they grow and develop physiological adaptations to feed at depth although our ibm does not directly distinguish between different tuna types several parameters e g Îº f Îº p in the ibm determine the relative strength of different dynamics on the tuna behaviour hence different of these parameter values may apply to these different classes or species changing through time with the age of the fish we have chosen idealized flow and prey fields at the 1 scale to compare simulations across this is typically the minimum scale at which tuna populations are modelled and below which model processes are assumed to be homogeneous since these configurations are idealized the distribution of tuna and their catch can be explained by known properties of the flow prey and interactions with fads at this sub grid scale however a question remains how these dynamics could be incorporated into ocean basin scale tuna models senina et al 2020 for instance these ocean basin scale tuna models could use sub grid scale parameterizations that are informed by similar ibm simulations of this paper identifying important sub grid scale mechanisms such as the impact of flow or fad density on catch then allows development of their incorporation into population level models this could be explored through alternate function responses or as covariates in analyses that use catch per unit effort cpue as an indication for population size furthermore output from state of the art hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models or tuna species specific habitat fields senina et al 2020 could be incorporated to further test the ability of this or existing tuna ibms scutt phillips et al 2018 to replicate tuna fad dynamics in a more realistic scenario in such an application the prey field could be based on the underlying eulerian model simulation and will be more compatible to the flow such a realistic setting may be applied to simulations in a future scenario in order to test the influence of climate change on the distribution of fads and its implication on their interaction with tuna bell et al 2021 applying the ibm in a realistic setting may require different fishing strategies fs2 and fs3 are rather extreme cases where fishers either have no or almost complete knowledge on where the tuna is located in reality however their knowledge about the locations of tuna is likely somewhere in between fishing strategies fs2 and fs3 the variability in simulated catch shown in this study highlights interesting questions regarding the relationship between catch the density of fads in a region and whether certain model configurations will lead to a nonlinear response of catch to tuna abundance so called hyperstability or hyperdepletion for example the idealized scenarios we have explored in this study have shown that simulated catch from the same population size of tuna can change by a factor of two purely as a result of different flow and prey field configurations while all other parameters remain constant our tuna ibm could be used to investigate the dependence of catch levels on these parameters across different tuna abundance under different model configurations examination of fad tuna observations including catch could where possible include in situ oceanography to further test the hypotheses of our model such analyses would provide a better understanding of how to interpret catch data potential levels at high stable populations may collapse or parameterize tuna fad dynamics at a large scale typically used to model their population dynamics and provide scientific advice on their management credit authorship contribution statement peter d

24301,catch and distribution of tuna in the ocean are typically investigated with ocean basin scale models due to their large scale such models must greatly simplify tuna behaviour occurring at a scale below 100 km despite interactions at this level potentially being important to both catch and distribution of tuna for example the associative behaviour of tuna with man made floating objects that are deployed by fishers to improve their catch rates fish aggregating devices fads are usually ignored or simplified here we present a model that can be used to investigate the influence of tuna dynamics below the 100 km scale on larger scales it is an individual based model ibm of a hypothetical tuna like species that includes their interactions with each other free floating fads and prey in this ibm both tuna and fads are represented by lagrangian particles that are advected by an ocean flow field with tuna also exhibiting active swimming based on internal states such as stomach fullness we apply the ibm in multiple configurations of idealized flow and prey fields alongside differing interaction strengths between agents when tuna swimming behaviour is influenced equally by prey and fads we find that the model simulations compare well with observations at the 100 km scale for instance compared to observations tuna particles have a similar stomach fullness when associated or non associated to a fad tuna colonize at similar timescales at fads after their deployment and tuna particles exhibit similar variations in continuous residence times however we find large differences in emergent dynamics such as residence and catch among different flow configurations because the flow determines the time scale at which tuna encounter fads these findings are discussed in the context of directing future research and an improved interpretation of tuna catch and other data for the sustainable management of these economically important species keywords tuna fish aggregating devices individual based model particle particle interaction data availability the code used for this work is distributed under the mit license nooteboom 2022 1 introduction tropical tuna species provide some of the largest catches of high trophic fish in the world and as such the assessment and management of the fisheries they support are critical to ensuring sustainable stocks food security and livelihoods sharma et al 2020 langley et al 2009 fao sofia in the case of tropical tunas the use of drifting fish aggregating devices fads by industrial purse seiner fisheries has markedly changed the efficiency within fishing grounds maufroy et al 2017 fonteneau et al 2013 fads are floating objects i e drogued buoys that aggregate pelagic fish around them tens of thousands of fads are deployed in the equatorial regions of the world s oceans annually escalle et al 2021 they usually include a gps tracking system and generally an echo sounder to measure the biomass of surrounding fish this increases the knowledge of where fish are most abundant therefore fads act as a peculiar trait of a predator by attracting tuna and other fish where after tuna are caught by purse seiners on or near the fads while it remains unclear whether tuna species are directly or indirectly attracted towards fads castro et al 2002 it is clear that they impact tuna behaviour and distribution girard et al 2004 leroy et al 2013 dagorn et al 2000 hallier and gaertner 2008 moreno et al 2007 to predict the distribution and abundance of tuna biomass in the oceans models are often used typically integrating catch and other fisheries data and they are even coupled to ocean biogeochemical models in some cases lehodey et al 2008 hampton and fournier 2001 fournier et al 1998 petrik et al 2019 kearney et al 2021 these population dynamics models use density dependent functions as an abstraction of individual tuna behaviour such as their foraging behaviour lehodey et al 2008 petrik et al 2019 predator prey equations or trophic functions that describe how the density of multiple species grows or declines in relation to one predating the other lotka 1925 volterra 1926 holling 1959 or density dependent catchability describing the relationship between the abundance of a fish population and how easy it is to catch them for a given effort arreguÃ­n sÃ¡nchez 1996 although fads have a substantial impact on tuna behaviour distribution and catch leroy et al 2013 most tuna distribution models do not consider the direct interaction of tuna with fads lehodey et al 2008 hampton and fournier 2001 fournier et al 1998 petrik et al 2019 kearney et al 2021 in contrast these models simplify this effect of fads through separated fisheries with differing units of effort an assumed catchability and selectivity parameters moreover these assumptions cannot be tested due to a lack of observations at the sub grid scale of the tuna models i e 100 km at which fads introduce relevant dynamics for the distribution of tuna observations of individual tuna pÃ©rez et al 2020 schaefer and fuller 2010 scutt phillips et al 2017 robert et al 2013 and aggregated biomass baidai et al 2018 precioso et al 2021 lopez et al 2017 show variable patterns of colonization and residence around fads and some of these dynamics have been replicated in simulation experiments of individual based models dagorn and frÃ©on 1999 dagorn et al 2000 which can have included the interaction between fish and fads dagorn et al 2000 in contrast to eulerian models lehodey et al 2008 hampton and fournier 2001 fournier et al 1998 petrik et al 2019 kearney et al 2021 individual based models ibms allow for an individual based quantification of tuna behaviour that can be compared to individual based observed data scutt phillips et al 2018 although often computationally more expensive compared to eulerian models ibms provide a bottom up approach which implements the behaviour of individuals below the 100 km scale to obtain a better understanding on the emergence of complex predator prey dynamics at large spatial scales grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2012 furthermore trophic functions have been shown to emerge from individual predator prey dynamics tyutyunov et al 2008 arditi et al 2001 and be responsible for complex and chaotic behaviour when involving multiple groups castellanos and chan lÃ³pez 2017 recent development of particle particle and particle field interaction functionalities in the parcels lagrangian framework kehl et al 2021 allows us to extend the approach of previous tropical tuna ibms dagorn and frÃ©on 1999 kirby et al 2004 scutt phillips et al 2019 to include the interaction of tuna with prey fads and ocean flow here we present a specific type of ibm where the individual represents a group of tuna organisms becher et al 2014 meyer et al 2017 the ibm considers those dynamics that impact the distribution of tuna below the 100 km scale and we apply the ibm in idealized configurations the ibm enables us to test whether these interactions are relevant to explain specific observations that occur at this scale such as the colonization and residence times at fads and tuna stomach fullness and the extent to which their observed variability can be caused by ocean flow prey dynamics and fishing strategies this information could be used to improve population dynamics models and the decisions that managers base on their simulations we explore potential mechanisms that lead to the simulated emergence of these dynamics 2 methods 2 1 biological assumptions the temporal and spatial scales of observed tuna fad interactions are typically days to weeks and sub 1 1 respectively robert et al 2013 cabral et al 2014 capello et al 2012 it is therefore not necessary to include all dynamics that are relevant for the distribution of tuna in the ocean basin scale but rather to capture the local scale interactions that may be responsible for the patterns observed to create a minimally appropriate behavioural model for a tuna like species around floating objects we have drawn on in situ observations and assumed that tuna are motivated by feeding and avoiding predators stephens and krebs 1978 tropical tuna at the size classes that typically associate with fads are a schooling and aggregating species leroy et al 2013 here we consider only those species and size classes of tuna that interact with fads in the surface epipelagic layer and hence do not include their vertical behaviour schooling provides fitness benefits from increased foraging success genetic diversity and protection from predators pitcher 2012 rather than include schooling dynamics directly here we include attraction between tuna particles as a mechanism by which aggregations of schools may form in the absence of other drivers tuna foraging behaviour and its dependence on the temporal evolution of their stomach fullness are complex dagorn et al 2000 however alongside survival and reproduction feeding is a fundamental driver of animal movement viswanathan et al 2011 potentially impacting tuna fad dynamics at the school level leroy et al 2013 and so simple foraging and hunger driven mechanisms are included in our model for foraging we assume that tuna are attracted by the presence of their prey following local gradients of prey density scutt phillips et al 2018 okubo and levin 2001 prey are consumed by tuna allowing density dependent feedback mechanisms every tuna particle has a stomach fullness which represents the average stomach fullness of the tuna organisms that a particle represents we assume that tuna particles forage when their stomach fullness is less than approximately 40 their stomach fills with a linear rate of 1 2 h 1 if food is available and their linear gastric evacuation rate is 1 12 h 1 which broadly matches controlled experiments on tropical tuna species magnuson and magnuson 1969 brill 1996 likewise tuna association near any type of object is complex and their mechanisms have so far remained unclear leroy et al 2013 however empirical indications exist that fads attract tuna particles when their distance is below 10 km moreno et al 2007 girard et al 2004 therefore we simplify and base the attraction of our tuna to fads on this value moreover we neglect the potential association of tuna with swimming objects edwards 1992 apart from prey the model presented in this paper does not include the effect of abiotic habitat on the tuna behaviour this implies that we assume that habitat such as temperature is suitable for the tuna to survive throughout the studied domain moreover we assume that tuna birth and mortality do not play a relevant role at the simulation timescale i e 100 days applied here the size of tuna may have an influence at these scales i e 100 days since different sizes of tuna may have a different attraction strength towards fads although fad attraction strength is a parameter in the model for simplicity we assume that there are no ontogenetic changes to tuna behaviour during the course of a simulation 2 2 model in the two dimensional model we use a rectangular domain Ï 0 l x 0 l y we consider two types of particles representing tuna and fads and one type of field that represents prey the tuna particles interact with the prey field the fads and with each other the prey field passively interacts with tuna particles through depletion fad particles interact with tuna particles through attraction and depletion in order to reduce computational costs of simulations a tuna particle is not an individual tuna fish but rather a so called super individual an entity representing a minimum group of tuna scutt phillips et al 2018 similarly we abstract individual prey to a eulerian field to minimize computational overhead this field drives the active searching behaviour of individual tuna through random and directed movements which have been shown to result in similar density evolution through time to diffusion and taxis like processes used to model the movement of animals lehodey et al 2008 faugeras and maury 2007 scutt phillips et al 2018 okubo and levin 2001 each fad particle j j 0 f is passively advected by horizontal ocean currents it is displaced every time step Î´ t 1 x j t 1 f x j t f v c Î´ t where x j t f is the two dimensional location of fad j at time t t 1 t and v c is the ocean flow velocity every tuna particle i i 1 n is also advected by ocean currents similarly to the fads however tuna particles also swim overall their trajectories are governed by 2 x i t 1 n x i t n v c v i t n v i t n v 0 Î´ t where x i t n is the location of tuna particle i at time t similarly to faugeras and maury 2007 the magnitude of the swimming velocity is deterministic given by v 0 v 0 x i t n v m a x 1 h x i t n where v m a x determines the maximum magnitude of the swimming velocity and h x is the prey index at location x which is nearest interpolated from the prey index field h Ï 0 t 0 1 having a resolution of Î´ x as a result of this implementation tuna particles swim faster if the prey abundance index h is lower the swimming direction of tuna particles is determined by 3 v i t n Îº i v i t i Îº f v i t f Îº p v i t p Îº t v i t t where v i t i x i t n x i t 1 n x i t n x i t 1 n represents inertia tyutyunov et al 2008 tuna are more likely to keep swimming in the same direction compared to other directions the parameter values Îº i Îº f Îº p Îº t 0 determine the relative contributions to the tuna swimming direction from inertia fads prey and other tuna particles respectively hence the most dominant dynamics that determine the swimming direction of tuna can be easily tuned with these four parameters of which the latter three are described below first the tuna swimming direction towards fads is given by 4 v i t f j i i j r b l n j c p k f n 0 f l f x j t x i t x j t x i t where n j is the number of tuna that are closer than a distance r a to fad j these tuna particles are associated with fad j l n c k n 0 l c l 1 e k n n 0 is the logistic function hence the more tuna particles are associated with a fad j the stronger the swimming direction of tuna particles is determined by fad j compared to other neighbouring fads creating a positive feedback for attraction to fads robert et al 2014 the value of r b is the interaction distances between tuna and fad particles i m n r 1 if x m t x n t r 0 otherwise second the trajectories of tuna particles depend on the interactive prey index field h the interaction between tuna particles and the prey field imply that tuna depletes the prey field every time step if prey is locally available with the value i min Ïµ p Î´ t h x i t n the total number of prey in the domain remains constant since depleted prey is redistributed at another location in the domain this location is determined by a probability density function such that it is more likely that prey is added at a location where the prey index was large at t 0 as a tuna particle i depletes the prey field it reduces the stomach emptiness s t i t 0 1 at time t dagorn et al 2000 5 s t i t s t i t 1 Î² i e here e min Ïµ e Î´ t 1 s t i t is the evacuation rate of the stomach tuna swim towards high concentrations of the prey field through a taxis behaviour according to faugeras and maury 2007 6 v i t p l s t i t c p k p n 0 p l p cos Î¸ i t p sin Î¸ i t p here Î¸ i t p is drawn from the von mises distribution with mean Î¸ 0 which has the same direction as the gradient of the prey field h and concentration parameter Îº m Î± h hence the standard deviation of the von mises distribution is lower if h is higher the logistic function l s t i t in eq 6 implies that the swimming direction of tuna is more strongly determined by the prey index gradient if their stomach is emptier dagorn et al 2000 third tuna particles are attracted towards each other if Îº t 0 7 v i t t cos Î¸ i t t sin Î¸ i t t where Î¸ i t t is drawn from the von mises distribution with mean the direction of d i t k i i k r c x k t x i t and concentration parameter Î³ d i t where r c determines the interaction distance between tuna particles to summarize stochasticity is included to the model in three ways first the level of stochasticity of the tuna swimming towards high prey abundance is controlled by Îº m second stochasticity of the tuna swimming direction towards other tuna is determined by Î³ third the initial location of both fads and tuna particles is random 2 3 fishing strategies to examine the effect of differing model configurations on an idealized catch of tuna fishing effort was kept constant at a single fishing event each day in the simulations if a tuna particle is caught during such an event it is removed and released at a random location in the domain in order to keep the tuna density constant in the domain tyutyunov et al 2008 four contrasting fishing strategies were implemented table 1 the first strategy fs1 is based on fishing of fad unassociated tuna in this strategy fishers have no information about any fad but they use sonar and sometimes helicopters to locate tuna tolentino zonderva et al 2018 hence we assume for our simulations that they simply search the domain to locate schools of tuna performing a single fishing event near a random tuna particle each day i e all tuna particles are caught with a probability Ïµ t if their distance with the randomly picked tuna particle is lower than r a the second type of fishing strategy assumes that fishers know the location of all fads they choose a fad to set their nets and catch every associated tuna particle with a probability Ïµ t a parameter p 0 1 determines the extend of the fisher s information on which fad has most tuna associated with it we order the fads j 0 f from high to low number of associated tuna the probability that a fishing event occurs at fad j is given by the geometric distribution 8 p j 1 p j p j 0 f 1 p j p hence for p 1 fishers have complete information on the number of associated tuna at all fads and always set at the fad that has most associated tuna for p 0 the fishers have no information about the number of associated tuna at fads and choose a fad with equal i e uniform probability in this paper we test fishing strategies p 0 fs2 and p 0 95 fs3 we also use a reference fishing strategy fs0 in fs0 no fishing events occur and no tuna particles are caught in the simulations 2 4 particle particle interaction in lagrangian simulations parcels is a framework for computing virtual lagrangian particle trajectories in ocean flow delandmeter and van sebille 2019 for this study we developed a novel ibm method with the lagrangian particle advection for physical oceanography which includes the interaction between these virtual particles i e tuna and fads inspired by established procedures for smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph for particle based fluid flow mÃ¼ller et al 2005 liu and liu 2010 a specialized procedure of three dimensional kd tree construction kehl et al 2021 as is common also for sph simulations linsen et al 2008 was integrated into the parcels framework the focus of the developed method is on rapid rebuild and particle indexing in a three dimensional geospatial coordinate frame in global ocean simulations over long time spans the arbitrary timestamp of particle insertion or removal makes fixed periodic tree rebuilding impractical parcels thus performs smart local branch rebuilds at the time where particle indices in the ordering tree change specific challenges are the change of particle coordinates and therefore indices in a chain of per particle kernels as well as the proper construction of an unambiguous hitlist of closest particles in short the first challenge is addressed with the design decision to evaluate all advective kernels prior to any interaction thus preventing index changes amid a single pass kernel evaluation the second challenge is addressed by the decision of symmetric ordering i e m 0 q i q j m 0 q j q i with m y q z being y th closest neighbour of particle q z those conditions are mandatory to resolve for particle particle interaction to work in the oceanographic setting this specialized kd tree which manages particle association in the background facilitates relatively fast adjacency queries of particles without excessive memory overhead this in terms enables us to model interactive behaviour between homogeneous and heterogeneous types of particles such as the fad s and tuna super individuals in this study additionally the computational method would in principle also facilitate direct predator prey behaviour through using particles for both the tuna and their prey however the modelling and evaluation of prey as a field quantity reduces the computational demand to a tenable level as the presented study interest is the tuna their prey is just consumed and thus requires no ibm or tracing in itself future studies can exploit the technical interaction possibilities even further by modelling dedicated swarm intelligence and group aware behaviour which is beyond the scope of this study in terms of constraints the method as designed so far still requires tree rebuilding after each particle integration step with a o 3 n log n complexity where n represents the number of particles hence imposing significant computational costs for massive particle sets n 1 0 5 in a parallel and distributed computing setup the kd tree construction and management needs to be globally consistent and thus needs to remain in full on one individual computing node implementation wise the method currently does not support multi processing or distributed computing related method extensions need to address the significant communication overhead at each integration step which is unavoidable due to the non local nature of the algorithm lastly the flexible particle definition and its various possible coordinate systems in oceanography makes a fast c c style implementation infeasible hence all interaction related kernels are evaluated in a computational setting based on python and scipy virtanen et al 2020 exclusively 2 5 ocean flow configurations our model framework was run in several configurations across different idealized flow fields table 1 although these flow fields are idealized they contain specific properties of realistic flows first we use a configuration where the flow is given by a random walk rw v c Îº r Î¾ here Î¾ is a unit random vector such that the value of Îº r constant throughout the whole domain determines the variance of the random walk in this configuration we use reflective boundary conditions for the particles the initial prey field is uniformly distributed and with a value of 0 4 depleted prey is redistributed at a uniformly random location the rw flow represents an isotropically diffusive process second we use a double gyre flow shadden et al 2005 which we here refer to as the double eddy de flow due to the scale at which it is applied fig 1a the double eddy flow has closed boundary conditions and we use reflective boundary conditions for the particles prey abundance is initialized as being large in the middle of one of the two eddies the initialized prey field also provides the probability density function for the redistribution of depleted prey depleted prey is more likely to be redistributed in the middle of this eddy the de flow has the property that passively advected particles accumulate in the middle of the two eddies over time and hence represent meso scale eddies that occur in the ocean third we use the bickley jet bj flow bickley 1937 fig 1b at the spatial scale that is used here the bickley jet flow resembles an oceanic front the bickley jet has a zonal periodic boundary and a meridional closed boundary which are also imposed as boundary conditions on the particles the prey field is initialized to be large in the middle and low in the north and south of the domain the latter two flow configurations are often used when studying the dispersion of advected lagrangian particles conti and badin 2017 del castillo negrete and morrison 1992 the flow was scaled in these configurations such that it fits on the fixed domain that we use in this paper and the maximum flow velocity was set

presented in this paper is 1728 2 6 data we present the results of our simulations across a suite of metrics ranging from the internal state of individuals to the emergent dynamics of aggregated individuals within the domain the patterns we compare our simulations with are first relative trends in numbers of tuna accumulated at fads over time prior to fishing events and thereafter compared to observations of tuna biomass made by echo sounder equipped fads escalle et al 2021 second the fullness of individuals stomachs comparing to those from tuna caught and examined in the western central pacific ocean machful et al 2021 third the length of time that tuna spend associated with fads comparing to electronic tagging experiments of tuna around fads scutt phillips et al 2019 pÃ©rez et al 2020 we have chosen these metrics so as to permit comparison to observed patterns and test the configurations of our model at multiple ecological scales both spatiotemporal and hierarchical simultaneously such an approach helps to constrain the high degrees of freedom inherent in individual based models for example by eliminating model configurations or structures that fail to produce the observed properties of a system at all levels grimm et al 2005 since we applied the ibm only in idealized and not in realistic configurations we cannot set specific criteria on model performance therefore we only compare whether these measures are of similar order of magnitude and represent similar patterns compared to observations 3 results 3 1 colonization of fads by tuna unsurprisingly more tuna become associated at fads when tuna behaviour was fad dominant compared to prey dominant fig 2 since tuna are less likely to move away from fads to forage tuna tuna attraction had little influence on these dynamics supporting information fig s1 fishing strategies had a major influence on the distribution of tuna particles among fads as it governs how fish are depleted and redistributed throughout the domain for a given behavioural configuration fishing strategies that catch tuna more efficiently e g fs3 compared to other fishing strategies generally reduce the number of associated tuna at fads during their initial colonization fig 2a c e in the days leading up to fishing events there was generally a larger number of associated tuna at the targeted fad under fishing strategy fs3 compared to fs2 under the rw and bj configurations fig 2b f due to its more consistent targeting of large associations this strategy prevents a buildup of large tuna numbers at several fads at the same time before the number of associated tuna can grow substantially a fishing event takes place at the fad resulting in a sudden halving of the number of associated tuna in the case of the de flow configuration where both tuna and fad particles tend to accumulate in the centre of the eddies this can result in many tuna associated at fads close to each other such associations can be repeatedly targeted for fishing under fs3 which results in an apparent decrease of biomass through time prior to fishing see below when averaged across the duration of a simulation the distribution of tuna among fads does not change much in the days after a fishing event in part driven by the reduction in density dependent negative feedback from prey depletion fig 2d f of which the strength is partly controlled by the relative Îº p and Îº f values colonization dynamics only weakly depend on fad density supporting information fig s2 on average it takes longer for tuna particles to get near a fad if the fad density is relatively low as a result it also takes longer for the colonization of tuna at fads to stabilize after their deployment moreover at relatively low fad densities less instances of large aggregations switch from one fad to another prior to fishing resulting in a smaller buildup of tuna particles at fads before a fishing event fad colonization and association dynamics differed strongly between different flow configurations fig 2 in the rw configuration tuna associate with nearby fads in a few days after deployment fig 2a the distribution of the number of associated tuna at fads does not change afterwards even if large associations could be expected to build up under fs0 where no fishing events occur this implies that tuna swim towards fads if their stomach is full where they subsequently deplete the local prey field when the prey field gets depleted near the fad due to the presence of many tuna particles and their stomach becomes empty tuna start foraging and move away from the fad while this process repeats the average number of tuna that associate with the fads does not change as the distribution of fads is governed by a brownian motion like random walk if tuna behaviour is fad dominant the build up of tuna at fads takes somewhat longer 10 days since tuna are less likely to swim away from a fad if tuna behaviour is prey dominant few tuna associate with fads as a nonzero gradient of prey density can be easily found throughout the domain for the directed flow configurations de and bj fads are more likely to meet tuna particles compared to the rw flow under the de flow fads are rapidly advected through either the westward or eastward eddy and tuna are attracted towards the prey rich area in the westward eddy where part of the fads accumulate numbers of fad associated tuna increase after deployment and stabilize after 50 80 days fig 2c when the fads accumulate in the middle of the two eddies on average the build up of tuna at fads does not occur before a fishing event in the de configuration fig 2d because the fads accumulate in the middle of the two gyres and fishing events are very likely to occur at the same fads every few days which results in little associated tuna the day before these catch events the bj domain averaged flow has a clear eastward component similarly to the rw configuration a rapid build up of associated tuna occurs in the first few days after deployment fig 2e however the distribution is still changing until day 60 after which it stabilizes observations from echo sounder biomass estimates indicate that tuna colonization at fads after their deployment follows a log normal distribution where the amount of fad associated tuna increases up to approximately 60 80 days after deployment fig 12 in escalle et al 2021 after which it stabilizes this number reduces again on a time scale longer than the 100 day simulations presented in this paper both the bj and de configurations fig 2c e compare better with these observations of tuna accumulation around fads compared to the rw configuration because the flow has a clear direction in bj and de which is also often the case in reality in the rw case on the other hand the time mean flow direction is 0 everywhere in the domain moreover observations indicate a buildup of tuna at fads before a fishing event and a stable number of associated tuna afterwards fig 13 in escalle et al 2021 similar to the rw and bj configurations fig 2b f overall we find that the ocean flow configuration has a major influence on the colonization of tuna particles at fads chiefly due to fads covering more distance over a given time within the domain which aids in their collection of tuna 3 2 stomach fullness tuna behaviour has implications for simulated stomach fullness as more tuna particles become associated with a fad due to fad dominant behaviour they deplete the prey locally fig 3 as a consequence the competition among tuna for food near them results in a lower stomach fullness of fad associated tuna compared to unassociated tuna when tuna particle swimming direction is only determined by the prey field Îº f 0 tuna either associate with fads incidentally if the fad is located in the prey rich area e g western eddy in the de flow or if the flow field is responsible for the accumulation of both fad and tuna particles in the same area if no prey is available e g in the eastern eddy in the de flow unsurprisingly stomach fullness is high if the tuna behaviour is not influenced by fads Îº f 0 indicating that tuna particles are more likely to end up in prey rich areas when their swimming behaviour is only determined by prey although absolute stomach fullness does not change much when this is the case Îº f 0 compared to Îº f 0 almost no difference exists between fad associated and unassociated tuna in contrast when tuna swimming behaviour is only determined by fads Îº p 0 those tuna that associate with a fad stay near the fad until they are caught at a fishing event tuna tuna attraction increases tuna stomach fullness Îº t 0 01 versus Îº t 0 on average a difference of 0 02 and 0 20 for de and bj configurations respectively tuna tuna attraction may lead to a snowballing effect castro et al 2002 where tuna may end up near a prey rich area by following other tuna for instance if tuna particles are located in the north or south of the domain in the bj configuration in the absence of any prey gradient or fads their swimming direction is arbitrary for Îº t 0 and they are likely to remain here with an empty stomach if Îº t 0 on the other hand it increases their ability to move to a prey rich area in the middle of the domain by following other tuna as a result tuna tuna attraction results in less tuna particles near the northern or southern boundary of the domain where prey abundance is low hence tuna stomach fullness is generally higher if tuna tuna attraction is included while fad density has no clear effect on the stomach fullness supporting information fig s3 the influence of fishing strategies on stomach fullness is only weak on average tuna stomach fullness is 0 02 and 0 14 lower for fishing strategy fs0 compared to other fishing strategies for the de and bj configuration respectively fishing strategies determine the amount of depletion and subsequent redistribution of tuna particles more efficient fishing strategies imply that more tuna are caught and redistributed at a location without the presence of a fad which relieves the tuna density dependent reduction of prey near the fad as a result stomach fullness is generally higher for these efficient fishing strategies in the bj flow configuration stomach fullness is generally higher and its difference between fad associated and non associated tuna is more sensitive to tuna behaviour compared to the de configuration fig 3 the dominant flow direction in this configuration also helps to continuously transport fad associated tuna through the richest areas of the prey field reducing local depletion and resulting in generally higher stomach fullness we also tested the tuna stomach fullness in the rw flow configuration not shown in this configuration stomach fullness is generally low 3 any tuna swimming behaviour results in a heterogeneous distribution of tuna particles which focuses the depletion of the homogeneously distributed prey field as a result tuna particles are more often located in areas where the prey field is locally depleted since no dominant flow direction exists this situation does not change hence the tuna stomachs are generally low in this configuration observations of tuna stomach contents indicate a lower stomach fullness for tuna that are caught near a fad compared to tuna that are caught while not associated to a fad fig 3 15 hallier and gaertner 2008 mÃ©nard et al 2000 allain and leroy 2006 machful et al 2021 note that it is mainly the comparison of the relative difference between fad associated and non associated tuna stomach fullness that is of importance here since the observed stomach fullness itself is an indirect measure varying with a number of covariates and difficult to compare with the stomach fullness in our simulations both absolute and relative stomach fullness match well with observations in both the de and bj configuration fig 3 especially for equal fad and prey driven behaviour Îº p Îº f 3 3 continuous residence times tuna leave a fad either when they are caught when another fad pulls them away or when they are foraging and move away towards an area with high prey abundance hence we find that stronger fad dominant behaviour increases continuous residence times crt and prey dominant behaviour decreases crt since the former increases the attraction strength of the fads and the latter causes abandonment of the fad to hunt prey the impact of tuna tuna attraction Îº t 0 on crt is weak tuna tuna attraction only has a relevant influence on crt under fishing strategy fs0 no fishing in the bj configuration fig 4d for fs0 where no tuna is caught and redistributed the median crt depends on how many tuna particles end up in the middle of the domain at the beginning of the simulation where prey abundance is high and cause the tuna to leave fads while foraging tuna tuna attraction may result in a higher tuna abundance in the middle of the domain through a snowballing effect and subsequent greater depletion of local prey castro et al 2002 fishing strategies decrease crt in our simulations as removal of individuals from around fads necessarily cuts short their residence at that fad fig 4d f however this effect is distinctly different between ocean flow configurations in the case of the bj configuration median crt can be relatively long in the absence of fishing fs0 crts are shorter in fs3 compared to fs2 because fishing is more efficient in fs3 and more fish are caught which shortens the median crt fishing strategies fs1 and fs2 do not deviate much because clustering of tuna mostly occurs near fads and hence the fishing events also often occur near fads under both strategies there appeared to be little impact of fishing strategy on crts under the de configuration where resident times remained very short due to the accumulation of tuna and fads in small areas driving frequent switching between fads by tuna supporting information fig s4 crt decreases at higher fad densities fig 4a c in particular when tuna behaviour is either prey or fad dominant Îº f Îº p this pattern occurs because the increasing probability that groups of tuna particles move from one fad to another this switching of tuna from one fad to another can occur either a because the other fad which has more associated tuna is located nearby and is more attractive or b the prey field is locally depleted near the current fad and tuna decide to look for prey elsewhere due to a low stomach fullness and associated with a new fad in a nearby and more prey rich area crts varied by flow field being the longest in the bj configuration compared to the rw and de configurations where the flow has a clear eastward direction keeping tuna associated while continually moving into prey rich areas as a consequence tuna are unlikely to move away from a fad to forage as they move into prey rich areas while remaining associated with a fad rw is the configuration with shortest crt because tuna are most often forced to forage away from fads in this configuration median absolute crt of tuna at fads are mostly between 1 10 days in the simulations fig 4 but can be several tens of days in some configurations e g fig 4c f which conforms to observations pÃ©rez et al 2020 scutt phillips et al 2019 scutt phillips et al 2017 supporting information fig s5 observations in drifting supporting information fig s5 and coastal anchored fad arrays pÃ©rez et al 2020 show an increasing crt at higher fad densities in our simulations increasing crt for higher fad densities only occurs for a few fad densities in the de and bj configurations fig 4b c although these do broadly match with fad densities present in crt observations crt can increase with fad density first because more fads cover a larger part of the domain and will associate more tuna particles second the same number of fishing events is distributed among more fads hence the probability reduces that a fishing event occurs at a specific fad if the fad density is higher and the crt of tuna associated with this fad increases 3 4 tuna catch we find that tuna catch is also sensitive to different behavioural parameters flow configurations and fishing strategies in our simulations fig 5 catch is generally higher in those configurations that result in a more heterogeneous distribution of tuna particles as our fishing strategies generally target aggregations this is particularly the case for fad dominant tuna behaviour fig 5 hence fad dominant behaviour results in a higher catch compared to prey dominant behaviour if it adds to the heterogeneity of the tuna distribution especially for the rw flow fig 5d however tuna tuna attraction influenced catch only weakly the effect of fishing strategy varies markedly with ocean flow configuration within the bj and rw flow targeting of fads with many associated tuna fs3 always results in higher catch than targeting of random fads fs2 however this relationship is reversed in the de simulations fig 5e due to the concentration of particles in the centre of the eddies and the density dependant attraction towards fads with many associated tuna becomes very strong since the fs3 strategy reduces the number of associated tuna at densely populated fads before associations can grow to a substantial number the attraction strength of fads is reduced compared to the attraction strength of the prey field as a result mean catch actually decreases compared to evenly targeting fads throughout the domain interestingly the targeting of random tuna particles in the domain fs1 often results in a higher catch than random fad fishing fs2 since fs1 picks a tuna particle at random to determine the fishing location when tuna are heterogeneously distributed it is likely that the fishing event occurs in an area with a lot of aggregated tuna independently of whether those fish are associated with a fad or not an optimal fad density often exists where catch is maximized under the fs2 strategy fig 5a c when fad density is very low only a fraction of the available tuna particles in the domain associate and are exposed to fishing with the maximum possible aggregation limited by local depletion of prey at very high fad densities on the other hand all available tuna particles are likely to associate with a fad but will be distributed over more fads and the probability that a fishing event occurs on a large aggregation is reduced this optimum fad density does not occur under the de flow configuration as this scenario results in very dense accumulation of fads between which tuna switch frequently targeting any fad in the domain is likely to yield the same catch as with our other results the impact of tuna having generally emptier stomachs in the rw configuration reduces the time they associate and aggregate at fads due to their increased need for foraging under greater competition which subsequently reduces the total catch fig 5a d we do not compare the catch in our simulations with observations because the number of tuna particles themselves cannot directly be compared to caught tuna biomass hence if these simulations are compared to catch data it can only be compared to the relative catch in different configurations however observed catch data represents many configurations of e g ocean flow fad density at the same time and tuna catch is highly variable as a result moreover general catch dynamics e g the dependence of catch on fad density as with continuous residence times crt are not known 4 discussion and outlook using the new particle particle and particle field interaction functionalities of the parcels framework we have developed an individual based model ibm of tuna behaviour in this ibm tuna is advected by ocean flow while interacting with drifting fish aggregating devices fads prey and other tuna the ibm presented here can be described by a small number of rules but which allow for both direct and indirect interactions between components in the system to occur the model was able to simultaneously produce many of the dynamics observed in the real ocean such as the distribution of tuna among different fads their stomach fullness and the tuna continuous residence time near fads these emergent properties most consistently matched observations when simulated tuna behaviour was driven equally by both fads and prey Îº f Îº p however testing the ibm in several idealized configurations of oceanic regime we found that the flow and prey field configuration has a major impact on these emergent metrics for instance the dominant flow direction in the bickley jet scenario helps to reduce local prey depletion by large associated aggregations of tuna allowing for a longer residence in the area around fads without hunger causing dispersal due to foraging conversely when there is an accumulation of particles due to flow as is the case in our double eddy scenario concentration of both tuna and fads occurs with high levels of prey depletion and switching by aggregations in the centre of these eddies hence the flow configuration determines the timescales at which tuna get close enough to a fad to associate with it in contrast our simulations under a null random walk flow configuration unrepresentative of the equatorial areas where tuna interact with fads resulted in far fewer of the real world patterns being replicated great variability has been observed in the dynamics of tropical tunas around fish aggregating devices causing suggestions of behavioural modes switching robert et al 2013 high day to day variability in biomass detected by echosounder equipped buoys escalle et al 2021 and mass abandonment of fads by fish at the same time moreno et al 2007 here we have shown that such variation can occur at similar magnitudes purely as a function of changes to the flow field in which tuna and fads find themselves an oceanographic feature rarely incorporated into fisheries analyses vidal et al 2020 the highly interactive nature of our agents mean that many of the emergent properties are highly sensitive to the fishing strategy beyond simply the depletion of tuna causing a reduction in the number of associated particles at a fad fishing events also relieve the density dependent negative feedback of those associations which deplete their surrounding prey field whilst simultaneously reducing the positive feedback of fad attraction caused by those large associations this leads to counter intuitive dynamics such as targeting of tuna associating with fads for fishing actually increasing the mean residence time of fish as it supports the remaining fish to stay associated for longer with lesser depletion of local prey around the fad forcing a large association to fragment away from the fad in search of food the ibm we have presented in this study remains idealized and with few parameters directly informed by data however such simulation models could be considered opaque thought experiments di paolo et al 2000 capable of exploring the potential mechanisms that lead to observed patterns and bracketing their uncertainty here we have shown that for the set of biologically plausible assumptions we have structured our model on realistic flow and prey fields are a requirement for observed dynamics to emerge however we also include a considerable flexibility in the behavioural parameters that can be used to examine more specific cases similarly the real world data that we have used for comparison of these dynamics have likely been observed across a range of ocean flow fields tuna prey distributions fad densities and possibly even behavioural modes our ibm remains a hypothesis testing tool where each of these components can be controlled for example tropical tuna behave differently among different species and size classes bigeye tuna thunnus obesus associate with fads during their small juvenile stage and slowly spend less time doing so as they grow and develop physiological adaptations to feed at depth although our ibm does not directly distinguish between different tuna types several parameters e g Îº f Îº p in the ibm determine the relative strength of different dynamics on the tuna behaviour hence different of these parameter values may apply to these different classes or species changing through time with the age of the fish we have chosen idealized flow and prey fields at the 1 scale to compare simulations across this is typically the minimum scale at which tuna populations are modelled and below which model processes are assumed to be homogeneous since these configurations are idealized the distribution of tuna and their catch can be explained by known properties of the flow prey and interactions with fads at this sub grid scale however a question remains how these dynamics could be incorporated into ocean basin scale tuna models senina et al 2020 for instance these ocean basin scale tuna models could use sub grid scale parameterizations that are informed by similar ibm simulations of this paper identifying important sub grid scale mechanisms such as the impact of flow or fad density on catch then allows development of their incorporation into population level models this could be explored through alternate function responses or as covariates in analyses that use catch per unit effort cpue as an indication for population size furthermore output from state of the art hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models or tuna species specific habitat fields senina et al 2020 could be incorporated to further test the ability of this or existing tuna ibms scutt phillips et al 2018 to replicate tuna fad dynamics in a more realistic scenario in such an application the prey field could be based on the underlying eulerian model simulation and will be more compatible to the flow such a realistic setting may be applied to simulations in a future scenario in order to test the influence of climate change on the distribution of fads and its implication on their interaction with tuna bell et al 2021 applying the ibm in a realistic setting may require different fishing strategies fs2 and fs3 are rather extreme cases where fishers either have no or almost complete knowledge on where the tuna is located in reality however their knowledge about the locations of tuna is likely somewhere in between fishing strategies fs2 and fs3 the variability in simulated catch shown in this study highlights interesting questions regarding the relationship between catch the density of fads in a region and whether certain model configurations will lead to a nonlinear response of catch to tuna abundance so called hyperstability or hyperdepletion for example the idealized scenarios we have explored in this study have shown that simulated catch from the same population size of tuna can change by a factor of two purely as a result of different flow and prey field configurations while all other parameters remain constant our tuna ibm could be used to investigate the dependence of catch levels on these parameters across different tuna abundance under different model configurations examination of fad tuna observations including catch could where possible include in situ oceanography to further test the hypotheses of our model such analyses would provide a better understanding of how to interpret catch data potential levels at high stable populations may collapse or parameterize tuna fad dynamics at a large scale typically used to model their population dynamics and provide scientific advice on their management credit authorship contribution statement peter d

24302,attempts to resolve the paradox of sexual reproduction in animal species have typically involved single factor explanations including but not limited to sexual species being better able to cope with fluctuating resources being better able to evade pathogens and predators and sex facilitating the elimination of deleterious alleles only a handful of studies have investigated two potentially interacting factors which most commonly involve the ability to evade pathogens and predators and mutation load only two simulation studies by the same authors have examined the potential interaction of 3 factors our study is the first three factor study to examine the potential interaction between purifying selection the ability to avoid predators and the ability to cope with fluctuating resources therefore we addressed a number of open eco evolutionary questions in our study first what is the effect of these three factors on the prevalence of sexual reproduction in animals second do these factors act integratively antagonistically or independently in determining the prevalence of sexual reproduction the controls were our three prior studies where we investigated each of these factors individually our aim was to determine if the effect sizes in our individual studies were integratively enhanced by the interaction with the remaining two factors what we found is that purifying selection purging deleterious alleles in sexual species was integratively enhanced by the two additional factors of increased predation and fluctuating resources on the other hand the effect of purifying selection and increased predation had an antagonistic effect on the levels of sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction in facultative species where there were fluctuating resources finally the presence of an intermediate intensity deleterious allele and fluctuating resources had no discernable effect on the extinction levels of sexual and asexual species where there is increased predation these results are not surprising as there is no a priori reason to assume that multiple factors will have a greater impact on mode of reproduction than any of these factors acting independently our results suggest that multiple factors can act intergratively antagonistically and non reductively all at the same time which is a significant contribution to the open question in the biological literature regarding the effect of multiple factors on the prevalence of sexual reproduction keywords tangled bank red tooth purifying selection pluralistic explanations antagonistic pluralism integrative pluralism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 open questions regarding the prevalence of sexual reproduction although biologists have been doing research for decades to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction the general consensus in the literature is that the prevalence of sexual reproduction remains an unresolved and possibly intractable problem for evolutionary biology the problem of the prevalence of sexual reproduction despite its costs remains an open question in eco evolutionary theory see table 1 this is owing to the fact that the costs of sexual reproduction including useless males vulnerability to mating during reproduction energy expenditure on the act of reproduction and so forth appear to outweigh any potential benefits of sexual reproduction eventuated by recombination stelzer 2015 lehntonen et al 2011 otto and lenormand 2002 almost all the attempts to explain the prevalence of sex rely on single factor explanations one such single factor explanation is that sexual reproduction via recombination and increased genetic variability gives rise to populations that are more resistant to predators and pathogens vs asexually reproducing species see table 2 additional single factor explanations for the prevalence of sex include but are not limited to the ability of recombination to purge a species genome of deleterious alleles cutter 2005 keightley and otto 2006 gray and goddard 2012 macpherson scott and gras 2021 and the ability of recombination to give rise to individuals that are better able to survive fluctuating resources than their asexual relatives tagg et al 2005 koch et al 2009 tobler and schlupp 2010 barbuti et al 2012 macpherson et al 2022 a natural inference based on the failure of single factor attempts to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction is that a more powerful explanation is needed one such potential explanation may reside in considering multiple factors simultaneously it is possible that several of these factors function interactively to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction however as noted single factor explanations dominate the literature on this topic a recent article by neiman et al 2017 delineates only 17 attempts to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction in terms of a plurality of factors what follows is a discussion of the pluralistic alternative to explaining the prevalence of sexual reproduction 1 2 discussion the pluralistic alternative 1 2 1 possible reasons for the scarcity of pluralistic empirical and simulation studies regarding sex in the case of both simulation and empirical studies the relative scarcity of pluralistic explanations in solving the puzzle of the prevalence of sexual reproduction probably has its origins in pragmatic difficulties associated with designing empirical studies that take multiple possibly interacting factors into account these studies may involve complicated experimental designs which prospective researchers will find prohibitive meirmans and neiman 2006 if four factors are considered each with two levels e g present absent and such that these variables can be manipulated independently and these factors are crossed then this results in a 24 factorial design collins et al 2009 of course variables such as predation level will have more than just two levels such as present or absent however collins et al 2009 suggest that experimenters can choose a reduced design even in cases where not all variables have 2 levels this reduced design mitigates design complexity resulting in a balance between simplicity and explanatory power in terms of computer simulation studies if researchers are investigating multiple independent variables this would seem to complicate experimental design since it could slow down overall computation time making such experiments difficult to carry out however as will be argued below this is not necessarily the case 1 2 2 intra level vs inter level pluralism pluralism within a domain as opposed to pluralism across domains is a distinction made in fehr 2001 and mitchell 2002 fehr 2001 argues that there is a pluralistic explanation for the origins of sex involving factors that are non reducible from different domains dna repair which is at the molecular level and the ability to elude predators which is a macro level explanation which constitutes an inter level pluralism on the other hand combining red queen sexually reproducing individuals are better able to elude predators pathogens vs clonals and tangled bank sexually reproducing individuals are better able to deal with fluctuating resources both macro level explanations to explain the maintenance of sex is an intra level pluralistic explanation song et al 2012 1 2 3 different varieties of inter level and intra level pluralism multiple factors from the same domain or across domains can interact integratively or antagonistically in explaining the prevalence of sexual reproduction or there may be no interaction at all a domain refers to the level of explanation used whether at the macro level or at the molecular level mitchell 2002 argues for an integrative pluralism between and across domains with respect to complex biological phenomena according to mitchell 2002 multiple explanations do not compete with one another instead their combination augments explanatory power mitchell 2002 schubach and sprenger 2011 a more fine grained distinction between two kinds of integrative pluralism is proposed by neiman et al 2017 synergistic pluralism is the view that the impact of multiple factors across domains or from the same domain on the prevalence of sexual reproduction is greater than the impact of the factors considered individually on the other hand enhancement pluralism is the view that one factor augments the impact of another factor on the prevalence of sexual reproduction neiman et al 2017 a third type of interactive pluralism not considered by neiman et al 2017 is what could be called antagonistic pluralism where the occurrence of multiple factors across domains or within a domain reduces their respective impacts on the prevalence of sexual reproduction finally isolationist pluralism or non reductive pluralism is the view that inter level or intra level explanations of sexual reproduction do not interact in such a case the effects of these factors on the prevalence of sexual reproduction is the same whether considered in isolation or in conjunction with other factors mitchell 2002 1 2 4 attempts to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction from a pluralistic perspective neiman et al 2017 cite 19 studies conducted between 1994 and 2012 with significant findings in 18 of the 19 studies where two or more factors interact either synergistically or in an enhancement capacity in explaining the prevalence of sexual reproduction red queen for pathogens and elimination of deleterious alleles are the two most common factors tested neiman et al 2017 table 3 summarizes these studies almost all the studies 17 of them involved red queen as one of the causal explanations for the prevalence of sexual reproduction neiman et al 2017 combined these studies lend credence to the thesis of integrative enhancement synergistic pluralism in explaining the prevalence of sexual reproduction as an example of a study confirming a synergistic interaction between multiple mechanisms in explaining sex neiman et al 2017 cite the simulation study of lively and howard 1994 who provide evidence that red queen dynamics decrease asexual lineages resulting in the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations in the remaining lineages as a result these remaining lineages quickly go extinct neiman et al 2017 the study by lively and howard 1994 demonstrates a synergistic interaction between the red queen effect and the muller s ratchet effect which involves preventing the accumulation of deleterious alleles as a result of recombination further neiman et al 2017 cite a study by lively 2009 as an example of research suggesting an enhancement interaction between multiple factors in explaining the prevalence of sex 1 2 5 overcoming practical difficulties with testing pluralistic explanations to deal with the practical difficulties in framing and testing pluralistic hypotheses discussed above meirmans and neiman 2006 proposed a framework for testing interactive pluralistic hypotheses explaining sex for empirical studies citing a computer simulation study after considering a number of potential candidates meirmans and neiman 2006 propose the so called manipulative model for testing a pluralistic approach involving red queen and muller s ratchet which involves manipulating each factor individually along with their interaction apparently the virtue of the manipulative approach is that the interaction of the red queen effect and muller s ratchet is easier to test than testing either factor separately meirmans and neiman 2006 this is owing to the fact that the threshold for a discernible result for the interacting factors is lower than the threshold for either stand alone factor meirmans and neiman 2006 more specifically manipulating the interaction of factors requires lower virulence red queen and lower mutation rate muller s ratchet than when the factors are stand alone meirmans and neiman 2006 in fact the same levels of the factors taken individually may not be sufficient to sustain sex meirmans and neiman 2006 according to meirmans and neiman 2006 the computer simulation study of lively and howard 1994 is an example of testing mutation load and parasitism synergistically along with the empirical studies by jokela et al 2003 and cooper et al 2005 1 3 testing the pluralistic hypothesis and significance of the study meirmans and neiman 2006 propose their manipulative model for pluralistic testing primarily for empirical studies although they cite computer simulation studies e g lively and howard 1994 as intuition pumps for their method thus their method should also be applicable to computer simulation studies in our study we employ individual based modeling ibm computer simulations to investigate three stand alone factors discussed above for the prevalence of sex red queen purging deleterious alleles tangled bank which de facto uses the manipulative method of meirmans and neiman 2006 to test their interaction given that their effects are staggered we chose these factors because these are some of the more prominent factors used to explain the prevalence of sex as discussed in hartfield and keightley 2012 moreover our three prior studies where we investigated each of these factors separately involve the control runs for our pluralistic study the three factor pluralistic hypothesis that we are testing using the manipulation method of meirmans and neiman 2006 is as follows hypothesis the avoidance of predators and the purging of deleterious mutations in a fluctuating resource environment act integratively to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction the testing of this hypothesis will involve manipulating each factor individually although staggered in the same runs staggering the timing of their introduction according to the experiments performed on each factor individually involves a de facto manipulation of their potential interaction the mid level of the deleterious allele da will be initiated at the first time step of the runs the sin function causing fluctuating resources will be activated at the beginning of the runs although the first 20 000 runs are relatively stable and finally the level of predation will be increased at the 15 000th time step corroboration of the above hypothesis will involve determining whether the effect sizes of each of these three factors in the pluralistic experiment are larger or smaller than or the same as the effect sizes of these factors in their individual experiments in the case of the deleterious allele da the metric for the effect size is its intensity for fluctuating resources the metric for the effect size is the rate of increase in sexual reproduction and the rate of decrease in asexual reproduction for facultative species and finally for the red tooth effect the effect size metric is the differential extinction rate of sexual vs asexual prey species if it turns out that the effect size for a single factor fi is larger in the pluralistic study than in the individual study performed in an earlier experiment then the effect of fi was possibly enhanced by one or more of the remaining factors in such a case the integrative hypothesis outlined above is confirmed with respect to this factor if the effect size for the single factor fi remains constant between the individual and pluralistic experiments then there is no effect on fi by the other factors therefore with respect to this factor the hypothesis is not confirmed finally if the effect size for the single factor fi is smaller in the pluralistic experiment as opposed to the individual experiment the other factors may have acted antagonistically with respect to factor fi it is possible that only one factor is enhanced by one or more of the other factors with the remaining factors being unchanged or antagonized by the other factors that two factors are each enhanced by one or more of the remaining factors or that all three are enhanced by one of more of the remaining factors 2 methods in this study we used an individual based ecological modeling platform ecosim to carry out our experiment section 2 1 involves a description of standard ecosim and modified ecosim modeling asexual and facultative reproduction which is outlined in greater detail in macpherson et al 2021a and in the odd description of ecosim included in the supplementary materials appended to this paper 2 1 standard ecosim vs asexual and facultative ecosim standard ecosim is outlined in detail in the odd description modeled after grimm et al 2010 2020 and in scott et al 2018 scott and gras 2020 and in macpherson et al 2021a ecosim summarized in fig 1 has discretized time steps and it is spatially explicit individuals start out with limited energy whereas energy is increased through eating eat and hunting hunt other activities such as sexually reproducing reproduce decrease energy levels the two kinds of individuals in ecosim are either prey or predators prey consume grass grass whereas predators consume prey meat moreover the amount of grass at the primary trophic level is influenced by the waste products of prey and predators serving as fertilizer the cell is the fundamental unit of space containing prey and predators finite amounts of grass and finite amounts of fertilizer time is measured in terms of discrete time steps the world which is a 1000 1000 torus world lasting typically tens of thousands of time steps consists of cells the odd summary of ecosim is represented diagrammatically in fig 1 below individuals in ecosim have a two part genome viz the behavioural genome and the physical genome although inherited genomes are fixed for individuals mutations are able to occur across generations associated with an individual s behavioural genome is a fuzzy cognitive map fcm kosko 1986 a graph model such that the stimulation of concepts is represented by nodes moreover an arc represents how the stimulation of a given concept influences the stimulation of the target concept fcm concepts are of three types perception such as food being close foodclose internal such as being hungry hunger or action such as escape predators escape each node has a floating point real number value between 0 and 1 which represents the activation level of a concept while many concepts are shared between prey and predators e g reproduce some concepts are unique to either prey or predators as an example hunting prey hunt is a predator concept but not a prey concept fcm arc values are an array of byte values mapped to floating point values whose range is 12 7 to 12 8 inclusive whereas byte representations are saved in files floating point values are used for computation raw inputs such as friends being close friendclose from an individual s immediate environment are fuzzified discretization with possible overlaps into perceptual concept activation levels on the other hand the activation levels of internal and action concepts are computed as a weighted sum of all incident arc values which are then multiplied by their respective origin activation levels the action concept with the highest activation level determines which action an individual will perform at a given time step it follows that the individual s viability and fecundity is directly influenced by their behavioural genome just like the behavioural genome the physical genome directly influences individual viability and fecundity the physical genome is an array of byte values each byte value is mapped onto floating point values where the mapping depends on the physical trait being represented as an example maximum amount of energy maxenergy is a stand in for the size of the individual limiting the amount of energy the individual can hold maxenergy ranges from 100 to 6475 by selecting an action each time step individuals interact with other individuals and their environment the decision to select a given action is influenced by the individual s state and physical characteristics given that inherited genomes directly influence an individual s fitness the evolution of gene pools in ecosim occurs through natural selection moreover there are no predefined fitness functions in ecosim gras et al 2015 in standard ecosim reproduction is effected via sexual reproduction individuals are either male or female with gender being determined at birth and fixed for the lifespan of the individual the only action requiring cooperation between two opposite sex individuals is reproduction the strongest individuals where strength is a proxy for the combination of energy level energy and age age have first choice for mates and resources in order to mimic female choosiness only females initiate sexual reproduction this characteristic of ecosim is validated by several empirical studies such as gabor and halladay 1997 and ben ari 2000 before a female can attempt reproduction several checks must occur in sequence age is checked to ensure that the female has reached the minimum reproductive age reproductiveage then energy is checked to ensure that the female has enough energy to pass on to her offspring stateofbirth is the amount of energy required to reproduce computed as a percentage of the individual s maximum energy if reproduction is successful this energy is passed on to the newborn by each parent in attempting reproduction the female randomly selects a mate in the same cell if no males are in the same cell as the female or the female is unfit to reproduce determined by their age or level of energy then the act of reproduction fails with no energy cost incurred although the individual does not perform any action at this time step for a sexual reproduction attempt to succeed several checks must be passed the male must be older than their minimum reproductive age and like the female they need to have sufficient energy to reproduce further the male must not have acted reproductively given that reproduction is initiated by females also the genetic distance between the two individuals must range between a minimum and maximum genetic distance provided that all checks are passed the reproductive event succeeds resulting in the generation of a new offspring while the newly generated offspring receives energy as the sum of each parent s stateofbirth described above each parent loses their transmitted energy including a loss equal to 5 of the transmitted energy which reflects energy costs associated with reproductive effort a newly generated individual will have a genome that is the recombination of its parents genome see adaptation in the odd both types of genomes physical and behavioural each has a specialized crossover operator used to recombine the parents genomes subsequent to this a specialized mutation operator is applied to each type of genome which puts the finishing touch on the genome the genes of behavioural and physical genomes are subject to a basic mutation rate of 0 1 whereas insertion and deletion mutation rates defined only for the behavioural genome are 0 05 an individual s sex is determined randomly with an equal chance of being male or female since each gene directly influences only one behavioural trait the behavioural genome accommodates epistasis but not pleiotropy whereas in the physical genome although there is neither epistasis nor pleiotropy some sex linkage can occur during recombination reproductive mechanisms for prey that mirror asexual and facultative reproduction are introduced into the asexual reproduction ar and facultative reproduction fr variants of ecosim these new mechanisms define a new type of reproductive action asexual reproduction reproduceasexual for prey with correlative alterations to the fcm along with a definition of the energy dynamics regarding asexual reproduction these modifications aside the ar and fr variants of ecosim are the same as standard ecosim to be eligible to perform asexual reproduction the prey individual must be female and older than their minimum reproductive age if these criteria are met the only remaining requirement is that the individual has sufficient energy analogous to the energy requirement of reproduce reproduceasexual is based on the individual s stateofbirth as defined above given that there is only one parent this energy requirement is multiplied by a factor of 1 9 in addition a 30 energy loss penalty is imposed these penalties make biological sense as can be seen in carter et al 2012 if the female individual has sufficient energy reproduceasexual succeeds and a new offspring is generated although the behavioural and physical genomes related to reproduceasexual are not subject to syngametic recombination and crossover both genomes are subject to the same mutation mechanisms as outlined for sexual reproduction moreover the sex of the offspring is determined randomly just as for sexual reproduction there is a correspondence between the fr variant of ecosim and what has been observed in nature species that reproduce facultatively have been found in nature as discussed in shibata et al 2017 and groot et al 2003 facultative prey individuals have both reproduce and reproduceasexual nodes in the fcm in the fr variant of ecosim there is only a slight difference in the initialization of the prey fcm edges between sr ar and fr edges to reproduceasexual in ar have the same weight as the edges to reproduce in sr whereas in the fr variant edges to reproduce are identical to those in the sr variant although this is not the case for ar we multiplied the initial value of positive edges to reproduceasexual by 0 75 the explanation of this calibration is to reduce the probability that fr individuals will reproduce asexually given that for the fr variant we found that with a constant of 1 0 i e all edges to reproduce and reproduceasexual are identically initialized prey individuals became biased towards reproduceasexual over reproduce after the first 100 time steps a key goal in our experiments involving facultative reproduction was to have both asexual and sexual reproduction used by the prey in the facultative runs if the costs associated with ar and sr were very different then one mode may be favored over the other consequently we wanted to ensure a balance between the two modes in facultative runs so that we could measure the independent variables in a given study e g deleterious alleles resource levels predation levels while controlling for confounding factors parameters of control variants were tuned in other works scott et al 2018 what follows is an outline of the methods used to conduct our pluralistic study both in terms of the manipulation of each of the three independent variables and an account of how these variables potentially interact due to a staggering of their introduction 2 2 deleterious allele what follows is a brief description of what we did to introduce an energy robbing deleterious allele da into the physical genome of sr ar and fr prey for the purpose of measuring the difference in the purging rates of deleterious alleles between sr ar and fr prey this is exactly the method that we employed in macpherson et al 2021a the introduction of da occurs at the first time step we constructed sr deleterious srd ar deleterious ard and fr deleterious frd experimental runs da has the following features da has a byte representation i e discrete values from 0 to 255 inclusive that we initialized mid range to 128 during crossover the new offspring receives the value of the gene from a randomly selected parent as noted da imposes an energy cost per time step with respect to the magnitude of its value this cost is computed by multiplying the value of the gene by 3 and then applying a power of 0 75 to it at initialization because the gene has a value of 128 in each individual the starting cost for this allele is 86 75 energy per time step when this allele is gradually purged by reducing its average magnitude in the gene pool its mean nnergy cost also decreases when the magnitude of the gene reaches 0 corresponding energy cost also reaches 0 therefore as the da is purged individuals will have more energy to perform actions that increase viability and fecundity such as reproducing and finding food findfood 2 3 artificially varying primary resource availability the manipulation of preys primary food resource grass in this part of the study is modelled after the method employed in macpherson et al 2021b for sr fr and ar control runs the maximum amount of the primary resource per cell is normally fixed at 4000 regardless of the time step on the other hand for sr fr and ar experimental runs srvr frvr arvr respectively this maximum level of grass was allowed to vary as a function of time step for sr ar and fr experimental runs the maximum amount of grass maxgrass was allowed to vary cyclically between 3200 and 4800 following the application of a cosine wave with a period of 400 time steps eq 1 at each time step t the maxgrass value was updated according to eq 1 following the application of our grass diffusion model the quantity of grass per cell was limited to the new maxgrass value for that time step this method generated a significant amount of temporal variation in grass while at the same time allowing the simulation to stabilize for over 20 000 time steps without prey or predator extinction 1 grassmax cos t Ï 200 1 800 3200 in order to test the possible role of reproductive mode on adaptability to fluctuating resources we compared srvr sexually reproducing prey with cyclical variation arvr asexually reproducing prey with cyclical variation and frvr facultatively reproducing prey with cyclical variation in experimental runs with the sr ar and fr control runs with respect to various parameters such as population for example in light of the tangled bank hypothesis one would expect that sexually reproducing prey will have larger populations as opposed to asexually reproducing prey in an environment with fluctuating resources as a result of greater genetic variability and hence greater adaptability of sexually reproducing prey also regarding frvr prey one would naturally expect a lower rate of asexual reproduction and a higher rate of sexual reproduction in environments with fluctuating resources this is borne out in a study by zhang et al 2016 where it was observed that individuals of the facultative species daphnia samiloids undergo parthenogenic reproduction in stable environments and switch to sexual reproduction in unstable environments what follows is table 4 which outlines the rationale for the various run configurations we ran fifteen simulations each of sr ar fr srvr arvr and frvr the proportion of populations evading proportion of populations killed by predators and number of individuals in the simulations were compared 2 4 artificially increasing predator pressure in experimental runs the sr ar and fr variants srp arp and frp ran identically to the corresponding sr ar and fr control runs until the 15 000th time step immediately following the 15 000th time step predation pressure for srp arp and frp was increased the method used to artificially increase predator pressure in the srp arp and frp runs is as follows we randomly sampled living predators at a given time step duplicated them and then added the duplicates into the simulation all dynamic attributes e g energy fcm states and static attributes e g sex fcm edge values were copied from selected predator individuals such that predators could be selected multiple times for duplication for a given run the number of predator duplicates added to the simulation at a given time step was in direct proportion to the number of prey individuals we slowly increased the number of duplicates over time so as not to shock the system and to elicit a potential evolutionary response to the increasing predator pressure the calculation of the number of predator duplicates nd for a given time step t with the number of prey nprey relative to that time step eq 2 the equation below is from macpherson et al 2021b 2 n d n p r e y t 15 00 0 5 000 00 at the 15 000th time step the number of duplicates is 0 however for subsequent time steps the number of duplicates would be non zero provided that nprey is non zero the constant 500 000 in the denominator in the 2nd product was included to scale the number of predators the result is a linear increase in the proportion of the prey used to determine the number of duplicate predators amounting to 1 over 5000 time steps 0 2 per 1000 time steps as an example if at t 20 000 there are 100 000 prey then 1000 predator duplicates would be added at that time step ecosim has several parameters that stabilize the simulation parameters specific to increasing predation were tested with a brief grid search where parameters were chosen which provide stability and fairness across the different run parameters of control variants were tuned in other works scott et al 2018 macpherson et al 2021a 2022 2 5 testing the pluralistic hypothesis the hypothesis being tested in this study is that the three factors of fluctuating resources increased predation and the presence of an energy robbing deleterious allele act integratively in explaining the prevalence of sexual reproduction in prey species in particular we are investigating a whether the effect size of the higher escape ratio of sexual vs asexual prey lower extinction rate for sexual vs asexual species investigated in macpherson et al 2021b is affected by the other factors b whether the effect size of the deleterious allele factor gradual decrease in magnitude of da in sexual species investigated in macpherson et al 2021a is affected by the other factors and finally c whether the effect size of fluctuating resources increase in sexual reproduction in facultative species investigated in macpherson et al 2022 is affected by the other factors as mentioned above meirmans and neiman 2006 argued that the preferred way of testing a pluralistic hypothesis is to a manipulate each factor individually and b manipulate the interaction of the factors although we have not directly manipulated the interaction between fluctuating resources increased predation and presence of an energy robbing deleterious allele we have indirectly manipulated their interaction by staggering the manipulation of the individual factors this de facto involves manipulating their potential interaction da was introduced at the initial time step fluctuating resources was introduced at the initial time step although the cosine function promoted stability for the first 20 000 time steps and finally increased predation was not introduced until the 15 000th time step thus the effect size of da could be enhanced diminished or remain unchanged at the 15 000th time step by the advent of the other two factors moreover the effect size of increased predation could be enhanced diminished or remain unchanged at the 15 000th time step by the pre existing da or by fluctuating resources that is just starting to take effect finally the effect size of fluctuating resources could be enhanced diminished or remain unchanged by the pre existing da factor along with the introduction of increased predation 2 6 statistical analysis of the data the data for experimental runs for individual factors in isolation from the other factors were taken from three previous studies macpherson et al 2021a macpherson et al 2021b and macpherson et al 2022 graphs of data averaged across 10 experimental runs for an individual factor and graphs of data averaged across 10 experimental runs for a pluralism of factors were plotted in ms excel 2019 because we are dealing with time series where in a given series one event depends on prior events we could not use either a generalized linear model approach nor a kolmogorov smirvov approach to comparing the curves moreover comparing variances of the curves could not be done for the same reason instead we compared distances between curves by estimating dynamic time warping dtw distances using the dtw package version 1 22 3 giogino 2009 tormene et al 2009 and the tsdist package version 3 7 mori et al 2016 for r version 4 2 0 r core team 2022 dtw is a reliable measure of distances between time series curves that circumvents the problems of time shifts and time distortions by minimizing their effects shou et al 2005 the tsdist package also contains a function that measures euclidean distances between time series curves although generally speaking dtw is regarded as a more serious measure of time series distance vs euclidean distance given that it minimizes time distortions ratanamahatna and keogh 2004 in our study we used dtw distance measures to determine where time series curves diverge moreover using the dtw distance function we were able to compare one segment of curves with another segment of the curves to determine which segment had the greatest curve distance 3 results and discussion we found that having the three factors da increased predation fluctuating resources acting together and staggered in the same experiment had the effect of integrative enhancement in terms of reducing the intensity of da for sexual runs in comparison with our experiments testing da as a single factor in macpherson et al 2021a on the other hand combining the factors had an antagonistic effect on the levels of sexual and asexual reproduction in facultative species in comparison with our experiments testing fluctuating resources as a single factor in macpherson et al 2022 finally in the pluralistic experiments of the current study the extinction rates for sexual asexual and facultative species remained unchanged in comparison with our experiments testing for the individual factor of increased predation in macpherson et al 2021b thus combining factors varied in their impact on the effect sizes from our previous experiments testing single factors exemplifying integrative enhancement pluralism antagonistic pluralism and isolationist non reductive pluralism 3 1 the impact of combining factors on the intensity of da in our previous study where we introduced an energy robbing deleterious allele da of intermediate intensity at the first time step for sexual asexual and facultative runs we found that there was a significant decline in the intensity of da for sexual runs although there was no decline in the intensity of da for asexual and facultative runs macpherson et al 2021a in the current study with a plurality of factors it turned out that in sexual runs the rate of decline of da intensity was objectively faster than the rate of decline of da intensity for the single factor study after roughly the 12 000th time step the dynamic time warping dtw distance between the time series curves following the 12 000th time step was greater than the dynamic time warping distance between the time series curves prior to the 12 000th time step 17 750 97 vs 231 04 there was no difference in the intensity of da for asexual and facultative runs in the pluralistic experiment vs the individual experiment in macpherson et al 2021a as outlined in fig 2 given the timing of the faster pace of the decline of da intensity for pluralistic vs single factor experiments for sexual prey included the introduction of higher levels of predation and the effect of fluctuating resources it is likely that these factors contributed to the increase in pressure for the selection of individuals with lower da intensity levels vs the single factor experiment that is sexual prey in pluralistic runs with lower da intensity levels due to recombination would be selected over individuals with higher intensity levels of da thus explaining the faster rate of decline of da intensity in pluralistic runs delving more deeply into the data for the da singular vs the pluralistic runs it is clear that the amount of grass is relatively stable for the da singular runs although it is fluctuating wildly after the 10 000th time step in the pluralistic run as in evidenced in fig 3 given that in the pluralistic runs we introduced the cosine style function that causes fluctuations of prey resources grass the instability in the level of grass in the pluralistic runs may put selective pressure on the sexual species to purge da at a faster rate in order to have more energy for foraging in the midst of unstable resources even in light of the fact that the level of grass for pluralistic runs was greater than the level of grass for singular runs moreover we found that in pluralistic runs there was an objectively higher ratio of dead killed prey vs da singular runs following the 15 000th time step the dtw distance between the time series curves prior to the 15 000th time step was lower than the dtw distance between the curves following the 15 000th time step 61 10 vs 869 08 a key difference between the da singular runs and the pluralistic runs is that in the pluralistic runs additional predators were introduced at the 15 000th time step which would explain the higher ratio of dead killed in the pluralistic runs for sexual prey depicted in fig 4 a this in turn would place additional selection pressure on sexual prey species to purge da resulting in a faster rate of decline in the intensity of da additionally there was a clear and significant difference in population levels between da singular runs and pluralistic runs population levels were objectively lower in pluralistic runs vs da singular runs in light of dtw distance measures following the 15 000th time step as is evidenced in fig 4b likely due to increased predation at that time step combined with fluctuating resources given the decrease in population levels of prey species in pluralistic runs likely due to fluctuating resources combined with increased predation this would exert selection pressure on prey species to purge their genome of da thus explaining the faster rate of da intensity decline in pluralistic runs vs da singular runs 3 2 the impact of combining factors on the reaction of facultative species to fluctuating resources in our simulation study where we examined the single factor of fluctuating resources introduced in the first time step albeit not manifest until the 15 000th time step due to a stabilizing feature of the cosine function we found that in facultative species there was a discernable increase in sexual reproduction and a discernable decrease in asexual reproduction macpherson et al 2022 these changes occurred around the 15 000th time step when the effects of fluctuating resources became manifest macpherson scott gras 2021c in the pluralistic study there was a measurable decrease in sexual reproduction and a measurable increase in asexual reproduction relative to their rates in the single factor study as evidenced by differential dtw distances in other words there appears to have been a reversal in the pluralistic study of what was observed in our single factor study of macpherson et al 2022 as can be seen in figs 5 a and b a plausible explanation of the reversal in rates of sexual and asexual reproduction in facultative prey in the pluralistic experiment is that the selective pressures of increased predation combined with an energy robbing deleterious allele threatened the population levels of facultative species as a result there would be pressure on facultative species to increase asexual reproduction in order to increase population levels that are threatened by the two additional factors since asexual reproduction involves all individuals being able to reproduce thereby sidestepping the problem of useless males a faster and more direct way to increase population considering countervailing factors would be to increase the rate of asexual reproduction and to decrease the rate of sexual reproduction in fact there is a measurably and consistently lower population level of facultative species in pluralistic runs vs the population levels of facultative species in single factor runs however following the 15 000th time step the curves begin to coalesce which is around the time that the intensity of the deleterious allele begins to decrease regardless population levels of prey in the pluralistic runs following the 15 000th time step remains lower than populations in the singular runs according to the dynamic time warping distances we measured as can be see in fig 6 the consistently lower population levels of facultative species in pluralistic runs in comparison with population levels of facultative species could the result of the deleterious allele da which starts at the initial time step combined with fluctuating resources which strictly speaking starts at the initial time step even though not becoming fully manifest until the 15 000th time step the lower population levels in pluralistic runs explains the reversion to asexual reproduction in facultative species as a kind of quick fix to increase population levels moreover we found that there was an increase in the ratio of dead killed for pluralistic runs following the 15 000th time step relative to single factor runs as can be seen in fig 7 this increase in the ratio of dead killed in pluralistic runs can be explained by the introduction of predators at the 15 000th time step which was absent in singular runs our conclusion supported by the data is that the reversal in the increase in sexual reproduction and the decrease in asexual reproduction is linked to selection pressures resulting from a marked decrease in population in pluralistic runs linked to da and the introduction of higher levels of predation 3 3 the impact of combining factors on the reaction of sexual and asexual species to increased predation the primary effect of the introduction of higher levels of predation in our single factor study was a lower extinction rate of sexual species vs the extinction rate of asexual species macpherson et al 2021b this result suggests that sexual species have a distinct advantage over asexual species in the face of increased predation viz a lower likelihood of species extinction however in our pluralistic study where increased predation was one factor amongst several fluctuating resources and deleterious allele the extinction rates of sexual and asexual species were virtually identical to the extinction rates of these species in the single factor study involving increased predation a plausible explanation for the lack of difference between the single factor and pluralistic studies vis a vis the red tooth factor is that the effects of da and fluctuating resources were not sufficient to temper a response regarding extinction rate this makes sense if we keep in mind that the da level is intermediate macpherson et al 2021a and that in the single factor studies fluctuating resources had no clear effect on either sexual or asexual species macpherson et al 2022 delving more deeply into the data we found that before the 10 000th time step the age of death for sexual species in pluralistic runs was objectively higher than the age of death for sexual species in rt singular runs as is evidenced in fig 8 a this may be an early evolutionary development in response to the deleterious allele whose effect begins at the initial time step though absent in the singular runs as a compensation for population loss due to the energy robbing effects of the allele between the 10000th and 15000th time step the age of death was objectively lower for pluralistic runs vs singular runs however after the 15 000th time step the age of death for pluralistic vs singular runs was higher again than the age of death for singular runs despite the mid time series dip in the age of death for pluralistic runs overall it is unlikely that there was sufficient selective pressure on sexual species in pluralistic runs to further decrease extinction rate at least from the perspective of age of death moreover we found that although population levels of sexual species in pluralistic runs were generally lower than population levels in rt singular runs for sexual species the population levels started to coalesce after the 17000th time step as evidenced by the fact that the dynamic time warping distance for steps 0 to 15 000 was 750 897 918 whereas the dynamic time warping distance for steps 15 000 28 000 was less at 142 464 088 fig 8b this coalescence would possibly be due to the higher intensity of the deleterious allele for singular runs vs pluralistic funs following the 15 000th time step reduce selection pressure on sexual species in pluralistic runs to evolve decreasing extinction rates the evidence presented above suggests that although the additional factors of da and fluctuating resources may have generated additional selection pressure for sexual species to evolve lower extinction rates these factors were not sufficient to achieve this effect 4 concluding remarks in this article we have investigated the potentially integrative effects of three factors that have the potential to affect reproductive mode in animal species da red tooth tangled bank to the best of our knowledge this is only one of three studies that have investigated the potential interaction of 3 factors on reproductive mode according to neiman et al 2017 only 2 studies besides ours have examined the impact of 3 factors on reproductive mode both of which were computer simulation studies that examined the potential interaction between deleterious alleles red queen and sexual selection howard and lively 2002 2003 our pluralistic study is the only simulation study to examine the combined effect of red tooth deleterious alleles and tangled bank on the mode of reproduction neiman et al 2017 whereas the studies conducted by howard and lively 2002 and howard and lively 2003 arguably proved that the three factors of red queen deleterious alleles and sexual selection acted synergistically to enhance their respective effects on modes of reproduction our study had mixed results although we found that the deleterious allele was reduced at a faster rate in the pluralistic study owing to the red tooth effect increased predation and the fluctuating resources effect the impact of the deleterious allele and red tooth actually had an antagonistic effect on the ratio of facultative species that reproduced sexually and asexually moreover in the pluralistic red tooth runs there was no obvious effect of the deleterious allele or1 8 fluctuating resources on the extinction rates for either sexual

24302,attempts to resolve the paradox of sexual reproduction in animal species have typically involved single factor explanations including but not limited to sexual species being better able to cope with fluctuating resources being better able to evade pathogens and predators and sex facilitating the elimination of deleterious alleles only a handful of studies have investigated two potentially interacting factors which most commonly involve the ability to evade pathogens and predators and mutation load only two simulation studies by the same authors have examined the potential interaction of 3 factors our study is the first three factor study to examine the potential interaction between purifying selection the ability to avoid predators and the ability to cope with fluctuating resources therefore we addressed a number of open eco evolutionary questions in our study first what is the effect of these three factors on the prevalence of sexual reproduction in animals second do these factors act integratively antagonistically or independently in determining the prevalence of sexual reproduction the controls were our three prior studies where we investigated each of these factors individually our aim was to determine if the effect sizes in our individual studies were integratively enhanced by the interaction with the remaining two factors what we found is that purifying selection purging deleterious alleles in sexual species was integratively enhanced by the two additional factors of increased predation and fluctuating resources on the other hand the effect of purifying selection and increased predation had an antagonistic effect on the levels of sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction in facultative species where there were fluctuating resources finally the presence of an intermediate intensity deleterious allele and fluctuating resources had no discernable effect on the extinction levels of sexual and asexual species where there is increased predation these results are not surprising as there is no a priori reason to assume that multiple factors will have a greater impact on mode of reproduction than any of these factors acting independently our results suggest that multiple factors can act intergratively antagonistically and non reductively all at the same time which is a significant contribution to the open question in the biological literature regarding the effect of multiple factors on the prevalence of sexual reproduction keywords tangled bank red tooth purifying selection pluralistic explanations antagonistic pluralism integrative pluralism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 open questions regarding the prevalence of sexual reproduction although biologists have been doing research for decades to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction the general consensus in the literature is that the prevalence of sexual reproduction remains an unresolved and possibly intractable problem for evolutionary biology the problem of the prevalence of sexual reproduction despite its costs remains an open question in eco evolutionary theory see table 1 this is owing to the fact that the costs of sexual reproduction including useless males vulnerability to mating during reproduction energy expenditure on the act of reproduction and so forth appear to outweigh any potential benefits of sexual reproduction eventuated by recombination stelzer 2015 lehntonen et al 2011 otto and lenormand 2002 almost all the attempts to explain the prevalence of sex rely on single factor explanations one such single factor explanation is that sexual reproduction via recombination and increased genetic variability gives rise to populations that are more resistant to predators and pathogens vs asexually reproducing species see table 2 additional single factor explanations for the prevalence of sex include but are not limited to the ability of recombination to purge a species genome of deleterious alleles cutter 2005 keightley and otto 2006 gray and goddard 2012 macpherson scott and gras 2021 and the ability of recombination to give rise to individuals that are better able to survive fluctuating resources than their asexual relatives tagg et al 2005 koch et al 2009 tobler and schlupp 2010 barbuti et al 2012 macpherson et al 2022 a natural inference based on the failure of single factor attempts to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction is that a more powerful explanation is needed one such potential explanation may reside in considering multiple factors simultaneously it is possible that several of these factors function interactively to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction however as noted single factor explanations dominate the literature on this topic a recent article by neiman et al 2017 delineates only 17 attempts to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction in terms of a plurality of factors what follows is a discussion of the pluralistic alternative to explaining the prevalence of sexual reproduction 1 2 discussion the pluralistic alternative 1 2 1 possible reasons for the scarcity of pluralistic empirical and simulation studies regarding sex in the case of both simulation and empirical studies the relative scarcity of pluralistic explanations in solving the puzzle of the prevalence of sexual reproduction probably has its origins in pragmatic difficulties associated with designing empirical studies that take multiple possibly interacting factors into account these studies may involve complicated experimental designs which prospective researchers will find prohibitive meirmans and neiman 2006 if four factors are considered each with two levels e g present absent and such that these variables can be manipulated independently and these factors are crossed then this results in a 24 factorial design collins et al 2009 of course variables such as predation level will have more than just two levels such as present or absent however collins et al 2009 suggest that experimenters can choose a reduced design even in cases where not all variables have 2 levels this reduced design mitigates design complexity resulting in a balance between simplicity and explanatory power in terms of computer simulation studies if researchers are investigating multiple independent variables this would seem to complicate experimental design since it could slow down overall computation time making such experiments difficult to carry out however as will be argued below this is not necessarily the case 1 2 2 intra level vs inter level pluralism pluralism within a domain as opposed to pluralism across domains is a distinction made in fehr 2001 and mitchell 2002 fehr 2001 argues that there is a pluralistic explanation for the origins of sex involving factors that are non reducible from different domains dna repair which is at the molecular level and the ability to elude predators which is a macro level explanation which constitutes an inter level pluralism on the other hand combining red queen sexually reproducing individuals are better able to elude predators pathogens vs clonals and tangled bank sexually reproducing individuals are better able to deal with fluctuating resources both macro level explanations to explain the maintenance of sex is an intra level pluralistic explanation song et al 2012 1 2 3 different varieties of inter level and intra level pluralism multiple factors from the same domain or across domains can interact integratively or antagonistically in explaining the prevalence of sexual reproduction or there may be no interaction at all a domain refers to the level of explanation used whether at the macro level or at the molecular level mitchell 2002 argues for an integrative pluralism between and across domains with respect to complex biological phenomena according to mitchell 2002 multiple explanations do not compete with one another instead their combination augments explanatory power mitchell 2002 schubach and sprenger 2011 a more fine grained distinction between two kinds of integrative pluralism is proposed by neiman et al 2017 synergistic pluralism is the view that the impact of multiple factors across domains or from the same domain on the prevalence of sexual reproduction is greater than the impact of the factors considered individually on the other hand enhancement pluralism is the view that one factor augments the impact of another factor on the prevalence of sexual reproduction neiman et al 2017 a third type of interactive pluralism not considered by neiman et al 2017 is what could be called antagonistic pluralism where the occurrence of multiple factors across domains or within a domain reduces their respective impacts on the prevalence of sexual reproduction finally isolationist pluralism or non reductive pluralism is the view that inter level or intra level explanations of sexual reproduction do not interact in such a case the effects of these factors on the prevalence of sexual reproduction is the same whether considered in isolation or in conjunction with other factors mitchell 2002 1 2 4 attempts to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction from a pluralistic perspective neiman et al 2017 cite 19 studies conducted between 1994 and 2012 with significant findings in 18 of the 19 studies where two or more factors interact either synergistically or in an enhancement capacity in explaining the prevalence of sexual reproduction red queen for pathogens and elimination of deleterious alleles are the two most common factors tested neiman et al 2017 table 3 summarizes these studies almost all the studies 17 of them involved red queen as one of the causal explanations for the prevalence of sexual reproduction neiman et al 2017 combined these studies lend credence to the thesis of integrative enhancement synergistic pluralism in explaining the prevalence of sexual reproduction as an example of a study confirming a synergistic interaction between multiple mechanisms in explaining sex neiman et al 2017 cite the simulation study of lively and howard 1994 who provide evidence that red queen dynamics decrease asexual lineages resulting in the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations in the remaining lineages as a result these remaining lineages quickly go extinct neiman et al 2017 the study by lively and howard 1994 demonstrates a synergistic interaction between the red queen effect and the muller s ratchet effect which involves preventing the accumulation of deleterious alleles as a result of recombination further neiman et al 2017 cite a study by lively 2009 as an example of research suggesting an enhancement interaction between multiple factors in explaining the prevalence of sex 1 2 5 overcoming practical difficulties with testing pluralistic explanations to deal with the practical difficulties in framing and testing pluralistic hypotheses discussed above meirmans and neiman 2006 proposed a framework for testing interactive pluralistic hypotheses explaining sex for empirical studies citing a computer simulation study after considering a number of potential candidates meirmans and neiman 2006 propose the so called manipulative model for testing a pluralistic approach involving red queen and muller s ratchet which involves manipulating each factor individually along with their interaction apparently the virtue of the manipulative approach is that the interaction of the red queen effect and muller s ratchet is easier to test than testing either factor separately meirmans and neiman 2006 this is owing to the fact that the threshold for a discernible result for the interacting factors is lower than the threshold for either stand alone factor meirmans and neiman 2006 more specifically manipulating the interaction of factors requires lower virulence red queen and lower mutation rate muller s ratchet than when the factors are stand alone meirmans and neiman 2006 in fact the same levels of the factors taken individually may not be sufficient to sustain sex meirmans and neiman 2006 according to meirmans and neiman 2006 the computer simulation study of lively and howard 1994 is an example of testing mutation load and parasitism synergistically along with the empirical studies by jokela et al 2003 and cooper et al 2005 1 3 testing the pluralistic hypothesis and significance of the study meirmans and neiman 2006 propose their manipulative model for pluralistic testing primarily for empirical studies although they cite computer simulation studies e g lively and howard 1994 as intuition pumps for their method thus their method should also be applicable to computer simulation studies in our study we employ individual based modeling ibm computer simulations to investigate three stand alone factors discussed above for the prevalence of sex red queen purging deleterious alleles tangled bank which de facto uses the manipulative method of meirmans and neiman 2006 to test their interaction given that their effects are staggered we chose these factors because these are some of the more prominent factors used to explain the prevalence of sex as discussed in hartfield and keightley 2012 moreover our three prior studies where we investigated each of these factors separately involve the control runs for our pluralistic study the three factor pluralistic hypothesis that we are testing using the manipulation method of meirmans and neiman 2006 is as follows hypothesis the avoidance of predators and the purging of deleterious mutations in a fluctuating resource environment act integratively to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction the testing of this hypothesis will involve manipulating each factor individually although staggered in the same runs staggering the timing of their introduction according to the experiments performed on each factor individually involves a de facto manipulation of their potential interaction the mid level of the deleterious allele da will be initiated at the first time step of the runs the sin function causing fluctuating resources will be activated at the beginning of the runs although the first 20 000 runs are relatively stable and finally the level of predation will be increased at the 15 000th time step corroboration of the above hypothesis will involve determining whether the effect sizes of each of these three factors in the pluralistic experiment are larger or smaller than or the same as the effect sizes of these factors in their individual experiments in the case of the deleterious allele da the metric for the effect size is its intensity for fluctuating resources the metric for the effect size is the rate of increase in sexual reproduction and the rate of decrease in asexual reproduction for facultative species and finally for the red tooth effect the effect size metric is the differential extinction rate of sexual vs asexual prey species if it turns out that the effect size for a single factor fi is larger in the pluralistic study than in the individual study performed in an earlier experiment then the effect of fi was possibly enhanced by one or more of the remaining factors in such a case the integrative hypothesis outlined above is confirmed with respect to this factor if the effect size for the single factor fi remains constant between the individual and pluralistic experiments then there is no effect on fi by the other factors therefore with respect to this factor the hypothesis is not confirmed finally if the effect size for the single factor fi is smaller in the pluralistic experiment as opposed to the individual experiment the other factors may have acted antagonistically with respect to factor fi it is possible that only one factor is enhanced by one or more of the other factors with the remaining factors being unchanged or antagonized by the other factors that two factors are each enhanced by one or more of the remaining factors or that all three are enhanced by one of more of the remaining factors 2 methods in this study we used an individual based ecological modeling platform ecosim to carry out our experiment section 2 1 involves a description of standard ecosim and modified ecosim modeling asexual and facultative reproduction which is outlined in greater detail in macpherson et al 2021a and in the odd description of ecosim included in the supplementary materials appended to this paper 2 1 standard ecosim vs asexual and facultative ecosim standard ecosim is outlined in detail in the odd description modeled after grimm et al 2010 2020 and in scott et al 2018 scott and gras 2020 and in macpherson et al 2021a ecosim summarized in fig 1 has discretized time steps and it is spatially explicit individuals start out with limited energy whereas energy is increased through eating eat and hunting hunt other activities such as sexually reproducing reproduce decrease energy levels the two kinds of individuals in ecosim are either prey or predators prey consume grass grass whereas predators consume prey meat moreover the amount of grass at the primary trophic level is influenced by the waste products of prey and predators serving as fertilizer the cell is the fundamental unit of space containing prey and predators finite amounts of grass and finite amounts of fertilizer time is measured in terms of discrete time steps the world which is a 1000 1000 torus world lasting typically tens of thousands of time steps consists of cells the odd summary of ecosim is represented diagrammatically in fig 1 below individuals in ecosim have a two part genome viz the behavioural genome and the physical genome although inherited genomes are fixed for individuals mutations are able to occur across generations associated with an individual s behavioural genome is a fuzzy cognitive map fcm kosko 1986 a graph model such that the stimulation of concepts is represented by nodes moreover an arc represents how the stimulation of a given concept influences the stimulation of the target concept fcm concepts are of three types perception such as food being close foodclose internal such as being hungry hunger or action such as escape predators escape each node has a floating point real number value between 0 and 1 which represents the activation level of a concept while many concepts are shared between prey and predators e g reproduce some concepts are unique to either prey or predators as an example hunting prey hunt is a predator concept but not a prey concept fcm arc values are an array of byte values mapped to floating point values whose range is 12 7 to 12 8 inclusive whereas byte representations are saved in files floating point values are used for computation raw inputs such as friends being close friendclose from an individual s immediate environment are fuzzified discretization with possible overlaps into perceptual concept activation levels on the other hand the activation levels of internal and action concepts are computed as a weighted sum of all incident arc values which are then multiplied by their respective origin activation levels the action concept with the highest activation level determines which action an individual will perform at a given time step it follows that the individual s viability and fecundity is directly influenced by their behavioural genome just like the behavioural genome the physical genome directly influences individual viability and fecundity the physical genome is an array of byte values each byte value is mapped onto floating point values where the mapping depends on the physical trait being represented as an example maximum amount of energy maxenergy is a stand in for the size of the individual limiting the amount of energy the individual can hold maxenergy ranges from 100 to 6475 by selecting an action each time step individuals interact with other individuals and their environment the decision to select a given action is influenced by the individual s state and physical characteristics given that inherited genomes directly influence an individual s fitness the evolution of gene pools in ecosim occurs through natural selection moreover there are no predefined fitness functions in ecosim gras et al 2015 in standard ecosim reproduction is effected via sexual reproduction individuals are either male or female with gender being determined at birth and fixed for the lifespan of the individual the only action requiring cooperation between two opposite sex individuals is reproduction the strongest individuals where strength is a proxy for the combination of energy level energy and age age have first choice for mates and resources in order to mimic female choosiness only females initiate sexual reproduction this characteristic of ecosim is validated by several empirical studies such as gabor and halladay 1997 and ben ari 2000 before a female can attempt reproduction several checks must occur in sequence age is checked to ensure that the female has reached the minimum reproductive age reproductiveage then energy is checked to ensure that the female has enough energy to pass on to her offspring stateofbirth is the amount of energy required to reproduce computed as a percentage of the individual s maximum energy if reproduction is successful this energy is passed on to the newborn by each parent in attempting reproduction the female randomly selects a mate in the same cell if no males are in the same cell as the female or the female is unfit to reproduce determined by their age or level of energy then the act of reproduction fails with no energy cost incurred although the individual does not perform any action at this time step for a sexual reproduction attempt to succeed several checks must be passed the male must be older than their minimum reproductive age and like the female they need to have sufficient energy to reproduce further the male must not have acted reproductively given that reproduction is initiated by females also the genetic distance between the two individuals must range between a minimum and maximum genetic distance provided that all checks are passed the reproductive event succeeds resulting in the generation of a new offspring while the newly generated offspring receives energy as the sum of each parent s stateofbirth described above each parent loses their transmitted energy including a loss equal to 5 of the transmitted energy which reflects energy costs associated with reproductive effort a newly generated individual will have a genome that is the recombination of its parents genome see adaptation in the odd both types of genomes physical and behavioural each has a specialized crossover operator used to recombine the parents genomes subsequent to this a specialized mutation operator is applied to each type of genome which puts the finishing touch on the genome the genes of behavioural and physical genomes are subject to a basic mutation rate of 0 1 whereas insertion and deletion mutation rates defined only for the behavioural genome are 0 05 an individual s sex is determined randomly with an equal chance of being male or female since each gene directly influences only one behavioural trait the behavioural genome accommodates epistasis but not pleiotropy whereas in the physical genome although there is neither epistasis nor pleiotropy some sex linkage can occur during recombination reproductive mechanisms for prey that mirror asexual and facultative reproduction are introduced into the asexual reproduction ar and facultative reproduction fr variants of ecosim these new mechanisms define a new type of reproductive action asexual reproduction reproduceasexual for prey with correlative alterations to the fcm along with a definition of the energy dynamics regarding asexual reproduction these modifications aside the ar and fr variants of ecosim are the same as standard ecosim to be eligible to perform asexual reproduction the prey individual must be female and older than their minimum reproductive age if these criteria are met the only remaining requirement is that the individual has sufficient energy analogous to the energy requirement of reproduce reproduceasexual is based on the individual s stateofbirth as defined above given that there is only one parent this energy requirement is multiplied by a factor of 1 9 in addition a 30 energy loss penalty is imposed these penalties make biological sense as can be seen in carter et al 2012 if the female individual has sufficient energy reproduceasexual succeeds and a new offspring is generated although the behavioural and physical genomes related to reproduceasexual are not subject to syngametic recombination and crossover both genomes are subject to the same mutation mechanisms as outlined for sexual reproduction moreover the sex of the offspring is determined randomly just as for sexual reproduction there is a correspondence between the fr variant of ecosim and what has been observed in nature species that reproduce facultatively have been found in nature as discussed in shibata et al 2017 and groot et al 2003 facultative prey individuals have both reproduce and reproduceasexual nodes in the fcm in the fr variant of ecosim there is only a slight difference in the initialization of the prey fcm edges between sr ar and fr edges to reproduceasexual in ar have the same weight as the edges to reproduce in sr whereas in the fr variant edges to reproduce are identical to those in the sr variant although this is not the case for ar we multiplied the initial value of positive edges to reproduceasexual by 0 75 the explanation of this calibration is to reduce the probability that fr individuals will reproduce asexually given that for the fr variant we found that with a constant of 1 0 i e all edges to reproduce and reproduceasexual are identically initialized prey individuals became biased towards reproduceasexual over reproduce after the first 100 time steps a key goal in our experiments involving facultative reproduction was to have both asexual and sexual reproduction used by the prey in the facultative runs if the costs associated with ar and sr were very different then one mode may be favored over the other consequently we wanted to ensure a balance between the two modes in facultative runs so that we could measure the independent variables in a given study e g deleterious alleles resource levels predation levels while controlling for confounding factors parameters of control variants were tuned in other works scott et al 2018 what follows is an outline of the methods used to conduct our pluralistic study both in terms of the manipulation of each of the three independent variables and an account of how these variables potentially interact due to a staggering of their introduction 2 2 deleterious allele what follows is a brief description of what we did to introduce an energy robbing deleterious allele da into the physical genome of sr ar and fr prey for the purpose of measuring the difference in the purging rates of deleterious alleles between sr ar and fr prey this is exactly the method that we employed in macpherson et al 2021a the introduction of da occurs at the first time step we constructed sr deleterious srd ar deleterious ard and fr deleterious frd experimental runs da has the following features da has a byte representation i e discrete values from 0 to 255 inclusive that we initialized mid range to 128 during crossover the new offspring receives the value of the gene from a randomly selected parent as noted da imposes an energy cost per time step with respect to the magnitude of its value this cost is computed by multiplying the value of the gene by 3 and then applying a power of 0 75 to it at initialization because the gene has a value of 128 in each individual the starting cost for this allele is 86 75 energy per time step when this allele is gradually purged by reducing its average magnitude in the gene pool its mean nnergy cost also decreases when the magnitude of the gene reaches 0 corresponding energy cost also reaches 0 therefore as the da is purged individuals will have more energy to perform actions that increase viability and fecundity such as reproducing and finding food findfood 2 3 artificially varying primary resource availability the manipulation of preys primary food resource grass in this part of the study is modelled after the method employed in macpherson et al 2021b for sr fr and ar control runs the maximum amount of the primary resource per cell is normally fixed at 4000 regardless of the time step on the other hand for sr fr and ar experimental runs srvr frvr arvr respectively this maximum level of grass was allowed to vary as a function of time step for sr ar and fr experimental runs the maximum amount of grass maxgrass was allowed to vary cyclically between 3200 and 4800 following the application of a cosine wave with a period of 400 time steps eq 1 at each time step t the maxgrass value was updated according to eq 1 following the application of our grass diffusion model the quantity of grass per cell was limited to the new maxgrass value for that time step this method generated a significant amount of temporal variation in grass while at the same time allowing the simulation to stabilize for over 20 000 time steps without prey or predator extinction 1 grassmax cos t Ï 200 1 800 3200 in order to test the possible role of reproductive mode on adaptability to fluctuating resources we compared srvr sexually reproducing prey with cyclical variation arvr asexually reproducing prey with cyclical variation and frvr facultatively reproducing prey with cyclical variation in experimental runs with the sr ar and fr control runs with respect to various parameters such as population for example in light of the tangled bank hypothesis one would expect that sexually reproducing prey will have larger populations as opposed to asexually reproducing prey in an environment with fluctuating resources as a result of greater genetic variability and hence greater adaptability of sexually reproducing prey also regarding frvr prey one would naturally expect a lower rate of asexual reproduction and a higher rate of sexual reproduction in environments with fluctuating resources this is borne out in a study by zhang et al 2016 where it was observed that individuals of the facultative species daphnia samiloids undergo parthenogenic reproduction in stable environments and switch to sexual reproduction in unstable environments what follows is table 4 which outlines the rationale for the various run configurations we ran fifteen simulations each of sr ar fr srvr arvr and frvr the proportion of populations evading proportion of populations killed by predators and number of individuals in the simulations were compared 2 4 artificially increasing predator pressure in experimental runs the sr ar and fr variants srp arp and frp ran identically to the corresponding sr ar and fr control runs until the 15 000th time step immediately following the 15 000th time step predation pressure for srp arp and frp was increased the method used to artificially increase predator pressure in the srp arp and frp runs is as follows we randomly sampled living predators at a given time step duplicated them and then added the duplicates into the simulation all dynamic attributes e g energy fcm states and static attributes e g sex fcm edge values were copied from selected predator individuals such that predators could be selected multiple times for duplication for a given run the number of predator duplicates added to the simulation at a given time step was in direct proportion to the number of prey individuals we slowly increased the number of duplicates over time so as not to shock the system and to elicit a potential evolutionary response to the increasing predator pressure the calculation of the number of predator duplicates nd for a given time step t with the number of prey nprey relative to that time step eq 2 the equation below is from macpherson et al 2021b 2 n d n p r e y t 15 00 0 5 000 00 at the 15 000th time step the number of duplicates is 0 however for subsequent time steps the number of duplicates would be non zero provided that nprey is non zero the constant 500 000 in the denominator in the 2nd product was included to scale the number of predators the result is a linear increase in the proportion of the prey used to determine the number of duplicate predators amounting to 1 over 5000 time steps 0 2 per 1000 time steps as an example if at t 20 000 there are 100 000 prey then 1000 predator duplicates would be added at that time step ecosim has several parameters that stabilize the simulation parameters specific to increasing predation were tested with a brief grid search where parameters were chosen which provide stability and fairness across the different run parameters of control variants were tuned in other works scott et al 2018 macpherson et al 2021a 2022 2 5 testing the pluralistic hypothesis the hypothesis being tested in this study is that the three factors of fluctuating resources increased predation and the presence of an energy robbing deleterious allele act integratively in explaining the prevalence of sexual reproduction in prey species in particular we are investigating a whether the effect size of the higher escape ratio of sexual vs asexual prey lower extinction rate for sexual vs asexual species investigated in macpherson et al 2021b is affected by the other factors b whether the effect size of the deleterious allele factor gradual decrease in magnitude of da in sexual species investigated in macpherson et al 2021a is affected by the other factors and finally c whether the effect size of fluctuating resources increase in sexual reproduction in facultative species investigated in macpherson et al 2022 is affected by the other factors as mentioned above meirmans and neiman 2006 argued that the preferred way of testing a pluralistic hypothesis is to a manipulate each factor individually and b manipulate the interaction of the factors although we have not directly manipulated the interaction between fluctuating resources increased predation and presence of an energy robbing deleterious allele we have indirectly manipulated their interaction by staggering the manipulation of the individual factors this de facto involves manipulating their potential interaction da was introduced at the initial time step fluctuating resources was introduced at the initial time step although the cosine function promoted stability for the first 20 000 time steps and finally increased predation was not introduced until the 15 000th time step thus the effect size of da could be enhanced diminished or remain unchanged at the 15 000th time step by the advent of the other two factors moreover the effect size of increased predation could be enhanced diminished or remain unchanged at the 15 000th time step by the pre existing da or by fluctuating resources that is just starting to take effect finally the effect size of fluctuating resources could be enhanced diminished or remain unchanged by the pre existing da factor along with the introduction of increased predation 2 6 statistical analysis of the data the data for experimental runs for individual factors in isolation from the other factors were taken from three previous studies macpherson et al 2021a macpherson et al 2021b and macpherson et al 2022 graphs of data averaged across 10 experimental runs for an individual factor and graphs of data averaged across 10 experimental runs for a pluralism of factors were plotted in ms excel 2019 because we are dealing with time series where in a given series one event depends on prior events we could not use either a generalized linear model approach nor a kolmogorov smirvov approach to comparing the curves moreover comparing variances of the curves could not be done for the same reason instead we compared distances between curves by estimating dynamic time warping dtw distances using the dtw package version 1 22 3 giogino 2009 tormene et al 2009 and the tsdist package version 3 7 mori et al 2016 for r version 4 2 0 r core team 2022 dtw is a reliable measure of distances between time series curves that circumvents the problems of time shifts and time distortions by minimizing their effects shou et al 2005 the tsdist package also contains a function that measures euclidean distances between time series curves although generally speaking dtw is regarded as a more serious measure of time series distance vs euclidean distance given that it minimizes time distortions ratanamahatna and keogh 2004 in our study we used dtw distance measures to determine where time series curves diverge moreover using the dtw distance function we were able to compare one segment of curves with another segment of the curves to determine which segment had the greatest curve distance 3 results and discussion we found that having the three factors da increased predation fluctuating resources acting together and staggered in the same experiment had the effect of integrative enhancement in terms of reducing the intensity of da for sexual runs in comparison with our experiments testing da as a single factor in macpherson et al 2021a on the other hand combining the factors had an antagonistic effect on the levels of sexual and asexual reproduction in facultative species in comparison with our experiments testing fluctuating resources as a single factor in macpherson et al 2022 finally in the pluralistic experiments of the current study the extinction rates for sexual asexual and facultative species remained unchanged in comparison with our experiments testing for the individual factor of increased predation in macpherson et al 2021b thus combining factors varied in their impact on the effect sizes from our previous experiments testing single factors exemplifying integrative enhancement pluralism antagonistic pluralism and isolationist non reductive pluralism 3 1 the impact of combining factors on the intensity of da in our previous study where we introduced an energy robbing deleterious allele da of intermediate intensity at the first time step for sexual asexual and facultative runs we found that there was a significant decline in the intensity of da for sexual runs although there was no decline in the intensity of da for asexual and facultative runs macpherson et al 2021a in the current study with a plurality of factors it turned out that in sexual runs the rate of decline of da intensity was objectively faster than the rate of decline of da intensity for the single factor study after roughly the 12 000th time step the dynamic time warping dtw distance between the time series curves following the 12 000th time step was greater than the dynamic time warping distance between the time series curves prior to the 12 000th time step 17 750 97 vs 231 04 there was no difference in the intensity of da for asexual and facultative runs in the pluralistic experiment vs the individual experiment in macpherson et al 2021a as outlined in fig 2 given the timing of the faster pace of the decline of da intensity for pluralistic vs single factor experiments for sexual prey included the introduction of higher levels of predation and the effect of fluctuating resources it is likely that these factors contributed to the increase in pressure for the selection of individuals with lower da intensity levels vs the single factor experiment that is sexual prey in pluralistic runs with lower da intensity levels due to recombination would be selected over individuals with higher intensity levels of da thus explaining the faster rate of decline of da intensity in pluralistic runs delving more deeply into the data for the da singular vs the pluralistic runs it is clear that the amount of grass is relatively stable for the da singular runs although it is fluctuating wildly after the 10 000th time step in the pluralistic run as in evidenced in fig 3 given that in the pluralistic runs we introduced the cosine style function that causes fluctuations of prey resources grass the instability in the level of grass in the pluralistic runs may put selective pressure on the sexual species to purge da at a faster rate in order to have more energy for foraging in the midst of unstable resources even in light of the fact that the level of grass for pluralistic runs was greater than the level of grass for singular runs moreover we found that in pluralistic runs there was an objectively higher ratio of dead killed prey vs da singular runs following the 15 000th time step the dtw distance between the time series curves prior to the 15 000th time step was lower than the dtw distance between the curves following the 15 000th time step 61 10 vs 869 08 a key difference between the da singular runs and the pluralistic runs is that in the pluralistic runs additional predators were introduced at the 15 000th time step which would explain the higher ratio of dead killed in the pluralistic runs for sexual prey depicted in fig 4 a this in turn would place additional selection pressure on sexual prey species to purge da resulting in a faster rate of decline in the intensity of da additionally there was a clear and significant difference in population levels between da singular runs and pluralistic runs population levels were objectively lower in pluralistic runs vs da singular runs in light of dtw distance measures following the 15 000th time step as is evidenced in fig 4b likely due to increased predation at that time step combined with fluctuating resources given the decrease in population levels of prey species in pluralistic runs likely due to fluctuating resources combined with increased predation this would exert selection pressure on prey species to purge their genome of da thus explaining the faster rate of da intensity decline in pluralistic runs vs da singular runs 3 2 the impact of combining factors on the reaction of facultative species to fluctuating resources in our simulation study where we examined the single factor of fluctuating resources introduced in the first time step albeit not manifest until the 15 000th time step due to a stabilizing feature of the cosine function we found that in facultative species there was a discernable increase in sexual reproduction and a discernable decrease in asexual reproduction macpherson et al 2022 these changes occurred around the 15 000th time step when the effects of fluctuating resources became manifest macpherson scott gras 2021c in the pluralistic study there was a measurable decrease in sexual reproduction and a measurable increase in asexual reproduction relative to their rates in the single factor study as evidenced by differential dtw distances in other words there appears to have been a reversal in the pluralistic study of what was observed in our single factor study of macpherson et al 2022 as can be seen in figs 5 a and b a plausible explanation of the reversal in rates of sexual and asexual reproduction in facultative prey in the pluralistic experiment is that the selective pressures of increased predation combined with an energy robbing deleterious allele threatened the population levels of facultative species as a result there would be pressure on facultative species to increase asexual reproduction in order to increase population levels that are threatened by the two additional factors since asexual reproduction involves all individuals being able to reproduce thereby sidestepping the problem of useless males a faster and more direct way to increase population considering countervailing factors would be to increase the rate of asexual reproduction and to decrease the rate of sexual reproduction in fact there is a measurably and consistently lower population level of facultative species in pluralistic runs vs the population levels of facultative species in single factor runs however following the 15 000th time step the curves begin to coalesce which is around the time that the intensity of the deleterious allele begins to decrease regardless population levels of prey in the pluralistic runs following the 15 000th time step remains lower than populations in the singular runs according to the dynamic time warping distances we measured as can be see in fig 6 the consistently lower population levels of facultative species in pluralistic runs in comparison with population levels of facultative species could the result of the deleterious allele da which starts at the initial time step combined with fluctuating resources which strictly speaking starts at the initial time step even though not becoming fully manifest until the 15 000th time step the lower population levels in pluralistic runs explains the reversion to asexual reproduction in facultative species as a kind of quick fix to increase population levels moreover we found that there was an increase in the ratio of dead killed for pluralistic runs following the 15 000th time step relative to single factor runs as can be seen in fig 7 this increase in the ratio of dead killed in pluralistic runs can be explained by the introduction of predators at the 15 000th time step which was absent in singular runs our conclusion supported by the data is that the reversal in the increase in sexual reproduction and the decrease in asexual reproduction is linked to selection pressures resulting from a marked decrease in population in pluralistic runs linked to da and the introduction of higher levels of predation 3 3 the impact of combining factors on the reaction of sexual and asexual species to increased predation the primary effect of the introduction of higher levels of predation in our single factor study was a lower extinction rate of sexual species vs the extinction rate of asexual species macpherson et al 2021b this result suggests that sexual species have a distinct advantage over asexual species in the face of increased predation viz a lower likelihood of species extinction however in our pluralistic study where increased predation was one factor amongst several fluctuating resources and deleterious allele the extinction rates of sexual and asexual species were virtually identical to the extinction rates of these species in the single factor study involving increased predation a plausible explanation for the lack of difference between the single factor and pluralistic studies vis a vis the red tooth factor is that the effects of da and fluctuating resources were not sufficient to temper a response regarding extinction rate this makes sense if we keep in mind that the da level is intermediate macpherson et al 2021a and that in the single factor studies fluctuating resources had no clear effect on either sexual or asexual species macpherson et al 2022 delving more deeply into the data we found that before the 10 000th time step the age of death for sexual species in pluralistic runs was objectively higher than the age of death for sexual species in rt singular runs as is evidenced in fig 8 a this may be an early evolutionary development in response to the deleterious allele whose effect begins at the initial time step though absent in the singular runs as a compensation for population loss due to the energy robbing effects of the allele between the 10000th and 15000th time step the age of death was objectively lower for pluralistic runs vs singular runs however after the 15 000th time step the age of death for pluralistic vs singular runs was higher again than the age of death for singular runs despite the mid time series dip in the age of death for pluralistic runs overall it is unlikely that there was sufficient selective pressure on sexual species in pluralistic runs to further decrease extinction rate at least from the perspective of age of death moreover we found that although population levels of sexual species in pluralistic runs were generally lower than population levels in rt singular runs for sexual species the population levels started to coalesce after the 17000th time step as evidenced by the fact that the dynamic time warping distance for steps 0 to 15 000 was 750 897 918 whereas the dynamic time warping distance for steps 15 000 28 000 was less at 142 464 088 fig 8b this coalescence would possibly be due to the higher intensity of the deleterious allele for singular runs vs pluralistic funs following the 15 000th time step reduce selection pressure on sexual species in pluralistic runs to evolve decreasing extinction rates the evidence presented above suggests that although the additional factors of da and fluctuating resources may have generated additional selection pressure for sexual species to evolve lower extinction rates these factors were not sufficient to achieve this effect 4 concluding remarks in this article we have investigated the potentially integrative effects of three factors that have the potential to affect reproductive mode in animal species da red tooth tangled bank to the best of our knowledge this is only one of three studies that have investigated the potential interaction of 3 factors on reproductive mode according to neiman et al 2017 only 2 studies besides ours have examined the impact of 3 factors on reproductive mode both of which were computer simulation studies that examined the potential interaction between deleterious alleles red queen and sexual selection howard and lively 2002 2003 our pluralistic study is the only simulation study to examine the combined effect of red tooth deleterious alleles and tangled bank on the mode of reproduction neiman et al 2017 whereas the studies conducted by howard and lively 2002 and howard and lively 2003 arguably proved that the three factors of red queen deleterious alleles and sexual selection acted synergistically to enhance their respective effects on modes of reproduction our study had mixed results although we found that the deleterious allele was reduced at a faster rate in the pluralistic study owing to the red tooth effect increased predation and the fluctuating resources effect the impact of the deleterious allele and red tooth actually had an antagonistic effect on the ratio of facultative species that reproduced sexually and asexually moreover in the pluralistic red tooth runs there was no obvious effect of the deleterious allele or1 8 fluctuating resources on the extinction rates for either sexual

24303,a new model of host depletion in the functional response of parasitoids is presented most existing models describe the dynamics of prey consumption as a sequential memoryless markovian process of searching for handling and consuming prey but the feeding interaction between a parasitoid and its host is different one of the most important characteristics is that the host is not consumed and remains in the arena on the other hand functional response models of solitary parasitoids assume that each host can accommodate an infinite number of oviposition events without being killed or becoming unsuitable as a host without the parasitoid noticing it as a consequence host depletion is never considered in parasitoid functional response models to solve that issue we extended the traditional random predator and random parasitoid functional response models of rogers into a compartmental model formulated with ordinary differential equations to group hosts with a different number of attacks to simulate how the parasitoid spreads the attacks between already parasitized and non parasitized hosts this model was further modified to simulate non sequential memoryless search handling and oviposition we studied the behaviour of these models to understand how a variation of their parameters led to different shapes of functional response curves and statistical distributions of the number of parasitoid eggs laid per host the results showed that the expected curves differ from those predicted by the simpler holling s disk equation type ii functional response random parasitoid models no depletion and the random predator model proportional depletion finally the non sequential memoryless models predict straight curves resembling a type i functional response at low host densities keywords egg distribution compartmental model host discrimination biological control data availability no data was used for the research described in the article abbreviations a search efficiency h handling time e eggs laid tu time unit n prey host density ode ordinary differential equations m number of parasitoid attacks received per host 1 introduction functional response models are used to describe and estimate the feeding interaction between a consumer and a resource rosenbaum and rall 2018 in addition to informing species interactions in a general sense applications of the functional response concept are found in conservation biology invasive species management and biocontrol novak and stouffer 2021 researchers consider functional response experiments mainly to be able to estimate two simple yet biologically meaningful parameters prey host search efficiency also defined in the literature as attack rate a and the handling time h holling 1959 denny 2014 or at most three parameters in the case of real 1977 1979 models both a and h are valuable indicators of the capabilities of any predator parasitoid since a indicates the proportion of prey hosts consumed under ideal conditions in a given time and h is related to the speed at which the prey hosts are processed holling 1959 type ii and type iii from holling 1959 are the most commonly used functional response models fernandez arhex corley 2003 however these models do not consider a relevant issue in functional response experiments a finite number of prey hosts and accordingly the number of available prey hosts decreases as they are consumed rogers 1972 with a subsequently biased estimation of the functional response for parasitoids host abundance does not decay noticeably during the observation period therefore the difference between the initial and the effectively available number of hosts within the arena unavoidably leads to an overestimation of a and h to circumvent this issue some authors proposed several workarounds such as replenishing the experimental arena by adding new prey hosts to the arena as the predators parasitoids depleted them mccaffrey horsburgh 1986 roche 1990 however it is sometimes not possible to maintain a constant number of prey hosts because of the complexities of the experimental setup for predators the introduction of prey can perturb the arena causing the predators to interrupt prey consumption okuyama ruyle 2011 griffen 2021 for parasitoids it is usually difficult to observe exactly how many hosts are effectively parasitized or not leading to unpredictable variations in the number of hosts within the arena prey depletion has been the subject of several theoretical studies that faced the problem of the finite number of prey hosts in the arena since it was introduced by rogers 1972 in his article rogers proposed two random search models one for parasitoids random parasite equation and another for predators random predator equation in both cases prey host consumption is assumed to be a markov like sequential memoryless process i e stochastic process in which the outcome of an event depends only on the state reached in the previous event according to the random parasite equation parasitoids can lay eggs every time they re encounter the host performing superparasitism in contrast the random predator equation assumes that predators consume the prey removing it from the environment the rogers random predator equation results in an exponential decay of available prey as it becomes increasingly difficult to find prey as they are consumed whereas with the random parasite equation the parasitoids oviposit at random i e with a uniform probability distribution among hosts without distinguishing already parasitized and non parasitized hosts resulting in a poisson distribution of eggs per host thus according to rogers parasitoids such as female wasps do not face host depletion which occurs only during predation other later authors such as morales ramos et al 1996 kratina et al 2009 clerc et al 2009 okuyama ruyle 2011 and okuyama 2013 always approached the subject from the side of the predator according to the random parasite equation any host can accommodate an infinite number of parasitoid eggs without the parasitoid noticing it however parasitoids distinguish between non parasitized and parasitised hosts speirs hubbard 1991 moreover parasitized hosts can be subject to manifold new attacks by i the same parasitoid individual ii other individuals of the same parasitoid species or iii other parasitoids of competing species speirs hubbard 1991 cases i and ii are superparasitism and case iii is multiparasitism solitary parasitoids usually avoid superparasitism as only one parasitoid larva can successfully complete its development in a host outreman et al 2001 chen et al 2020 however there is evidence that it is a common phenomenon van alphen visser 1990 speirs hubbard 1991 duval et al 2018 that occurs frequently enough to be not only a behaviour when there is an error or no options available but also an adaptive strategy van alphen visser 1990 speirs hubbard 1991 zhang 1992 for example some solitary parasitoids can benefit from placing several eggs in a host which leads to high levels of encapsulation and a consequent saturation of the host s defence system which increases the chance that one individual will survive luna et al 2016 these responses can happen only when the parasitoids can distinguish between parasitized and non parasitized hosts van lenteren 1975 hubbard et al 1987 by rejecting hosts parasitoids suffer host depletion therefore they do not lay eggs at random and are also subjected to host depletion like the predators only in a different way to solve this kind of issue rogers 1975 and griffiths 1977a later developed different models of superparasitism avoidance but they were not formalized in the same way as the random parasite model and were not integrated within the functional response framework so they are used much less other models of superparasitism exist but as mentioned they focus mostly on egg distribution and not on the functional response arditi 1983 and arditi glaizot 1995 proposed an imperfect discriminator model in which host discrimination is integrated within a functional response finally even under conditions of limited host availability rogers model might perform worse than holling s aguirre et al 2021 in this case the number of attacked hosts is neither a rogers nor a holling s type process but a compromise between them bruzzone et al 2018 aguirre et al 2021 the objective of this study was to develop a model to analyse host consumption by a solitary parasitoid based on rogers random parasite equation but now considering the existence of host depletion due to the rejection of hosts that have an egg load attack history that makes them unacceptable for the parasitoids to oviposit in them and allowing the model to accommodate a host search process that is non memoryless in this way the parasitoid s process of host search manipulation oviposition rejection is no longer markovian but rather it remembers previous encounters with the hosts or the process of host search manipulation oviposition rejection is not completely sequential finally via a series of simulations we attempted to understand how the accumulation of parasitised hosts influences the results of functional response experiments 2 methods the type ii functional response in its original form is known as holling s disk equation it describes how many prey hosts are consumed during a time period t e t by a predator parasitoid with search efficiency a and handling time h given a defined prey host density n it is a hyperbolic saturating curve in which a controls the initial slope of the curve and h limits the rate at which the prey host is consumed holling later showed that the type iii functional response sigmoidal curve could be derived by introducing the mechanism of predator parasitoid learning holling 1965 the mathematical reason for the change in shape is that holling s disc equation becomes a quadratic function of prey host density the consequence is an increase in the search efficiency but it keeps the limitation caused by the handling time both equations assume that the predator parasitoid searches systematically for its prey hosts and does not invest effort in searching again in the same part of the area we can adapt the equation for parasitoids by considering the number of eggs laid e per unit of time and per parasitoid leading to the following differential form 1 d e t d t a n 1 a h n rogers 1972 revised this equation to create the random parasitoid and random predator models the former can be obtained by substituting holling s disk equation into the thompson 1924 random parasitoid egg distribution model the process results in superparasitism with a poisson distributed number of eggs per host as time passes the number of non parasitized hosts n0 decays exponentially from n to zero while na the number of parasitized hosts increases asymptotically to n at a rate given by holling s disk equation unlike previous models used to describe superparasitism by solitary parasitoids such as the imperfect discriminator of arditi 1983 and arditi glaizot 1995 we choose a differential equation as a final form of rogers model which improves understanding of the dynamics of host depletion to develop an alternative model from a better starting point we substituted the rogers modified form of the disk equation into thompson s equation to obtain a differential form of the random parasite equation d n a t d t n 0 n a n 1 a h n simplified into 2 d n a t d t a n 0 1 a h n in equation 2 the number of hosts attacked per unit of time remains constant according to equation 1 with n n0 na but the number of non parasitized hosts decreases because the attacks are distributed randomly in other words already parasitized and non parasitized hosts have the same probability of being attacked thus the total number of eggs laid is provided by equation 1 the total number of parasitized hosts na by equation 2 and the average number of eggs laid per host is the ratio e n a the random predator model however can be rewritten considering that the newly parasitized hosts are a proportion of the number of the non parasitized hosts 3 d n t d t a n 1 a h n as for the random parasitoid model the number of available hosts decays exponentially to zero but now they are removed from the available pool instead of being reused as in superparasitism the predator unlike the parasitoid does not waste time rehandling the previously attacked prey because they were consumed therefore the difference between the two models is the term ahn in the first equation 2 the host density remains constant similar to the initial value nt 0 so n t nt 0 while in the second equation 3 n decreases which also decreases ahn if ahn equals zero both equations converge thus with the same parameters the consumption rate in the predator model is higher than that in the parasitoid model except when n a n0 or n a 0 fig 1 using equation 2 as a starting point but taking some elements of the rationale of equation 3 we developed a host depletion model for parasitoids as follows 2 1 host depletion with sequential search 2 1 1 hosts attacked only once let us divide the process into two compartments fig 2 one for hosts available and one for hosts unavailable for oviposition once the parasitoid attacks a host it becomes unavailable for future oviposition by the same or other parasitoids we defined n 0 t and n 1 t the number of non parasitized and parasitized hosts respectively this process is unidirectional thus once hosts pass to stage 1 they cannot be attacked again so na is not completely equivalent to n1 because na represents hosts that were attacked at least once moreover we assumed that each attack allows the oviposition of a single egg into the hosts we described the compartmental model as a chained system composed of ordinary differential equations odes similar to equation 3 d d t n 0 t a n 0 t 1 a h 0 n t d d t n 1 t a n 0 t 1 a h 1 n t with 4 n n 0 h 1 h 0 n 1 this model is similar to the rogers random predator equation for n 0 t but now the attacked hosts are transferred into a new compartment instead of being removed from the system as in the random parasitoid model the parasitoid is hampered in its need to remanipulate the already parasitized hosts so the term ahn has n n0 n1 but if the handling time of already parasitized hosts h1 differs from that of non parasitized ones h0 a weighted sum must be used to compose n t if h1 h0 0 the model becomes the random predator model and if the ratio h1 h0 1 the model becomes the random parasitoid values between 0 to 1 for this ratio h1 h0 of parameters indicate intermediate cases in which the parasitoid spends less time probing hosts that it is going to reject as in bai macauer 1990 or keinan et al 2012 2 1 2 hosts attacked repeatedly the process described in the previous section can be generalised to describe cases in which hosts are repeatedly parasitized by the same parasitoid or by other parasitoids of the same species resulting in superparasitism we approached repeated attacks by adding compartments to the model which differs from the approaches of previous authors that focused on the statistical distribution of eggs or attacks per host as a result of stochastic oviposition bakker et al 1972 rogers 1975 griffiths 1977a 1977b daley 1989 arditi 1980 arditi 1983 arditi glaizot 1995 fenlon et al 2009 leading to a known statistical distribution usually poisson or some of its variants in the number of eggs per host also as in the imperfect discriminator model of arditi glaizot 1995 the parasitoid usually cannot distinguish hosts with different numbers of attacks and consequently there is no upper limit of attacks oviposition events per host and thus host depletion does not exist instead starting from the model in equation 4 we expanded it from only two categories not parasitised and parasitized to any number of parasitoid eggs per host thus we defined m as the maximum number of attacks a host can receive before it becomes completely unsuitable or dead and also as the number of compartments in the model with the subscript i denoting the ith compartment fig 3 here na in equation 2 is equivalent to ni 0 each compartment is described by an ode leading to the following general mathematical form of the system d d t n 0 t a 0 n 0 t 1 a 0 h 0 n t d d t n 1 t a 0 n 0 t 1 a 0 h 0 n t a 1 n 1 t 1 a 1 h 1 n t d d t n m t a m 1 n m 1 t 1 a m 1 h m 1 n t with 5 n t i 0 m h i h 0 n i t with a i the search efficiency of parasitoids towards hosts attacked i times if a 0 a 1 a m the parasitoid search efficiency is the same regardless of the number of eggs in the host moreover if m is sufficiently large the number of eggs per host will follow a poisson distribution and converge to the rogers random parasitoid model if instead a i 0 for i 0 or m 1 we again obtain rogers random predator model as a consequence both rogers models become special cases of the model from equation 5 with a 0 a 1 a m the search efficiency differs by egg load so the system can also represent parasitoids that can differentiate between non parasitized and already parasitized hosts or even different numbers of attacks on the other hand if h 0 h 1 h m the handling time is the same for all hosts and the model is again the rogers random parasitoid model and if hm 0 the model becomes similar to a multi stage version of the random predator model in which each successive stage is an increased number of eggs in the host 2 2 host depletion with non sequential search 2 2 1 hosts attacked only once the general case presented previously section 2 1 can be improved considering that under rogers approach the parasitoid forages sequentially in a finite resource environment in real environments however as the parasitoid uses the resource it becomes increasingly difficult to find the next host as the density of hosts decreases as the number of items consumed increases in other words this phenomenon consists of a continuous decrease in efficiency over time otherwise the parasitoid might remember the location of its last parasitized host mathematically speaking the parasitoid s decrease in efficiency may not be directly proportional to the available host density as hypothesised by rogers what happens biologically speaking is a partial increase in search efficiency through learning and memory which overcomes the difficulty caused by the reduction of the host density haverkamps smid 2020 when the female parasitoid is rewarded by an oviposition experience it learns that its foraging behaviour in response to that odour e g plant volatiles created by its host leads to finding a suitable host learned information is stored as a memory in the brain that can be divided into short mid and long lasting memory all of which can exist simultaneously the combination of habituation and extinction memory forms a crucial evaluation system that also helps to maintain the foraging efficiency of wasps in complex environments therefore if searching manipulating ovipositing is not completely sequential and memoryless i e is not markovian the perception of parasitized and non parasitized hosts must differ we can improve equation 5 by considering the difference between the perceived n p number of hosts and its real number n as an alternative there must be a delay in the perception of the true n available to the host so its remotion speed the number of individuals per unit of time that are transferred to the next compartment is later than that of the rogers model these assumptions lead to reformulating equation 3 as follows d d t n t a n n p t 1 a n h n 0 d d t n p t Î· d d t n t 6 with 0 Î· 1 and 0 n n p with Î· being the forgetting rate which is the rate at which non parasitized hosts are forgotten inducing the parasitoid to continue searching with a subsequent decrease of its efficiency hence the second equation of 6 results in an exponential smoothing of n p if Î· 1 the non parasitized hosts are completely forgotten leading equation 6 to the rogers model while if Î· 0 the parasitoid never forgets a host or loses efficiency leading equation 6 to a truncated version of the holling s disk equation in which if the host pool is emptied both n and n p are truncated to zero 2 2 2 hosts attacked repeatedly once the equation for a single attack is introduced we can consider hosts parasitized m times by the same parasitoid via superparasitism leading to the following modification of the system 5 d d t n 0 t a 0 n 0 t 1 a 0 h 0 n t d d t n 0 p t Î· d d t n 0 t d d t n 1 t a 0 n 0 t 1 a 0 h 0 n t a 1 n 1 t 1 a 1 h 1 n t d d t n 1 p t Î· d d t n 1 t 1 Î· d d t n 0 t d d t n m t a m 1 n m 1 t 1 a m 1 h m 1 n t 7 d d t n m p t Î· d d t n m t 1 Î· d d t n m 1 t in the general case Î· is applied also to the hosts that came from the previous m stages however we should consider that at the same level there are hosts that are forgotten once attacked proportionally to Î· and other hosts that are remembered proportionally to 1 Î· accordingly the hosts with a certain number of attacks have positions that are partially known by the parasitoid 2 3 model evaluation model behaviour was evaluated by considering different combinations of parameters in particular we were interested in understanding how the parameters m a m and Î· influence the statistical distribution of eggs laid by parasitoids into the hosts 2 3 1 default parameters for all simulations in this study we used a default combination of parameters thus unless stated otherwise the values of each parameter are described as follows for this part of the study we assumed that parasitoids had an infinite egg load so that the only factor that influenced the functional response was host depletion and that there were no learning effects given that assumption and that the number of offered hosts is finite the host pool is expected to be completely depleted after some time so we restricted the duration of the simulation to a finite time which might represent the oviposition activity during one day or the lifetime of the parasitoids thus except when testing the effect of time in the statistical distribution of eggs per host we assumed a duration of 20 time units tu for each simulation the functional response was a type ii with a handling time h of 0 1 tu resulting in an asymptote of 100 and with a search efficiency a of non parasitized hosts of 0 8 the number of offered hosts was in a continuous range of 1 to 120 at intervals of 0 01 finally it was assumed that the handling time of rejected hosts hosts with an egg load m was the same as that of accepted hosts according to the original random parasite equation following the results of fenlon et al 2009 who found a maximum of 10 parasitoid eggs per aphid host m was thus limited to it as the maximum number of solitary parasitoid eggs that a host can carry until it is removed from the analysis because it becomes unacceptable for a parasitoid or is killed by the sum of attacks this general framework was then divided into three steps one for each parameter to test more specifically three effects were evaluated first changing m and keeping a and Î· constant second changing a and keeping m and Î· constant and finally changing Î· and keeping a and m constant as follows 1 effects of m simulations were performed considering a sequence of integer values of m 0 10 in addition a 0 a 1 a m 0 8 so that the hosts with less than m attacks could be parasitized randomly with the same probability regardless of the number of previous attacks three types of curves were generated a host egg load as a function of m from 1 to 10 and time from the start until the end of the simulated experiment b host egg load as a function of the duration of the simulation 5 tu 20 tu the default value used in the rest of the simulations and 40 time units c the functional response as a function of m for comparison the random predator model was also calculated for m 1 with the same parameters 1 effects of changing a as a function of host egg load with this second case we analysed the influence of changing a setting a constant value of m 10 and considering two functions describing a the first function was an exponential decay 8 a i a 0 a Î» with a 0 0 8 as in the previous step and for which five host attractiveness decay rates Î» were explored 1 hosts with an egg load 1 rejected 0 75 0 5 0 25 and 0 0 a constant as in 1 fig 4 a therefore if Î» 1 the wasp shows perfect discrimination rejecting all parasitized hosts the second function was a gamma distribution 9 f a a k 1 Î¸ k Î³ k e a Î¸ with parameters k shape and Î¸ scale being the mean and variance equal to k Î¸ and k Î¸ 2 respectively we used two combinations of parameters the first with k Î¸ 2 and k Î¸ 2 2 and the second with k Î¸ 4 and k Î¸ 2 2 fig 4b we described three types of responses a parasitoid egg load as a function of search efficiency a with values described by equations 8 and 9 and time from the start until the end of the simulated experiment b distribution of eggs among hosts as a function of the curve of a c the functional response as a function of a 1 effects of changing Î· we analysed the effects of decreasing efficiency of the parasitoid due to the host egg load which reduced the number of available healthy hosts three values of Î· were considered Î· 0 the hollings disk equation Î· 1 rogers model random predator or random parasite and an intermediate value at Î· 0 5 moreover we set m 10 and a 0 5 we first analysed the dynamics of host egg load as a function of time in the simulated experiments and the functional responses for the three values of Î· 3 results 3 1 effects of m 3 1 1 attacked hosts and eggs laid as a function of time increasing m from 1 to higher values did not change the total number of parasitized or non parasitized hosts overall the non parasitized hosts were depleted at the same rate fig 5 a as depletion depended only on a m 0 and not on a m i with 1 i m overall the number of non parasitized hosts decayed exponentially to zero at the same rate regardless of the value of m the number of hosts that received more eggs showed the typical increasing decreasing behaviour of compartmental models the number of highly parasitized hosts first increased and then began to decrease asymptotically to zero once the host transferring speed from that compartment to the next exceeded the input speed from previous compartments resembling a gamma distribution fig 5b the number of individuals that hosted the maximum number of eggs m and as a consequence were no longer available to the parasitoid increases asymptotically to n 0 however as m increases the asymptotic growth towards n 0 was slower fig 5c the total number of eggs in hosts instead grew almost linearly as m increased with an asymptotic final value of m n fig 5d 3 1 2 statistical distribution of eggs as a function of m the effect of m is that the eggs accumulated in the last stage of the compartmental model which produced a peak in the frequency distribution of eggs per host in m at short experimental times the curve visually resembled a poisson distribution according to rogers 1975 especially at higher values of m fig 6 a however at smaller values of m hosts with m eggs quickly accumulated as the experiment became longer hosts with m eggs began to accumulate in all simulations fig 6b c with intermediate values of m or with longer experiments the distribution of the number of eggs laid per host became bimodal fig 6b c none of these bimodal distributions resembled a poisson binomial or even a discrete beta statistical distribution 3 1 3 shape of the functional response the number of attacked hosts was always the same regardless of the value of m with all curves overlapping completely fig 7 a the difference lay in the total number of laid eggs which increased as m increased fig 7b in both curves the random predator model behaved very similarly to the random parasite model with this combination of parameters the curves overlapped completely and it was difficult to differentiate them 3 2 effects of different search efficiency distributions the test distributions chosen for a yielded different model outputs fig 4 the exponentially decaying a yielded the same number of attacked hosts fig 8 a this value in fact depended only on a 0 whose value was kept constant for all rates Î» considered in this part of the analysis fig 4a for egg loads greater than zero as Î» increased the number of eggs laid by the parasitoid also increased more specifically if Î» 1 the search efficiency decreased abruptly as a consequence the parasitoid attacked only healthy hosts and therefore did not perform superparasitism in contrast when Î» 0 for which a remained constant for all egg loads and the parasitoid behaved as in the random parasite model the number of eggs laid in already parasited hosts was higher fig 8b c as was the total number of eggs laid fig 8d in comparison the gamma shaped curves parametrized as k shape and Î¸ scale started more slowly because their value of a0 was lower fig 4b with the curve with a lower mean a k Î¸ 2 that decayed faster because it had a0 higher than that with k Î¸ 4 fig 8e the number of hosts with m 1 attacks showed that the curve with Î» 0 also had more hosts with any number of attacks because a was always the maximum with Î» 0 a was constant figs 8c 8e in the gamma shaped curve the number of hosts with m 1 and m attacks was higher with k Î¸ 4 even though the total number of attacked hosts was lower because of the parasitoid s preference for previously attacked hosts thus once some hosts had received a certain number of attacks they were repeatedly attacked until they were removed fig 8e f the total number of eggs laid also increased as Î» decreased because at lower values of Î» a decreased more slowly thus the parasitoid retained its efficiency therefore laying more eggs per host fig 8g in the case of gamma distributed a the total number of eggs laid with k Î¸ 2 was higher than that with k Î¸ 4 because it attacked more hosts repeatedly whereas with k Î¸ 4 attacks were fewer but more concentrated the distribution of hosts as a function of the number of attacks showed that the exponentially decaying models yielded a unimodally distributed number of attacks although this function decreased monotonically with Î» 0 75 it resembled a normal distribution mostly because at certain values of m the number of hosts that were attacked and moved to the next compartments was compensated by the number of hosts that came from the previous stage fig 9 a c with gamma distributed a the distribution was unimodal at lower values of k Î¸ also resembling a normal distribution but at higher values it retained a large number of unattacked hosts with a flattened distribution as a consequence the attacks with high values of k Î¸ were concentrated on the most attacked hosts so that all the hosts that had received a certain number of attacks were repeatedly attacked until they reached m the functional response curves had a similar number of attacked hosts with all Î» values and lower with higher k Î¸ values mainly because the number of attacked hosts was defined by the search efficiency at a0 fig 10 a d 3 3 effects of changing Î· the model with a different perception of parasitized and non parasitized hosts produced expected intermediate values between the hollings disk equation no update and rogers model complete update depending on the value of Î· when Î· 1 the non parasitized host pool was completely depleted at some moment whereas with Î· 1 rogers model the non parasitized host pool decreased asymptotically to zero fig 11 a the number of hosts attacked only once and presumably had received one egg increased until the non parasitized host pool was completely depleted and sharply decreased to zero when 0 Î· 1 whereas when Î· 1 it made a smooth transition from growing to also decreasing asymptotically to zero fig 11b the pattern for the removed hosts with m attacks was exactly the opposite of that for the non parasitized hosts when 0 Î· 1 increasing exponentially until the number of removed hosts reached n0 when Î· 1 the number of removed hosts increased asymptotically to n0 fig 11c the shape of the functional response was also influenced by Î· as it increased the functional response became less steep due to the increasing costs of searching for another host in a depleted environment where the healthy hosts were increasingly scarce without previous memories of their location as the duration of the experiment increased the pool of hosts offered eventually became depleted and thus the functional response became a straight line similar to type i until there were more hosts than the parasitoid could process during the entire experiment fig 12 a the functional response curve then recovered its typically asymptotically increasing shape fig 12b for the number of eggs laid the pattern was essentially the same when the duration of the experiment was 2 tu fig 12c with a straight line stage at lower host densities when the duration of the experiment was 4 tu fig 12d below certain values there is a breakpoint because under the hollings disk equation with limited host supply non attacked hosts are completely depleted eventually fig 12b d 4 discussion overall the new models showed new emerging patterns in the use of hosts that cannot be expected or explained by any existing model of predator functional response this is because the parasitoids are not predators thus the logic of resource use differs completely as the used hosts remain in the area they interfere with the experience of the parasitoids and it also differs from what happens in an infinite arena with only non parasitized hosts the models also differ from functional response models for parasitoids such as rogers 1972 random parasite equation or arditi s 1995 imperfect discriminator model as we used explicit compartmentalization and an upper limit to the number of eggs per host either by death caused by hosting too many eggs or simply by parasitoid rejection distinguishing hosts health status i e non parasitized parasitized but acceptable for oviposition parasitized but unacceptable for oviposition or killed is the main mechanism behind host depletion therefore avoiding superparasitism implies host depletion and vice versa under the random parasite model the parasitoid cannot distinguish hosts so there is no depletion and therefore superparasitism occurs however the assumption of random manipulation does not hold because parasitoids can distinguish non parasitized and parasitized hosts by detecting volatiles fatouros et al 2005 or more rapidly via probing a host with the ovipositor but not ovipositing if another parasitoid is found inside bai macauer 1990 keinan et al 2012 thus the search efficiency and handling times depend on the health status of the host the solution used in the imperfect discriminator model was to use a third parameter Î´ which is the propensity to superparasite here we used the search efficiency to model the degree of preference between different numbers of previous attacks per host and found that it can influence the results greatly handling time however is the parameter that causes the difference between rogers models the combination of parameters used in this study did not make much difference thus to avoid an overly complex analysis we did not study its effect further in this study we did not examine intrahost competition which could lead to fewer emerging hosts than the number of eggs laid usually in solitary parasitoids only one parasitoid emerges from a host that was attacked multiple times godfray 1994 according to our results the factor that influences the number of attacked hosts the most if only one parasite emerges is a0 the search efficiency for healthy hosts in some solitary parasitoids however superparasitism is an adaptive behaviour speirs hubbard 1991 thus in this case the search efficiency for previously attacked hosts will be an important factor even if only one parasitoid emerges per individual host the statistical distribution of the number of eggs per host might not resemble the preference of the parasitoid but rather an equilibrium point at which the number of hosts that enter the m stage is compensated or not by the rate at which they are removed over time the mode of the statistical distribution moves to larger numbers of attacks until it reaches m when all hosts are either unacceptable for the parasitoid or dead while rogers 1975 and other later authors griffiths 1977a 1977b daley 1989 arditi 1983 arditi glaizot 1995 fenlon et al 2009 focused on the statistical distribution of parasitoid eggs per host we developed a more flexible approach in which a compartmental model can gain more insights into the biology of the studied species finally our results show that parasitoids must deal with already parasitized hosts and in a finite arena the non parasitized host pool can be emptied simply because the parasitoid was able to find all available hosts or had some non memoryless search behaviour via some kind of learning so the non attacked host pool does not decrease asymptotically to zero if that pool is emptied the functional response takes the shape of a straight line type i functional response with high efficiency until the density is so high that the parasitoid cannot process all of the hosts available which masks the true shape of the curve at that range of host densities at high host densities the functional response curve will resemble a type ii but with a steeper increase to the asymptote an empty host pool may mask a type iii functional response if the inflexion point occurs within the density at which the host pool is emptied as previous studies have highlighted bruzzone et al 2022 the type i and taller sharper type ii functional responses are also consequences of the consumer i e the parasitoid having learnt with this compartmentalized model we were able to create a system that also captured the change in preference for host health as they receive repeated attacks although other categories can be used the basic categories can remain as non parasitized parasitized but acceptable for oviposition and removed i e unacceptable or killed killed hosts can be distinguished from unacceptable hosts in the same way as in the epidemiological sird susceptible infectious recovered deceased is used to model the number of deaths from a disease overall compartmentalization may allow the development of models using the ample literature of robust and well known models from epidemiology 4 1 conclusions we developed new models which describe host depletion when the resources hosts used are still present after being used or consumed by their natural enemies as for a host parasitoid relationship these models are extensions of rogers random parasite model of functional response in the form of compartmental models with ordinary differential equations the behaviour of those models showed emerging patterns that must be considered when studying the functional response of parasitoids under laboratory or field conditions in which hosts have low densities or numbers

24303,a new model of host depletion in the functional response of parasitoids is presented most existing models describe the dynamics of prey consumption as a sequential memoryless markovian process of searching for handling and consuming prey but the feeding interaction between a parasitoid and its host is different one of the most important characteristics is that the host is not consumed and remains in the arena on the other hand functional response models of solitary parasitoids assume that each host can accommodate an infinite number of oviposition events without being killed or becoming unsuitable as a host without the parasitoid noticing it as a consequence host depletion is never considered in parasitoid functional response models to solve that issue we extended the traditional random predator and random parasitoid functional response models of rogers into a compartmental model formulated with ordinary differential equations to group hosts with a different number of attacks to simulate how the parasitoid spreads the attacks between already parasitized and non parasitized hosts this model was further modified to simulate non sequential memoryless search handling and oviposition we studied the behaviour of these models to understand how a variation of their parameters led to different shapes of functional response curves and statistical distributions of the number of parasitoid eggs laid per host the results showed that the expected curves differ from those predicted by the simpler holling s disk equation type ii functional response random parasitoid models no depletion and the random predator model proportional depletion finally the non sequential memoryless models predict straight curves resembling a type i functional response at low host densities keywords egg distribution compartmental model host discrimination biological control data availability no data was used for the research described in the article abbreviations a search

are used to describe and estimate the feeding interaction between a consumer and a resource rosenbaum and rall 2018 in addition to informing species interactions in a general sense applications of the functional response concept are found in conservation biology invasive species management and biocontrol novak and stouffer 2021 researchers consider functional response experiments mainly to be able to estimate two simple yet biologically meaningful parameters prey host search efficiency also defined in the literature as attack rate a and the handling time h holling 1959 denny 2014 or at most three parameters in the case of real 1977 1979 models both a and h are valuable indicators of the capabilities of any predator parasitoid since a indicates the proportion of prey hosts consumed under ideal conditions in a given time and h is related to the speed at which the prey hosts are processed holling 1959 type ii and type iii from holling 1959 are the most commonly used functional response models fernandez arhex corley 2003 however these models do not consider a relevant issue in functional response experiments a finite number of prey hosts and accordingly the number of available prey hosts decreases as they are consumed rogers 1972 with a subsequently biased estimation of the functional response for parasitoids host abundance does not decay noticeably during the observation period therefore the difference between the initial and the effectively available number of hosts within the arena unavoidably leads to an overestimation of a and h to circumvent this issue some authors proposed several workarounds such as replenishing the experimental arena by adding new prey hosts to the arena as the predators parasitoids depleted them mccaffrey horsburgh 1986 roche 1990 however it is sometimes not possible to maintain a constant number of prey hosts because of the complexities of the experimental setup for predators the introduction of prey can perturb the arena causing the predators to interrupt prey consumption okuyama ruyle 2011 griffen 2021 for parasitoids it is usually difficult to observe exactly how many hosts are effectively parasitized or not leading to unpredictable variations in the number of hosts within the arena prey depletion has been the subject of several theoretical studies that faced the problem of the finite number of prey hosts in the arena since it was introduced by rogers 1972 in his article rogers proposed two random search models one for parasitoids random parasite equation and another for predators random predator equation in both cases prey host consumption is assumed to be a markov like sequential memoryless process i e stochastic process in which the outcome of an event depends only on the state reached in the previous event according to the random parasite equation parasitoids can lay eggs every time they re encounter the host performing superparasitism in contrast the random predator equation assumes that predators consume the prey removing it from the environment the rogers random predator equation results in an exponential decay of available prey as it becomes increasingly difficult to find prey as they are consumed whereas with the random parasite equation the parasitoids oviposit at random i e with a uniform probability distribution among hosts without distinguishing already parasitized and non parasitized hosts resulting in a poisson distribution of eggs per host thus according to rogers parasitoids such as female wasps do not face host depletion which occurs only during predation other later authors such as morales ramos et al 1996 kratina et al 2009 clerc et al 2009 okuyama ruyle 2011 and okuyama 2013 always approached the subject from the side of the predator according to the random parasite equation any host can accommodate an infinite number of parasitoid eggs without the parasitoid noticing it however parasitoids distinguish between non parasitized and parasitised hosts speirs hubbard 1991 moreover parasitized hosts can be subject to manifold new attacks by i the same parasitoid individual ii other individuals of the same parasitoid species or iii other parasitoids of competing species speirs hubbard 1991 cases i and ii are superparasitism and case iii is multiparasitism solitary parasitoids usually avoid superparasitism as only one parasitoid larva can successfully complete its development in a host outreman et al 2001 chen et al 2020 however there is evidence that it is a common phenomenon van alphen visser 1990 speirs hubbard 1991 duval et al 2018 that occurs frequently enough to be not only a behaviour when there is an error or no options available but also an adaptive strategy van alphen visser 1990 speirs hubbard 1991 zhang 1992 for example some solitary parasitoids can benefit from placing several eggs in a host which leads to high levels of encapsulation and a consequent saturation of the host s defence system which increases the chance that one individual will survive luna et al 2016 these responses can happen only when the parasitoids can distinguish between parasitized and non parasitized hosts van lenteren 1975 hubbard et al 1987 by rejecting hosts parasitoids suffer host depletion therefore they do not lay eggs at random and are also subjected to host depletion like the predators only in a different way to solve this kind of issue rogers 1975 and griffiths 1977a later developed different models of superparasitism avoidance but they were not formalized in the same way as the random parasite model and were not integrated within the functional response framework so they are used much less other models of superparasitism exist but as mentioned they focus mostly on egg distribution and not on the functional response arditi 1983 and arditi glaizot 1995 proposed an imperfect discriminator model in which host discrimination is integrated within a functional response finally even under conditions of limited host availability rogers model might perform worse than holling s aguirre et al 2021 in this case the number of attacked hosts is neither a rogers nor a holling s type process but a compromise between them bruzzone et al 2018 aguirre et al 2021 the objective of this study was to develop a model to analyse host consumption by a solitary parasitoid based on rogers random parasite equation but now considering the existence of host depletion due to the rejection of hosts that have an egg load attack history that makes them unacceptable for the parasitoids to oviposit in them and allowing the model to accommodate a host search process that is non memoryless in this way the parasitoid s process of host search manipulation oviposition rejection is no longer markovian but rather it remembers previous encounters with the hosts or the process of host search manipulation oviposition rejection is not completely sequential finally via a series of simulations we attempted to understand how the accumulation of parasitised hosts influences the results of functional response experiments 2 methods the type ii functional response in its original form is known as holling s disk equation it describes how many prey hosts are consumed during a time period t e t by a predator parasitoid with search efficiency a and handling time h given a defined prey host density n it is a hyperbolic saturating curve in which a controls the initial slope of the curve and h limits the rate at which the prey host is consumed holling later showed that the type iii functional response sigmoidal curve could be derived by introducing the mechanism of predator parasitoid learning holling 1965 the mathematical reason for the change in shape is that holling s disc equation becomes a quadratic function of prey host density the consequence is an increase in the search efficiency but it keeps the limitation caused by the handling time both equations assume that the predator parasitoid searches systematically for its prey hosts and does not invest effort in searching again in the same part of the area we can adapt the equation for parasitoids by considering the number of eggs laid e per unit of time and per parasitoid leading to the following differential form 1 d e t d t a n 1 a h n rogers 1972 revised this equation to create the random parasitoid and random predator models the former can be obtained by substituting holling s disk equation into the thompson 1924 random parasitoid egg distribution model the process results in superparasitism with a poisson distributed number of eggs per host as time passes the number of non parasitized hosts n0 decays exponentially from n to zero while na the number of parasitized hosts increases asymptotically to n at a rate given by holling s disk equation unlike previous models used to describe superparasitism by solitary parasitoids such as the imperfect discriminator of arditi 1983 and arditi glaizot 1995 we choose a differential equation as a final form of rogers model which improves understanding of the dynamics of host depletion to develop an alternative model from a better starting point we substituted the rogers modified form of the disk equation into thompson s equation to obtain a differential form of the random parasite equation d n a t d t n 0 n a n 1 a h n simplified into 2 d n a t d t a n 0 1 a h n in equation 2 the number of hosts attacked per unit of time remains constant according to equation 1 with n n0 na but the number of non parasitized hosts decreases because the attacks are distributed randomly in other words already parasitized and non parasitized hosts have the same probability of being attacked thus the total number of eggs laid is provided by equation 1 the total number of parasitized hosts na by equation 2 and the average number of eggs laid per host is the ratio e n a the random predator model however can be rewritten considering that the newly parasitized hosts are a proportion of the number of the non parasitized hosts 3 d n t d t a n 1 a h n as for the random parasitoid model the number of available hosts decays exponentially to zero but now they are removed from the available pool instead of being reused as in superparasitism the predator unlike the parasitoid does not waste time rehandling the previously attacked prey because they were consumed therefore the difference between the two models is the term ahn in the first equation 2 the host density remains constant similar to the initial value nt 0 so n t nt 0 while in the second equation 3 n decreases which also decreases ahn if ahn equals zero both equations converge thus with the same parameters the consumption rate in the predator model is higher than that in the parasitoid model except when n a n0 or n a 0 fig 1 using equation 2 as a starting point but taking some elements of the rationale of equation 3 we developed a host depletion model for parasitoids as follows 2 1 host depletion with sequential search 2 1 1 hosts attacked only once let us divide the process into two compartments fig 2 one for hosts available and one for hosts unavailable for oviposition once the parasitoid attacks a host it becomes unavailable for future oviposition by the same or other parasitoids we defined n 0 t and n 1 t the number of non parasitized and parasitized hosts respectively this process is unidirectional thus once hosts pass to stage 1 they cannot be attacked again so na is not completely equivalent to n1 because na represents hosts that were attacked at least once moreover we assumed that each attack allows the oviposition of a single egg into the hosts we described the compartmental model as a chained system composed of ordinary differential equations odes similar to equation 3 d d t n 0 t a n 0 t 1 a h 0 n t d d t n 1 t a n 0 t 1 a h 1 n t with 4 n n 0 h 1 h 0 n 1 this model is similar to the rogers random predator equation for n 0 t but now the attacked hosts are transferred into a new compartment instead of being removed from the system as in the random parasitoid model the parasitoid is hampered in its need to remanipulate the already parasitized hosts so the term ahn has n n0 n1 but if the handling time of already parasitized hosts h1 differs from that of non parasitized ones h0 a weighted sum must be used to compose n t if h1 h0 0 the model becomes the random predator model and if the ratio h1 h0 1 the model becomes the random parasitoid values between 0 to 1 for this ratio h1 h0 of parameters indicate intermediate cases in which the parasitoid spends less time probing hosts that it is going to reject as in bai macauer 1990 or keinan et al 2012 2 1 2 hosts attacked repeatedly the process described in the previous section can be generalised to describe cases in which hosts are repeatedly parasitized by the same parasitoid or by other parasitoids of the same species resulting in superparasitism we approached repeated attacks by adding compartments to the model which differs from the approaches of previous authors that focused on the statistical distribution of eggs or attacks per host as a result of stochastic oviposition bakker et al 1972 rogers 1975 griffiths 1977a 1977b daley 1989 arditi 1980 arditi 1983 arditi glaizot 1995 fenlon et al 2009 leading to a known statistical distribution usually poisson or some of its variants in the number of eggs per host also as in the imperfect discriminator model of arditi glaizot 1995 the parasitoid usually cannot distinguish hosts with different numbers of attacks and consequently there is no upper limit of attacks oviposition events per host and thus host depletion does not exist instead starting from the model in equation 4 we expanded it from only two categories not parasitised and parasitized to any number of parasitoid eggs per host thus we defined m as the maximum number of attacks a host can receive before it becomes completely unsuitable or dead and also as the number of compartments in the model with the subscript i denoting the ith compartment fig 3 here na in equation 2 is equivalent to ni 0 each compartment is described by an ode leading to the following general mathematical form of the system d d t n 0 t a 0 n 0 t 1 a 0 h 0 n t d d t n 1 t a 0 n 0 t 1 a 0 h 0 n t a 1 n 1 t 1 a 1 h 1 n t d d t n m t a m 1 n m 1 t 1 a m 1 h m 1 n t with 5 n t i 0 m h i h 0 n i t with a i the search efficiency of parasitoids towards hosts attacked i times if a 0 a 1 a m the parasitoid search efficiency is the same regardless of the number of eggs in the host moreover if m is sufficiently large the number of eggs per host will follow a poisson distribution and converge to the rogers random parasitoid model if instead a i 0 for i 0 or m 1 we again obtain rogers random predator model as a consequence both rogers models become special cases of the model from equation 5 with a 0 a 1 a m the search efficiency differs by egg load so the system can also represent parasitoids that can differentiate between non parasitized and already parasitized hosts or even different numbers of attacks on the other hand if h 0 h 1 h m the handling time is the same for all hosts and the model is again the rogers random parasitoid model and if hm 0 the model becomes similar to a multi stage version of the random predator model in which each successive stage is an increased number of eggs in the host 2 2 host depletion with non sequential search 2 2 1 hosts attacked only once the general case presented previously section 2 1 can be improved considering that under rogers approach the parasitoid forages sequentially in a finite resource environment in real environments however as the parasitoid uses the resource it becomes increasingly difficult to find the next host as the density of hosts decreases as the number of items consumed increases in other words this phenomenon consists of a continuous decrease in efficiency over time otherwise the parasitoid might remember the location of its last parasitized host mathematically speaking the parasitoid s decrease in efficiency may not be directly proportional to the available host density as hypothesised by rogers what happens biologically speaking is a partial increase in search efficiency through learning and memory which overcomes the difficulty caused by the reduction of the host density haverkamps smid 2020 when the female parasitoid is rewarded by an oviposition experience it learns that its foraging behaviour in response to that odour e g plant volatiles created by its host leads to finding a suitable host learned information is stored as a memory in the brain that can be divided into short mid and long lasting memory all of which can exist simultaneously the combination of habituation and extinction memory forms a crucial evaluation system that also helps to maintain the foraging efficiency of wasps in complex environments therefore if searching manipulating ovipositing is not completely sequential and memoryless i e is not markovian the perception of parasitized and non parasitized hosts must differ we can improve equation 5 by considering the difference between the perceived n p number of hosts and its real number n as an alternative there must be a delay in the perception of the true n available to the host so its remotion speed the number of individuals per unit of time that are transferred to the next compartment is later than that of the rogers model these assumptions lead to reformulating equation 3 as follows d d t n t a n n p t 1 a n h n 0 d d t n p t Î· d d t n t 6 with 0 Î· 1 and 0 n n p with Î· being the forgetting rate which is the rate at which non parasitized hosts are forgotten inducing the parasitoid to continue searching with a subsequent decrease of its efficiency hence the second equation of 6 results in an exponential smoothing of n p if Î· 1 the non parasitized hosts are completely forgotten leading equation 6 to the rogers model while if Î· 0 the parasitoid never forgets a host or loses efficiency leading equation 6 to a truncated version of the holling s disk equation in which if the host pool is emptied both n and n p are truncated to zero 2 2 2 hosts attacked repeatedly once the equation for a single attack is introduced we can consider hosts parasitized m times by the same parasitoid via superparasitism leading to the following modification of the system 5 d d t n 0 t a 0 n 0 t 1 a 0 h 0 n t d d t n 0 p t Î· d d t n 0 t d d t n 1 t a 0 n 0 t 1 a 0 h 0 n t a 1 n 1 t 1 a 1 h 1 n t d d t n 1 p t Î· d d t n 1 t 1 Î· d d t n 0 t d d t n m t a m 1 n m 1 t 1 a m 1 h m 1 n t 7 d d t n m p t Î· d d t n m t 1 Î· d d t n m 1 t in the general case Î· is applied also to the hosts that came from the previous m stages however we should consider that at the same level there are hosts that are forgotten once attacked proportionally to Î· and other hosts that are remembered proportionally to 1 Î· accordingly the hosts with a certain number of attacks have positions that are partially known by the parasitoid 2 3 model evaluation model behaviour was evaluated by considering different combinations of parameters in particular we were interested in understanding how the parameters m a m and Î· influence the statistical distribution of eggs laid by parasitoids into the hosts 2 3 1 default parameters for all simulations in this study we used a default combination of parameters thus unless stated otherwise the values of each parameter are described as follows for this part of the study we assumed that parasitoids had an infinite egg load so that the only factor that influenced the functional response was host depletion and that there were no learning effects given that assumption and that the number of offered hosts is finite the host pool is expected to be completely depleted after some time so we restricted the duration of the simulation to a finite time which might represent the oviposition activity during one day or the lifetime of the parasitoids thus except when testing the effect of time in the statistical distribution of eggs per host we assumed a duration of 20 time units tu for each simulation the functional response was a type ii with a handling time h of 0 1 tu resulting in an asymptote of 100 and with a search efficiency a of non parasitized hosts of 0 8 the number of offered hosts was in a continuous range of 1 to 120 at intervals of 0 01 finally it was assumed that the handling time of rejected hosts hosts with an egg load m was the same as that of accepted hosts according to the original random parasite equation following the results of fenlon et al 2009 who found a maximum of 10 parasitoid eggs per aphid host m was thus limited to it as the maximum number of solitary parasitoid eggs that a host can carry until it is removed from the analysis because it becomes unacceptable for a parasitoid or is killed by the sum of attacks this general framework was then divided into three steps one for each parameter to test more specifically three effects were evaluated first changing m and keeping a and Î· constant second changing a and keeping m and Î· constant and finally changing Î· and keeping a and m constant as follows 1 effects of m simulations were performed considering a sequence of integer values of m 0 10 in addition a 0 a 1 a m 0 8 so that the hosts with less than m attacks could be parasitized randomly with the same probability regardless of the number of previous attacks three types of curves were generated a host egg load as a function of m from 1 to 10 and time from the start until the end of the simulated experiment b host egg load as a function of the duration of the simulation 5 tu 20 tu the default value used in the rest of the simulations and 40 time units c the functional response as a function of m for comparison the random predator model was also calculated for m 1 with the same parameters 1 effects of changing a as a function of host egg load with this second case we analysed the influence of changing a setting a constant value of m 10 and considering two functions describing a the first function was an exponential decay 8 a i a 0 a Î» with a 0 0 8 as in the previous step and for which five host attractiveness decay rates Î» were explored 1 hosts with an egg load 1 rejected 0 75 0 5 0 25 and 0 0 a constant as in 1 fig 4 a therefore if Î» 1 the wasp shows perfect discrimination rejecting all parasitized hosts the second function was a gamma distribution 9 f a a k 1 Î¸ k Î³ k e a Î¸ with parameters k shape and Î¸ scale being the mean and variance equal to k Î¸ and k Î¸ 2 respectively we used two combinations of parameters the first with k Î¸ 2 and k Î¸ 2 2 and the second with k Î¸ 4 and k Î¸ 2 2 fig 4b we described three types of responses a parasitoid egg load as a function of search efficiency a with values described by equations 8 and 9 and time from the start until the end of the simulated experiment b distribution of eggs among hosts as a function of the curve of a c the functional response as a function of a 1 effects of changing Î· we analysed the effects of decreasing efficiency of the parasitoid due to the host egg load which reduced the number of available healthy hosts three values of Î· were considered Î· 0 the hollings disk equation Î· 1 rogers model random predator or random parasite and an intermediate value at Î· 0 5 moreover we set m 10 and a 0 5 we first analysed the dynamics of host egg load as a function of time in the simulated experiments and the functional responses for the three values of Î· 3 results 3 1 effects of m 3 1 1 attacked hosts and eggs laid as a function of time increasing m from 1 to higher values did not change the total number of parasitized or non parasitized hosts overall the non parasitized hosts were depleted at the same rate fig 5 a as depletion depended only on a m 0 and not on a m i with 1 i m overall the number of non parasitized hosts decayed exponentially to zero at the same rate regardless of the value of m the number of hosts that received more eggs showed the typical increasing decreasing behaviour of compartmental models the number of highly parasitized hosts first increased and then began to decrease asymptotically to zero once the host transferring speed from that compartment to the next exceeded the input speed from previous compartments resembling a gamma distribution fig 5b the number of individuals that hosted the maximum number of eggs m and as a consequence were no longer available to the parasitoid increases asymptotically to n 0 however as m increases the asymptotic growth towards n 0 was slower fig 5c the total number of eggs in hosts instead grew almost linearly as m increased with an asymptotic final value of m n fig 5d 3 1 2 statistical distribution of eggs as a function of m the effect of m is that the eggs accumulated in the last stage of the compartmental model which produced a peak in the frequency distribution of eggs per host in m at short experimental times the curve visually resembled a poisson distribution according to rogers 1975 especially at higher values of m fig 6 a however at smaller values of m hosts with m eggs quickly accumulated as the experiment became longer hosts with m eggs began to accumulate in all simulations fig 6b c with intermediate values of m or with longer experiments the distribution of the number of eggs laid per host became bimodal fig 6b c none of these bimodal distributions resembled a poisson binomial or even a discrete beta statistical distribution 3 1 3 shape of the functional response the number of attacked hosts was always the same regardless of the value of m with all curves overlapping completely fig 7 a the difference lay in the total number of laid eggs which increased as m increased fig 7b in both curves the random predator model behaved very similarly to the random parasite model with this combination of parameters the curves overlapped completely and it was difficult to differentiate them 3 2 effects of different search efficiency distributions the test distributions chosen for a yielded different model outputs fig 4 the exponentially decaying a yielded the same number of attacked hosts fig 8 a this value in fact depended only on a 0 whose value was kept constant for all rates Î» considered in this part of the analysis fig 4a for egg loads greater than zero as Î» increased the number of eggs laid by the parasitoid also increased more specifically if Î» 1 the search efficiency decreased abruptly as a consequence the parasitoid attacked only healthy hosts and therefore did not perform superparasitism in contrast when Î» 0 for which a remained constant for all egg loads and the parasitoid behaved as in the random parasite model the number of eggs laid in already parasited hosts was higher fig 8b c as was the total number of eggs laid fig 8d in comparison the gamma shaped curves parametrized as k shape and Î¸ scale started more slowly because their value of a0 was lower fig 4b with the curve with a lower mean a k Î¸ 2 that decayed faster because it had a0 higher than that with k Î¸ 4 fig 8e the number of hosts with m 1 attacks showed that the curve with Î» 0 also had more hosts with any number of attacks because a was always the maximum with Î» 0 a was constant figs 8c 8e in the gamma shaped curve the number of hosts with m 1 and m attacks was higher with k Î¸ 4 even though the total number of attacked hosts was lower because of the parasitoid s preference for previously attacked hosts thus once some hosts had received a certain number of attacks they were repeatedly attacked until they were removed fig 8e f the total number of eggs laid also increased as Î» decreased because at lower values of Î» a decreased more slowly thus the parasitoid retained its efficiency therefore laying more eggs per host fig 8g in the case of gamma distributed a the total number of eggs laid with k Î¸ 2 was higher than that with k Î¸ 4 because it attacked more hosts repeatedly whereas with k Î¸ 4 attacks were fewer but more concentrated the distribution of hosts as a function of the number of attacks showed that the exponentially decaying models yielded a unimodally distributed number of attacks although this function decreased monotonically with Î» 0 75 it resembled a normal distribution mostly because at certain values of m the number of hosts that were attacked and moved to the next compartments was compensated by the number of hosts that came from the previous stage fig 9 a c with gamma distributed a the distribution was unimodal at lower values of k Î¸ also resembling a normal distribution but at higher values it retained a large number of unattacked hosts with a flattened distribution as a consequence the attacks with high values of k Î¸ were concentrated on the most attacked hosts so that all the hosts that had received a certain number of attacks were repeatedly attacked until they reached m the functional response curves had a similar number of attacked hosts with all Î» values and lower with higher k Î¸ values mainly because the number of attacked hosts was defined by the search efficiency at a0 fig 10 a d 3 3 effects of changing Î· the model with a different perception of parasitized and non parasitized hosts produced expected intermediate values between the hollings disk equation no update and rogers model complete update depending on the value of Î· when Î· 1 the non parasitized host pool was completely depleted at some moment whereas with Î· 1 rogers model the non parasitized host pool decreased asymptotically to zero fig 11 a the number of hosts attacked only once and presumably had received one egg increased until the non parasitized host pool was completely depleted and sharply decreased to zero when 0 Î· 1 whereas when Î· 1 it made a smooth transition from growing to also decreasing asymptotically to zero fig 11b the pattern for the removed hosts with m attacks was exactly the opposite of that for the non parasitized hosts when 0 Î· 1 increasing exponentially until the number of removed hosts reached n0 when Î· 1 the number of removed hosts increased asymptotically to n0 fig 11c the shape of the functional response was also influenced by Î· as it increased the functional response became less steep due to the increasing costs of searching for another host in a depleted environment where the healthy hosts were increasingly scarce without previous memories of their location as the duration of the experiment increased the pool of hosts offered eventually became depleted and thus the functional response became a straight line similar to type i until there were more hosts than the parasitoid could process during the entire experiment fig 12 a the functional response curve then recovered its typically asymptotically increasing shape fig 12b for the number of eggs laid the pattern was essentially the same when the duration of the experiment was 2 tu fig 12c with a straight line stage at lower host densities when the duration of the experiment was 4 tu fig 12d below certain values there is a breakpoint because under the hollings disk equation with limited host supply non attacked hosts are completely depleted eventually fig 12b d 4 discussion overall the new models showed new emerging patterns in the use of hosts that cannot be expected or explained by any existing model of predator functional response this is because the parasitoids are not predators thus the logic of resource use differs completely as the used hosts remain in the area they interfere with the experience of the parasitoids and it also differs from what happens in an infinite arena with only non parasitized hosts the models also differ from functional response models for parasitoids such as rogers 1972 random parasite equation or arditi s 1995 imperfect discriminator model as we used explicit compartmentalization and an upper limit to the number of eggs per host either by death caused by hosting too many eggs or simply by parasitoid rejection distinguishing hosts health status i e non parasitized parasitized but acceptable for oviposition parasitized but unacceptable for oviposition or killed is the main mechanism behind host depletion therefore avoiding superparasitism implies host depletion and vice versa under the random parasite model the parasitoid cannot distinguish hosts so there is no depletion and therefore superparasitism occurs however the assumption of random manipulation does not hold because parasitoids can distinguish non parasitized and parasitized hosts by detecting volatiles fatouros et al 2005 or more rapidly via probing a host with the ovipositor but not ovipositing if another parasitoid is found inside bai macauer 1990 keinan et al 2012 thus the search efficiency and handling times depend on the health status of the host the solution used in the imperfect discriminator model was to use a third parameter Î´ which is the propensity to superparasite here we used the search efficiency to model the degree of preference between different numbers of previous attacks per host and found that it can influence the results greatly handling time however is the parameter that causes the difference between rogers models the combination of parameters used in this study did not make much difference thus to avoid an overly complex analysis we did not study its effect further in this study we did not examine intrahost competition which could lead to fewer emerging hosts than the number of eggs laid usually in solitary parasitoids only one parasitoid emerges from a host that was attacked multiple times godfray 1994 according to our results the factor that influences the number of attacked hosts the most if only one parasite emerges is a0 the search efficiency for healthy hosts in some solitary parasitoids however superparasitism is an adaptive behaviour speirs hubbard 1991 thus in this case the search efficiency for previously attacked hosts will be an important factor even if only one parasitoid emerges per individual host the statistical distribution of the number of eggs per host might not resemble the preference of the parasitoid but rather an equilibrium point at which the number of hosts that enter the m stage is compensated or not by the rate at which they are removed over time the mode of the statistical distribution moves to larger numbers of attacks until it reaches m when all hosts are either unacceptable for the parasitoid or dead while rogers 1975 and other later authors griffiths 1977a 1977b daley 1989 arditi 1983 arditi glaizot 1995 fenlon et al 2009 focused on the statistical distribution of parasitoid eggs per host we developed a more flexible approach in which a compartmental model can gain more insights into the biology of the studied species finally our results show that parasitoids must deal with already parasitized hosts and in a finite arena the non parasitized host pool can be emptied simply because the parasitoid was able to find all available hosts or had some non memoryless search behaviour via some kind of learning so the non attacked host pool does not decrease asymptotically to zero if that pool is emptied the functional response takes the shape of a straight line type i functional response with high efficiency until the density is so high that the parasitoid cannot process all of the hosts available which masks the true shape of the curve at that range of host densities at high host densities the functional response curve will resemble a type ii but with a steeper increase to the asymptote an empty host pool may mask a type iii functional response if the inflexion point occurs within the density at which the host pool is emptied as previous studies have highlighted bruzzone et al 2022 the type i and taller sharper type ii functional responses are also consequences of the consumer i e the parasitoid having learnt with this compartmentalized model we were able to create a system that also captured the change in preference for host health as they receive repeated attacks although other categories can be used the basic categories can remain as non parasitized parasitized but acceptable for oviposition and removed i e unacceptable or killed killed hosts can be distinguished from unacceptable hosts in the same way as in the epidemiological sird susceptible infectious recovered deceased is used to model the number of deaths from a disease overall compartmentalization may allow the development of models using the ample literature of robust and well known models from epidemiology 4 1 conclusions we developed new models which describe host depletion when the resources hosts used are still present after being used or consumed by their natural enemies as for a host parasitoid relationship these models are extensions of rogers random parasite model of functional response in the form of compartmental models with ordinary differential equations the behaviour of those models showed emerging patterns that must be considered when studying the functional response of parasitoids under laboratory or field conditions in which hosts have low densities or numbers

24304,this paper uses the dea malmquist model to measure the static and dynamic ecological efficiency of city and describes its spatial distribution characteristics then we use social network analysis and the quadratic assignment procedure to analyze the spatial association network characteristics of ecological efficiency and its influencing factors the results show that urban eco efficiency is close being effective according to the dea method but does not fully the ecological total factor productivity of the city is increasing the spatial distribution of technical progress is consistent with total factor productivity which shows that the former is the main reason for the progress of the latter the ecological efficiency spatial association network structure is obvious and shows the characteristics of multithreading and complexity the changing trends of network density and associated relationships remain consistent in general there is an upward trend of volatility network connectedness network hierarchy and network efficiency show that the spatial association of ecological efficiency is inseparable the overall network structure has better correlation and stability but there are strict ecological efficiency spatial association network structural characteristics between cities the analysis of individual network characteristics shows that the connection between cities is getting closer but the spatial association needs strengthening the correlation coefficients of green level industrial structure government financial support and fixed asset investment are significantly positive while the influence of economic level and opening up on the ecological efficiency spatial network are not significant keywords ecological efficiency dea malmquist index spatiotemporal distribution social network analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ecological efficiency eco efficiency improvement is one of the effective ways to facilitate the transition from economic development to sustainable development it seeks to establish harmony between ecology and economy benjamin 2017 the aim of the paris climate change agreement in 2015 is to control global warming and pursue that the average temperature rises control in 1 5 c compared with pre industrialization the 2030 agenda for sustainable development identifies several social economic and ecological goals the report argued that building a sustainable city is critical to the quality of life of humans the coordinated growth of beijing tianjin and hebei province is one of the important national strategies of china while the initial breakthrough in ecological protection is a significant section of the coordinated development strategy beijing municipal environmental protection bureau 2017 since 2015 the chinese government has successively issued a series of plans for the coordinated development of beijing tianjin and hebei the government work report mentioned many times the importance of strengthening the effectiveness of ecosystem protection management and the continuous enhancement of environmental quality since the coordinated development of urban agglomerations began ecosystem protection has achieved remarkable results in 2019 the development index increased by 7 59 points over the previous year among which the green development index increased the most in 2020 the average pm2 5 concentration dropped by 51 compared with 2014 sun 2021 according to statistical data the beijing tianjin hebei region used approximately 2 of its land to feed nearly 8 of china s population ecological problems such as air quality water resources and water environment are becoming increasingly prominent and the ecological environment is in a state of overload bao 2019 therefore realizing the reasonable allocation of limited resources in beijing tianjin and hebei province helping regional eco efficiency and promoting further breakthroughs in the environmental protection of these are important and meaningful to the achievement of sustainable development eco efficiency is defined to minimize ecological damage while maximizing efficiency it is an input output ratio and the efficiency of ecological resources meeting human needs originally eco efficiency measured the effect of economic activity on the environment schaltegger and sturm 1990 subsequently international organizations also defined eco efficiency zhang et al 2020 believed the different descriptions of eco efficiency have a commonality this commonality was maximizing economic benefits by minimizing environmental pollution and resource consumption which reflects the pursuit of optimizing the input output scale of ecological resources eco efficiency is essentially the pursuit of maximum economic growth and ecological protection with less resource input and environmental costs hou and yao 2018 therefore the measurement of urban eco efficiency requires comprehensive resources and energy input ecological protection and economic growth scholars have studied eco efficiency from various perspectives and extended data envelopment analysis dea models have also been widely applied in calculating various eco efficiency liu et al 2017 mardani et al 2017 monastyrenko 2017 for example they evaluated agricultural ecological efficiency and tested the validity of the city s efficiency and energy eco efficiency in chinese provinces by dea method and slacks based measure model clemens et al 2016 guan and xu 2016 picazo tadeo et al 2011 they found that china s agricultural eco efficiency was rising but the regional differences were obvious akbar et al 2021 with the promotion of the dea model scholars began to expand it instead of simply using it dea tobit model and network dea model were used to measure and calculate coastal cities tourism ecological efficiency and the chain structure efficiency of the complex marine system liu et al 2017 sun et al 2017 scholars measured the industrial eco efficiency of china and analyzed its influencing factors zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2020b they combined other efficiency estimation and spatial analysis methods to analyze the differences in the temporal and spatial distribution of industrial eco efficiency in china and its convergence yang 2020 yang et al 2012 dimaria 2019 used the revised dea model to construct a comprehensive economic and eco efficiency indicator system to assess the sustainability of development in various countries scholars who study the problem of eco efficiency pay more attention to its spatiotemporal distribution and its convergence zhou et al 2020a analyzed the time and space evolution of provincial eco efficiency through modified three stage dea based on the slacks based measure and discussed its influencing factors yu et al 2021 studied the regional differences dynamically evolving features and convergence of the city eco efficiency there is a positive spatial correlation in the distribution of china s urban eco efficiency li and yang 2018 moreover giordano et al 2014 measured cities eco efficiency using the fuzzy evaluation of heterogeneous quantities sun and yang 2019 analyzed the spatial network structural characteristics of ecological governance and the influencing factors in recent years studies on eco efficiency have focused on the calculation of eco efficiency the analysis of spatiotemporal distribution and affecting factors there are not enough studies on the spatial correlation of urban eco efficiency the existing literature has analyzed the geographic spatial correlation characteristics of the city or the spatial linkage network structure characteristics of ecological governance through moran s index there is little literature on the features of urban eco efficiency spatial association networks and their influencing factors from the research methods the dea model relies on its advantages in considering multiple outputs and multiple inputs simultaneously and has been extensively used to evaluate eco efficiency therefore this article applies the dea malmquist index to estimate the static and dynamic urban eco efficiency of the beijing tianjin hebei and analyzes its spatial and temporal distribution characteristics then we describe the whole network feature individual network feature and spatial association network structure feature of the urban eco efficiency with the social network analysis method finally the quadratic assignment procedure method is used to analyze which factors affect the spatial association network of eco efficiency we use a variety of methods to conduct a comprehensive study on the spatial correlation characteristics of urban ecological efficiency to provide a reference for the coordinated development of cities 2 methods and materials 2 1 dea malmquist model data envelopment analysis dea is to measure the input output efficiency of characteristic decision making units dea is extensively used to evaluate the input output efficiency of characteristic decision making units dmus it is appropriate for assessing the eco efficiency of cities characterized by multi input and multi output the dea bcc model with variable returns to scale is used to calculate the static urban eco efficiency the expression is 1 min Î¸ s t i 1 k x i Î» i Î¸ x 0 i 1 k y i Î» i y 0 i 1 k Î» i 1 Î» i 0 i 1 2 k where Î¸ is technical efficiency the dmu is not effective unless Î¸ 1 the malmquist index reflects the change of production efficiency in the two periods before and after the decision making unit total factor productivity is equal to the malmquist index the malmquist index expression is 2 m x t 1 y t 1 x t y t d t x t 1 y t 1 d t x t y t d t 1 x t 1 y t 1 d t 1 x t y t 1 2 2 2 gravity model the gravity model is a spatial interaction model which is commonly used classical model for determining the spatial relationship wasserman and faust 1994 the calculation formula is 3 r ij k ij e i e j d ij 2 k ij g i g i g j d ij d ij a i a j where r i j represents the spatial association strength of urban eco efficiency between cities i and j e i e j represent the eco efficiency of i and j g i g j stand for the gdp of i and j k i j represents the adjustment coefficient this article takes urban gdp as the regulating coefficient of eco efficiency d i j is the spherical distance between cities a i a j is the per capita gdp of i and j d i j is the corrected distance between the two cities in this way the correlation matrix of urban eco efficiency is obtained and the average value of each row of the matrix is taken as the critical value if r is greater than the mean assign the value 1 otherwise it is 0 which expresses the existence and nonexistence of an association between the efficiency of cities 2 3 social network analysis this article analyzes the general network structure feature of the spatial correlation network of urban eco efficiency through social network analysis sna sna is a structural analysis for explaining the relational structure and properties of social networks i e how participants affect mutual behavior and the standard of connectivity cohesion and clustering within the entire network seiford and zhu 2005 the indicators that are always used to describe the overall network structure are network density network connectedness network hierarchy and network efficiency network density defined as the ratio of actual associations to all associations to measure closeness between individuals kim et al 2020 the network connectedness is the relationship between the connection probability and node degree between points in the network qian et al 2018 network hierarchy reveals the hierarchical structure and dominant position of the space correlation network the individual centrality analysis can reveal the location and action of each city in the network network centrality can be used to interpret the power of participants in a spatial network that is and the capability to dominate and affect other participants bai et al 2020 centrality describes an individual s communication ability and state in a network the most important being degree centrality betweenness centrality and closeness centrality evelien and ronald 2002 freeman 1978 degree centrality is the count of edges incident to a certain node it is more probable that actors with high degree centrality get information and influence others decisions zedan and miller 2017 betweenness centrality measures the number of other vertices whose shortest path must be passed through a particular node yan and ding 2009 actors with high betweenness centrality play a part of hub points in information flow in the network closeness centrality describes how much a node is not dominated by others song et al 2019 2 4 indicator selection and data sources this article selects 13 cities in hebei province beijing and tianjin for eco efficiency analysis the definition of the study area is according to the 11 2 division method because the measurement of eco efficiency involves many aspects the indicator system includes input expected output and undesirable outputs capital labor energy and water resources are input indicators urban fixed asset investment represents capital input and the sum of urban units urban private sector employees and individual employees express labor input fixed asset investment employment electricity consumption and water consumption are commonly used indicators to reflect urban capital labor energy and water resources this paper refers to the study of chen et al 2020 the electricity consumption and water supply of entire society approximates representation of the input of energy and water the gdp of a city or region stands for its economic development level to a certain extent green space is a vital part of city construction the expected output is expressed in terms of urban gdp and green space area yu et al 2021 we are talking about eco efficiency and have to consider polluting emissions including air and water pollution drawing on the research of hou and yao 2018 we select the discharge of industrial wastewater sulfur dioxide and industrial smoke powder dust as undesirable outputs this article uses the linear data transfer function to deal with the undesirable outputs which was come up by seiford and zhu 2005 suppose c i j is the polluting emissions of city j in year i m a x c i is the maximum annual pollutant emissions and let Ï m a x c i 1 then the transformed pollutant emissions output is expressed as c i j c i j Ï and c i j 1 the undesirable outputs turn into the expected outputs and then the static and dynamic eco efficiency is calculated by dea malmquist index model the data sources are the statistical yearbook of china city hebei province and related statistical bulletins of cities table 1 shows descriptive statistics of the original data 3 results this chapter explores the urban eco efficiency and spatial association characteristics of beijing tianjin hebei region we not only measure static and dynamic eco efficiency of cities but also analyze the feature of the spatial association network and its affecting factor 3 1 eco efficiency analysis 3 1 1 results of static urban eco efficiency we get the evaluation results of the static urban eco efficiency between 2010 and 2018 table 2 according to the dea valid judgment method if the efficiency value is equivalent to 1 dea is efficacious if not the result is considered ineffective most urban eco efficiency is in the effective state the mean of urban agglomerations eco efficiency is 0 976 which is close to but not reaching the dea valid state handan shijiazhuang xingtai and zhangjiakou have eco efficiency values less than one which are dea ineffective other cities reach effective status every year in terms of eco efficiency in 2018 handan shijiazhuang and zhangjiakou did not achieve dea effectiveness handan and shijiazhuang are very close to being efficacious the eco efficiency of other cities is always equal to one this implies that the input and output of the decision making units are fully efficient that is both technology and scale are effective the efficiency in terms of resource input and achievement output is also relatively ideal however the static eco efficiency value equal to 1 can only indicate that the input and output of the city in a certain period are reasonable but not explain that the urban eco efficiency has reached the optimal state moreover due to the differences in the selection of indicators for eco efficiency system construction among scholars the results of eco efficiency in different cities are different 3 1 2 results of dynamic urban eco efficiency to determine the changing tendency of eco efficiency in more depth this paper uses deap2 1 to conduct a dynamic analysis of the malmquist index for the urban ecological efficiency from 2010 to 2018 we further decompose the annual ecological efficiency of cities fig 1 the annual ecological total factor productivity tfp is 1 041 this indicates that the growth rate of tfp resin is 4 1 each year which means that the ecological total factor productivity shows a positive growth trend however the gaps in total factor productivity in different periods are conspicuous the total factor productivity of urban agglomerations decreased to varying degrees in 2011 2014 and 2015 2016 technical progress tp is similar to change in total factor productivity the average growth of pure technical efficiency pte is 0 3 every year while scale efficiency se remains unchanged the growth of tfp is caused by an average increase of 3 9 in the efficiency of technical progress every year which belongs to the type driven by technological advancement while the years with low total factor productivity are caused by the lower efficiency of technical progress 3 1 3 spatial characteristics of urban eco efficiency table 3 shows the malmquist index and decomposition of the eco efficiency for each city in terms of the individual dimensions of cities the tfp of ecology is greater than one beijing tianjin cangzhou and xingtai are over the mean while qinhuangdao langfang and handan rank in the bottom three the total factor productivity of qinhuangdao fell by 1 9 percentage points which is on a decreasing trend in the level of technological progress the ecological total factor productivity of other cities is over 1 this means that other cities have different degrees of growth except qinhuangdao the average annual growth rate of xingtai reached 20 3 which is the highest growth of urban ecological total factor productivity this is mainly because of improvements in technical progress in terms of pure technical efficiency handan and shijiazhuang declined but the downward trend is not visible while xingtai and zhangjiakou show an upward trend in terms of scale efficiency handan shijiazhuang and zhangjiakou declined showing that the ecological input and output scales of the above cities do not match the scale efficiency of tianjin and xingtai is increasing and other cities pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency remain unchanged the visual spatial distribution chart can more intuitively show the intensity of each indicator in different cities therefore we draw the spatial distribution diagram of urban eco efficiency according to table 3 fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the average level of malmquist index and its decomposition index of eco efficiency in beijing tianjin hebei region from 2010 to 2018 considering that the whole sample is small and the sample standard deviation is not large combined with the research of wang et al 2022 each decomposition index is broken into three levels through the natural breaks on the whole except for pure technical efficiency most of the other indicators are at a medium level this shows that the city s entire efficiency level should be improved especially regarding the problem of low pure technical efficiency which urgently needs to be solved the spatial distribution of technical progress and total factor productivity is highly consistent proving that the growth of cities tfp stems from technological progress technological progress is an effective way to improve the science technology productivity innovative behavior plays an irreplaceable role as the primary driving force of total factor productivity hu and kim 2022 lopez rodriguez and martinez lopez 2017 as far as cities are concerned xingtai has the best performance except for scale efficiency which is at a medium level the other indicators are at a high level the second is zhangjiakou all others are at a medium level except for the low level of technical progress indicators 3 2 spatial association network and influencing factors of urban eco efficiency the spatial relationship matrix between cities is determined through the modified gravity model and draw the graph of the urban ecological efficiency associative network in 2018 by the ucinet visualization tool fig 3 we can see that the space association network structure of the ecological efficiency is clear and it also shows the characteristics of multithreading and complexity beijing and tianjin belong to the central position of the associative network in this spatial network the urban eco efficiency is interconnected and has a strong linkage 3 2 1 analysis of whole network feature 1 network density from 2010 to 2018 the changing trend of the network density and association of the urban eco efficiency remained the same and the general trend volatility up fig 4 the network density value from 0 199 in 2010 rise to 0 218 in 2018 although it is far below the medium level of 0 5 it also reflects the closer spatial relationship of urban ecological efficiency the result is in line with the idea of the overall coordinated development of the region su and yu 2018 the network density increased prominently from 2014 the main reason is that since 2014 the common development of beijing and tianjin together with hebei province has become a grand national development strategy as one of the key breakthrough areas for the coordinated development ecological protection has received extensive attention from relevant departments governments and sectors of society 2 network association this paper uses network connectedness network hierarchy and network efficiency to comprehensively evaluate the relevance of cities spatial network fig 5 the spatial network will be more stable if the network connectedness is greater the more efficient the network the more redundant lines exist from 2010 to 2018 the network connectedness is 1 showing that cities are closely connected and have significant spatial spillover effects and the overall network structure has good relevance and stability the network hierarchy in 2018 was only 0 035 higher than that in 2010 and reached the lowest value in 2015 and 2016 the overall level is higher than the middle the spatial network has relatively strict eco efficiency spatial network structure characteristics and beijing and tianjin are located in the heart position of the urban agglomeration the network efficiency presents a fluctuating descending trend which means that the redundant links in the network of urban ecological efficiency are decreasing the network structure stability is improving 3 2 2 analysis of individual network feature figs 6 and 7 show the measurement results of the centrality of the urban eco efficiency spatial association network 1 degree centrality the city is approached the core position of the network if the degree of centrality is higher in 2010 the mean value of degree centrality was 3 54 there are four cities above this average namely tianjin beijing shijiazhuang and xingtai this shows that these cities have more connections with other cities in the urban agglomeration this is similar to the findings of sun and zhang 2021 who believed that the beijing tianjin tangshan region and shijiazhuang have a higher level of urbanization coupling coordination the mean value of degree centrality in 2018 is 4 15 cities above this average are beijing tianjin and shijiazhuang the increase in the degree centrality of the three shows that their status in the spatial network has improved regarding the in degree tianjin and beijing have the highest in degree and the out degree of each city is over zero there is a space radiation effect on the urban eco efficiency in 2010 and 2018 the standard deviations of out degrees were 1 146 and 1 077 and the standard deviations of in degrees were 2 528 and 3 431 respectively the standard deviation of the in degree is greater than that of the out degree showing that the network has a significant agglomeration effect 2 betweenness centrality the higher the degree of control the city has over the eco efficiency linkages between other cities if the betweenness centrality is higher the centrality feature of the urban eco efficiency spatial association network in 2010 2018 are shown in fig 7 we can see that tianjin ranks first among the betweenness centers in urban agglomeration tianjin has a powerful capability to control other cities ecological efficiency in the urban agglomeration which is inseparable from its industrial structure and geographical location compared with beijing tianjin has a larger environmental carrying capacity the mean betweenness centrality dropped from 3 69 in 2010 to 3 62 in 2018 showing that the control of major cities over other cities has declined the betweenness centrality is between 0 25 which is at a low level this shows that the spatial association between cities needs to be improved 3 closeness centrality a high closeness centrality stands for the city belongs to the core participant the mean closeness centrality increased from 25 29 in 2010 to 30 11 in 2018 this shows that the ties between cities are getting closer but the distribution is quite different with a difference of up to 12 times between the minimum and maximum in 2018 the cities in the urban agglomeration with the highest closeness centrality to the center were beijing and tianjin so they are able to rapidly associate with other stakeholders in the eco efficient spatial network and are in the position of a central actor this reflects the hierarchical and centralized characteristics of the spatial network among urban agglomerations fang et al 2020 beijing and tianjin have a solid economic foundation and beijing as the political center of china has a strong influence and can form a clear agglomeration effect however zhangjiakou and handan etc act as marginal actors because of geographical location and other restrictions 3 3 factors influencing the spatial association network of eco efficiency in the beijing tianjin hebei region the quadratic assignment procedure qap can solve multicollinearity problems and the results are more reliable than the estimated results obtained by parameter methods su and yu 2018 yan and ding 2009 we utilize qap to analyze the associated network structure of urban eco efficiency and its influencing factors and give optimization suggestions for spatial associated network drawing on the existing literature this article selects the economic level green level industrial structure opening up level government financial support and fixed asset investment as the influencing factors sun and yang 2019 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the logarithm of per capita gdp and the city s green area represent the economic and green levels respectively this paper use gdp to standardize raw data on industrial structure opening up level and fixed asset investment industrial structure tertiary industry gdp opening up level actual utilization of foreign capital gdp and fixed asset investment fixed asset investment gdp data are from china city statistical yearbook this article selects 2018 as the representative year uses the spatial association matrix of each city s eco efficiency as the dependent variable the economic development level different matrix green level different matrix industrial structure different matrix opening up level different matrix government financial support different matrix and fixed asset investment different matrix as independent variables we apply qap to examine the influencing factors of the urban ecological efficiency spatial network the qap correlation results are seen in table 4 the coefficient between the respective variables and the spatial network are both positive the correlation coefficient of urban green level industrial structure opening up level and fixed asset investment is clearly positive at the 1 or 5 statistical level although the coefficient of economic level and government financial support is greater than 0 it is not statistically significant this shows that area of urban green space the tertiary industry accounts for gdp the proportion of actual foreign capital utilization and the total investment in fixed assets have a strong correlation with the urban eco efficiency spatial association network the results of the qap regression analysis are shown in table 5 the correlation coefficients of green level industrial structure government financial support and fixed asset investment are conspicuously positive expanding the area of urban green space the added value of the tertiary industry increased the increase in government fiscal expenditure and fixed asset investment are beneficial to the linkage of eco efficiency between cities this further confirms the conclusion of zhang et al 2017 in terms of urban eco efficiency since the 18th cpc national congress the ecological construction has ranked as part of the five sphere integrated plan the government proposed five development concepts including coordination and greenness industrial structure adjustment policy has produced a marked effect the green development concept is deeply rooted in the hearts of people factors such as green level industrial structure government financial support and fixed asset investment have a noticeable positive effect on the association network of urban eco efficiency different from the results of the qap regression the coefficients of the level of economy and openness are not significant which means that the urban per capita gdp and actual direct use of foreign capital have an insignificant effect on the city s ecological efficiency spatial association network the impact of opening up level is not significant which is different from the conclusions of previous research zhou et al 2020a found that the structure of industry and trade openness adverse to eco efficiency foreign direct investment has an active influence on ecological efficiency this may be because of differences in research methods and research samples because urban agglomeration should further strengthen efficiency orientation and environmental constraints in attracting investment the impact of opening up level on the network of urban ecological efficiency is not significant yu et al 2021 4 discussion ecological efficiency is a key concept for a region to achieve sustainable development considering the added value of its activities and the environmental impacts in the construction of ecological efficiency index systems scholars have considered three aspects of input desirable output and undesirable output but there are differences in the selection of specific indicators yu et al 2021 selected built up areas population and fixed assets as input to represent land population and capital in the development of urban agglomeration the desirable output is gdp and green space area and the undesirable outputs are industrial wastewater discharge and sulfur dioxide discharge in the eco efficiency indicator system established by chen et al 2020 the input includes capital labor energy and water resources the desirable output is expressed in gdp and the undesirable output is the comprehensive pollution index composed of industrial wastewater industrial smoke dust and industrial sulfur dioxide emissions the 2030 agenda for sustainable development proposes to protect restore and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems it advocates the conservation and sustainable use of freshwater resources forests mountains and dryland the protection of ecosystems and the solution of water scarcity and water pollution therefore in this paper water resources and energy use are included in the input index and green space area is taken as the desired output to measure the rational use of land and the protection of green development of the ecosystem in terms of undesirable outputs the urban pollution problems of water and air are prominent and the range of industrial smoke powder dust compared with pm2 5 and other specific factors are larger considering the availability of data and drawing on existing research we select industrial wastewater discharge sulfur dioxide emission and industrial smoke powder dust emission as the representative indicators of undesirable output this paper uses a representative index from various aspects such as capital labor energy water resources land air pollution and water pollution which have persuasion in the results of eco efficiency according to the research results the static eco efficiency of most cities in the beijing tianjin hebei region reaches dea effectiveness indicating that the input factors and output scale in this period are relatively reasonable but it does not mean that urban eco efficiency has reached the optimal and needs to be further improved moreover the differences in the construction of eco efficiency index systems also lead to different eco efficiency levels among regions in terms of undesirable output from 2014 to 2018 industrial wastewater emissions sulfur dioxide emissions and industrial smoke powder dust emissions in the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration showed a downward trend industrial sulfur dioxide emissions decreased the most with a decline rate of up to 76 5 the discharge of industrial smoke powder dust and industrial wastewater decreased by 67 22 percent and 52 55 percent respectively however there is clear evidence of the threat of air pollution to human health and climate change in who s air quality guidelines it proposed to adjust the average daily target of so2 to 40 Âµg mÂ³ the average annual target of pm2 5 from 10 Âµg mÂ³ to 5 Âµg mÂ³ and adjust the average annual target of no2 and co accordingly and added the peak quarterly average target of o3 concentration although air quality in the beijing tianjin hebei region has improved it has not yet met the who s air quality requirements for example the average annual pm2 5 concentration in beijing tianjin and hebei in 2021 was 33 Âµg mÂ³ 39 Âµg mÂ³ and 38 8 Âµg mÂ³ respectively far from the standard of 5 Âµg mÂ³ cities should be based on maintaining current levels of eco efficiency continue to optimize and adjust the industrial structure boost the greening process for economic development and pay close attention to improving quality while pursuing the quantity of economic growth allocate resources more rationally to achieve optimal input and output of limited resources considering that the differences in urban eco efficiency and the growth of ecological total factor productivity primarily come from the efficiency of technological progress it is necessary to develop strategies according to local conditions we focus on implementing the innovation driven development strategy improving the city s innovation capability and efficiency and pushing urban eco efficiency improvement through technological progress it is known that urban agglomerations are closely connected and have significant spatial spillover effects and the overall network structure has good relevance and stability we can establish and improve the cities ecological governance cooperation mechanism to promote the improvement of regional eco efficiency strengthen the linkage and agglomeration effects of ecological governance in cities improving the spatial allocation efficiency of resource elements and enhancing the closeness of the eco efficiency spatial network of urban agglomeration give plays to the radiating role of central cities promote the flow of resources such as technology talent and capital among regions strengthen technological exchanges between cities continuously improve cooperation and bridge the gap in urban eco efficiency improve urban eco efficiency through a comprehensive and multi channel ecological governance system according to the qap regression results we can know that increasing the urban green level industrial structure government fiscal expenditure and fixed asset investment is beneficial to the linkage of urban eco efficiency while advancing the progress of urbanization the government should rationally plan urban land to ensure the proportion of green space with economic development we will continue to re adjust and optimize the industrial structure appropriately allocate resources to the tertiary industry and promote the industrial structure from rationalization to advancement the government should plan a reasonable fiscal expenditure plan and increase support for technological innovation to encourage people to innovate and entrepreneurship to realize the aim of saving energy and reducing pollutants discharge as soon as possible thus improving the eco efficiency of each city fixed asset investment is the principal means of social fixed asset reproduction optimizing the asset investment structure is a critical approach to enhancing resource utilization and promoting the healthy development of urban ecology 5 conclusions this article deals with the undesirable outputs in the production process by using the linear data transfer function method we use the dea malmquist index method to measure and analyze eco efficiency from a static and dynamic perspective and draw a spatial distribution map to describe the spatial distribution characteristics of eco efficiency then we use the modified gravity model to construct the spatial association matrix and combine the social network analysis method to analyze spatial association network characteristics of eco efficiency finally we test the influencing factors of the urban eco efficiency network by the qap method the main findings of the paper are as follows in terms of ecological efficiency evaluation from 2010 to 2018 the most ecological efficiency of the city was in the dea effective state and the average value was close to but not reached dea effective the ecological total factor productivity is increasing the spatial distribution of technical progress and total factor productivity is highly consistent testifying that technological progress promotes the growth of urban ecological total factor productivity from the perspective of spatial association network characteristics the spatial association network structure of urban ecological efficiency is distinct and shows the characteristics of multithreading and complexity the changing trend of the network density and correlation relationship is similar and has a fluctuating upward trend the cities are closely connected and have significant spatial spillover effects the overall network structure has good correlation and stability and there are relatively strict eco efficiency spatial network structural characteristics between cities the connection between cities is getting closer and closer but the spatial association between them needs to be improved from the qap analysis results urban green space tertiary industry proportion foreign capital utilized and investment in fixed assets have a stronger correlation with the urban eco efficiency spatial association network the expansion of urban green space increase in tertiary industry proportion and government fiscal expenditure and fixed asset investment is beneficial to the linkage of the urban eco efficiency the effect of urban gdp per capita and foreign capital actually utilized on the spatial network of urban eco efficiency is not significant evaluating the static and dynamic eco efficiency of cities is helpful to understand the state and changing trend of urban eco efficiency and analyze the reasons for the ineffectiveness of urban eco efficiency it is convenient to take targeted measures to improve urban eco efficiency from both input and output the analysis of spatial network structure of urban eco efficiency and its influencing factors contribute to grasping the characteristics of urban individuals and urban agglomerations highlight the role of central cities strengthen the interconnection and interaction between peripheral areas and areas with high eco efficiency and drive the improvement of urban eco efficiency by fan out from point to area there are some limitations in this paper first the latest data we use is up to 2018 which can be supplemented to the latest year in the future secondly considering the research purpose and data availability only some representative indicators have been selected for the construction of an eco efficiency indicator system which can be further improved in the future for example co2 and other gas emissions pm2 5 soil pollution and other factors can be added credit authorship contribution statement gongli

24304,this paper uses the dea malmquist model to measure the static and dynamic ecological efficiency of city and describes its spatial distribution characteristics then we use social network analysis and the quadratic assignment procedure to analyze the spatial association network characteristics of ecological efficiency and its influencing factors the results show that urban eco efficiency is close being effective according to the dea method but does not fully the ecological total factor productivity of the city is increasing the spatial distribution of technical progress is consistent with total factor productivity which shows that the former is the main reason for the progress of the latter the ecological efficiency spatial association network structure is obvious and shows the characteristics of multithreading and complexity the changing trends of network density and associated relationships remain consistent in general there is an upward trend of volatility network connectedness network hierarchy and network efficiency show that the spatial association of ecological efficiency is inseparable the overall network structure has better correlation and stability but there are strict ecological efficiency spatial association network structural characteristics between cities the analysis of individual network characteristics shows that the connection between cities is getting closer but the spatial association needs strengthening the correlation coefficients of green level industrial structure government financial support and fixed asset investment are significantly positive while the influence of economic level and opening up on the ecological efficiency spatial network are not significant keywords ecological efficiency dea malmquist index spatiotemporal distribution social network analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ecological efficiency eco efficiency improvement is one of the effective ways to facilitate the transition from economic development to sustainable development it seeks to establish harmony between ecology and economy benjamin 2017 the aim of the paris climate change agreement in 2015 is to control global warming and pursue that the average temperature rises control in 1 5 c compared with pre industrialization the 2030 agenda for sustainable development identifies several social economic and ecological goals the report argued that building a sustainable city is critical to the quality of life of humans the coordinated growth of beijing tianjin and hebei province is one of the important national strategies of china while the initial breakthrough in ecological protection is a significant section of the coordinated development strategy beijing municipal environmental protection bureau 2017 since 2015 the chinese government has successively issued a series of plans for the coordinated development of beijing tianjin and hebei the government work report mentioned many times the importance of strengthening the effectiveness of ecosystem protection management and the continuous enhancement of environmental quality since the coordinated development of urban agglomerations began ecosystem protection has achieved remarkable results in 2019 the development index increased by 7 59 points over the previous year among which the green development index increased the most in 2020 the average pm2 5 concentration dropped by 51 compared with 2014 sun 2021 according to statistical data the beijing tianjin hebei region used approximately 2 of its land to feed nearly 8 of china s population ecological problems such as air quality water resources and water environment are becoming increasingly prominent and the ecological environment is in a state of overload bao 2019 therefore realizing the reasonable allocation of limited resources in beijing tianjin and hebei province helping regional eco efficiency and promoting further breakthroughs in the environmental protection of these are important and meaningful to the achievement of sustainable development eco efficiency is defined to minimize ecological damage while maximizing efficiency it is an input output ratio and the efficiency of ecological resources meeting human needs originally eco efficiency measured the effect of economic activity on the environment schaltegger and sturm 1990 subsequently international organizations also defined eco efficiency zhang et al 2020 believed the different descriptions of eco efficiency have a commonality this commonality was maximizing economic benefits by minimizing environmental pollution and resource consumption which reflects the pursuit of optimizing the input output scale of ecological resources eco efficiency is essentially the pursuit of maximum economic growth and ecological protection with less resource input and environmental costs hou and yao 2018 therefore the measurement of urban eco efficiency requires comprehensive resources and energy input ecological protection and economic growth scholars have studied eco efficiency from various perspectives and extended data envelopment analysis dea models have also been widely applied in calculating various eco efficiency liu et al 2017 mardani et al 2017 monastyrenko 2017 for example they evaluated agricultural ecological efficiency and tested the validity of the city s efficiency and energy eco efficiency in chinese provinces by dea method and slacks based measure model clemens et al 2016 guan and xu 2016 picazo tadeo et al 2011 they found that china s agricultural eco efficiency was rising but the regional differences were obvious akbar et al 2021 with the promotion of the dea model scholars began to expand it instead of simply using it dea tobit model and network dea model were used to measure and calculate coastal cities tourism ecological efficiency and the chain structure efficiency of the complex marine system liu et al 2017 sun et al 2017 scholars measured the industrial eco efficiency of china and analyzed its influencing factors zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2020b they combined other efficiency estimation and spatial analysis methods to analyze the differences in the temporal and spatial distribution of industrial eco efficiency in china and its convergence yang 2020 yang et al 2012 dimaria 2019 used the revised dea model to construct a comprehensive economic and eco efficiency indicator system to assess the sustainability of development in various countries scholars who study the problem of eco efficiency pay more attention to its spatiotemporal distribution and its convergence zhou et al 2020a analyzed the time and space evolution of provincial eco efficiency through modified three stage dea based on the slacks based measure and discussed its influencing factors yu et al 2021 studied the regional differences dynamically evolving features and convergence of the city eco efficiency there is a positive spatial correlation in the distribution of china s urban eco efficiency li and yang 2018 moreover giordano et al 2014 measured cities eco efficiency using the fuzzy evaluation of heterogeneous quantities sun and yang 2019 analyzed the spatial network structural characteristics of ecological governance and the influencing factors in recent years studies on eco efficiency have focused on the calculation of eco efficiency the analysis of spatiotemporal distribution and affecting factors there are not enough studies on the spatial correlation of urban eco efficiency the existing literature has analyzed the geographic spatial correlation characteristics of the city or the spatial linkage network structure characteristics of ecological governance through moran s index there is little literature on the features of urban eco efficiency spatial association networks and their influencing factors from the research methods the dea model relies on its advantages in considering multiple outputs and multiple inputs simultaneously and has been extensively used to evaluate eco efficiency therefore this article applies the dea malmquist index to estimate the static and dynamic urban eco efficiency of the beijing tianjin hebei and analyzes its spatial and temporal distribution characteristics then we describe the whole network feature individual network feature and spatial association network structure feature of the urban eco efficiency with the social network analysis method finally the quadratic assignment procedure method is used to analyze which factors affect the spatial association network of eco efficiency we use a variety of methods to conduct a comprehensive study on the spatial correlation characteristics of urban ecological efficiency to provide a reference for the coordinated development of cities 2 methods and materials 2 1 dea malmquist model data envelopment analysis dea is to measure the input output efficiency of characteristic decision making units dea is extensively used to evaluate the input output efficiency of characteristic decision making units dmus it is appropriate for assessing the eco efficiency of cities characterized by multi input and multi output the dea bcc model with variable returns to scale is used to calculate the static urban eco efficiency the expression is 1 min Î¸ s t i 1 k x i Î» i Î¸ x 0 i 1 k y i Î» i y 0 i 1 k Î» i 1 Î» i 0 i 1 2 k where Î¸ is technical efficiency the dmu is not effective unless Î¸ 1 the malmquist index reflects the change of production efficiency in the two periods before and after the decision making unit total factor productivity is equal to the malmquist index the malmquist index expression is 2 m x t 1 y t 1 x t y t d t x t 1 y t 1 d t x t y t d t 1 x t 1 y t 1 d t 1 x t y t 1 2 2 2 gravity model the gravity model is a spatial interaction model which is commonly used classical model for determining the spatial relationship wasserman and faust 1994 the calculation formula is 3 r ij k ij e i e j d ij 2 k ij g i g i g j d ij d ij a i a j where r i j represents the spatial association strength of urban eco efficiency between cities i and j e i e j represent the eco efficiency of i and j g i g j stand for the gdp of i and j k i j represents the adjustment coefficient this article takes urban gdp as the regulating coefficient of eco efficiency d i j is the spherical distance between cities a i a j is the per capita gdp of i and j d i j is the corrected distance between the two cities in this way the correlation matrix of urban eco efficiency is obtained and the average value of each row of the matrix is taken as the critical value if r is greater than the mean assign the value 1 otherwise it is 0 which expresses the existence and nonexistence of an association between the efficiency of cities 2 3 social network analysis this article analyzes the general network structure feature of the spatial correlation network of urban eco efficiency through social network analysis sna sna is a structural analysis for explaining the relational structure and properties of social networks i e how participants affect mutual behavior and the standard of connectivity cohesion and clustering within the entire network seiford and zhu 2005 the indicators that are always used to describe the overall network structure are network density network connectedness network hierarchy and network efficiency network density defined as the ratio of actual associations to all associations to measure closeness between individuals kim et al 2020 the network connectedness is the relationship between the connection probability and node degree between points in the network qian et al 2018 network hierarchy reveals the hierarchical structure and dominant position of the space correlation network the individual centrality analysis can reveal the location and action of each city in the network network centrality can be used to interpret the power of participants in a spatial network that is and the capability to dominate and affect other participants bai et al 2020 centrality describes an individual s communication ability and state in a network the most important being degree centrality betweenness centrality and closeness centrality evelien and ronald 2002 freeman 1978 degree centrality is the count of edges incident to a certain node it is more probable that actors with high degree centrality get information and influence others decisions zedan and miller 2017 betweenness centrality measures the number of other vertices whose shortest path must be passed through a particular node yan and ding 2009 actors with high betweenness centrality play a part of hub points in information flow in the network closeness centrality describes how much a node is not dominated by others song et al 2019 2 4 indicator selection and data sources this article selects 13 cities in hebei province beijing and tianjin for eco efficiency analysis the definition of the study area is according to the 11 2 division method because the measurement of eco efficiency involves many aspects the indicator system includes input expected output and undesirable outputs capital labor energy and water resources are input indicators urban fixed asset investment represents capital input and the sum of urban units urban private sector employees and individual employees express labor input fixed asset investment employment electricity consumption and water consumption are commonly used indicators to reflect urban capital labor energy and water resources this paper refers to the study of chen et al 2020 the electricity consumption and water supply of entire society approximates representation of the input of energy and water the gdp of a city or region stands for its economic development level to a certain extent green space is a vital part of city construction the expected output is expressed in terms of urban gdp and green space area yu et al 2021 we are talking about eco efficiency and have to consider polluting emissions including air and water pollution drawing on the research of hou and yao 2018 we select the discharge of industrial wastewater sulfur dioxide and industrial smoke powder dust as undesirable outputs this article uses the linear data transfer function to deal with the undesirable outputs which was come up by seiford and zhu 2005 suppose c i j is the polluting emissions of city j in year i m a x c i is the maximum annual pollutant emissions and let Ï m a x c i 1 then the transformed pollutant emissions output is expressed as c i j c i j Ï and c i j 1 the undesirable outputs turn into the expected outputs and then the static and dynamic eco efficiency is calculated by dea malmquist index model the data sources are the statistical yearbook of china city hebei province and related statistical bulletins of cities table 1 shows descriptive statistics of the original data 3 results this chapter explores the urban eco efficiency and spatial association characteristics of beijing tianjin hebei region we not only measure static and dynamic eco efficiency of cities but also analyze the feature of the spatial association network and its affecting factor 3 1 eco efficiency analysis 3 1 1 results of static urban eco efficiency we get the evaluation results of the static urban eco efficiency between 2010 and 2018 table 2 according to the dea valid judgment method if the efficiency value is equivalent to 1 dea is efficacious if not the result is considered ineffective most urban eco efficiency is in the effective state the mean of urban agglomerations eco efficiency is 0 976 which is close to but not reaching the dea valid state handan shijiazhuang xingtai and zhangjiakou have eco efficiency values less than one which are dea ineffective other cities reach effective status every year in terms of eco efficiency in 2018 handan shijiazhuang and zhangjiakou did not achieve dea effectiveness handan and shijiazhuang are very close to being efficacious the eco efficiency of other cities is always equal to one this implies that the input and output of the decision making units are fully efficient that is both technology and scale are effective the efficiency in terms of resource input and achievement output is also relatively ideal however the static eco efficiency value equal to 1 can only indicate that the input and output of the city in a certain period are reasonable but not explain that the urban eco efficiency has reached the optimal state moreover due to the differences in the selection of indicators for eco efficiency system construction among scholars the results of eco efficiency in different cities are different 3 1 2 results of dynamic urban eco efficiency to determine the changing tendency of eco efficiency in more depth this paper uses deap2 1 to conduct a dynamic analysis of the malmquist index for the urban ecological efficiency from 2010 to 2018 we further decompose the annual ecological efficiency of cities fig 1 the annual ecological total factor productivity tfp is 1 041 this indicates that the growth rate of tfp resin is 4 1 each year which means that the ecological total factor productivity shows a positive growth trend however the gaps in total factor productivity in different periods are conspicuous the total factor productivity of urban agglomerations decreased to varying degrees in 2011 2014 and 2015 2016 technical progress tp is similar to change in total factor productivity the average growth of pure technical efficiency pte is 0 3 every year while scale efficiency se remains unchanged the growth of tfp is caused by an average increase of 3 9 in the efficiency of technical progress every year which belongs to the type driven by technological advancement while the years with low total factor productivity are caused by the lower efficiency of technical progress 3 1 3 spatial characteristics of urban eco efficiency table 3 shows the malmquist index and decomposition of the eco efficiency for each city in terms of the individual dimensions of cities the tfp of ecology is greater than one beijing tianjin cangzhou and xingtai are over the mean while qinhuangdao langfang and handan rank in the bottom three the total factor productivity of qinhuangdao fell by 1 9 percentage points which is on a decreasing trend in the level of technological progress the ecological total factor productivity of other cities is over 1 this means that other cities have different degrees of growth except qinhuangdao the average annual growth rate of xingtai reached 20 3 which is the highest growth of urban ecological total factor productivity this is mainly because of improvements in technical progress in terms of pure technical efficiency handan and shijiazhuang declined but the downward trend is not visible while xingtai and zhangjiakou show an upward trend in terms of scale efficiency handan shijiazhuang and zhangjiakou declined showing that the ecological input and output scales of the above cities do not match the scale efficiency of tianjin and xingtai is increasing and other cities pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency remain unchanged the visual spatial distribution chart can more intuitively show the intensity of each indicator in different cities therefore we draw the spatial distribution diagram of urban eco efficiency according to table 3 fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of the average level of malmquist index and its decomposition index of eco efficiency in beijing tianjin hebei region from 2010 to 2018 considering that the whole sample is small and the sample standard deviation is not large combined with the research of wang et al 2022 each decomposition index is broken into three levels through the natural breaks on the whole except for pure technical efficiency most of the other indicators are at a medium level this shows that the city s entire efficiency level should be improved especially regarding the problem of low pure technical efficiency which urgently needs to be solved the spatial distribution of technical progress and total factor productivity is highly consistent proving that the growth of cities tfp stems from technological progress technological progress is an effective way to improve the science technology productivity innovative behavior plays an irreplaceable role as the primary driving force of total factor productivity hu and kim 2022 lopez rodriguez and martinez lopez 2017 as far as cities are concerned xingtai has the best performance except for scale efficiency which is at a medium level the other indicators are at a high level the second is zhangjiakou all others are at a medium level except for the low level of technical progress indicators 3 2 spatial association network and influencing factors of urban eco efficiency the spatial relationship matrix between cities is determined through the modified gravity model and draw the graph of the urban ecological efficiency associative network in 2018 by the ucinet visualization tool fig 3 we can see that the space association network structure of the ecological efficiency is clear and it also shows the characteristics of multithreading and complexity beijing and tianjin belong to the central position of the associative network in this spatial network the urban eco efficiency is interconnected and has a strong linkage 3 2 1 analysis of whole network feature 1 network density from 2010 to 2018 the changing trend of the network density and association of the urban eco efficiency remained the same and the general trend volatility up fig 4 the network density value from 0 199 in 2010 rise to 0 218 in 2018 although it is far below the medium level of 0 5 it also reflects the closer spatial relationship of urban ecological efficiency the result is in line with the idea of the overall coordinated development of the region su and yu 2018 the network density increased prominently from 2014 the main reason is that since 2014 the common development of beijing and tianjin together with hebei province has become a grand national development strategy as one of the key breakthrough areas for the coordinated development ecological protection has received extensive attention from relevant departments governments and sectors of society 2 network association this paper uses network connectedness network hierarchy and network efficiency to comprehensively evaluate the relevance of cities spatial network fig 5 the spatial network will be more stable if the network connectedness is greater the more efficient the network the more redundant lines exist from 2010 to 2018 the network connectedness is 1 showing that cities are closely connected and have significant spatial spillover effects and the overall network structure has good relevance and stability the network hierarchy in 2018 was only 0 035 higher than that in 2010 and reached the lowest value in 2015 and 2016 the overall level is higher than the middle the spatial network has relatively strict eco efficiency spatial network structure characteristics and beijing and tianjin are located in the heart position of the urban agglomeration the network efficiency presents a fluctuating descending trend which means that the redundant links in the network of urban ecological efficiency are decreasing the network structure stability is improving 3 2 2 analysis of individual network feature figs 6 and 7 show the measurement results of the centrality of the urban eco efficiency spatial association network 1 degree centrality the city is approached the core position of the network if the degree of centrality is higher in 2010 the mean value of degree centrality was 3 54 there are four cities above this average namely tianjin beijing shijiazhuang and xingtai this shows that these cities have more connections with other cities in the urban agglomeration this is similar to the findings of sun and zhang 2021 who believed that the beijing tianjin tangshan region and shijiazhuang have a higher level of urbanization coupling coordination the mean value of degree centrality in 2018 is 4 15 cities above this average are beijing tianjin and shijiazhuang the increase in the degree centrality of the three shows that their status in the spatial network has improved regarding the in degree tianjin and beijing have the highest in degree and the out degree of each city is over zero there is a space radiation effect on the urban eco efficiency in 2010 and 2018 the standard deviations of out degrees were 1 146 and 1 077 and the standard deviations of in degrees were 2 528 and 3 431 respectively the standard deviation of the in degree is greater than that of the out degree showing that the network has a significant agglomeration effect 2 betweenness centrality the higher the degree of control the city has over the eco efficiency linkages between other cities if the betweenness centrality is higher the centrality feature of the urban eco efficiency spatial association network in 2010 2018 are shown in fig 7 we can see that tianjin ranks first among the betweenness centers in urban agglomeration tianjin has a powerful capability to control other cities ecological efficiency in the urban agglomeration which is inseparable from its industrial structure and geographical location compared with beijing tianjin has a larger environmental carrying capacity the mean betweenness centrality dropped from 3 69 in 2010 to 3 62 in 2018 showing that the control of major cities over other cities has declined the betweenness centrality is between 0 25 which is at a low level this shows that the spatial association between cities needs to be improved 3 closeness centrality a high closeness centrality stands for the city belongs to the core participant the mean closeness centrality increased from 25 29 in 2010 to 30 11 in 2018 this shows that the ties between cities are getting closer but the distribution is quite different with a difference of up to 12 times between the minimum and maximum in 2018 the cities in the urban agglomeration with the highest closeness centrality to the center were beijing and tianjin so they are able to rapidly associate with other stakeholders in the eco efficient spatial network and are in the position of a central actor this reflects the hierarchical and centralized characteristics of the spatial network among urban agglomerations fang et al 2020 beijing and tianjin have a solid economic foundation and beijing as the political center of china has a strong influence and can form a clear agglomeration effect however zhangjiakou and handan etc act as marginal actors because of geographical location and other restrictions 3 3 factors influencing the spatial association network of eco efficiency in the beijing tianjin hebei region the quadratic assignment procedure qap can solve multicollinearity problems and the results are more reliable than the estimated results obtained by parameter methods su and yu 2018 yan and ding 2009 we utilize qap to analyze the associated network structure of urban eco efficiency and its influencing factors and give optimization suggestions for spatial associated network drawing on the existing literature this article selects the economic level green level industrial structure opening up level government financial support and fixed asset investment as the influencing factors sun and yang 2019 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the logarithm of per capita gdp and the city s green area represent the economic and green levels respectively this paper use gdp to standardize raw data on industrial structure opening up level and fixed asset investment industrial structure tertiary industry gdp opening up level actual utilization of foreign capital gdp and fixed asset investment fixed asset investment gdp data are from china city statistical yearbook this article selects 2018 as the representative year uses the spatial association matrix of each city s eco efficiency as the dependent variable the economic development level different matrix green level different matrix industrial structure different matrix opening up level different matrix government financial support different matrix and fixed asset investment different matrix as independent variables we apply qap to examine the influencing factors of the urban ecological efficiency spatial network the qap correlation results are seen in table 4 the coefficient between the respective variables and the spatial network are both positive the correlation coefficient of urban green level industrial structure opening up level and fixed asset investment is clearly positive at the 1 or 5 statistical level although the coefficient of economic level and government financial support is greater than 0 it is not statistically significant this shows that area of urban green space the tertiary industry accounts for gdp the proportion of actual foreign capital utilization and the total investment in fixed assets have a strong correlation with the urban eco efficiency spatial association network the results of the qap regression analysis are shown in table 5 the correlation coefficients of green level industrial structure government financial support and fixed asset investment are conspicuously positive expanding the area of urban green space the added value of the tertiary industry increased the increase in government fiscal expenditure and fixed asset investment are beneficial to the linkage of eco efficiency between cities this further confirms the conclusion of zhang et al 2017 in terms of urban eco efficiency since the 18th cpc national congress the ecological construction has ranked as part of the five sphere integrated plan the government proposed five development concepts including coordination and greenness industrial structure adjustment policy has produced a marked effect the green development concept is deeply rooted in the hearts of people factors such as green level industrial structure government financial support and fixed asset investment have a noticeable positive effect on the association network of urban eco efficiency different from the results of the qap regression the coefficients of the level of economy and openness are not significant which means that the urban per capita gdp and actual direct use of foreign capital have an insignificant effect on the city s ecological efficiency spatial association network the impact of opening up level is not significant which is different from the conclusions of previous research zhou et al 2020a found that the structure of industry and trade openness adverse to eco efficiency foreign direct investment has an active influence on ecological efficiency this may be because of differences in research methods and research samples because urban agglomeration should further strengthen efficiency orientation and environmental constraints in attracting investment the impact of opening up level on the network of urban ecological efficiency is not significant yu et al 2021 4 discussion ecological efficiency is a key concept for a region to achieve sustainable development considering the added value of its activities and the environmental impacts in the construction of ecological efficiency index systems scholars have considered three aspects of input desirable output and undesirable output but there are differences in the selection of specific indicators yu et al 2021 selected built up areas population and fixed assets as input to represent land population and capital in the development of urban agglomeration the desirable output is gdp and green space area and the undesirable outputs are industrial wastewater discharge and sulfur dioxide discharge in the eco efficiency indicator system established by chen et al 2020 the input includes capital labor energy and water resources the desirable output is expressed in gdp and the undesirable output is the comprehensive pollution index composed of industrial wastewater industrial smoke dust and industrial sulfur dioxide emissions the 2030 agenda for sustainable development proposes to protect restore and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems it advocates the conservation and sustainable use of freshwater resources forests mountains and dryland the protection of ecosystems and the solution of water scarcity and water pollution therefore in this paper water resources and energy use are included in the input index and green space area is taken as the desired output to measure the rational use of land and the protection of green development of the ecosystem in terms of undesirable outputs the urban pollution problems of water and air are prominent and the range of industrial smoke powder dust compared with pm2 5 and other specific factors are larger considering the availability of data and drawing on existing research we select industrial wastewater discharge sulfur dioxide emission and industrial smoke powder dust emission as the representative indicators of undesirable output this paper uses a representative index from various aspects such as capital labor energy water resources land air pollution and water pollution which have persuasion in the results of eco efficiency according to the research results the static eco efficiency of most cities in the beijing tianjin hebei region reaches dea effectiveness indicating that the input factors and output scale in this period are relatively reasonable but it does not mean that urban eco efficiency has reached the optimal and needs to be further improved moreover the differences in the construction of eco efficiency index systems also lead to different eco efficiency levels among regions in terms of undesirable output from 2014 to 2018 industrial wastewater emissions sulfur dioxide emissions and industrial smoke powder dust emissions in the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration showed a downward trend industrial sulfur dioxide emissions decreased the most with a decline rate of up to 76 5 the discharge of industrial smoke powder dust and industrial wastewater decreased by 67 22 percent and 52 55 percent respectively however there is clear evidence of the threat of air pollution to human health and climate change in who s air quality guidelines it proposed to adjust the average daily target of so2 to 40 Âµg mÂ³ the average annual target of pm2 5 from 10 Âµg mÂ³ to 5 Âµg mÂ³ and adjust the average annual target of no2 and co accordingly and added the peak quarterly average target of o3 concentration although air quality in the beijing tianjin hebei region has improved it has not yet met the who s air quality requirements for example the average annual pm2 5 concentration in beijing tianjin and hebei in 2021 was 33 Âµg mÂ³ 39 Âµg mÂ³ and 38 8 Âµg mÂ³ respectively far from the standard of 5 Âµg mÂ³ cities should be based on maintaining current levels of eco efficiency continue to optimize and adjust the industrial structure boost the greening process for economic development and pay close attention to improving quality while pursuing the quantity of economic growth allocate resources more rationally to achieve optimal input and output of limited resources considering that the differences in urban eco efficiency and the growth of ecological total factor productivity primarily come from the efficiency of technological progress it is necessary to develop strategies according to local conditions we focus on implementing the innovation driven development strategy improving the city s innovation capability and efficiency and pushing urban eco efficiency improvement through technological progress it is known that urban agglomerations are closely connected and have significant spatial spillover effects and the overall network structure has good relevance and stability we can establish and improve the cities ecological governance cooperation mechanism to promote the improvement of regional eco efficiency strengthen the linkage and agglomeration effects of ecological governance in cities improving the spatial allocation efficiency of resource elements and enhancing the closeness of the eco efficiency spatial network of urban agglomeration give plays to the radiating role of central cities promote the flow of resources such as technology talent and capital among regions strengthen technological exchanges between cities continuously improve cooperation and bridge the gap in urban eco efficiency improve urban eco efficiency through a comprehensive and multi channel ecological governance system according to the qap regression results we can know that increasing the urban green level industrial structure government fiscal expenditure and fixed asset investment is beneficial to the linkage of urban eco efficiency while advancing the progress of urbanization the government should rationally plan urban land to ensure the proportion of green space with economic development we will continue to re adjust and optimize the industrial structure appropriately allocate resources to the tertiary industry and promote the industrial structure from rationalization to advancement the government should plan a reasonable fiscal expenditure plan and increase support for technological innovation to encourage people to innovate and entrepreneurship to realize the aim of saving energy and reducing pollutants discharge as soon as possible thus improving the eco efficiency of each city fixed asset investment is the principal means of social fixed asset reproduction optimizing the asset investment structure is a critical approach to enhancing resource utilization and promoting the healthy development of urban ecology 5 conclusions this article deals with the undesirable outputs in the production process by using the linear data transfer function method we use the dea malmquist index method to measure and analyze eco efficiency from a static and dynamic perspective and draw a spatial distribution map to describe the spatial distribution characteristics of eco efficiency then we use the modified gravity model to construct the spatial association matrix and combine the social network analysis method to analyze spatial association network characteristics of eco efficiency finally we test the influencing factors of the urban eco efficiency network by the qap method the main findings of the paper are as follows in terms of ecological efficiency evaluation from 2010 to 2018 the most ecological efficiency of the city was in the dea effective state and the average value was close to but not reached dea effective the ecological total factor productivity is increasing the spatial distribution of technical progress and total factor productivity is highly consistent testifying that technological progress promotes the growth of urban ecological total factor productivity from the perspective of spatial association network characteristics the spatial association network structure of urban ecological efficiency is distinct and shows the characteristics of multithreading and complexity the changing trend of the network density and correlation relationship is similar and has a fluctuating upward trend the cities are closely connected and have significant spatial spillover effects the overall network structure has good correlation and stability and there are relatively strict eco efficiency spatial network structural characteristics between cities the connection between cities is getting closer and closer but the spatial association between them needs to be improved from the qap analysis results urban green space tertiary industry proportion foreign capital utilized and investment in fixed assets have a stronger correlation with the urban eco efficiency spatial association network the expansion of urban green space increase in tertiary industry proportion and government fiscal expenditure and fixed asset investment is beneficial to the linkage of the urban eco efficiency the effect of urban gdp per capita and foreign capital actually utilized on the spatial network of urban eco efficiency is not significant evaluating the static and dynamic eco efficiency of cities is helpful to understand the state and changing trend of urban eco efficiency and analyze the reasons for the ineffectiveness of urban eco efficiency it is convenient to take targeted measures to improve urban eco efficiency from both input and output the analysis of spatial network structure of urban eco efficiency and its influencing factors contribute to grasping the characteristics of urban individuals and urban agglomerations highlight the role of central cities strengthen the interconnection and interaction between peripheral areas and areas with high eco efficiency and drive the improvement of urban eco efficiency by fan out from point to area there are some limitations in this paper first the latest data we use is up to 2018 which can be supplemented to the latest year in the future secondly considering the research purpose and data availability only some representative indicators have been selected for the construction of an eco efficiency indicator system which can be further improved in the future for example co2 and other gas emissions pm2 5 soil pollution and other factors can be added credit authorship contribution statement gongli
