2810,the deuterium excess is a function of the isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen in water traditionally the d excess is used worldwide to constrain the moisture sources of precipitation as it mainly depends on the relative humidity and surface sea temperature at the evaporative sources that control diffusion of the water molecules across the density gradient a case in point is represented by precipitation deriving from vapor originating over the eastern mediterranean sea characterized by the higher d excess values 22 compared to the global average d excess in precipitation of 10 accordingly d excess values of 14 found in precipitation across the western mediterranean are generally interpreted as the result of mixing of atlantic and mediterranean air masses nevertheless several studies proved the d excess values of precipitation evolves during transport of vapor and changes depending on local processes e g sub cloud evaporation of raindrops continental moisture recycling seeder feeder mechanism thus compromising the reliability of d excess as a proxy of vapor source regions with the aim to investigate the pattern of d excess in precipitation at higher spatial and temporal resolution and to evaluate its reliability for tracing the moisture source in the western mediterranean in this work we present the results of a study performed in the apuan alps tuscany italy one of the rainiest areas in italy 19 single rain events were collected from 2020 to 2021 at two sites placed at different altitudes furthermore monthly precipitations were collected at five sites at different elevations over different time intervals from 2019 to 2021 event based and monthly local meteoric water lines were computed at each site indicating droplets evaporation beneath the clouds especially at lower altitude sites d excess seasonally and spatially varied with higher values registered at higher altitudes in winter and autumn and lower values at lower altitudes in spring and summer large differences in d excess were found among sites placed at different altitudes and these differences ranged both at monthly and event scales mean and weighted mean d excess vertical gradients of 0 73 100 m r2 0 92 and 0 51 100 m r2 0 95 respectively were computed using 9 months in which monthly samples were collected at all five sites this positive relationship between altitude and d excess in precipitation is consistent with a process like sub cloud evaporation that appears to be the most important process controlling the d excess spatial variability in the mountainous areas these findings evidence the importance of local processes acting on the d excess and downsize the reliability of this parameter in tracing moisture sources in this area conversely the d excess vertical gradient combined with the δ18o vertical gradient i e altitude effect could be used to identify the recharge areas of groundwater keywords deuterium excess precipitation mediterranean pseudo altitude effect sub cloud evaporation data availability all the data are available in the supplementary materials 1 introduction the isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen in meteoric water is extensively used to characterize the hydrologic cycle processes worldwide the deuterium excess d excess is a second order isotope parameter that is function of the isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen in water as defined by the dansgaard s equation d excess δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 the term d excess is therefore used to express the excess of deuterium compared to heavy oxygen 18o in vapor that occurs when water molecules formed by different hydrogen and oxygen isotopes also known as isotopologues diffuse across a density gradient during evaporation processes h2h16o isotopologue has a lower weight than water molecules composed of heavy oxygen 18o that results in a more diffusive fractionation of 18o during evaporation since diffusion is accompanied by kinetic fractionation the larger the diffusion the higher the d excess in the vapor above the evaporating surface traditionally the d excess is used worldwide to constrain the moisture sources of precipitation celle jeanton et al 2001 cui et al 2009 gat and carmi 1970 jouzel et al 2013 juhlke et al 2019 as it mainly depends on relative humidity rh and surface sea temperature sst at the evaporative sources bonne et al 2019 merlivat and jouzel 1979 pfahl and sodemann 2014 uemura et al 2008 that control diffusion of the water molecules at the water air interface this also explains why d excess is characterized by a large seasonality juhlke et al 2019 masiol et al 2021 natali et al 2021 with higher values in winter precipitation when rh over oceans is low and lower values in summer when atmosphere is wetter the lower the rh the stronger the kinetic fractionation during evaporation leading to higher d excess in the vapor precipitation along the global meteoric water line craig 1961 rozanski et al 1993 has d excess of ca 10 which correspond to a theoretical process under rh and sst of 85 and 25 c respectively clark and fritz 1997 a case in point is precipitation deriving from vapor originating over the eastern mediterranean sea em characterized by the highest d excess values 22 gat and carmi 1970 compared to the global mean d excess in precipitation of 10 due to the higher sst and lower rh in this sector of mediterranean sea accordingly d excess values of 14 found in precipitation across the western mediterranean wm are generally interpreted as the result of mixing of atlantic with d excess values of ca 10 and mediterranean air masses casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2001 cruz san et al 1992 natali et al 2021 nevertheless several studies proved that d excess evolves during transport of vapor to the precipitation site and changes depending on local processes e g froehlich et al 2001 gat and airey 2006 wang et al 2016 after the condensation of vapor in clouds raindrops can go through secondary evaporation during their fall through an unsaturated air column which influences their original isotopic composition resulting in an enrichment of 18o and a decrease of d excess froehlich et al 2008 stewart 1975 sub cloud evaporation is common in arid and semiarid climate pang et al 2011 salamalikis et al 2016 wang et al 2016 where the d excess in precipitation collected at ground level may be much different from that in first condensate in the clouds chen et al 2015 froehlich et al 2008 kong et al 2013 in continental precipitation moisture originated over the continents may also largely contribute to precipitation kurita and yamada 2008 modifying the original oceanic d excess signal larger the continental moisture recycling higher the d excess in precipitation aemisegger et al 2014 froehlich et al 2008 yang et al 2007 a positive relationship between altitude and d excess in precipitation rivers and groundwater have been observed globally on the windward side of mountain ranges bershaw 2018 bershaw and lechler 2019 froehlich et al 2008 kong et al 2013 liotta et al 2006 masiol et al 2021 natali et al 2021 also referred as pseudo altitude effect by similarity to the well known altitude effect dansgaard 1964 gonfiantini et al 2001 which implies more depleted δ18o and δ2h values as elevation increases different interpretations have been provided to explain the pseudo altitude effect the so called seeder feeder mechanism was proposed by liotta et al 2006 and evoked by masiol et al 2021 which occurs when rain droplets from an upper level cloud seeder fall through a lower level orographic cloud and interact with it other authors attributed the altitudinal d excess variability to moisture sources partitioning by altitude with different moisture sources at low elevation with respect to higher altitudes tian et al 2007 high d excess values in fog ingraham and matthews 1990 and in upper tropospheric and or stratospheric vapor galewsky et al 2016 salmon et al 2019 may also influence the isotope composition of precipitation in mountains as well as the progressive decrease of temperature as altitude increases is thought to increase d excess in meteoric waters gonfiantini et al 2001 majoube 1971 however bershaw 2018 argues that the high d excess values globally observed at high elevation are more consistent with a reduction in subcloud evaporation due to the shorter distance between clouds and ground and to colder and wetter conditions all the processes above cited may alter the original d excess signature that is related to conditions at the moisture sources thus compromising the reliability of d excess as a proxy of vapor source regions in this context the typical interpretation of the d excess variability in precipitation over the wm being controlled by shifting in moisture sources between mediterranean sea and atlantic ocean casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2001 cruz san et al 1992 appears often ambiguous and speculative as a matter of fact increasing d excess values with altitude were found in the wm liotta et al 2006 masiol et al 2021 natali et al 2021 in addition to a wide seasonal variability masiol et al 2021 natali et al 2021 thus highlighting the need for new investigations at high spatial and temporal resolution with the aim to investigate the pattern of d excess in precipitation and to evaluate its reliability for tracing the moisture source in the wm in this work we present the results of a study performed in the apuan alps northwestern tuscany italy one of the rainiest areas in italy and characterized by a peculiar physiographic structure this area was selected because of its position in the western mediterranean basin as well as the peculiar climate and orography in order to define the hydrometeorological processes that may occur in similar areas in the world 19 single rain events were collected from 2020 to 2021 in 2 sites placed at different altitudes furthermore monthly precipitations were collected at 5 sites at different elevations over different time intervals from 2019 to 2021 the main objectives of this work were 1 to compute and interpret the event based and monthly local meteoric water line lmwl for each site 2 to analyze the spatial variability of δ18o and d excess and identify the processes that control these parameters 3 to define the influence of local meteorological variables on the d excess in precipitation 4 to evaluate the reliability of d excess as a proxy of moisture source regions and as tracer of water resources fate in this area of wm 2 location and climate the apuan alps is a mountain range spreading over an area of about 650 km2 in northwestern tuscany italy the chain is ne se oriented and runs parallel to the coastline from which is separated by a long and narrow plain area known as versilia plain to the south and riviera apuana to the north fig 1 the maximum altitude is 1942 m a s l at mt pisanino according to köppen s classification system the climate is explained as csa in plain areas at low altitudes and csb at higher altitudes even though the main climatic features of the region are those typical of a mediterranean climatic regime especially for the low altitude sites with hot dry summers and mild wet winters lionello et al 2006 the apuan alps represent one of the rainiest areas in the italian peninsula and in the mediterranean area the proximity to the sea and the peculiar orography of the chain characterized by steep slopes induce the lifting of humid air masses and their rapid adiabatic cooling this results in high precipitation of about 2500 mm year with peaks up to 3000 mm year in the areas close to the major ridges doveri et al 2019a doveri et al 2019b and references therein the average rainfall regime is characterized by two peaks of precipitation the main one in autumn and the secondary in late winter spring bartolini et al 2018 rapetti and vittorini 1994 summer is the driest season even if short and heavy rainstorms can occur at the highest altitudes in the apuan alps area intense thunderstorms are frequent in all seasons but especially in autumn when the sea surface temperature sst is at its highest bartolini et al 2014a giannecchini and d amato avanzi 2012 most of the precipitation in this area derives from the arrival of atlantic frontal disturbances in the wm lionello et al 2006 which often interact with the most important cyclogenetic center of the mediterranean area the gulf of genoa reale and lionello 2013 trigo et al 2002 in this context the apuan alps and apennine reliefs act as a geographical barrier to air masses moving eastward thus triggering local cyclogenesis according to this framework the autumn winter precipitation patterns over the north western tuscany are influenced by the north atlantic oscillation nao teleconnection lópez moreno et al 2011 luppichini et al 2021 as indicated by the negative correlation between nao index and rainfall amount luppichini et al 2021 zanchetta et al 2021 congruently to the general decrease in precipitation observed in the wm ipcc 2013 a significant decrease in annual winter and spring rainfall was found in northwestern tuscany bartolini et al 2018 bartolini et al 2014b even though the tendencies are not statistically significant for many sites d oria et al 2017 the mean annual temperature is 16 c on the seaward side at sea level and 10 c at 1000 m a s l however due to the particular morphology of the reliefs and variability of exposure temperature is strongly influenced by local orographic conditions and the vertical temperature gradient is not linear with altitude doveri et al 2019a according to the general warming trend observed in the mediterranean area e g brunetti et al 2006 bartolini et al 2012 a warming trend of about 0 1 c per decade was also found in the northern tuscany bartolini et al 2008 d oria et al 2017 3 methods and materials 3 1 monitoring sites a total of 133 precipitation samples were collected from march 2019 to august 2021 at 5 monitoring sites placed in two different basins of the apuan alps fig 1 table 1 among these sites 4 are located within the apuan hilly mountainous area at different altitudes plsa pev1 pev2 plrl whereas plpt is the only station placed in the plain between the apuan alps and the sea sites were selected to investigate the d excess variability at different altitudes in order to discern the possible influence of local processes in the southern basin named baccatoio stream basin both single rain events and monthly precipitations were collected from march 2020 may 2020 to june august 2021 respectively at two different altitudes plpt 4 5 m a s l and plsa 660 m a s l in the northern basin named frigido river basin only monthly precipitations were monitored at three different altitudes pev1 160 m a s l and pev2 765 m a s l from march 2019 to august 2021 whereas rainfall at plrl 315 m a s l were sampled from november 2020 to august 2021 3 2 sampling and meteorological data 19 single rain events were sampled both at plpt and plsa the sampling procedures complied with the regulations provided by the iaea iaea 2014 for the gnip network rain samplers were tube dip in water collectors palmex rs1 equipped with 3l plastic bottles and 13 5 cm funnel fig s1 the reliability of anti evaporative system of this sampler has been proven by previous works gröning et al 2012 michelsen et al 2018 in some cases rain samples were collected immediately after the end of rainfall to avoid mixing with later events and then stored in 50 ml hdpe high density polyethylene bottles with waterproof seals in all other cases sampling was performed within 24 h after the end of rain the total events precipitation amount mm was calculated as the ratio between the collected water volume and surface area of funnel however hourly records of precipitation were derived from stations of the tuscany region hydrologic service sir https www sir toscana it that were as close as possible to the rain collectors and at similar altitude fig 1 table s1 hourly air temperature was measured at both sites using a diver baro probe schlumberger water services with an accuracy of 0 1 c the hourly meteorological records were then averaged for each precipitation event monthly precipitations were also collected at plpt and plsa using two tube dip in water collectors fig s1 a palmex rs2 was used at plpt being equipped with a 10 l plastic bottle and 13 5 cm funnel a smaller 6 l bottle was placed during the drier months to minimize the air water ratio inside the bottle a 10 l home made sampler assembled according to iaea prescriptions iaea 2014 was used at plsa with a 20 cm funnel the monthly sample collected at plpt in april 2021 was not analyzed because the rain collector was found clogged by fine materials thus preventing an adequate sample collection moreover we decided to discard the july 2021 sample whose d excess value was 0 due to probable secondary evaporation inside the bottle in view of the very low precipitation amount 0 05 l ca 3 mm harvey 2005 harvey and welker 2000 welker 2000 a different sampling method was set up in the other test area in which oil collectors were adopted to collect monthly precipitation at pev1 pev2 and plrl fig s1 10 l bottles were used in all cases with funnels of 15 5 10 0 and 18 0 cm respectively a thin layer of paraffin oil ca 0 3 l was added to bottles before each sampling period to prevent evaporation oil was accurately separated by using separatory funnels iaea 2014 in order to avoid the presence of oil fractions in the water samples that can create various issues for laboratory analysis oil may contaminate the mass spectrometer and its periphery and possible spectral contamination may occur using laser spectroscopy gröning et al 2012 iaea 2014 unfortunately two monthly samples are missing from pev1 july and october 2020 and pev2 march and july 2020 the total precipitation amount during each month was measured by subtracting the initial weight of bottle with oil from the final weight temperature data were obtained in situ for pev1 from the website meteoapuane https www meteoapuane it whereas data for pev2 and plrl were derived from the closest sir station fig 1 table s1 hourly temperature was also registered at plrl by a diver baro probe schlumberger water services with an accuracy of 0 1 c aliquots from precipitation samples were transferred in 50 ml double sealing hdpe bottles and kept at a temperature of about 4 c before the analysis 3 3 isotopic analysis the 18o 16o and 2h h isotopic ratios of precipitation samples were determined at two different laboratories samples collected before december 2020 were analyzed at the institute of geosciences and earth resources of the national research council igg cnr of pisa samples collected starting from january 2021 were analyzed at the laboratory of fluid geochemistry of the university of florence a selection of samples was analyzed at both laboratories in order to verify the congruence of the entire dataset table s2 oxygen isotope composition was measured at igg cnr by the water co2 equilibration technique epstein and mayeda 1953 followed by the analysis of co2 using a finnigan mat 252 mass spectrometer irms a los gatos research lgr liquid water isotope analyzer based on the off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy technique lis et al 2008 was used at igg cnr to determine the hydrogen isotope composition irms was used for δ18o because some randomly distributed errors were detected for lgr results during the analyses of secondary standard and replicated samples for δ2h laboratory tests revealed that lgr data were more consistent than irms method and characterized by high reproducibility the 18o 16o and 2h h isotopic ratios of other samples were determined at university of florence using a picarro l2130 i analyzer based on cavity ring down spectroscopy crds picarro s chemcorrect post processing software was used to analyze the spectral features of each water sample and to determine whether the analysis was compromised by organic molecules e g paraffin oil the data are expressed as δ compared to the international reference standard v smow total error was within 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h for all methods all the laboratories ran isotopic reference materials spanning isotope scales of interest and calibrated them with internationally distributed isotopic reference materials obtained from iaea to the vsmow slap scale an internal lab standard was run several times among samples as a check on the instrumentation d excess was calculated by dansgaard s equation dansgaard 1964 using the relationship d δ2h 8 δ18o error propagation for d excess was calculated according to formula 1 and it resulted in an error of about 1 8 by using the total errors of 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h 1 u d e x c u δ 2 h 2 8 2 u δ 18 o 2 2 8 u δ 18 o 1 80 where u is the error associated to the isotopic parameters 3 4 statistics and lmwl computation statistical analyses were performed using r 4 1 2 all the standard deviations calculated were given at 1σ spearman s rank correlation analysis was applied to summarize the strength and direction negative or positive of the relationships between the d excess of precipitation and the meteorological variables the classification proposed in fowler et al 2009 was used to describe the strength of the correlation beside arithmetic means amount weighted isotopic composition δ18ow δ2hw and d excessw at event and monthly scales was also calculated for each monitoring site using the amount of water l measured in the rain collectors as shown in equation 2 2 δ i i 1 n δ i p i i 1 n p i where δi is the isotopic composition δ18o δ2h and d excess of a single event or month with precipitation amount of pi n is the total number of events or months in the monitoring period lmwls were computed at each site on event based and monthly data by applying the reduced major axis regression rma this technique proved to be suitable to fit the isotope data of precipitation crawford et al 2014 precipitation weighted regressions were not computed because we were not interested in hydrologically significant precipitation but rather in understanding the atmospheric and hydrometeorological processes that govern the isotopic composition of precipitation diagrams and plots were drawn by using the software grapher 19 goldensoftware llc 4 results 4 1 δ18o δ2h and d excess of single rain events meteorological and isotope data of 19 single rain events sampled at both plpt and plsa are reported in table s3 along with information about the duration of each event summary statistics of event based data are provided in table 2 precipitation amounts and temperature values during the events were different at the two sites with plsa experiencing a wetter and colder climate with respect to plpt which is placed at lower altitude in the plain as expected temperature during events was always higher at plpt than plsa with a mean difference of δt of 4 4 1 1 c n 19 whereas rain amounts were higher at plsa except for three summer events e4 e5 and e19 when higher precipitation occurred at plpt fig 2 a table s3 precipitation amounts were variable among rain events ranging from a minimum of 5 mm and 11 mm to a maximum of 129 mm and 171 mm respectively at plpt and plsa two long and very rainy events were sampled in winter period djf but plentiful events also occurred in spring mam summer jja and autumn son the weakest events were always sampled in summer and autumn table s3 inter event temperature was also variable from a minimum of 4 8 c and 9 1 c to a maximum of 19 2 c and 25 2 c respectively at plsa and plpt table 2 the coldest events occurred in winter and spring whereas atmospheric temperature was higher during autumn and summer events table 3 δ18o and δ2h was systematically more negative at plsa than plpt table s3 fig 2a except for the event collected in june 2021 e19 when a more depleted isotopic composition was registered at plpt the arithmetic mean δ18o of all sampled events was 6 09 at plsa and 4 96 at plpt table 2 the arithmetic means were more positive than amount weighted mean δ18o at both sites that was equal to 6 46 and 5 55 respectively at plsa and plpt the difference between weighted and not weighted means was larger at plpt the δ2h values evidenced a similar pattern δ18o and δ2h values of event based samples showed a large seasonal variability at both sites fig 2a δ18o ranged from a minimum of 11 02 at plsa and 9 19 at plpt in january 2021 e14 to a maximum of 1 99 and 0 51 in march 2021 e15 the event based δ18o was also variable within the same season fig 2a even if more depleted values were generally registered in winter autumn whereas more enriched rains mostly occurred in spring summer table 3 the winter events showed on average the most depleted δ18o value equal to 7 31 and 9 03 respectively at plpt and plsa whereas the most enriched rains occurred in spring with a arithmetic mean δ18o of 3 05 at plpt and 4 45 at plsa in respect of the intra season δ18o variability of rain events it is worth noting the presence of two strongly δ18o depleted events in summer e4 and e5 showing isotopic values typical of winter or autumn precipitation the d excess parameter was systematically higher at plsa than plpt fig 2b except for the event collected in june 2020 e4 when d excess was comparable at two sites the arithmetic mean d excess of all sampled events was 10 8 and 13 7 at plpt and plsa respectively table 2 and the amount weighted mean values was 0 6 0 5 higher than arithmetic ones however differences between weighted and not weighted means may be not significant since the error associated to the d excess 1 8 was about three times higher the event based d excess showed an evident seasonal variability at both sites fig 2b ranging from a minimum of 7 1 and 10 0 in march 2020 e1 to a maximum of 19 9 and 21 2 in october 2020 e9 respectively at plpt and plsa higher d excess values were measured in autumn and early winter events whereas lower values were registered in spring and summer table 3 the autumn events showed on average the highest d excess 13 7 at plpt whereas the winter d excess was the highest at plsa 15 8 moreover d excess also widely varied among events sampled within a single season or month fig 2b as clearly indicated by the five events collected from september to october 2020 e7 e8 e9 e10 and e11 it is worth noting that two spring events e15 and e16 sampled at plsa showed very high d excess compared to the seasonal mean 4 2 δ18o δ2h and d excess of monthly precipitation meteorological and isotope data of monthly precipitations collected at five sites in the apuan alps are reported in table s4 whereas summary statistics are provided in table 2 as shown in fig 3 meteorological and isotope data exhibited a very similar pattern at five sites even though some differences may be observed among the stations the two sites placed at lower altitudes plpt and pev1 showed the highest monthly mean temperature and the lowest precipitation amount 17 3 c and 106 mm at plpt 14 5 c and 136 mm at pev1 on the contrary the high altitude stations plsa and pev2 showed the lowest temperature 13 4 c and 13 0 c respectively and higher precipitation amounts than low altitude sites 170 mm and 179 mm respectively plrl was placed at an intermediate altitude compared to other sites and it showed an intermediate mean temperature 13 7 c but the highest rain amount 185 mm however the monitoring periods were different at five stations which prevent the direct comparison of means monthly precipitation amounts were variable over the monitoring period at all sites fig 3 table 3 most of precipitation occurred in winter that showed the highest rain amounts followed by autumn and spring the rainiest months during the investigation period were november 2019 december 2020 and january 2021 summer was the driest season at all sites the atmospheric temperature also showed expected seasonal fluctuations fig 3 with lower temperatures registered in winter and higher temperatures in summer as shown in fig 3 the δ18o and δ2h showed a trend from more positive values to more negative values moving from low altitude sites to stations placed at a higher altitude plpt exhibited the most enriched oxygen isotopic composition with a mean value of 4 35 whereas pev2 showed the most depleted mean δ18o equal to 5 69 table 2 precipitation collected at plpt showed the most enriched δ18o values during the entire monitoring period except for june 2021 when a more negative δ18o was registered at this site the amount weighted mean δ18o values were more negative than arithmetic means at all sites table 2 with differences ranging from a minimum of 0 86 at plrl to a maximum of 1 45 at plpt δ18o and δ2h values of monthly precipitation also showed a large seasonal variability at all sites fig 3 which roughly followed the mean monthly air temperature trend and rain amount fluctuations δ18o tended to be more negative during colder and rainier periods and more positive during warmer and drier periods precipitation showed the most depleted mean oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition in winter whereas the most enriched values were registered in spring and summer table 3 as shown in fig 3 the most negative δ18o values were registered in three rainiest months nov 19 dec 20 and jan 21 at all sites which also were among the coldest of the whole period on the contrary the most positive δ18o were registered in august 2019 and march 2021 which were among the driest months the amount weighted seasonal mean δ18o was always more negative than arithmetic means at all sites with a mean difference of 0 5 the d excess of monthly precipitation was generally lower at low altitude sites than higher elevations fig 3 table 2 plpt exhibited the lowest d excess during the whole monitoring period with a mean value of 8 5 followed by pev1 and plrl which showed a mean d excess of about 10 9 and 11 7 respectively pev2 and plsa showed instead higher d excess with mean values of 12 9 and 13 7 respectively however d excess was comparable at stations in some months except for plpt which always showed lower d excess the amount weighted mean d excess was higher than arithmetic means at all sites even if differences were lower than d excess error except for plpt where the weighted mean d excess was 2 3 higher than the arithmetic one table 2 the monthly precipitation d excess also seasonally changed at all sites fig 3 the d excess trend roughly followed the temperature and precipitation trend and appeared anticorrelated with δ18o higher d excess were measured in winter and autumn rains whereas lower values were registered in spring and summer table 3 the lowest d excess was registered at plpt in march 2021 1 4 when other sites showed higher values ranging from 12 2 plrl to 15 6 plsa overall low d excess values were registered at low altitude stations during the driest months i e august 2019 november 2020 july and august 2021 5 discussion 5 1 event based and monthly lmwls the wide variability of δ18o and d excess recorded in single rain events and monthly precipitation over the apuan alps and versilia plain is consistent with the one found for monthly rainfall in tuscany natali et al 2021 and over the entire italian peninsula giustini et al 2016 longinelli and selmo 2003 stable isotopes exhibited seasonal variability figs 2 3 that is less evident for event based precipitation whose δ18o and d excess values largely varied within a single month seasonality of isotopic parameters roughly reflects trend in air temperature and precipitation amount during the investigated period the two well known temperature effect dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 and amount effect clark and fritz 1997 may be invoked to explain δ18o variations as well as seasonal changes of moisture source regions could influence the δ18o and d excess values of precipitation however the understanding of the processes that regulate the δ18o seasonal variability goes beyond the objectives of this paper the influence of local meteorological variables on the d excess in precipitation is instead discussed in section 5 3 data in the δ space fig 4 lie between the gmwl craig 1961 rozanski et al 1993 and eastern mediterranean meteoric water line emmwl gat and carmi 1970 the computed meteoric lines fig 4 table 4 overlap with the mwl for tuscany region natali et al 2021 and central italy meteoric water line cimwl by giustini et al 2016 the event based lmwl at plsa had a slope of 8 03 that is the same as that of gmwl but an higher intercept 13 9 very close to the western mediterranean meteoric water line wmmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 13 7 calculated by celle jeanton 2000 according to traditional interpretation of lmwls in the wm region e g casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2001 intercept of about 14 calculated at plsa is typical of this mediterranean area indicating the mixing of vapor coming from the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean however lmwl intercepts higher than 10 may be attributed to moisture continental recycling gat and matsui 1991 occurring when recycled vapor from land surfaces is mixed with oceanic vapor the event based lmwl at plpt had lower slope and intercept 7 57 and 8 62 respectively than wmmwl and gmwl as well as the monthly lmwls computed at each site fig 4 the lowest slope 6 71 and intercept 2 90 was calculated for monthly precipitation at plpt whereas the other sites were characterized by similar lmwls table 4 lower slope and intercept compared to the gmwl indicate warmer and drier climatic conditions at these sites suggesting the existence of secondary evaporation processes of raindrops beneath the cloud base during precipitation gat 2005 gonfiantini 1986 sub cloud evaporation implies that more 18o remains in the liquid phase reducing the slope of the lmwl accordingly sub cloud processes appear to be more intense at plpt as also evidenced by the lowest d excess calculated at this site plpt is the only station placed in the plain area close to the coastline right outside the mountainous area of the apuan alps where rain droplets fall a longer distance from the cloud base to the ground moreover plpt also was the warmest and less humid site increasing the possibility of raindrops evaporation even if this effect is clearly recognizable in fitting plpt monthly precipitation the event based lmwls had higher slope and intercept than monthly ones the wide difference between event based and monthly lmwls further evidences the occurrence of secondary evaporation processes which mostly affect the weaker rain events whose isotopic signature is averaged and smoothed in the monthly mean isotopic composition on the contrary the isotopic signature of weaker events is underrepresented by the event based lmwls because we generally collected the most intense rain events during each month however it is worth noting that monthly lmwls were derived in this study using records shorter than length threshold proposed by putman et al 2019 as slope and intercept may change for longer dataset considerations above discussed should be taken with caution even if other evidence support them the stronger influence of sub cloud processes on the weaker rains is clearly depicted by the large difference between the amount weighted mean δ18o and d excess with respect the arithmetic means weaker precipitations mostly occur in drier and warmer months when evaporation falling droplets is more likely and they generally have more positive δ18o and lower d excess the weighted mean δ18o and d excess are thus more negative and higher than arithmetic ones respectively because weaker precipitations have a lesser weight in the computation differences were larger at plpt indicating that below cloud evaporation is more likely in the plain area near the coastline sub cloud processes are less important at all other sites placed at higher altitude than plpt and within the mountain district of apuan alps where more precipitation and higher humidity contain evaporation of raindrops overall the derived lmwls and the d excess values highlight the mixed influence between atlantic and mediterranean moisture source in precipitation over the investigated region congruently with what has been observed for tuscany natali et al 2021 however secondary evaporation of falling droplets appears likely at all sites even if topography has an important effect on kinetic fractionation processes that act with higher intensity in coastal plain site with respect the mountain sites these processes are more pronounced when low precipitation amounts occur in a warmer atmosphere 5 2 pseudo altitude effect controls the d excess spatial variability d excess in event based and monthly precipitation largely varied among the investigated sites with higher values at higher elevations this spatial heterogeneity of d excess could be due to different moisture source regions for the five survey sites nonetheless the stations are located in a relatively small area that is generally interested by moist air masses coming from northwest to southwest zanchetta et al 2021 except for local and sporadic thunderstorms events or rare disturbances coming from north or east accordingly different moisture source regions or source partitioning by altitude are unlikely for precipitation occurring on the windward side of the apuan alps this mechanism may be more likely in large mountain chains reaching very high altitudes like the himalayas and tianshan region in china tian et al 2007 tian et al 2005 where low altitude precipitation are frequently due to monsoonal southerlies whereas moisture coming from west is prevalent at high altitudes in the apuan alps the d excess spatial variability may then be due to several processes that potentially occur during the moisture transport and or at precipitation site in order to evaluate the intensity of these processes during the whole monitoring period differences in d excess δd excess were computed between sites placed in the same basin and whose data covered the same period δd excess values were therefore calculated for both single events and monthly precipitations between plpt and plsa and for monthly rains collected at pev1 and pev2 fig 5 a c event based δd excess between plsa and plpt was on average 3 0 but it widely varied among rain events fig 5a within the range 0 9 8 6 except for e4 when the d excess was comparable at two sites and δd excess was near zero considering the error associated to d excess equal to 1 8 all the events showed a significant δd excess between plsa and plpt except for four events when it ranged from 0 2 to 1 3 e4 e7 e8 and e9 monthly δd excess for plpt plsa followed a similar trend fig 5b ranging from a minimum of 0 6 to a maximum of 14 1 with a mean value of 5 5 the maximum δd excess at plpt plsa was computed in march 2021 for both event based and monthly precipitation respectively of 8 6 and 14 1 when very weak rains occurred at plpt compared to plsa albeit ascribable to the same atmospheric disturbance on the contrary δd excess was lower in june 2021 when low precipitations also occurred but they were higher at plpt than plsa the greater the ratio between the precipitation amount at plsa with respect to that at plpt i e the greater the difference in precipitation between plsa and plpt the greater the δd excess fig s2 congruently to the lmwls computed for plpt and plsa table 4 these data indicate sub cloud evaporation as one of the processes potentially driving the differences in d excess between low and high altitude sites precipitation is generally more abundant at high altitude and raindrops fall a shorter distance between the cloud base and the ground thus limiting secondary evaporation droplets may also have a larger diameter at high altitude which is a further important factor controlling sub cloud evaporation wang et al 2016 on the contrary the longer distance crossed by raindrops at low altitude where air temperature is higher and precipitation amounts are lower increases the probability of non equilibrium kinetic fractionation during the fall decreasing the d excess values in precipitation at plpt and increasing δd excess values monthly δd excess for pev1 pev2 also largely varied fig 5c with a mean δd excess of 1 8 even though it was comparable to d excess error in many cases overall δd excess for pev1 pev2 varied in a narrower interval with respect plpt plsa that is reasonably due to the different geographical location of these two rain collectors compared to plpt plsa pev1 is located at higher altitude than plpt within the mountainous district of the apuan alps whereas plpt is placed in the plain area a few kilometres far from the coastline this results in climatic and meteorological conditions significantly different despite the short distance between two sites therefore the lower δd excess values observed for pev1 pev2 may be related to a reduction in sub cloud evaporation at pev1 with respect plpt whereas no relevant difference is evidenced between plsa and pev2 that are located at similar elevation positive δd excess values between high and low altitude sites imply a positive relationship between d excess and elevation which is known as pseudo altitude effect e g bershaw and lechler 2019 liotta et al 2006 masiol et al 2021 natali et al 2021 based on data hitherto discussed this effect is arguably ascribable to a sub cloud evaporation model in order to compute the relationship between d excess and elevation in the study area we selected only months from november 2020 to august 2021 when monthly precipitations were collected at all sites as shown in fig 5d a vertical d excess gradient was found with positive values for all months during the investigated period however the linear relationship between altitude and d excess in precipitation was significant p value 0 05 only in november 2020 december 2020 january and may 2021 with values ranging from 0 35 100 m to 1 1 100 m and r2 values always higher than 0 8 as also observed for δd excess values no seasonal dependence is evidenced by the trend of d excess vertical gradient indicating more local processes controlling the spatial variability of d excess two ordinary least square regressions olsr were applied to arithmetic mean d excess and amount weighted mean d excess calculated for each site fig 6 a we found two very strong positive relationships and significant at 99 p value 0 01 between d excess and elevation of about 0 73 100 m for arithmetic means and of about 0 51 100 m for amount weighted means these relationships are consistent with those found in precipitation over tuscany natali et al 2021 and in northeast italy masiol et al 2021 even though lower correlations were found by these authors similar gradients were calculated by authors of this paper for two single rain events collected in 2018 2019 along an elevation transect in one of two studied basins baccatoio stream basin table s5 precipitations were collected at three different altitudes 4 5 260 and 660 m a s l the first and third one being the same as in this research during two events in may 2018 and april 2019 d excess vertical gradients were computed of about 0 83 100 m r2 0 81 and 0 66 100 m r2 0 98 respectively table s5 positive relationships between altitude and d excess in precipitation but also in rivers and groundwater have been observed globally on the windward side of mountain ranges e g bershaw and lechler 2019 froehlich et al 2008 liotta et al 2006 and they are consistent with a process like sub cloud evaporation that appears to be the most important process controlling the d excess spatial variability in the mountainous areas therefore the pseudo altitude effect here observed is primarily determined by the intensity of secondary evaporation processes occurring during precipitation the lower d excess gradient calculated by amount weighted means indicates once again the large influence of sub cloud processes on the weaker precipitation whose lower d excess values have a lesser weight in the computation however other processes as recycling of continental moisture at higher altitude sites or seeder feeder mechanism liotta et al 2006 may not be totally excluded although these processes are more likely to occur sporadically and therefore they are not able to control the d excess local variability over long time periods 5 3 d excess seasonality and influence of local meteorological variables the d excess seasonality observed in precipitation collected in this study is partly due to variations of rh and sst at the oceanic source lower rh and sst in winter and autumn increase the kinetic fractionation at the evaporative sources leading to higher d excess in vapor and precipitation on the contrary the higher rh and sst in summer yield lower d excess moreover d excess in summer precipitation may be further altered by sub cloud processes which should be more intense during this season when precipitation amounts are very low and temperature is higher in order to evaluate the influence of local meteorological variables on the d excess of precipitation event based monthly d excess values were plotted against event monthly mean temperature and total event monthly precipitation fig 7 and a spearman s correlation analysis was performed no correlation was found between event based d excess and meteorological variables fig 7 table 5 probably due to the large isotopic variability of single rain events a moderate to strong positive correlation was found between monthly d excess and precipitation amount fig s3 which is significant p value 0 05 at all sites spearman s correlation coefficients ranged from a minimum of 0 41 at pev1 to a maximum of 0 90 at plrl table 5 this positive correlation implies decreasing d excess values as rain amount decrease congruently to a sub cloud evaporation model moreover it is worth noting that the slope of linear relationship between monthly d excess and precipitation amount were quite similar at all mountain sites about 1 0 1 3 100 mm except for plpt where the gradient was stronger 3 5 100 mm a moderate negative correlation was also found between monthly d excess and air temperature fig s3 except for plpt spearman s correlation coefficients ranged from a minimum of 0 34 at pev1 to a maximum of 0 83 at plrl table 5 this negative relationship implies decreasing d excess values as temperature increase which once again prove the greater influence of sub cloud processes at warmer sites and during warmer seasons overall the d excess seasonal variability is partly controlled by changes in sst and rh at the moisture sources but also by the local meteorological variables whose effect overlaps and potentially obscures the original d excess signature imprinted at the moisture source the seasonal patterns of d excess clearly indicate that linking high d excess values to mediterranean moisture without thorough discussion may lead to erroneous and misleading interpretation as a matter of fact the lower d excess commonly registered in summer precipitation over the wm could be due to a reduction in vapor mediterranean sources but also to more intense sub cloud processes in a warmer atmosphere on the other side higher winter d excess may be ascribable to drier conditions at the moisture sources but also to a reduction of sub cloud evaporation while it can be interpreted as the result of an increase in mediterranean moisture sources over the wm therefore the interpretation of d excess patterns in precipitation is often ambiguous as changes in vapor sources and processes during vapor transport affect d excess in a complex way 5 4 altitude effect and δ18o spatial variability as shown in figs 2 and 3 event based and monthly δ18o showed a marked spatial variability among the investigated sites with more depleted δ18o at higher altitudes the δ18o spatial heterogeneity may be explained by the well known altitude effect dansgaard 1964 gonfiantini et al 2001 moist air masses coming from the sea cross the versilia plain and are forced to climb up along the slopes of mountain with consequent rapid cooling and adiabatic expansion during this process equilibrium isotopic fractionations occur and vapor progressively becomes depleted in heavy isotopes this results in an inverse relationship between δ18o and elevation on the windward side of chain with decreasing δ18o values as altitude increases congruently to a rayleigh distillation model of air mass depletion rowley and garzione 2007 in order to evaluate the intensity of the altitude effect during the whole monitoring period differences in δ18o δδ18o were calculated for both single events and monthly precipitations between plpt and plsa and for monthly rains collected at pev1 and pev2 δδ18o was always higher than the analytical error associated to δ18o measurements pointing it as actual and not imputable to analytical errors as shown in fig 8 a the event based δδ18o between plsa and plpt was quite variable among rain events ranging from 0 6 to 2 5 with a mean value of 1 1 the event e19 was the only one showing a positive δδ18o of 2 2 being also one of the three events when rain amounts were larger at plpt monthly δδ18o for plpt plsa exhibited a similar pattern fig 8b ranging from 0 7 to 3 8 and a mean value of 1 2 june 2021 was the only month having a positive δδ18o of 2 0 congruently to the event e19 collected in the same month that accounted for most of fallen precipitation the positive relationship between δ18o and altitude in this month can be attributed to a rainstorm coming from east and rapidly crossing the apuan alps discharging most of the rain into the plain in front of the sea fig s4 consequently precipitations collected at plpt were depleted in heavy isotopes than plsa on the other side the maximum δδ18o for plpt plsa was computed in march 2021 both for event based and monthly data when very weak rains occurred at plpt compared to plsa even if they were ascribable to the same event a strong evaporation of raindrops could then explain the more positive isotopic composition registered at plpt as also indicated by the largest δd excess calculated in this month however the monthly δδ18o for plpt plsa was relatively constant and not depending on season except for two aforesaid extremes monthly δδ18o for pev1 pev2 also varied within a similar interval fig 8c with a mean δδ18o of 0 9 δδ18o was positive only for three months in two of which precipitation was higher at the low altitude site pev1 the isotopic vertical gradient also known as isotopic lapse rate bershaw and lechler 2019 is a useful parameter generally used in hydrogeology to characterize the recharge areas of aquifers doveri et al 2013 doveri and mussi 2014 liotta et al 2013 paternoster et al 2008 as for the d excess in order to compute the monthly δ18o vertical gradient for the investigated area we selected only months from november 2020 to august 2021 when monthly precipitations were collected at all sites as shown in fig 8d the δ18o vertical gradient was relatively variable during the investigated period with negative values for most of months except summer when the gradient was null and no linear relationship was found however the linear relationship was not significant n 5 for each month p value 0 05 for most of months even if r2 was always 0 6 the gradient was significant only in december 2020 january and may 2021 with values from 0 17 100 m to 0 20 100 m when precipitations were more abundant the absence of gradient in summer months may be imputable to uneven rainstorms occurring only at certain sites resulting in spatially different δ18o values that were not controlled by the altitude effect on the contrary strong and significant δ18o vertical gradients were revealed during very rainy months december 2020 january and may 2021 when precipitations were linked to large scale atmospheric disturbances which interested the whole study area in order to compute the mean δ18o vertical gradient for the investigation period two linear regressions were applied to arithmetic mean δ18o and amount weighted mean δ18o calculated for each site even if the relationships were not significant in both cases δ18o vertical gradients of 0 16 100 m and 0 12 100 m were computed respectively for arithmetic and weighted mean δ18o fig 6b such values were consistent with those previously calculated in the apuan alps area doveri et al 2021 2013 mussi et al 1998 by applying the so called small springs method doveri and mussi 2014 vespasiano et al 2015 it is worth noting that the δ18o vertical gradient computed by amount weighted means is more suitable to identify the recharge areas of groundwater since more abundant precipitations are responsible of higher infiltration into aquifers and therefore they should weight more in the computation of the gradient 5 5 implications for using the d excess as tracer of moisture source and water resources fate data presented in this study have some implications for using the d excess parameter as reliable tracer of moisture source and water resources fate in the wm based on these findings more caution should be paid when interpreting d excess variability in precipitation over the wm as the result of mixing and or shifting between mediterranean and atlantic sources of moisture local processes can largely modify the original d excess signature imprinted at the moisture source especially across elevation transects where sub cloud evaporation is the main process controlling the d excess spatial variability in the event that the d excess is mostly altered by raindrops evaporations below the clouds as indicated by data here presented precipitation at high altitude should be preferred to derive information about the vapor sources as a matter of fact precipitation at coastal and plain sites may experience strong sub cloud evaporation thus lowering their d excess according to this interpretation the mediterranean sea confirm to be an important supplier of moisture to precipitation over the wm especially in autumn and winter when d excess was high at high altitude sites nonetheless sub cloud processes may also act at mountain sites in addition to other processes able to increase the d excess values e g continental moisture recycling seeder feeder mechanism contributions from fog or upper stratospheric tropospheric vapor winter snow events at high altitude sites may also be responsible of high d excess values in precipitation researchers should be careful during monitoring and discard those meteoric events or months potentially affected by snow precipitations in this study the maximum altitude of rain collectors was 765 m a s l but snow events are not so frequent at this altitude in the mediterranean therefore rain collectors placed at altitudes between about 500 and 1000 m a s l could be suitable to minimize the effect of sub cloud processes and to avoid snow precipitations however as also observed by juhlke et al 2019 the notion of mediterranean moisture as the only explanation for relatively high d excess values appears imprecise and quite speculative on the other side the strong positive relationship between elevation and d excess in precipitation over the study area appears to be suitable in order to characterize the recharge areas of groundwater the δ18o vertical gradient in precipitation and or in low yield springs is already widely adopted in hydrogeological field to identify the mean recharge altitudes of aquifers e g doveri et al 2021 doveri and mussi 2014 liotta et al 2013 paternoster et al 2008 likewise the d excess vertical gradient in precipitation could be used for the same goal as surface and groundwater fed at different altitudes should also exhibit increasing d excess values as altitude increase further investigations could highlight how the combined use of the δ18o vertical gradient and the d excess vertical gradient could increase the possibility of discerning the recharge areas of groundwater as a matter of fact we could have different d excess values for the same δ18o values depending on specific local conditions moreover the d excess seasonality observed in precipitation could be a useful tool to characterize hydrodynamics of aquifer systems and to reveal their dependence on seasonal recharge doveri et al 2019b 6 conclusions results obtained in this study may be generalized to other regions in the mediterranean and arid or semi arid regions in the world especially along windward sides of mountains and they are useful to infer possibly common hydrometeorological processes the spatial variability of δ18o and d excess over the apuan alps and the versilia coastal plain is mostly due to local processes involving topography and altitude event based and monthly lmwls indicate the mixing of atlantic and mediterranean moisture sources in generating precipitation over this area of wm although sub cloud processes involving non equilibrium kinetic fractionations play an important role at a local scale lowering the slope and intercept values of lmwl long term monitoring at these sites would be important to produce isotope records long enough to have more stable and reliable lmwl slope and intercept values a linear relationship between elevation and d excess in precipitation was found over the investigated area with increasing d excess values as altitude increases this pseudo altitude effect is primarily due to subcloud evaporation which implies secondary kinetic evaporation of raindrops during their fall through an unsaturated air column this influences their original isotopic composition resulting in an enrichment of heavy isotopes and a decrease of d excess this process is more pronounced at low altitude especially in the coastal and plain area whereas its effect is less evident at higher altitudes due to the shorter distance between the cloud base and the ground as well as the lower temperature and the higher rainfall amounts contain sub cloud evaporation these findings evidence that d excess parameter is highly sensitive to topography and local climatology therefore more caution should be observed when interpreting d excess variability in precipitation as the result of different source regions of moisture influencing a specific area local processes can largely modify the original d excess signature imprinted at the moisture source especially across elevation transects where sub cloud evaporation is the main process controlling the d excess spatial variability findings from this work indicate that precipitation at mountain sites should be preferred to derive information about the vapor sources by using the d excess according to this interpretation the mediterranean sea confirm to be an important supplier of moisture to precipitation over the wm furthermore the strong positive relationship between elevation and d excess in precipitation over the study area together with the δ18o vertical gradient appears to be suitable in order to characterize the recharge areas of groundwater as surface and groundwater fed at different altitudes should exhibit increasing d excess values as altitude increase the combined use of the δ18o and d excess vertical gradient could be a promising approach to better constrain the recharge areas of aquifer systems in mountain environments credit authorship contribution statement stefano natali conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis

2810,the deuterium excess is a function of the isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen in water traditionally the d excess is used worldwide to constrain the moisture sources of precipitation as it mainly depends on the relative humidity and surface sea temperature at the evaporative sources that control diffusion of the water molecules across the density gradient a case in point is represented by precipitation deriving from vapor originating over the eastern mediterranean sea characterized by the higher d excess values 22 compared to the global average d excess in precipitation

several studies proved the d excess values of precipitation evolves during transport of vapor and changes depending on local processes e g sub cloud evaporation of raindrops continental moisture recycling seeder feeder mechanism thus compromising the reliability of d excess as a proxy of vapor source regions with the aim to investigate the pattern of d excess in precipitation at higher spatial and temporal resolution and to evaluate its reliability for tracing the moisture source in the western mediterranean in this work we present the results of a study performed in the apuan alps tuscany italy one of the rainiest areas in italy 19 single rain events were collected from 2020 to 2021 at two sites placed at different altitudes furthermore monthly precipitations were collected at five sites at different elevations over different time intervals from 2019 to 2021 event based and monthly local meteoric water lines were computed at each site indicating droplets evaporation beneath the clouds especially at lower altitude sites d excess seasonally and spatially varied with higher values registered at higher altitudes in winter and autumn and lower values at lower altitudes in spring and summer large differences in d excess were found among sites placed at different altitudes and these differences ranged both at monthly and event scales mean and weighted mean d excess vertical gradients of 0 73 100 m r2 0 92 and 0 51 100 m r2 0 95 respectively were computed using 9 months in which monthly samples were collected at all five sites this positive relationship between altitude and d excess in precipitation is consistent with a process like sub cloud evaporation that appears to be the most important process controlling the d excess spatial variability in the mountainous areas these findings evidence the importance of local processes acting on the d excess and downsize the reliability of this parameter in tracing moisture sources in this area conversely

mediterranean pseudo altitude effect sub cloud evaporation data availability all the data are available in the supplementary materials 1 introduction the isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen in meteoric water is extensively used to characterize the hydrologic cycle processes worldwide the deuterium excess d excess is a second order isotope parameter that is function of the isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen in water as defined by the dansgaard s equation d excess δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 the term d excess is therefore used to express the excess of deuterium compared to heavy oxygen 18o in vapor that occurs when water molecules formed by different hydrogen and oxygen isotopes also known as isotopologues diffuse across a density gradient during evaporation processes h2h16o isotopologue has a lower weight than water molecules composed of heavy oxygen 18o that results in a more diffusive fractionation of 18o during evaporation since diffusion is accompanied by kinetic fractionation the larger the diffusion the higher the d excess in the vapor above the evaporating surface traditionally the d excess is used worldwide to constrain the moisture sources of precipitation celle jeanton et al 2001 cui et al 2009 gat and carmi 1970 jouzel et al 2013 juhlke et al 2019 as it mainly depends on relative humidity rh and surface sea temperature sst at the evaporative sources bonne et al 2019 merlivat and jouzel 1979 pfahl and sodemann 2014 uemura et al 2008 that control diffusion of the water molecules at the water air interface this also explains why d excess is characterized by a large seasonality juhlke et al 2019 masiol et al 2021 natali et al 2021 with higher values in winter precipitation when rh over oceans is low and lower values in summer when atmosphere is wetter the lower the rh the stronger the kinetic fractionation during evaporation leading to higher d excess in the vapor precipitation along the global meteoric water line craig 1961 rozanski et al 1993 has d excess of ca 10 which correspond to a theoretical process under rh and sst of 85 and 25 c respectively clark and fritz 1997 a case in point is precipitation deriving from vapor originating over the eastern mediterranean sea em characterized by the highest d excess values 22 gat and carmi 1970 compared to the global mean d excess in precipitation of 10 due to the higher sst and lower rh in this sector of mediterranean sea accordingly d excess values of 14 found in precipitation across the western mediterranean wm are generally interpreted as the result of mixing of atlantic with d excess values of ca 10 and mediterranean air masses casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2001 cruz san et al 1992 natali et al 2021 nevertheless several studies proved that d excess evolves during transport of vapor to the precipitation site and changes depending on local processes e g froehlich et al 2001 gat and airey 2006 wang et al 2016 after the condensation of vapor in clouds raindrops can go through secondary evaporation during their fall through an unsaturated air column which influences their original isotopic composition resulting in an enrichment of 18o and a decrease of d excess froehlich et al 2008 stewart 1975 sub cloud evaporation is common in arid and semiarid climate pang et al 2011 salamalikis et al 2016 wang et al 2016 where the d excess in precipitation collected at ground level may be much different from that in first condensate in the clouds chen et al 2015 froehlich et al 2008 kong et al 2013 in continental precipitation moisture originated over the continents may also largely contribute to precipitation kurita and yamada 2008 modifying the original oceanic d excess signal larger the continental moisture recycling higher the d excess in precipitation aemisegger et al 2014 froehlich et al 2008 yang et al 2007 a positive relationship between altitude and d excess in precipitation rivers and groundwater have been observed globally on the windward side of mountain ranges bershaw 2018 bershaw and lechler 2019 froehlich et al 2008 kong et al 2013 liotta et al 2006 masiol et al 2021 natali et al 2021 also referred as pseudo altitude effect by similarity to the well known altitude effect dansgaard 1964 gonfiantini et al 2001 which implies more depleted δ18o and δ2h values as elevation increases different interpretations have been provided to explain the pseudo altitude effect the so called seeder feeder mechanism was proposed by liotta et al 2006 and evoked by masiol et al 2021 which occurs when rain droplets from an upper level cloud seeder fall through a lower level orographic cloud and interact with it other authors attributed the altitudinal d excess variability to moisture sources partitioning by altitude with different moisture sources at low elevation with respect to higher altitudes tian et al 2007 high d excess values in fog ingraham and matthews 1990 and in upper tropospheric and or stratospheric vapor galewsky et al 2016 salmon et al 2019 may also influence the isotope composition of precipitation in mountains as well as the progressive decrease of temperature as altitude increases is thought to increase d excess in meteoric waters gonfiantini et al 2001 majoube 1971 however bershaw 2018 argues that the high d excess values globally observed at high elevation are more consistent with a reduction in subcloud evaporation due to the shorter distance between clouds and ground and to colder and wetter conditions all the processes above cited may alter the original d excess signature that is related to conditions at the moisture sources thus compromising the reliability of d excess as a proxy of vapor source regions in this context the typical interpretation of the d excess variability in precipitation over the wm being controlled by shifting in moisture sources between mediterranean sea and atlantic ocean casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2001 cruz san et al 1992 appears often ambiguous and speculative as a matter of fact increasing d excess values with altitude were found in the wm liotta et al 2006 masiol et al 2021 natali et al 2021 in addition to a wide seasonal variability masiol et al 2021 natali et al 2021 thus highlighting the need for new investigations at high spatial and temporal resolution with the aim to investigate the pattern of d excess in precipitation and to evaluate its reliability for tracing the moisture source in the wm in this work we present the results of a study performed in the apuan alps northwestern tuscany italy one of the rainiest areas in italy and characterized by a peculiar physiographic structure this area was selected because of its position in the western mediterranean basin as well as the peculiar climate and orography in order to define the hydrometeorological processes that may occur in similar areas in the world 19 single rain events were collected from 2020 to 2021 in 2 sites placed at different altitudes furthermore monthly precipitations were collected at 5 sites at different elevations over different time intervals from 2019 to 2021 the main objectives of this work were 1 to compute and interpret the event based and monthly local meteoric water line lmwl for each site 2 to analyze the spatial variability of δ18o and d excess and identify the processes that control these parameters 3 to define the influence of local meteorological variables on the d excess in precipitation 4 to evaluate the reliability of d excess as a proxy of moisture source regions and as tracer of water resources fate in this area of wm 2 location and climate the apuan alps is a mountain range spreading over an area of about 650 km2 in northwestern tuscany italy the chain is ne se oriented and runs parallel to the coastline from which is separated by a long and narrow plain area known as versilia plain to the south and riviera apuana to the north fig 1 the maximum altitude is 1942 m a s l at mt pisanino according to köppen s classification system the climate is explained as csa in plain areas at low altitudes and csb at higher altitudes even though the main climatic features of the region are those typical of a mediterranean climatic regime especially for the low altitude sites with hot dry summers and mild wet winters lionello et al 2006 the apuan alps represent one of the rainiest areas in the italian peninsula and in the mediterranean area the proximity to the sea and the peculiar orography of the chain characterized by steep slopes induce the lifting of humid air masses and their rapid adiabatic cooling this results in high precipitation of about 2500 mm year with peaks up to 3000 mm year in the areas close to the major ridges doveri et al 2019a doveri et al 2019b and references therein the average rainfall regime is characterized by two peaks of precipitation the main one in autumn and the secondary in late winter spring bartolini et al 2018 rapetti and vittorini 1994 summer is the driest season even if short and heavy rainstorms can occur at the highest altitudes in the apuan alps area intense thunderstorms are frequent in all seasons but especially in autumn when the sea surface temperature sst is at its highest bartolini et al 2014a giannecchini and d amato avanzi 2012 most of the precipitation in this area derives from the arrival of atlantic frontal disturbances in the wm lionello et al 2006 which often interact with the most important cyclogenetic center of the mediterranean area the gulf of genoa reale and lionello 2013 trigo et al 2002 in this context the apuan alps and apennine reliefs act as a geographical barrier to air masses moving eastward thus triggering local cyclogenesis according to this framework the autumn winter precipitation patterns over the north western tuscany are influenced by the north atlantic oscillation nao teleconnection lópez moreno et al 2011 luppichini et al 2021 as indicated by the negative correlation between nao index and rainfall amount luppichini et al 2021 zanchetta et al 2021 congruently to the general decrease in precipitation observed in the wm ipcc 2013 a significant decrease in annual winter and spring rainfall was found in northwestern tuscany bartolini et al 2018 bartolini et al 2014b even though the tendencies are not statistically significant for many sites d oria et al 2017 the mean annual temperature is 16 c on the seaward side at sea level and 10 c at 1000 m a s l however due to the particular morphology of the reliefs and variability of exposure temperature is strongly influenced by local orographic conditions and the vertical temperature gradient is not linear with altitude doveri et al 2019a according to the general warming trend observed in the mediterranean area e g brunetti et al 2006 bartolini et al 2012 a warming trend of about 0 1 c per decade was also found in the northern tuscany bartolini et al 2008 d oria et al 2017 3 methods and materials 3 1 monitoring sites a total of 133 precipitation samples were collected from march 2019 to august 2021 at 5 monitoring sites placed in two different basins of the apuan alps fig 1 table 1 among these sites 4 are located within the apuan hilly mountainous area at different altitudes plsa pev1 pev2 plrl whereas plpt is the only station placed in the plain between the apuan alps and the sea sites were selected to investigate the d excess variability at different altitudes in order to discern the possible influence of local processes in the southern basin named baccatoio stream basin both single rain events and monthly precipitations were collected from march 2020 may 2020 to june august 2021 respectively at two different altitudes plpt 4 5 m a s l and plsa 660 m a s l in the northern basin named frigido river basin only monthly precipitations were monitored at three different altitudes pev1 160 m a s l and pev2 765 m a s l from march 2019 to august 2021 whereas rainfall at plrl 315 m a s l were sampled from november 2020 to august 2021 3 2 sampling and meteorological data 19 single rain events were sampled both at plpt and plsa the sampling procedures complied with the regulations provided by the iaea iaea 2014 for the gnip network rain samplers were tube dip in water collectors palmex rs1 equipped with 3l plastic bottles and 13 5 cm funnel fig s1 the reliability of anti evaporative system of this sampler has been proven by previous works gröning et al 2012 michelsen et al 2018 in some cases rain samples were collected immediately after the end of rainfall to avoid mixing with later events and then stored in 50 ml hdpe high density polyethylene bottles with waterproof seals in all other cases sampling was performed within 24 h after the end of rain the total events precipitation amount mm was calculated as the ratio between the collected water volume and surface area of funnel however hourly records of precipitation were derived from stations of the tuscany region hydrologic service sir https www sir toscana it that were as close as possible to the rain collectors and at similar altitude fig 1 table s1 hourly air temperature was measured at both sites using a diver baro probe schlumberger water services with an accuracy of 0 1 c the hourly meteorological records were then averaged for each precipitation event monthly precipitations were also collected at plpt and plsa using two tube dip in water collectors fig s1 a palmex rs2 was used at plpt being equipped with a 10 l plastic bottle and 13 5 cm funnel a smaller 6 l bottle was placed during the drier months to minimize the air water ratio inside the bottle a 10 l home made sampler assembled according to iaea prescriptions iaea 2014 was used at plsa with a 20 cm funnel the monthly sample collected at plpt in april 2021 was not analyzed because the rain collector was found clogged by fine materials thus preventing an adequate sample collection moreover we decided to discard the july 2021 sample whose d excess value was 0 due to probable secondary evaporation inside the bottle in view of the very low precipitation amount 0 05 l ca 3 mm harvey 2005 harvey and welker 2000 welker 2000 a different sampling method was set up in the other test area in which oil collectors were adopted to collect monthly precipitation at pev1 pev2 and plrl fig s1 10 l bottles were used in all cases with funnels of 15 5 10 0 and 18 0 cm respectively a thin layer of paraffin oil ca 0 3 l was added to bottles before each sampling period to prevent evaporation oil was accurately separated by using separatory funnels iaea 2014 in order to avoid the presence of oil fractions in the water samples that can create various issues for laboratory analysis oil may contaminate the mass spectrometer and its periphery and possible spectral contamination may occur using laser spectroscopy gröning et al 2012 iaea 2014 unfortunately two monthly samples are missing from pev1 july and october 2020 and pev2 march and july 2020 the total precipitation amount during each month was measured by subtracting the initial weight of bottle with oil from the final weight temperature data were obtained in situ for pev1 from the website meteoapuane https www meteoapuane it whereas data for pev2 and plrl were derived from the closest sir station fig 1 table s1 hourly temperature was also registered at plrl by a diver baro probe schlumberger water services with an accuracy of 0 1 c aliquots from precipitation samples were transferred in 50 ml double sealing hdpe bottles and kept at a temperature of about 4 c before the analysis 3 3 isotopic analysis the 18o 16o and 2h h isotopic ratios of precipitation samples were determined at two different laboratories samples collected before december 2020 were analyzed at the institute of geosciences and earth resources of the national research council igg cnr of pisa samples collected starting from january 2021 were analyzed at the laboratory of fluid geochemistry of the university of florence a selection of samples was analyzed at both laboratories in order to verify the congruence of the entire dataset table s2 oxygen isotope composition was measured at igg cnr by the water co2 equilibration technique epstein and mayeda 1953 followed by the analysis of co2 using a finnigan mat 252 mass spectrometer irms a los gatos research lgr liquid water isotope analyzer based on the off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy technique lis et al 2008 was used at igg cnr to determine the hydrogen isotope composition irms was used for δ18o because some randomly distributed errors were detected for lgr results during the analyses of secondary standard and replicated samples for δ2h laboratory tests revealed that lgr data were more consistent than irms method and characterized by high reproducibility the 18o 16o and 2h h isotopic ratios of other samples were determined at university of florence using a picarro l2130 i analyzer based on cavity ring down spectroscopy crds picarro s chemcorrect post processing software was used to analyze the spectral features of each water sample and to determine whether the analysis was compromised by organic molecules e g paraffin oil the data are expressed as δ compared to the international reference standard v smow total error was within 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h for all methods all the laboratories ran isotopic reference materials spanning isotope scales of interest and calibrated them with internationally distributed isotopic reference materials obtained from iaea to the vsmow slap scale an internal lab standard was run several times among samples as a check on the instrumentation d excess was calculated by dansgaard s equation dansgaard 1964 using the relationship d δ2h 8 δ18o error propagation for d excess was calculated according to formula 1 and it resulted in an error of about 1 8 by using the total errors of 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h 1 u d e x c u δ 2 h 2 8 2 u δ 18 o 2 2 8 u δ 18 o 1 80 where u is the error associated to the isotopic parameters 3 4 statistics and lmwl computation statistical analyses were performed using r 4 1 2 all the standard deviations calculated were given at 1σ spearman s rank correlation analysis was applied to summarize the strength and direction negative or positive of the relationships between the d excess of precipitation and the meteorological variables the classification proposed in fowler et al 2009 was used to describe the strength of the correlation beside arithmetic means amount weighted isotopic composition δ18ow δ2hw and d excessw at event and monthly scales was also calculated for each monitoring site using the amount of water l measured in the rain collectors as shown in equation 2 2 δ i i 1 n δ i p i i 1 n p i where δi is the isotopic composition δ18o δ2h and d excess of a single event or month with precipitation amount of pi n is the total number of events or months in the monitoring period lmwls were computed at each site on event based and monthly data by applying the reduced major axis regression rma this technique proved to be suitable to fit the isotope data of precipitation crawford et al 2014 precipitation weighted regressions were not computed because we were not interested in hydrologically significant precipitation but rather in understanding the atmospheric and hydrometeorological processes that govern the isotopic composition of precipitation diagrams and plots were drawn by using the software grapher 19 goldensoftware llc 4 results 4 1 δ18o δ2h and d excess of single rain events meteorological and isotope data of 19 single rain events sampled at both plpt and plsa are reported in table s3 along with information about the duration of each event summary statistics of event based data are provided in table 2 precipitation amounts and temperature values during the events were different at the two sites with plsa experiencing a wetter and colder climate with respect to plpt which is placed at lower altitude in the plain as expected temperature during events was always higher at plpt than plsa with a mean difference of δt of 4 4 1 1 c n 19 whereas rain amounts were higher at plsa except for three summer events e4 e5 and e19 when higher precipitation occurred at plpt fig 2 a table s3 precipitation amounts were variable among rain events ranging from a minimum of 5 mm and 11 mm to a maximum of 129 mm and 171 mm respectively at plpt and plsa two long and very rainy events were sampled in winter period djf but plentiful events also occurred in spring mam summer jja and autumn son the weakest events were always sampled in summer and autumn table s3 inter event temperature was also variable from a minimum of 4 8 c and 9 1 c to a maximum of 19 2 c and 25 2 c respectively at plsa and plpt table 2 the coldest events occurred in winter and spring whereas atmospheric temperature was higher during autumn and summer events table 3 δ18o and δ2h was systematically more negative at plsa than plpt table s3 fig 2a except for the event collected in june 2021 e19 when a more depleted isotopic composition was registered at plpt the arithmetic mean δ18o of all sampled events was 6 09 at plsa and 4 96 at plpt table 2 the arithmetic means were more positive than amount weighted mean δ18o at both sites that was equal to 6 46 and 5 55 respectively at plsa and plpt the difference between weighted and not weighted means was larger at plpt the δ2h values evidenced a similar pattern δ18o and δ2h values of event based samples showed a large seasonal variability at both sites fig 2a δ18o ranged from a minimum of 11 02 at plsa and 9 19 at plpt in january 2021 e14 to a maximum of 1 99 and 0 51 in march 2021 e15 the event based δ18o was also variable within the same season fig 2a even if more depleted values were generally registered in winter autumn whereas more enriched rains mostly occurred in spring summer table 3 the winter events showed on average the most depleted δ18o value equal to 7 31 and 9 03 respectively at plpt and plsa whereas the most enriched rains occurred in spring with a arithmetic mean δ18o of 3 05 at plpt and 4 45 at plsa in respect of the intra season δ18o variability of rain events it is worth noting the presence of two strongly δ18o depleted events in summer e4 and e5 showing isotopic values typical of winter or autumn precipitation the d excess parameter was systematically higher at plsa than plpt fig 2b except for the event collected in june 2020 e4 when d excess was comparable at two sites the arithmetic mean d excess of all sampled events was 10 8 and 13 7 at plpt and plsa respectively table 2 and the amount weighted mean values was 0 6 0 5 higher than arithmetic ones however differences between weighted and not weighted means may be not significant since the error associated to the d excess 1 8 was about three times higher the event based d excess showed an evident seasonal variability at both sites fig 2b ranging from a minimum of 7 1 and 10 0 in march 2020 e1 to a maximum of 19 9 and 21 2 in october 2020 e9 respectively at plpt and plsa higher d excess values were measured in autumn and early winter events whereas lower values were registered in spring and summer table 3 the autumn events showed on average the highest d excess 13 7 at plpt whereas the winter d excess was the highest at plsa 15 8 moreover d excess also widely varied among events sampled within a single season or month fig 2b as clearly indicated by the five events collected from september to october 2020 e7 e8 e9 e10 and e11 it is worth noting that two spring events e15 and e16 sampled at plsa showed very high d excess compared to the seasonal mean 4 2 δ18o δ2h and d excess of monthly precipitation meteorological and isotope data of monthly precipitations collected at five sites in the apuan alps are reported in table s4 whereas summary statistics are provided in table 2 as shown in fig 3 meteorological and isotope data exhibited a very similar pattern at five sites even though some differences may be observed among the stations the two sites placed at lower altitudes plpt and pev1 showed the highest monthly mean temperature and the lowest precipitation amount 17 3 c and 106 mm at plpt 14 5 c and 136 mm at pev1 on the contrary the high altitude stations plsa and pev2 showed the lowest temperature 13 4 c and 13 0 c respectively and higher precipitation amounts than low altitude sites 170 mm and 179 mm respectively plrl was placed at an intermediate altitude compared to other sites and it showed an intermediate mean temperature 13 7 c but the highest rain amount 185 mm however the monitoring periods were different at five stations which prevent the direct comparison of means monthly precipitation amounts were variable over the monitoring period at all sites fig 3 table 3 most of precipitation occurred in winter that showed the highest rain amounts followed by autumn and spring the rainiest months during the investigation period were november 2019 december 2020 and january 2021 summer was the driest season at all sites the atmospheric temperature also showed expected seasonal fluctuations fig 3 with lower temperatures registered in winter and higher temperatures in summer as shown in fig 3 the δ18o and δ2h showed a trend from more positive values to more negative values moving from low altitude sites to stations placed at a higher altitude plpt exhibited the most enriched oxygen isotopic composition with a mean value of 4 35 whereas pev2 showed the most depleted mean δ18o equal to 5 69 table 2 precipitation collected at plpt showed the most enriched δ18o values during the entire monitoring period except for june 2021 when a more negative δ18o was registered at this site the amount weighted mean δ18o values were more negative than arithmetic means at all sites table 2 with differences ranging from a minimum of 0 86 at plrl to a maximum of 1 45 at plpt δ18o and δ2h values of monthly precipitation also showed a large seasonal variability at all sites fig 3 which roughly followed the mean monthly air temperature trend and rain amount fluctuations δ18o tended to be more negative during colder and rainier periods and more positive during warmer and drier periods precipitation showed the most depleted mean oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition in winter whereas the most enriched values were registered in spring and summer table 3 as shown in fig 3 the most negative δ18o values were registered in three rainiest months nov 19 dec 20 and jan 21 at all sites which also were among the coldest of the whole period on the contrary the most positive δ18o were registered in august 2019 and march 2021 which were among the driest months the amount weighted seasonal mean δ18o was always more negative than arithmetic means at all sites with a mean difference of 0 5 the d excess of monthly precipitation was generally lower at low altitude sites than higher elevations fig 3 table 2 plpt exhibited the lowest d excess during the whole monitoring period with a mean value of 8 5 followed by pev1 and plrl which showed a mean d excess of about 10 9 and 11 7 respectively pev2 and plsa showed instead higher d excess with mean values of 12 9 and 13 7 respectively however d excess was comparable at stations in some months except for plpt which always showed lower d excess the amount weighted mean d excess was higher than arithmetic means at all sites even if differences were lower than d excess error except for plpt where the weighted mean d excess was 2 3 higher than the arithmetic one table 2 the monthly precipitation d excess also seasonally changed at all sites fig 3 the d excess trend roughly followed the temperature and precipitation trend and appeared anticorrelated with δ18o higher d excess were measured in winter and autumn rains whereas lower values were registered in spring and summer table 3 the lowest d excess was registered at plpt in march 2021 1 4 when other sites showed higher values ranging from 12 2 plrl to 15 6 plsa overall low d excess values were registered at low altitude stations during the driest months i e august 2019 november 2020 july and august 2021 5 discussion 5 1 event based and monthly lmwls the wide variability of δ18o and d excess recorded in single rain events and monthly precipitation over the apuan alps and versilia plain is consistent with the one found for monthly rainfall in tuscany natali et al 2021 and over the entire italian peninsula giustini et al 2016 longinelli and selmo 2003 stable isotopes exhibited seasonal variability figs 2 3 that is less evident for event based precipitation whose δ18o and d excess values largely varied within a single month seasonality of isotopic parameters roughly reflects trend in air temperature and precipitation amount during the investigated period the two well known temperature effect dansgaard 1964 rozanski et al 1993 and amount effect clark and fritz 1997 may be invoked to explain δ18o variations as well as seasonal changes of moisture source regions could influence the δ18o and d excess values of precipitation however the understanding of the processes that regulate the δ18o seasonal variability goes beyond the objectives of this paper the influence of local meteorological variables on the d excess in precipitation is instead discussed in section 5 3 data in the δ space fig 4 lie between the gmwl craig 1961 rozanski et al 1993 and eastern mediterranean meteoric water line emmwl gat and carmi 1970 the computed meteoric lines fig 4 table 4 overlap with the mwl for tuscany region natali et al 2021 and central italy meteoric water line cimwl by giustini et al 2016 the event based lmwl at plsa had a slope of 8 03 that is the same as that of gmwl but an higher intercept 13 9 very close to the western mediterranean meteoric water line wmmwl δ2h 8 δ18o 13 7 calculated by celle jeanton 2000 according to traditional interpretation of lmwls in the wm region e g casellas et al 2019 celle jeanton et al 2001 intercept of about 14 calculated at plsa is typical of this mediterranean area indicating the mixing of vapor coming from the mediterranean sea and the atlantic ocean however lmwl intercepts higher than 10 may be attributed to moisture continental recycling gat and matsui 1991 occurring when recycled vapor from land surfaces is mixed with oceanic vapor the event based lmwl at plpt had lower slope and intercept 7 57 and 8 62 respectively than wmmwl and gmwl as well as the monthly lmwls computed at each site fig 4 the lowest slope 6 71 and intercept 2 90 was calculated for monthly precipitation at plpt whereas the other sites were characterized by similar lmwls table 4 lower slope and intercept compared to the gmwl indicate warmer and drier climatic conditions at these sites suggesting the existence of secondary evaporation processes of raindrops beneath the cloud base during precipitation gat 2005 gonfiantini 1986 sub cloud evaporation implies that more 18o remains in the liquid phase reducing the slope of the lmwl accordingly sub cloud processes appear to be more intense at plpt as also evidenced by the lowest d excess calculated at this site plpt is the only station placed in the plain area close to the coastline right outside the mountainous area of the apuan alps where rain droplets fall a longer distance from the cloud base to the ground moreover plpt also was the warmest and less humid site increasing the possibility of raindrops evaporation even if this effect is clearly recognizable in fitting plpt monthly precipitation the event based lmwls had higher slope and intercept than monthly ones the wide difference between event based and monthly lmwls further evidences the occurrence of secondary evaporation processes which mostly affect the weaker rain events whose isotopic signature is averaged and smoothed in the monthly mean isotopic composition on the contrary the isotopic signature of weaker events is underrepresented by the event based lmwls because we generally collected the most intense rain events during each month however it is worth noting that monthly lmwls were derived in this study using records shorter than length threshold proposed by putman et al 2019 as slope and intercept may change for longer dataset considerations above discussed should be taken with caution even if other evidence support them the stronger influence of sub cloud processes on the weaker rains is clearly depicted by the large difference between the amount weighted mean δ18o and d excess with respect the arithmetic means weaker precipitations mostly occur in drier and warmer months when evaporation falling droplets is more likely and they generally have more positive δ18o and lower d excess the weighted mean δ18o and d excess are thus more negative and higher than arithmetic ones respectively because weaker precipitations have a lesser weight in the computation differences were larger at plpt indicating that below cloud evaporation is more likely in the plain area near the coastline sub cloud processes are less important at all other sites placed at higher altitude than plpt and within the mountain district of apuan alps where more precipitation and higher humidity contain evaporation of raindrops overall the derived lmwls and the d excess values highlight the mixed influence between atlantic and mediterranean moisture source in precipitation over the investigated region congruently with what has been observed for tuscany natali et al 2021 however secondary evaporation of falling droplets appears likely at all sites even if topography has an important effect on kinetic fractionation processes that act with higher intensity in coastal plain site with respect the mountain sites these processes are more pronounced when low precipitation amounts occur in a warmer atmosphere 5 2 pseudo altitude effect controls the d excess spatial variability d excess in event based and monthly precipitation largely varied among the investigated sites with higher values at higher elevations this spatial heterogeneity of d excess could be due to different moisture source regions for the five survey sites nonetheless the stations are located in a relatively small area that is generally interested by moist air masses coming from northwest to southwest zanchetta et al 2021 except for local and sporadic thunderstorms events or rare disturbances coming from north or east accordingly different moisture source regions or source partitioning by altitude are unlikely for precipitation occurring on the windward side of the apuan alps this mechanism may be more likely in large mountain chains reaching very high altitudes like the himalayas and tianshan region in china tian et al 2007 tian et al 2005 where low altitude precipitation are frequently due to monsoonal southerlies whereas moisture coming from west is prevalent at high altitudes in the apuan alps the d excess spatial variability may then be due to several processes that potentially occur during the moisture transport and or at precipitation site in order to evaluate the intensity of these processes during the whole monitoring period differences in d excess δd excess were computed between sites placed in the same basin and whose data covered the same period δd excess values were therefore calculated for both single events and monthly precipitations between plpt and plsa and for monthly rains collected at pev1 and pev2 fig 5 a c event based δd excess between plsa and plpt was on average 3 0 but it widely varied among rain events fig 5a within the range 0 9 8 6 except for e4 when the d excess was comparable at two sites and δd excess was near zero considering the error associated to d excess equal to 1 8 all the events showed a significant δd excess between plsa and plpt except for four events when it ranged from 0 2 to 1 3 e4 e7 e8 and e9 monthly δd excess for plpt plsa followed a similar trend fig 5b ranging from a minimum of 0 6 to a maximum of 14 1 with a mean value of 5 5 the maximum δd excess at plpt plsa was computed in march 2021 for both event based and monthly precipitation respectively of 8 6 and 14 1 when very weak rains occurred at plpt compared to plsa albeit ascribable to the same atmospheric disturbance on the contrary δd excess was lower in june 2021 when low precipitations also occurred but they were higher at plpt than plsa the greater the ratio between the precipitation amount at plsa with respect to that at plpt i e the greater the difference in precipitation between plsa and plpt the greater the δd excess fig s2 congruently to the lmwls computed for plpt and plsa table 4 these data indicate sub cloud evaporation as one of the processes potentially driving the differences in d excess between low and high altitude sites precipitation is generally more abundant at high altitude and raindrops fall a shorter distance between the cloud base and the ground thus limiting secondary evaporation droplets may also have a larger diameter at high altitude which is a further important factor controlling sub cloud evaporation wang et al 2016 on the contrary the longer distance crossed by raindrops at low altitude where air temperature is higher and precipitation amounts are lower increases the probability of non equilibrium kinetic fractionation during the fall decreasing the d excess values in precipitation at plpt and increasing δd excess values monthly δd excess for pev1 pev2 also largely varied fig 5c with a mean δd excess of 1 8 even though it was comparable to d excess error in many cases overall δd excess for pev1 pev2 varied in a narrower interval with respect plpt plsa that is reasonably due to the different geographical location of these two rain collectors compared to plpt plsa pev1 is located at higher altitude than plpt within the mountainous district of the apuan alps whereas plpt is placed in the plain area a few kilometres far from the coastline this results in climatic and meteorological conditions significantly different despite the short distance between two sites therefore the lower δd excess values observed for pev1 pev2 may be related to a reduction in sub cloud evaporation at pev1 with respect plpt whereas no relevant difference is evidenced between plsa and pev2 that are located at similar elevation positive δd excess values between high and low altitude sites imply a positive relationship between d excess and elevation which is known as pseudo altitude effect e g bershaw and lechler 2019 liotta et al 2006 masiol et al 2021 natali et al 2021 based on data hitherto discussed this effect is arguably ascribable to a sub cloud evaporation model in order to compute the relationship between d excess and elevation in the study area we selected only months from november 2020 to august 2021 when monthly precipitations were collected at all sites as shown in fig 5d a vertical d excess gradient was found with positive values for all months during the investigated period however the linear relationship between altitude and d excess in precipitation was significant p value 0 05 only in november 2020 december 2020 january and may 2021 with values ranging from 0 35 100 m to 1 1 100 m and r2 values always higher than 0 8 as also observed for δd excess values no seasonal dependence is evidenced by the trend of d excess vertical gradient indicating more local processes controlling the spatial variability of d excess two ordinary least square regressions olsr were applied to arithmetic mean d excess and amount weighted mean d excess calculated for each site fig 6 a we found two very strong positive relationships and significant at 99 p value 0 01 between d excess and elevation of about 0 73 100 m for arithmetic means and of about 0 51 100 m for amount weighted means these relationships are consistent with those found in precipitation over tuscany natali et al 2021 and in northeast italy masiol et al 2021 even though lower correlations were found by these authors similar gradients were calculated by authors of this paper for two single rain events collected in 2018 2019 along an elevation transect in one of two studied basins baccatoio stream basin table s5 precipitations were collected at three different altitudes 4 5 260 and 660 m a s l the first and third one being the same as in this research during two events in may 2018 and april 2019 d excess vertical gradients were computed of about 0 83 100 m r2 0 81 and 0 66 100 m r2 0 98 respectively table s5 positive relationships between altitude and d excess in precipitation but also in rivers and groundwater have been observed globally on the windward side of mountain ranges e g bershaw and lechler 2019 froehlich et al 2008 liotta et al 2006 and they are consistent with a process like sub cloud evaporation that appears to be the most important process controlling the d excess spatial variability in the mountainous areas therefore the pseudo altitude effect here observed is primarily determined by the intensity of secondary evaporation processes occurring during precipitation the lower d excess gradient calculated by amount weighted means indicates once again the large influence of sub cloud processes on the weaker precipitation whose lower d excess values have a lesser weight in the computation however other processes as recycling of continental moisture at higher altitude sites or seeder feeder mechanism liotta et al 2006 may not be totally excluded although these processes are more likely to occur sporadically and therefore they are not able to control the d excess local variability over long time periods 5 3 d excess seasonality and influence of local meteorological variables the d excess seasonality observed in precipitation collected in this study is partly due to variations of rh and sst at the oceanic source lower rh and sst in winter and autumn increase the kinetic fractionation at the evaporative sources leading to higher d excess in vapor and precipitation on the contrary the higher rh and sst in summer yield lower d excess moreover d excess in summer precipitation may be further altered by sub cloud processes which should be more intense during this season when precipitation amounts are very low and temperature is higher in order to evaluate the influence of local meteorological variables on the d excess of precipitation event based monthly d excess values were plotted against event monthly mean temperature and total event monthly precipitation fig 7 and a spearman s correlation analysis was performed no correlation was found between event based d excess and meteorological variables fig 7 table 5 probably due to the large isotopic variability of single rain events a moderate to strong positive correlation was found between monthly d excess and precipitation amount fig s3 which is significant p value 0 05 at all sites spearman s correlation coefficients ranged from a minimum of 0 41 at pev1 to a maximum of 0 90 at plrl table 5 this positive correlation implies decreasing d excess values as rain amount decrease congruently to a sub cloud evaporation model moreover it is worth noting that the slope of linear relationship between monthly d excess and precipitation amount were quite similar at all mountain sites about 1 0 1 3 100 mm except for plpt where the gradient was stronger 3 5 100 mm a moderate negative correlation was also found between monthly d excess and air temperature fig s3 except for plpt spearman s correlation coefficients ranged from a minimum of 0 34 at pev1 to a maximum of 0 83 at plrl table 5 this negative relationship implies decreasing d excess values as temperature increase which once again prove the greater influence of sub cloud processes at warmer sites and during warmer seasons overall the d excess seasonal variability is partly controlled by changes in sst and rh at the moisture sources but also by the local meteorological variables whose effect overlaps and potentially obscures the original d excess signature imprinted at the moisture source the seasonal patterns of d excess clearly indicate that linking high d excess values to mediterranean moisture without thorough discussion may lead to erroneous and misleading interpretation as a matter of fact the lower d excess commonly registered in summer precipitation over the wm could be due to a reduction in vapor mediterranean sources but also to more intense sub cloud processes in a warmer atmosphere on the other side higher winter d excess may be ascribable to drier conditions at the moisture sources but also to a reduction of sub cloud evaporation while it can be interpreted as the result of an increase in mediterranean moisture sources over the wm therefore the interpretation of d excess patterns in precipitation is often ambiguous as changes in vapor sources and processes during vapor transport affect d excess in a complex way 5 4 altitude effect and δ18o spatial variability as shown in figs 2 and 3 event based and monthly δ18o showed a marked spatial variability among the investigated sites with more depleted δ18o at higher altitudes the δ18o spatial heterogeneity may be explained by the well known altitude effect dansgaard 1964 gonfiantini et al 2001 moist air masses coming from the sea cross the versilia plain and are forced to climb up along the slopes of mountain with consequent rapid cooling and adiabatic expansion during this process equilibrium isotopic fractionations occur and vapor progressively becomes depleted in heavy isotopes this results in an inverse relationship between δ18o and elevation on the windward side of chain with decreasing δ18o values as altitude increases congruently to a rayleigh distillation model of air mass depletion rowley and garzione 2007 in order to evaluate the intensity of the altitude effect during the whole monitoring period differences in δ18o δδ18o were calculated for both single events and monthly precipitations between plpt and plsa and for monthly rains collected at pev1 and pev2 δδ18o was always higher than the analytical error associated to δ18o measurements pointing it as actual and not imputable to analytical errors as shown in fig 8 a the event based δδ18o between plsa and plpt was quite variable among rain events ranging from 0 6 to 2 5 with a mean value of 1 1 the event e19 was the only one showing a positive δδ18o of 2 2 being also one of the three events when rain amounts were larger at plpt monthly δδ18o for plpt plsa exhibited a similar pattern fig 8b ranging from 0 7 to 3 8 and a mean value of 1 2 june 2021 was the only month having a positive δδ18o of 2 0 congruently to the event e19 collected in the same month that accounted for most of fallen precipitation the positive relationship between δ18o and altitude in this month can be attributed to a rainstorm coming from east and rapidly crossing the apuan alps discharging most of the rain into the plain in front of the sea fig s4 consequently precipitations collected at plpt were depleted in heavy isotopes than plsa on the other side the maximum δδ18o for plpt plsa was computed in march 2021 both for event based and monthly data when very weak rains occurred at plpt compared to plsa even if they were ascribable to the same event a strong evaporation of raindrops could then explain the more positive isotopic composition registered at plpt as also indicated by the largest δd excess calculated in this month however the monthly δδ18o for plpt plsa was relatively constant and not depending on season except for two aforesaid extremes monthly δδ18o for pev1 pev2 also varied within a similar interval fig 8c with a mean δδ18o of 0 9 δδ18o was positive only for three months in two of which precipitation was higher at the low altitude site pev1 the isotopic vertical gradient also known as isotopic lapse rate bershaw and lechler 2019 is a useful parameter generally used in hydrogeology to characterize the recharge areas of aquifers doveri et al 2013 doveri and mussi 2014 liotta et al 2013 paternoster et al 2008 as for the d excess in order to compute the monthly δ18o vertical gradient for the investigated area we selected only months from november 2020 to august 2021 when monthly precipitations were collected at all sites as shown in fig 8d the δ18o vertical gradient was relatively variable during the investigated period with negative values for most of months except summer when the gradient was null and no linear relationship was found however the linear relationship was not significant n 5 for each month p value 0 05 for most of months even if r2 was always 0 6 the gradient was significant only in december 2020 january and may 2021 with values from 0 17 100 m to 0 20 100 m when precipitations were more abundant the absence of gradient in summer months may be imputable to uneven rainstorms occurring only at certain sites resulting in spatially different δ18o values that were not controlled by the altitude effect on the contrary strong and significant δ18o vertical gradients were revealed during very rainy months december 2020 january and may 2021 when precipitations were linked to large scale atmospheric disturbances which interested the whole study area in order to compute the mean δ18o vertical gradient for the investigation period two linear regressions were applied to arithmetic mean δ18o and amount weighted mean δ18o calculated for each site even if the relationships were not significant in both cases δ18o vertical gradients of 0 16 100 m and 0 12 100 m were computed respectively for arithmetic and weighted mean δ18o fig 6b such values were consistent with those previously calculated in the apuan alps area doveri et al 2021 2013 mussi et al 1998 by applying the so called small springs method doveri and mussi 2014 vespasiano et al 2015 it is worth noting that the δ18o vertical gradient computed by amount weighted means is more suitable to identify the recharge areas of groundwater since more abundant precipitations are responsible of higher infiltration into aquifers and therefore they should weight more in the computation of the gradient 5 5 implications for using the d excess as tracer of moisture source and water resources fate data presented in this study have some implications for using the d excess parameter as reliable tracer of moisture source and water resources fate in the wm based on these findings more caution should be paid when interpreting d excess variability in precipitation over the wm as the result of mixing and or shifting between mediterranean and atlantic sources of moisture local processes can largely modify the original d excess signature imprinted at the moisture source especially across elevation transects where sub cloud evaporation is the main process controlling the d excess spatial variability in the event that the d excess is mostly altered by raindrops evaporations below the clouds as indicated by data here presented precipitation at high altitude should be preferred to derive information about the vapor sources as a matter of fact precipitation at coastal and plain sites may experience strong sub cloud evaporation thus lowering their d excess according to this interpretation the mediterranean sea confirm to be an important supplier of moisture to precipitation over the wm especially in autumn and winter when d excess was high at high altitude sites nonetheless sub cloud processes may also act at mountain sites in addition to other processes able to increase the d excess values e g continental moisture recycling seeder feeder mechanism contributions from fog or upper stratospheric tropospheric vapor winter snow events at high altitude sites may also be responsible of high d excess values in precipitation researchers should be careful during monitoring and discard those meteoric events or months potentially affected by snow precipitations in this study the maximum altitude of rain collectors was 765 m a s l but snow events are not so frequent at this altitude in the mediterranean therefore rain collectors placed at altitudes between about 500 and 1000 m a s l could be suitable to minimize the effect of sub cloud processes and to avoid snow precipitations however as also observed by juhlke et al 2019 the notion of mediterranean moisture as the only explanation for relatively high d excess values appears imprecise and quite speculative on the other side the strong positive relationship between elevation and d excess in precipitation over the study area appears to be suitable in order to characterize the recharge areas of groundwater the δ18o vertical gradient in precipitation and or in low yield springs is already widely adopted in hydrogeological field to identify the mean recharge altitudes of aquifers e g doveri et al 2021 doveri and mussi 2014 liotta et al 2013 paternoster et al 2008 likewise the d excess vertical gradient in precipitation could be used for the same goal as surface and groundwater fed at different altitudes should also exhibit increasing d excess values as altitude increase further investigations could highlight how the combined use of the δ18o vertical gradient and the d excess vertical gradient could increase the possibility of discerning the recharge areas of groundwater as a matter of fact we could have different d excess values for the same δ18o values depending on specific local conditions moreover the d excess seasonality observed in precipitation could be a useful tool to characterize hydrodynamics of aquifer systems and to reveal their dependence on seasonal recharge doveri et al 2019b 6 conclusions results obtained in this study may be generalized to other regions in the mediterranean and arid or semi arid regions in the world especially along windward sides of mountains and they are useful to infer possibly common hydrometeorological processes the spatial variability of δ18o and d excess over the apuan alps and the versilia coastal plain is mostly due to local processes involving topography and altitude event based and monthly lmwls indicate the mixing of atlantic and mediterranean moisture sources in generating precipitation over this area of wm although sub cloud processes involving non equilibrium kinetic fractionations play an important role at a local scale lowering the slope and intercept values of lmwl long term monitoring at these sites would be important to produce isotope records long enough to have more stable and reliable lmwl slope and intercept values a linear relationship between elevation and d excess in precipitation was found over the investigated area with increasing d excess values as altitude increases this pseudo altitude effect is primarily due to subcloud evaporation which implies secondary kinetic evaporation of raindrops during their fall through an unsaturated air column this influences their original isotopic composition resulting in an enrichment of heavy isotopes and a decrease of d excess this process is more pronounced at low altitude especially in the coastal and plain area whereas its effect is less evident at higher altitudes due to the shorter distance between the cloud base and the ground as well as the lower temperature and the higher rainfall amounts contain sub cloud evaporation these findings evidence that d excess parameter is highly sensitive to topography and local climatology therefore more caution should be observed when interpreting d excess variability in precipitation as the result of different source regions of moisture influencing a specific area local processes can largely modify the original d excess signature imprinted at the moisture source especially across elevation transects where sub cloud evaporation is the main process controlling the d excess spatial variability findings from this work indicate that precipitation at mountain sites should be preferred to derive information about the vapor sources by using the d excess according to this interpretation the mediterranean sea confirm to be an important supplier of moisture to precipitation over the wm furthermore the strong positive relationship between elevation and d excess in precipitation over the study area together with the δ18o vertical gradient appears to be suitable in order to characterize the recharge areas of groundwater as surface and groundwater fed at different altitudes should exhibit increasing d excess values as altitude increase the combined use of the δ18o and d excess vertical gradient could be a promising approach to better constrain the recharge areas of aquifer systems in mountain environments credit authorship contribution statement stefano natali conceptualization methodology validation formal analysis

2811,under the double pressure of ecological vulnerability and economic development natural resources and ecological environment have become the key constraints to the development of the yellow river basin yrb this paper proposed a theoretical framework for the relationship between water energy food wef and poverty an improved coupling coordination degree model and the geographical detector were used to evaluate the spatio temporal coupling between wef and poverty and its influencing factors in yrb the results suggest that the levels of coupling coordination increase to different degrees in yrb and its provinces from 2000 to 2019 and the coupling types are characterized by pyramidal shaped distribution the regions of yrb are divided into four development types water driven type energy driven type food driven type and economy driven type spatially a dominant factor zone is formed with a multi polar core furthermore some practical suggestions are put forward to promote the effective utilization of water resources and high quality development according to specific regional situations in yrb this study will promote coupling coordination and high quality development in yrb providing a reference for the coordination of the human land relationship and regional sustainable development keywords water energy food wef poverty nighttime light improved coupling coordination degree geographic detector model the yellow river basin yrb data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction poverty eradication is the primary goal of the un s 2030 sustainable development goals sdgs steele et al 2017 global demand for water food and energy is projected to increase by 55 60 and 80 by 2050 respectively compared to current demand zhang and chen 2019 water energy and food are essential for human ecological well being and sustainable development jalilov et al 2016 hao et al 2022 the united nations four sustainable development goals of no poverty zero hunger clean water and sanitation and affordable clean energy iisd 2020 pose challenges for policymakers guo et al 2022 the surging covid 19 pandemic and natural disasters have significantly impacted food production and energy supply since 2020 in particular the economic slowdown caused by covid 19 pandemic and the disruption in the food value chain have exacerbated the poverty level mccallum et al 2022 meanwhile china s 14th five year plan released in march 2021 set out a series of important development strategies for the high quality development of water energy and food in china qian and liang 2021 due to the lack of data availability in specific regions e g tibet and the difficulty of penetrating fine granularity some of the studies cannot interpret reality and meet the requirement of rapid and dynamic precision mccallum et al 2022 moreover the lack of statistical data on poverty in china and the inconsistency of statistical caliber in different provinces add difficulty to obtaining poverty identification data especially in remote western areas regional differences deviations in statistical data and the others in poor areas will also skew the reality of poverty poverty level relies heavily on survey data which are time consuming and expensive to obtain scholars have begun to use nighttime light data to assess poverty noor et al 2008 jean et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 nighttime light data due to its long time series accessibility and objectivity are effective in estimating socio economic parameters and have been widely used in the fields of economic growth souknilanh et al 2015 levin et al 2020 urban shrinkage or expansion yang et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 and carbon emissions du et al 2021 fang et al 2022 nighttime light index measures the intensity of artificial light sources at night which is deemed an important measure of economic strength and negatively correlated with poverty distribution the scarcity of artificial light at night is considered a sign of relative poverty in the region studies have employed nighttime light data to identify poverty and suggested a high correlation between poverty and nighttime light intensity noor et al 2008 pan et al 2018 shi et al 2020 the study of poverty research from a geographical perspective focuses on the relationship between resource endowment and poverty as the natural resources available to the poor are directly related to the income of the population mccallum et al 2022 the studies on poverty factor in water energy and food have received growing attention over the past few decades sullivan 2002 attempted to link water and poverty through the water poverty index ward and kaczan 2014 concluded that landscape and scale are essential for understanding the linkage between water and poverty pachauris et al 2004 proposed a two dimensional approach to assess energy poverty in terms of accessibility and quality of consumption moegi and shunsuke 2022 revealed the impact of socio economic factors on household energy poverty philip et al 2021 explored the net impact of energy poverty and renewable energy transition on development outcomes yacob et al 2016 assessed the vulnerability of food poverty based on household expectations of future food expenditure olawale and tunrayo 2018 captured the relationship between rainfall and food poverty to evaluate the vulnerability of the agricultural economy to climate change unfortunately there have been no studies that directly address the relationship between wef system and poverty at present scholars are focusing on the interaction between wef and the external environment han et al 2022 climate change land use and other natural factors are closely linked to the wef system destouni et al 2013 ozturk 2017 yue et al 2021 and any changes in factors will inevitably affect the wef system shi et al 2020 yoon et al 2022 for example qin et al 2022 evaluated the water energy food ecology system pressure using the projection pursuit model and the virtual water trade concept which revealed the transmission of pressure meanwhile social factors e g population size economic trade and rapid urbanization also have a critical impact on the wef nexus system ouyang et al 2021 putra et al 2020 identified underlying synergies and trade offs within and among the wef sectors based on the quantitative analysis zhang et al 2022 built a food energy water nexus framework from the lens of sdgs and quantitatively analyzed two way interactions between the six sectors additionally the relationship between wef and policy has also been recognized huntington et al 2021 emphasized that transportation and governance also play a major role in determining food energy water security therefore there is an urgent need for a convenient and effective way to reflect the relationship between wef system and poverty considering the impact of food security water scarcity and inadequate electricity supply on people s livelihoods and poverty level coupling is a phenomenon in which two or more systems or two forms of motion interact with each other through various interactions so that they join forces cui et al 2019 in recent years coupling has been widely used in various fields such as urbanization economy society and ecosystem development li and yi 2020 chen and zhang 2021 li et al 2021a li et al 2021b the coupling coordination model is effective in providing information on the degree of coordination and guiding coordinated development in regions liu et al 2018 however the coefficient of the traditional coupling coordination model is subjective and has equal weight which may influence the judgment of decision makers therefore this paper introduced an improved coupling coordination model to analyze the relationship between wef systems and poverty research is limited on poverty from the angle of natural resource endowment the coupling studies between poverty and integrated systems have not attracted comprehensive attention moreover the contribution coefficients of traditional coupling coordination models are subjective which may distort the evaluation results and fail to provide proper explanations for the coordination level between systems given this a theoretical framework of wef and poverty was established with 9 provinces in the yrb as the research object this paper employed an improved coupling coordination degree model and the geographical detector method to study the coupling coordination evaluation of wef and poverty and its influencing factors in the yrb it aimed to provide a scientific basis for the government to bridge the poverty gap between regions and promote the construction of ecological civilization 2 methodology 2 1 indicator framework to evaluate the synergistic interconnection between wef and poverty in yrb we proposed a multi factor theoretical framework to represent the multifaceted challenges fig 1 the structure of the theoretical framework is divided into a two factor framework and a multi factor framework the two factor analysis framework includes water poverty energy poverty and food poverty the multi factor theoretical framework is based on the two factor framework consisting of an internal system layer of linkages among water energy and food factors and an external system layer of interconnection between the internal system layer water energy and food factors and poverty the internal system layer refers to the influence and transformation relationships among three core factors water energy and food the external system layer presents external factors such as poverty levels that have a complex impact on internal linkages the interplay of regional poverty levels and wef system creates a complex feedback mechanism this coupling coordination relationship showed the level of regional sustainable development 2 2 the weighting approach and indicator system the entropy method is a widely used weighting method the dispersion degree of each indicator is judged by calculating the entropy value and effectively eliminating the influence of subjectivity the greater the entropy value is the greater the dispersion degree is and the greater the influence of the indicator on the comprehensive evaluation is the specific calculation process had been described in the previous research for reference wang et al 2021 referring to the relevant research results of wef wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a based on the principles of scientificity accessibility and typicality this paper selected 28 indicators in three dimensions and constructed an indicator system of wef table 1 the water resource subsystem reflects the water resource level which can be measured in terms of water consumption per capita water consumption per 10 000 yuan of gdp and the proportion of ecological water in total water consumption in the energy subsystem total energy consumption energy consumption per unit of gdp and energy self sufficiency rate represent the energy status and development potential the food subsystem assesses the food situation in current regions by using the per capita food output the proportion of food sown area and the engel coefficient of urban residents 2 3 the level of wef and nighttime light index based on weight and non quantitative indicators the comprehensive evaluation of wef system is calculated as follows 1 wef i 1 n y ij w i where yij is the normalized value of the indicators i in the jth year wi is the weighting value of indicator i and n is the number of indicators for wef system nighttime light data reflect the socio economic situation in regions which has been employed to assess the poverty level in a given region elvidge et al 2009 wang et al 2012 this paper constructed nli for light intensity in different regions to indicate the difference in poverty level namely 2 nli p 1 p dn p p where p is the number of pixel in provinces dnp means the digital number value grey value of pth pixel the stronger the light intensity at night the better the economic development and the lower the poverty level and vice versa 2 4 coupling coordination model 2 4 1 traditional coupling coordination model the coupling coordination degree model can quantitatively evaluate the coordination degree of coupling between two or more systems or the nonlinear relationship between multiple disciplines and systems li et al 2012 in this study the coupling coordination model of wef and poverty i e nighttime light index was established based on the meaning of coupling in physics the formula is as follows 3 c wef n l i k α w e f β n l i 2 k 4 d c α w e f β n l i where c is the coupling degree between wef and poverty and 0 c 1 d is the degree of the coupling coordination between wef and poverty α and β are contribution coefficients and α β 1 based on the theory of sustainable development wef composite index level and poverty index level are equally important in this paper that is α β 0 5 and k 5 wef and nli represent the performance level of wef composite system and poverty system 2 4 2 improved coupling coordination model in the traditional coupling coordination model the contribution coefficients α and β are defined as subjective coefficients to which equal values are assigned the synergetic theory reveals the mechanism of dynamic change between two systems haken 1983 a higher coordination degree represents a stronger coupling state between two systems the way to improve the coupling degree of two systems is either to reduce the coupling degree of the more developed system or to increase the coupling degree of the less developed system the latter is deemed a better choice meaning that the less developed system should be given a higher weight to demonstrate its importance promoting the development of the less developed system and achieving a higher coupling coordination development based on the above theory the new contribution coefficient α and β for wef system and poverty in this study can be determined by eq 5 6 the improved coupling coordination degree between wef and poverty is assessed by usingeq 7 8 shen et al 2018 the equations are as follows 5 α nli wef n l i 6 β w e f wef n l i 7 c w e f n l i k α w e f β n l i 2 k 8 d c α w e f β n l i where c is the degree of the improved coupling between wef and poverty and d is the degree of the improved coupling coordination between wef and poverty a uniform function method was used to coordinate wef and poverty zhang and chen 2019 li and yi 2020 the framework includes 10 phases ranging from unbalance to high level coordination table 2 2 5 geographical detector model to capture the spatial heterogeneity of influence factors the geographical detector is used to identify the spatial heterogeneity of coupling coordination between wef and poverty and to measure the extent to which a given indicator interprets the spatial differentiation with the help of q values wang et al 2010 the calculation formula is wang et al 2016 9 q 1 i 1 n t i δ i 2 t δ 2 i 1 2 n where i is the classification or region of each indicator in the coupling coordination between wef and poverty ti and t are the numbers of units in the i region and the whole region the range of q values is 0 1 and larger values indicate more obvious in spatial heterogeneity 2 6 study area and data sources the yrb flows through qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong provinces across china s three major economic zones eastern middle and western regions yrb is not only an ecologically fragile area and a major ecological function area but also an important food producing area and an energy rich area playing a key role in the national economic and social development pattern however compared with other national strategic regions such as the beijing tianjin hebei region and the yangtze river economic belt yrb is relatively weak in terms of natural conditions geographical location and economic base and the problem of unbalanced development within the basin is prominent food and energy production in the region is constrained by water resources zhang et al 2019 the research period was from 2000 to 2019 the location of the study area is shown in fig 2 and a brief profile of the study area is provided in table 3 data used in the study mainly include 1 statistical data collected from china statistical yearbook china energy statistical yearbook china regional statistical yearbook 2001 2006 2011 2016 2020 and china water resources bulletins water resources bulletins for provincial 2001 2006 2011 2016 2020 2 the nighttime light data in 2002 2013 obtained from dmsp ols and the light values from 2012 to 2020 obtained from viirs https eogdata mines edu products vnl the spatial resolution is 1000 m 1000 m to achieve a longer time span the two datasets were fused and the viirs data were downscaled and fitted to dmsp data 3 results 3 1 performance evaluation for wef 3 1 1 performance level of wef system the overall level of wef system in yrb exhibited an upward trend with a growth rate during 2000 2019 fig 3 table s1 and the performance values ranged from 0 2529 to 0 3646 which was at a medium level it indicated that the development level of wef system in yrb was increasing and the overall development trend was good most of the regions showed a marked upward trend of fluctuation except ningxia the performance values of inner mongolia saw rapid growth reaching 0 4395 in 2019 which was influenced by the rising efficiency of water utilization and the optimization of the food subsystem in contrast the performance value of ningxia decreased from 0 3067 in 2000 to 0 2799 in 2019 which may be related to the policy of discharge standard of water pollutants for rural sewage treatment facilities gu et al 2022 the comprehensive development of wef was polarized and regionally imbalanced in yrb the performance value of qinghai rose from 0 3759 in 2000 to 0 4869 in 2019 while shandong henan and gansu showed a downward trend in the evaluation index indicating inconsistent paces of development in all regions the natural resource conditions and social economy development within yrb are diverse which affects the development level of wef 3 1 2 performance level of wef subsystem the energy subsystem of yrb had the highest performance value with an average of 0 1181 followed by the water resources subsystem and the food subsystem with values of 0 0956 and 0 0890 respectively table s2 s4 in terms of temporal change the energy subsystem exhibited the highest average growth rate of 56 80 from 0 0899 to 0 1409 followed by the food subsystem with a growth rate of 49 74 while the average growth rate of the water resources subsystem was only 26 76 from 0 0892 to 0 1130 these accord with the reality of yrb as an energy rich area in china however the relative scarcity of water reserves in yrb has led to increasing competition for energy and food production and mounting pressure on water resources the water energy and food subsystems displayed different degrees of growth across regions from 2000 to 2019 fig 4 in the water resources and energy subsystem only gansu and ningxia showed a downward trend as for the food subsystem the performance values of all regions showed an increase because yrb is the main food production area in china with a high potential for the development of agricultural production 3 2 evaluation level of improved coupling coordination the coupling coordination is calculated between wef and nighttime light index using an improved coupling coordination degree model and divided coupling coordination types based on the coupling coordination phase the improved coupling coordination degree increased by various magnitudes in all regions of yrb from 2000 to 2019 fig 5 table s5 indicating that the control level of yrb positively impacts the infrastructure development of wef as the regional poverty level decreases in 2019 the improved coupling coordination degree of shandong was above 0 8 indicating a strong interconnection between the wef and poverty the high security of the wef system with a low level of poverty promotes coordination development in shandong only qinghai and gansu had improved coupling coordination degree below 0 5 reflecting uncoordinated development between wef and poverty a low level of wef and high poverty level in these regions can effectively alleviate the poverty 3 3 spatial pattern of improved coupling coordination degree the improved coupling coordination degree between wef and poverty increased steadily in yrb from 2000 to 2019 transitioning from serious unbalance to good coordination without extreme unbalance and extreme coordination in the development process fig 6 the improved coupling coordination degree of all regions was at a low level in 2000 with the continuous development of society and economy the optimization and adjustment of resources and environment the improved coupling coordination degree of each region showed an increase but the growth rate of each province varied markedly the statistical analysis of the coupling type showed a normal distribution indicating a pyramid shaped distribution fig 7 the number of provinces in the unbalance phase was decreasing while the number of provinces in the coordination phase was increasing five provinces qinghai sichuan gansu inner mongolia and shaanxi were in unbalance phase in 2000 and all provinces had been out of the unbalance phase until 2019 three provinces were in the coordinated development type shanxi henan and shandong and the rest were in the transitional development type therefore a symbiotic relationship between wef and poverty is clear alleviating the wef crisis can effectively reduce the pressure of economic poverty and poverty alleviation support to coordination development of ecological environment chen et al 2021 pan et al 2022 at the provincial scale the improved coupling coordination degree of qinghai inner mongolia henan shandong and shaanxi exhibited relatively fast growth rates during 2000 2019 with a positive development trend gansu shanxi and sichuan were on the rise the improved coupling coordination degree growing slowly but steadily the improved coupling coordination degree of ningxia rose to various degrees during the study period with an overall slow growing trend with the development of social economy and technology all regions are facing environmental problems and resource pressure while actively addressing resource problems the improvement of water use efficiency energy efficiency and food production unit area have relieved the wef demand and resource pressure brought by population growth and economic development 3 4 influencing factors of improved coupling coordination degree the coupling between wef and poverty in yrb is characterized by significant spatial heterogeneity likely due to the diverse absorption of spillover effects caused by various factors such as resources economy and industry therefore the geographical detector model was used to identify the main driving factors of the coupling relationship between wef and poverty in yrb and to measure the degree of explanation of the spatial differentiation by an indicator with the aid of q value the selected 29 influencing factors including x1 x28 in the wef system and x29 representing nighttime light index are classified into five types by using the natural breakpoint method in gis software and the influencing factor data were discrete into type variables the improved coupling coordination degree between wef and poverty was selected as the dependent variable and the above factor values and dependent variables were imported into the geographical detector model to obtain the q value of each influencing factor on the coupling degree fig 8 and table s6 each influencing factor showed fluctuating trends from 2000 to 2019 only the influencing factors of x4 water consumption per 10 000 yuan of gdp x6 the proportion of domestic water in total water consumption x24 fertilizer load x27 engel coefficient for urban residents x29 nighttime light index remained stable overall with little variation and their q values were above 0 6 with high interpretive power the dominant influencing factors on wef and poverty coupling relationship in yrb were obtained by screening through significant level of explanatory power and high impact factors from 2000 to 2019 with the reference to influence ranking and occurrence frequency the magnitude of impact on coupling ranked as x4 water consumption per 10 000 yuan of gdp x5 water consumption per ten thousand yuan of industrial added value x6 the proportion of domestic water in total water consumption x9 waste water discharge x10 total energy consumption x15 the industrial waste gas emissions x16 energy self sufficiency rate x22 the proportion of food sown area x24 fertilizer load x27 engel coefficient for urban residents x29 nighttime light index to characterize the spatial differentiation of dominant influencing factors and further analyze the mechanism of each dominant factor in regional spatial differentiation spatial kriging interpolation analysis was performed using gis for interpretive mean values of the explanatory power for the period 2000 2019 fig 9 the result showed strong spatial heterogeneity and dependence in each influencing factor among different geographical areas suggesting that the multiple factors and policy instruments are required for the coordination development of yrb owing to the diverse impact of dominant factors across different regions the regional classification can provide a reference tailored to local conditions and accurate poverty alleviation implementation policies therefore four development types were classified according to the dominant factors 1 water driven type sichuan inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong are greatly affected by factors such as the amount of water used by every 10 000 yuan of industrial value added fig 9a b c d water resource conflict is a basic problem in yrb at present song et al 2018 and inseparable from the ecosystem fragility of the basin given the limited total water resources water resource demand management is critical to the socio economic development of water scarce areas yang et al 2019 the requirement for green development is to use the water resources of yrb as its capacity permits 2 energy driven type it is strongly influenced by energy consumption industrial emissions and energy self sufficiency fig 9e f g including qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia shaanxi shanxi and henan such regions mainly rely on energy development and resource utilization to promote regional development importance should be attached to the harmonious coexistence between energy transition and the ecological environment to lay a theoretical foundation for sustainable development in yrb 3 food driven type the influencing factors such as the proportion of food sown area fertilizer load and engel coefficient of urban residents play a key role including qinghai ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong fig 9h i j in such regions food security is essential for social stability and the high quality development of food industry is particularly important food supply and demand and the reform of food circulation which are key means to improve the comprehensive strength of the region 4 economy driven type the nighttime light index reflects the regional poverty level and economic level shandong and henan are mainly driven by economy fig 9k such areas should take advantage of the siphoning effect and trickle down effect in economically developed areas to vigorously develop the regional special economy promote employment and poverty alleviation and achieve economic diversification digitalization and innovation in reality spatial differentiation is a result of a combination of one or more factors therefore there are various combinations of dominant factors for the occurrence of spatial differentiation in the coupling of wef and poverty in yrb the influence of a single dominant factor has a clear mechanism of occurrence which is conductive to target poverty alleviation and precise policy implementation while the heterogeneity caused by multiple dominant factors is more complicated the government needs to adapt to local conditions the spatial differentiation is further divided into single factor two factor and multi factor dominant regions according to the number of core dominant influencing factors using cluster analysis gansu belongs to single factor dominant region qinghai ningxia and inner mongolia belong to double factor dominant region and the rest of the regions are dominated by multiple factors finally the dominant factor regions with the coexistence of a multi polar core were formed which takes hu huanyong line 1 1 the hu huanyong line is an imaginary line stretching from heihe a northern city of china located on the russian border to tengchong a southwestern city of china bordering with myanmar which divides the area of china into two roughly equal parts as the dividing line the western area is single factor and two factor dominant regions and the eastern area is multifactor dominant regions fig 10 this result indicated that the breakpoint effect on two sides of the hu huanyong line is very obvious and the development is significantly unbalanced cheng et al 2022 this not only revealed the dominant factors of spatial differentiation and the key directions for targeted poverty alleviation but also confirmed the important fact that the hu huanyong line is regarded as the dividing line between the rich and the poor in china chen et al 2019 4 discussion 4 1 scenario analysis of improved coupling coordination degree model in this work an improved coupling coordination degree model is presented to carry out a better evaluation of coupling between resources and poverty in the last decades poverty concerns have promoted the wef nexus to reduce unsustainable consumption of resources in the traditional coupling coordination degree model the contribution coefficients α and β are subjectively determined representing the weight of the system therefore the different contribution weights of each system may affect the effectiveness of the model to address this issue five scenarios i e α 0 2 β 0 8 α 0 4 β 0 6 α 0 5 β 0 5 α 0 6 β 0 4 α 0 8 β 0 2 were defined to analyze the variation of coupling coordination degree with different contribution coefficients table s7 and fig 11 significant differences were identified between the maximum minimum average and median values of coupling coordination degree under different scenarios which greatly affects the accuracy of calculation results in addition we compared the value of coupling coordination in the improved coupling coordination degree model i e scenario 6 with the above five scenarios fig 12 we find that the coupling coordination values in yrb during 2000 2019 are highest in scenario 6 yrb has been developing towards coordination between resource utilization of wef and poverty alleviation which indicates that yrb can achieve the optimum result of coupling coordination in scenario 6 the improved coupling coordination degree model is an effective method to test the coupling relationship between wef and poverty the method objectively determines the contribution coefficients which allows comparison between regions it is conducive to rational allocation of resource and can avoid polarization of sustainable development zhang et al 2021b however since the coupling coordination process is affected by the spatial scale it is difficult to scientifically reflect the coupling process between systems under a single scale 4 2 the discussion of dominant influencing factors the complexity of the interaction between wef and poverty means that the coupling coordination between wef and poverty is influenced by multiple factors identifying the dominant influencing factors affecting the coupling coordination in different periods is conducive to understanding the coupling development process fig 13 the coupling coordination was mainly influenced by x5 water consumption per ten thousand yuan of industrial added value in 2000 which is due to the limitation of economic development level and the lag of the old and new kinetic energy conversion mi et al 2021 in 2005 2010 and 2015 the coupling coordination was influenced by x4 water consumption per 10 000 yuan of gdp which is due to the increase in water consumption as the economy grows and the dominant influencing factor has changed the comprehensive plan for the yrb in 2012 stated the effective use of water resources promotes economic development wei et al 2021 the most important influence factor on the coupling coordination in 2019 was x29 nighttime light index indicating that the socio economic vitality of the regions becomes strong power for the coupling of wef and poverty the proposed ecological protection and the high quality development strategy in yrb provided the direction for sustainable development these characteristics are closely related to the economic development stage and development strategy in yrb 4 3 limitations and future research nighttime light data provide a robust and inexpensive alternative to poverty quantification through spatial distribution which is conducive to exploring regional economic inequalities in wef however poverty is a complex combination of natural and social factors as well as a social and development problem that is both absolute and relative the use of nighttime light data may be incomplete and has limitations in reflecting poverty levels when the poverty level differences are small in regions with low resolution jean et al 2016 studies have attempted to use multiple sources of data to assess poverty including combining nighttime light remote sensing technology with machine learning li et al 2019 xu et al 2021 and using nighttime light data land cover data google satellite images and others zhao et al 2019 the impact of covid 19 pandemic on poverty posed a challenge to global poverty reduction in 2020 which has led to shortcomings in the selection of indicators and the quantification of indicators follow up work will involve the calculation of poverty data after 2019 to compare the impact on poverty before and after the occurrence of covid 19 pandemic in addition combining multiple sources of data the nighttime lighting data will be further exploited to better analyze the unevenness of regional high quality development the variability of energy demand and the rationality of water resources allocation this paper focuses on the coupling synergistic relationship between wef and social factor poverty to achieve regional coordination development by promoting synergy among systems the trade offs among wef and other factors are ignored in our study the synergistic restrictive and competitive relationships of the wef system exist in china putra et al 2020 sun and hao 2022 one approach to achieving coordination development is to reduce competition between systems therefore the two way interactions of trade offs and synergistic among systems increases the uncertainty of the study results more research on the competition and constraint relationship between wef and social factors is warranted 4 4 policy implications the framework for the coupling coordination between wef and poverty provide new insights into achieving sustainable development not only in yrb but also in other regions it is imperative to use the evaluation results to guide watershed management and maintain the development of the wef system while poverty reduction our research classifies the study area into four coupling development types and specific improvement measures are formulated for each as follows 1 formulate policies adapted to local conditions and promote the development of coupling coordination since improved coupling coordination degree varies across regions control policies ought to be implemented according to the classification type of dominant factors administrative barriers should be broken down with watershed integration as the main line to explore the development path with regional characteristics 2 break the limitation of the hu huanyong line and achieve high quality development owing to the large differences in the regional development divided by the hu huanyong line the government should increase its financial support and population control in the regions to the west of the hu huanyong line it could reduce the unbalanced development of the two sides of the lines and prevent them from falling into the poverty trap to promote high quality development in the region 3 promote the conservation and intensive utilization of water resources and combine development with environmental protection water resources should be regarded as the maximum rigid constraint rationalize water demand and implement social water conservation protection measures such as ecological protection and restoration projects should be carried out in the upstream areas of the yrb to improve water conservation capacities water and soil conservation and pollution control are needed in the central regions of the yrb the downstream area should focus on promoting river ecosystem health and biodiversity 5 conclusions this study proposed a theoretical framework for the coupling coordination between wef and poverty the interaction between wef and poverty in yrb from 2000 to 2019 is evaluated using an improved coupling coordination degree model based on the nighttime light index and wef system in addition the spatial heterogeneity of the main influencing factors is studied by using the geographical detector the performance of wef and poverty has been improved from 2000 to 2019 and the improved coupling coordination degree between wef and poverty has improved steadily and gradually the types of coupling coordination varied from serious unbalance to good coordination phase with a pyramidal shaped distribution four development types were identified according to the dominant factors water driven type energy driven type food driven type and economy driven type it forms dominant factor regions with the coexistence of multi polar core spatially divided by the hu huanyong line credit authorship contribution statement yirui wang conceptualization

2811,under the double pressure of ecological vulnerability and economic development natural resources and ecological environment have become the key constraints to the development of the yellow river basin yrb this paper proposed a theoretical framework for the relationship between water energy food wef and poverty an improved coupling coordination degree model and the geographical detector were used to evaluate the spatio temporal coupling between wef and poverty and its influencing factors in yrb the results suggest that the levels of coupling coordination increase to different degrees in yrb and its provinces from 2000 to 2019 and the coupling types are characterized by pyramidal shaped distribution the regions of yrb are divided into four development types water driven type energy driven type food driven type and economy driven type spatially a dominant factor zone is formed with a multi polar core furthermore some practical suggestions are put forward to promote the effective utilization of water resources and high quality development according to specific regional situations in yrb this study will promote coupling coordination and high quality development in yrb providing a reference for the coordination of the human land relationship and regional sustainable development keywords water energy food wef poverty nighttime light improved coupling coordination degree

development goals sdgs steele et al 2017 global demand for water food and energy is projected to increase by 55 60 and 80 by 2050 respectively compared to current demand zhang and chen 2019 water energy and food are essential for human ecological well being and sustainable development jalilov et al 2016 hao et al 2022 the united nations four sustainable development goals of no poverty zero hunger clean water and sanitation and affordable clean energy iisd 2020 pose challenges for policymakers guo et al 2022 the surging covid 19 pandemic and natural disasters have significantly impacted food production and energy supply since 2020 in particular the economic slowdown caused by covid 19 pandemic and the disruption in the food value chain have exacerbated the poverty level mccallum et al 2022 meanwhile china s 14th five year plan released in march 2021 set out a series of important development strategies for the high quality development of water energy and food in china qian and liang 2021 due to the lack of data availability in specific regions e g tibet and the difficulty of penetrating fine granularity some of the studies cannot interpret reality and meet the requirement of rapid and dynamic precision mccallum et al 2022 moreover the lack of statistical data on poverty in china and the inconsistency of statistical caliber in different provinces add difficulty to obtaining poverty identification data especially in remote western areas regional differences deviations in statistical data and the others in poor areas will also skew the reality of poverty poverty level relies heavily on survey data which are time consuming and expensive to obtain scholars have begun to use nighttime light data to assess poverty noor et al 2008 jean et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 nighttime light data due to its long time series accessibility and objectivity are effective in estimating socio economic parameters and have been widely used in the fields of economic growth souknilanh et al 2015 levin et al 2020 urban shrinkage or expansion yang et al 2021 zheng et al 2022 and carbon emissions du et al 2021 fang et al 2022 nighttime light index measures the intensity of artificial light sources at night which is deemed an important measure of economic strength and negatively correlated with poverty distribution the scarcity of artificial light at night is considered a sign of relative poverty in the region studies have employed nighttime light data to identify poverty and suggested a high correlation between poverty and nighttime light intensity noor et al 2008 pan et al 2018 shi et al 2020 the study of poverty research from a geographical perspective focuses on the relationship between resource endowment and poverty as the natural resources available to the poor are directly related to the income of the population mccallum et al 2022 the studies on poverty factor in water energy and food have received growing attention over the past few decades sullivan 2002 attempted to link water and poverty through the water poverty index ward and kaczan 2014 concluded that landscape and scale are essential for understanding the linkage between water and poverty pachauris et al 2004 proposed a two dimensional approach to assess energy poverty in terms of accessibility and quality of consumption moegi and shunsuke 2022 revealed the impact of socio economic factors on household energy poverty philip et al 2021 explored the net impact of energy poverty and renewable energy transition on development outcomes yacob et al 2016 assessed the vulnerability of food poverty based on household expectations of future food expenditure olawale and tunrayo 2018 captured the relationship between rainfall and food poverty to evaluate the vulnerability of the agricultural economy to climate change unfortunately there have been no studies that directly address the relationship between wef system and poverty at present scholars are focusing on the interaction between wef and the external environment han et al 2022 climate change land use and other natural factors are closely linked to the wef system destouni et al 2013 ozturk 2017 yue et al 2021 and any changes in factors will inevitably affect the wef system shi et al 2020 yoon et al 2022 for example qin et al 2022 evaluated the water energy food ecology system pressure using the projection pursuit model and the virtual water trade concept which revealed the transmission of pressure meanwhile social factors e g population size economic trade and rapid urbanization also have a critical impact on the wef nexus system ouyang et al 2021 putra et al 2020 identified underlying synergies and trade offs within and among the wef sectors based on the quantitative analysis zhang et al 2022 built a food energy water nexus framework from the lens of sdgs and quantitatively analyzed two way interactions between the six sectors additionally the relationship between wef and policy has also been recognized huntington et al 2021 emphasized that transportation and governance also play a major role in determining food energy water security therefore there is an urgent need for a convenient and effective way to reflect the relationship between wef system and poverty considering the impact of food security water scarcity and inadequate electricity supply on people s livelihoods and poverty level coupling is a phenomenon in which two or more systems or two forms of motion interact with each other through various interactions so that they join forces cui et al 2019 in recent years coupling has been widely used in various fields such as urbanization economy society and ecosystem development li and yi 2020 chen and zhang 2021 li et al 2021a li et al 2021b the coupling coordination model is effective in providing information on the degree of coordination and guiding coordinated development in regions liu et al 2018 however the coefficient of the traditional coupling coordination model is subjective and has equal weight which may influence the judgment of decision makers therefore this paper introduced an improved coupling coordination model to analyze the relationship between wef systems and poverty research is limited on poverty from the angle of natural resource endowment the coupling studies between poverty and integrated systems have not attracted comprehensive attention moreover the contribution coefficients of traditional coupling coordination models are subjective which may distort the evaluation results and fail to provide proper explanations for the coordination level between systems given this a theoretical framework of wef and poverty was established with 9 provinces in the yrb as the research object this paper employed an improved coupling coordination degree model and the geographical detector method to study the coupling coordination evaluation of wef and poverty and its influencing factors in the yrb it aimed to provide a scientific basis for the government to bridge the poverty gap between regions and promote the construction of ecological civilization 2 methodology 2 1 indicator framework to evaluate the synergistic interconnection between wef and poverty in yrb we proposed a multi factor theoretical framework to represent the multifaceted challenges fig 1 the structure of the theoretical framework is divided into a two factor framework and a multi factor framework the two factor analysis framework includes water poverty energy poverty and food poverty the multi factor theoretical framework is based on the two factor framework consisting of an internal system layer of linkages among water energy and food factors and an external system layer of interconnection between the internal system layer water energy and food factors and poverty the internal system layer refers to the influence and transformation relationships among three core factors water energy and food the external system layer presents external factors such as poverty levels that have a complex impact on internal linkages the interplay of regional poverty levels and wef system creates a complex feedback mechanism this coupling coordination relationship showed the level of regional sustainable development 2 2 the weighting approach and indicator system the entropy method is a widely used weighting method the dispersion degree of each indicator is judged by calculating the entropy value and effectively eliminating the influence of subjectivity the greater the entropy value is the greater the dispersion degree is and the greater the influence of the indicator on the comprehensive evaluation is the specific calculation process had been described in the previous research for reference wang et al 2021 referring to the relevant research results of wef wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a based on the principles of scientificity accessibility and typicality this paper selected 28 indicators in three dimensions and constructed an indicator system of wef table 1 the water resource subsystem reflects the water resource level which can be measured in terms of water consumption per capita water consumption per 10 000 yuan of gdp and the proportion of ecological water in total water consumption in the energy subsystem total energy consumption energy consumption per unit of gdp and energy self sufficiency rate represent the energy status and development potential the food subsystem assesses the food situation in current regions by using the per capita food output the proportion of food sown area and the engel coefficient of urban residents 2 3 the level of wef and nighttime light index based on weight and non quantitative indicators the comprehensive evaluation of wef system is calculated as follows 1 wef i 1 n y ij w i where yij is the normalized value of the indicators i in the jth year wi is the weighting value of indicator i and n is the number of indicators for wef system nighttime light data reflect the socio economic situation in regions which has been employed to assess the poverty level in a given region elvidge et al 2009 wang et al 2012 this paper constructed nli for light intensity in different regions to indicate the difference in poverty level namely 2 nli p 1 p dn p p where p is the number of pixel in provinces dnp means the digital number value grey value of pth pixel the stronger the light intensity at night the better the economic development and the lower the poverty level and vice versa 2 4 coupling coordination model 2 4 1 traditional coupling coordination model the coupling coordination degree model can quantitatively evaluate the coordination degree of coupling between two or more systems or the nonlinear relationship between multiple disciplines and systems li et al 2012 in this study the coupling coordination model of wef and poverty i e nighttime light index was established based on the meaning of coupling in physics the formula is as follows 3 c wef n l i k α w e f β n l i 2 k 4 d c α w e f β n l i where c is the coupling degree between wef and poverty and 0 c 1 d is the degree of the coupling coordination between wef and poverty α and β are contribution coefficients and α β 1 based on the theory of sustainable development wef composite index level and poverty index level are equally important in this paper that is α β 0 5 and k 5 wef and nli represent the performance level of wef composite system and poverty system 2 4 2 improved coupling coordination model in the traditional coupling coordination model the contribution coefficients α and β are defined as subjective coefficients to which equal values are assigned the synergetic theory reveals the mechanism of dynamic change between two systems haken 1983 a higher coordination degree represents a stronger coupling state between two systems the way to improve the coupling degree of two systems is either to reduce the coupling degree of the more developed system or to increase the coupling degree of the less developed system the latter is deemed a better choice meaning that the less developed system should be given a higher weight to demonstrate its importance promoting the development of the less developed system and achieving a higher coupling coordination development based on the above theory the new contribution coefficient α and β for wef system and poverty in this study can be determined by eq 5 6 the improved coupling coordination degree between wef and poverty is assessed by usingeq 7 8 shen et al 2018 the equations are as follows 5 α nli wef n l i 6 β w e f wef n l i 7 c w e f n l i k α w e f β n l i 2 k 8 d c α w e f β n l i where c is the degree of the improved coupling between wef and poverty and d is the degree of the improved coupling coordination between wef and poverty a uniform function method was used to coordinate wef and poverty zhang and chen 2019 li and yi 2020 the framework includes 10 phases ranging from unbalance to high level coordination table 2 2 5 geographical detector model to capture the spatial heterogeneity of influence factors the geographical detector is used to identify the spatial heterogeneity of coupling coordination between wef and poverty and to measure the extent to which a given indicator interprets the spatial differentiation with the help of q values wang et al 2010 the calculation formula is wang et al 2016 9 q 1 i 1 n t i δ i 2 t δ 2 i 1 2 n where i is the classification or region of each indicator in the coupling coordination between wef and poverty ti and t are the numbers of units in the i region and the whole region the range of q values is 0 1 and larger values indicate more obvious in spatial heterogeneity 2 6 study area and data sources the yrb flows through qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong provinces across china s three major economic zones eastern middle and western regions yrb is not only an ecologically fragile area and a major ecological function area but also an important food producing area and an energy rich area playing a key role in the national economic and social development pattern however compared with other national strategic regions such as the beijing tianjin hebei region and the yangtze river economic belt yrb is relatively weak in terms of natural conditions geographical location and economic base and the problem of unbalanced development within the basin is prominent food and energy production in the region is constrained by water resources zhang et al 2019 the research period was from 2000 to 2019 the location of the study area is shown in fig 2 and a brief profile of the study area is provided in table 3 data used in the study mainly include 1 statistical data collected from china statistical yearbook china energy statistical yearbook china regional statistical yearbook 2001 2006 2011 2016 2020 and china water resources bulletins water resources bulletins for provincial 2001 2006 2011 2016 2020 2 the nighttime light data in 2002 2013 obtained from dmsp ols and the light values from 2012 to 2020 obtained from viirs https eogdata mines edu products vnl the spatial resolution is 1000 m 1000 m to achieve a longer time span the two datasets were fused and the viirs data were downscaled and fitted to dmsp data 3 results 3 1 performance evaluation for wef 3 1 1 performance level of wef system the overall level of wef system in yrb exhibited an upward trend with a growth rate during 2000 2019 fig 3 table s1 and the performance values ranged from 0 2529 to 0 3646 which was at a medium level it indicated that the development level of wef system in yrb was increasing and the overall development trend was good most of the regions showed a marked upward trend of fluctuation except ningxia the performance values of inner mongolia saw rapid growth reaching 0 4395 in 2019 which was influenced by the rising efficiency of water utilization and the optimization of the food subsystem in contrast the performance value of ningxia decreased from 0 3067 in 2000 to 0 2799 in 2019 which may be related to the policy of discharge standard of water pollutants for rural sewage treatment facilities gu et al 2022 the comprehensive development of wef was polarized and regionally imbalanced in yrb the performance value of qinghai rose from 0 3759 in 2000 to 0 4869 in 2019 while shandong henan and gansu showed a downward trend in the evaluation index indicating inconsistent paces of development in all regions the natural resource conditions and social economy development within yrb are diverse which affects the development level of wef 3 1 2 performance level of wef subsystem the energy subsystem of yrb had the highest performance value with an average of 0 1181 followed by the water resources subsystem and the food subsystem with values of 0 0956 and 0 0890 respectively table s2 s4 in terms of temporal change the energy subsystem exhibited the highest average growth rate of 56 80 from 0 0899 to 0 1409 followed by the food subsystem with a growth rate of 49 74 while the average growth rate of the water resources subsystem was only 26 76 from 0 0892 to 0 1130 these accord with the reality of yrb as an energy rich area in china however the relative scarcity of water reserves in yrb has led to increasing competition for energy and food production and mounting pressure on water resources the water energy and food subsystems displayed different degrees of growth across regions from 2000 to 2019 fig 4 in the water resources and energy subsystem only gansu and ningxia showed a downward trend as for the food subsystem the performance values of all regions showed an increase because yrb is the main food production area in china with a high potential for the development of agricultural production 3 2 evaluation level of improved coupling coordination the coupling coordination is calculated between wef and nighttime light index using an improved coupling coordination degree model and divided coupling coordination types based on the coupling coordination phase the improved coupling coordination degree increased by various magnitudes in all regions of yrb from 2000 to 2019 fig 5 table s5 indicating that the control level of yrb positively impacts the infrastructure development of wef as the regional poverty level decreases in 2019 the improved coupling coordination degree of shandong was above 0 8 indicating a strong interconnection between the wef and poverty the high security of the wef system with a low level of poverty promotes coordination development in shandong only qinghai and gansu had improved coupling coordination degree below 0 5 reflecting uncoordinated development between wef and poverty a low level of wef and high poverty level in these regions can effectively alleviate the poverty 3 3 spatial pattern of improved coupling coordination degree the improved coupling coordination degree between wef and poverty increased steadily in yrb from 2000 to 2019 transitioning from serious unbalance to good coordination without extreme unbalance and extreme coordination in the development process fig 6 the improved coupling coordination degree of all regions was at a low level in 2000 with the continuous development of society and economy the optimization and adjustment of resources and environment the improved coupling coordination degree of each region showed an increase but the growth rate of each province varied markedly the statistical analysis of the coupling type showed a normal distribution indicating a pyramid shaped distribution fig 7 the number of provinces in the unbalance phase was decreasing while the number of provinces in the coordination phase was increasing five provinces qinghai sichuan gansu inner mongolia and shaanxi were in unbalance phase in 2000 and all provinces had been out of the unbalance phase until 2019 three provinces were in the coordinated development type shanxi henan and shandong and the rest were in the transitional development type therefore a symbiotic relationship between wef and poverty is clear alleviating the wef crisis can effectively reduce the pressure of economic poverty and poverty alleviation support to coordination development of ecological environment chen et al 2021 pan et al 2022 at the provincial scale the improved coupling coordination degree of qinghai inner mongolia henan shandong and shaanxi exhibited relatively fast growth rates during 2000 2019 with a positive development trend gansu shanxi and sichuan were on the rise the improved coupling coordination degree growing slowly but steadily the improved coupling coordination degree of ningxia rose to various degrees during the study period with an overall slow growing trend with the development of social economy and technology all regions are facing environmental problems and resource pressure while actively addressing resource problems the improvement of water use efficiency energy efficiency and food production unit area have relieved the wef demand and resource pressure brought by population growth and economic development 3 4 influencing factors of improved coupling coordination degree the coupling between wef and poverty in yrb is characterized by significant spatial heterogeneity likely due to the diverse absorption of spillover effects caused by various factors such as resources economy and industry therefore the geographical detector model was used to identify the main driving factors of the coupling relationship between wef and poverty in yrb and to measure the degree of explanation of the spatial differentiation by an indicator with the aid of q value the selected 29 influencing factors including x1 x28 in the wef system and x29 representing nighttime light index are classified into five types by using the natural breakpoint method in gis software and the influencing factor data were discrete into type variables the improved coupling coordination degree between wef and poverty was selected as the dependent variable and the above factor values and dependent variables were imported into the geographical detector model to obtain the q value of each influencing factor on the coupling degree fig 8 and table s6 each influencing factor showed fluctuating trends from 2000 to 2019 only the influencing factors of x4 water consumption per 10 000 yuan of gdp x6 the proportion of domestic water in total water consumption x24 fertilizer load x27 engel coefficient for urban residents x29 nighttime light index remained stable overall with little variation and their q values were above 0 6 with high interpretive power the dominant influencing factors on wef and poverty coupling relationship in yrb were obtained by screening through significant level of explanatory power and high impact factors from 2000 to 2019 with the reference to influence ranking and occurrence frequency the magnitude of impact on coupling ranked as x4 water consumption per 10 000 yuan of gdp x5 water consumption per ten thousand yuan of industrial added value x6 the proportion of domestic water in total water consumption x9 waste water discharge x10 total energy consumption x15 the industrial waste gas emissions x16 energy self sufficiency rate x22 the proportion of food sown area x24 fertilizer load x27 engel coefficient for urban residents x29 nighttime light index to characterize the spatial differentiation of dominant influencing factors and further analyze the mechanism of each dominant factor in regional spatial differentiation spatial kriging interpolation analysis was performed using gis for interpretive mean values of the explanatory power for the period 2000 2019 fig 9 the result showed strong spatial heterogeneity and dependence in each influencing factor among different geographical areas suggesting that the multiple factors and policy instruments are required for the coordination development of yrb owing to the diverse impact of dominant factors across different regions the regional classification can provide a reference tailored to local conditions and accurate poverty alleviation implementation policies therefore four development types were classified according to the dominant factors 1 water driven type sichuan inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong are greatly affected by factors such as the amount of water used by every 10 000 yuan of industrial value added fig 9a b c d water resource conflict is a basic problem in yrb at present song et al 2018 and inseparable from the ecosystem fragility of the basin given the limited total water resources water resource demand management is critical to the socio economic development of water scarce areas yang et al 2019 the requirement for green development is to use the water resources of yrb as its capacity permits 2 energy driven type it is strongly influenced by energy consumption industrial emissions and energy self sufficiency fig 9e f g including qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia shaanxi shanxi and henan such regions mainly rely on energy development and resource utilization to promote regional development importance should be attached to the harmonious coexistence between energy transition and the ecological environment to lay a theoretical foundation for sustainable development in yrb 3 food driven type the influencing factors such as the proportion of food sown area fertilizer load and engel coefficient of urban residents play a key role including qinghai ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong fig 9h i j in such regions food security is essential for social stability and the high quality development of food industry is particularly important food supply and demand and the reform of food circulation which are key means to improve the comprehensive strength of the region 4 economy driven type the nighttime light index reflects the regional poverty level and economic level shandong and henan are mainly driven by economy fig 9k such areas should take advantage of the siphoning effect and trickle down effect in economically developed areas to vigorously develop the regional special economy promote employment and poverty alleviation and achieve economic diversification digitalization and innovation in reality spatial differentiation is a result of a combination of one or more factors therefore there are various combinations of dominant factors for the occurrence of spatial differentiation in the coupling of wef and poverty in yrb the influence of a single dominant factor has a clear mechanism of occurrence which is conductive to target poverty alleviation and precise policy implementation while the heterogeneity caused by multiple dominant factors is more complicated the government needs to adapt to local conditions the spatial differentiation is further divided into single factor two factor and multi factor dominant regions according to the number of core dominant influencing factors using cluster analysis gansu belongs to single factor dominant region qinghai ningxia and inner mongolia belong to double factor dominant region and the rest of the regions are dominated by multiple factors finally the dominant factor regions with the coexistence of a multi polar core were formed which takes hu huanyong line 1 1 the hu huanyong line is an imaginary line stretching from heihe a northern city of china located on the russian border to tengchong a southwestern city of china bordering with myanmar which divides the area of china into two roughly equal parts as the dividing line the western area is single factor and two factor dominant regions and the eastern area is multifactor dominant regions fig 10 this result indicated that the breakpoint effect on two sides of the hu huanyong line is very obvious and the development is significantly unbalanced cheng et al 2022 this not only revealed the dominant factors of spatial differentiation and the key directions for targeted poverty alleviation but also confirmed the important fact that the hu huanyong line is regarded as the dividing line between the rich and the poor in china chen et al 2019 4 discussion 4 1 scenario analysis of improved coupling coordination degree model in this work an improved coupling coordination degree model is presented to carry out a better evaluation of coupling between resources and poverty in the last decades poverty concerns have promoted the wef nexus to reduce unsustainable consumption of resources in the traditional coupling coordination degree model the contribution coefficients α and β are subjectively determined representing the weight of the system therefore the different contribution weights of each system may affect the effectiveness of the model to address this issue five scenarios i e α 0 2 β 0 8 α 0 4 β 0 6 α 0 5 β 0 5 α 0 6 β 0 4 α 0 8 β 0 2 were defined to analyze the variation of coupling coordination degree with different contribution coefficients table s7 and fig 11 significant differences were identified between the maximum minimum average and median values of coupling coordination degree under different scenarios which greatly affects the accuracy of calculation results in addition we compared the value of coupling coordination in the improved coupling coordination degree model i e scenario 6 with the above five scenarios fig 12 we find that the coupling coordination values in yrb during 2000 2019 are highest in scenario 6 yrb has been developing towards coordination between resource utilization of wef and poverty alleviation which indicates that yrb can achieve the optimum result of coupling coordination in scenario 6 the improved coupling coordination degree model is an effective method to test the coupling relationship between wef and poverty the method objectively determines the contribution coefficients which allows comparison between regions it is conducive to rational allocation of resource and can avoid polarization of sustainable development zhang et al 2021b however since the coupling coordination process is affected by the spatial scale it is difficult to scientifically reflect the coupling process between systems under a single scale 4 2 the discussion of dominant influencing factors the complexity of the interaction between wef and poverty means that the coupling coordination between wef and poverty is influenced by multiple factors identifying the dominant influencing factors affecting the coupling coordination in different periods is conducive to understanding the coupling development process fig 13 the coupling coordination was mainly influenced by x5 water consumption per ten thousand yuan of industrial added value in 2000 which is due to the limitation of economic development level and the lag of the old and new kinetic energy conversion mi et al 2021 in 2005 2010 and 2015 the coupling coordination was influenced by x4 water consumption per 10 000 yuan of gdp which is due to the increase in water consumption as the economy grows and the dominant influencing factor has changed the comprehensive plan for the yrb in 2012 stated the effective use of water resources promotes economic development wei et al 2021 the most important influence factor on the coupling coordination in 2019 was x29 nighttime light index indicating that the socio economic vitality of the regions becomes strong power for the coupling of wef and poverty the proposed ecological protection and the high quality development strategy in yrb provided the direction for sustainable development these characteristics are closely related to the economic development stage and development strategy in yrb 4 3 limitations and future research nighttime light data provide a robust and inexpensive alternative to poverty quantification through spatial distribution which is conducive to exploring regional economic inequalities in wef however poverty is a complex combination of natural and social factors as well as a social and development problem that is both absolute and relative the use of nighttime light data may be incomplete and has limitations in reflecting poverty levels when the poverty level differences are small in regions with low resolution jean et al 2016 studies have attempted to use multiple sources of data to assess poverty including combining nighttime light remote sensing technology with machine learning li et al 2019 xu et al 2021 and using nighttime light data land cover data google satellite images and others zhao et al 2019 the impact of covid 19 pandemic on poverty posed a challenge to global poverty reduction in 2020 which has led to shortcomings in the selection of indicators and the quantification of indicators follow up work will involve the calculation of poverty data after 2019 to compare the impact on poverty before and after the occurrence of covid 19 pandemic in addition combining multiple sources of data the nighttime lighting data will be further exploited to better analyze the unevenness of regional high quality development the variability of energy demand and the rationality of water resources allocation this paper focuses on the coupling synergistic relationship between wef and social factor poverty to achieve regional coordination development by promoting synergy among systems the trade offs among wef and other factors are ignored in our study the synergistic restrictive and competitive relationships of the wef system exist in china putra et al 2020 sun and hao 2022 one approach to achieving coordination development is to reduce competition between systems therefore the two way interactions of trade offs and synergistic among systems increases the uncertainty of the study results more research on the competition and constraint relationship between wef and social factors is warranted 4 4 policy implications the framework for the coupling coordination between wef and poverty provide new insights into achieving sustainable development not only in yrb but also in other regions it is imperative to use the evaluation results to guide watershed management and maintain the development of the wef system while poverty reduction our research classifies the study area into four coupling development types and specific improvement measures are formulated for each as follows 1 formulate policies adapted to local conditions and promote the development of coupling coordination since improved coupling coordination degree varies across regions control policies ought to be implemented according to the classification type of dominant factors administrative barriers should be broken down with watershed integration as the main line to explore the development path with regional characteristics 2 break the limitation of the hu huanyong line and achieve high quality development owing to the large differences in the regional development divided by the hu huanyong line the government should increase its financial support and population control in the regions to the west of the hu huanyong line it could reduce the unbalanced development of the two sides of the lines and prevent them from falling into the poverty trap to promote high quality development in the region 3 promote the conservation and intensive utilization of water resources and combine development with environmental protection water resources should be regarded as the maximum rigid constraint rationalize water demand and implement social water conservation protection measures such as ecological protection and restoration projects should be carried out in the upstream areas of the yrb to improve water conservation capacities water and soil conservation and pollution control are needed in the central regions of the yrb the downstream area should focus on promoting river ecosystem health and biodiversity 5 conclusions this study proposed a theoretical framework for the coupling coordination between wef and poverty the interaction between wef and poverty in yrb from 2000 to 2019 is evaluated using an improved coupling coordination degree model based on the nighttime light index and wef system in addition the spatial heterogeneity of the main influencing factors is studied by using the geographical detector the performance of wef and poverty has been improved from 2000 to 2019 and the improved coupling coordination degree between wef and poverty has improved steadily and gradually the types of coupling coordination varied from serious unbalance to good coordination phase with a pyramidal shaped distribution four development types were identified according to the dominant factors water driven type energy driven type food driven type and economy driven type it forms dominant factor regions with the coexistence of multi polar core spatially divided by the hu huanyong line credit authorship contribution statement yirui wang conceptualization

2812,regulating reservoirs play vital roles in water transfer project of which the hydraulic and water quality status are usually affected by diverted water to study the environmental impacts of pingtan and minjiang estuary water resources allocation project on regulating reservoir a two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model of dongzhang reservoir is established and calibrated combined with flow field features dongzhang reservoir is divided into six parts the sensitivities to sudden water pollution events of different parts of dongzhang reservoir are analyzed dry year is the most unfavorable operation typical year wind field is the main driving force on flow field whether the water transfer project operates the water transfers will change main flow route greatly of dongzhang reservoir in dry season mixed with diverted water from dazhang stream the total phosphorus concentration of dongzhang reservoir will increase in short term for reaching the water quality standard of dongzhang reservoir a total phosphorus concentration threshold of dazhang stream is predicted the study will guide the pollution control work along the water transfer project also it should be helpful in ecological restoration and management of longjiang basin keywords hydrodynamic water quality regulating reservoir sudden water pollution water transfer project data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction interbasin water transfer projects are constructed to alleviate water shortage crisis caused by imbalances between water resources distribution and regional water demands it could help optimize the allocation of water resources and improve the regional ecological environment fornarelli and antenucci 2011 li et al 2009 zhao et al 2020 for ensuring the water supply safety regulating reservoirs are constructed or selected along the line such as nansi lake for east route of south to north water diversion project liang et al 2010 san luis reservoir in the california state water project kraus et al 2011 shasta reservoir in the central valley project brekke et al 2009 eucumbene reservoir in the snowy mountains scheme normyle and pittock 2020 etc as a water source the water quality safety of the reservoir is related to the drinking safety of the downstream people once water pollution happens the consequences would be unimaginable for instance the lake michigan water transfer project chicago usa has a lot of controversy about water transfer because of the long term suffering of contaminants murphy and rzeszutko 1977 rasmussen et al 2014 the umiam reservoir in india is water source for interbasin water transfer project which covers an area of 1393 km2 however its internal heavy metals and bacterial flora exceeded the standards which affected the water quality of receiving basin marak et al 2020 adversely due to incomplete contamination control measures the diverted water increased total phosphorus concentration of yuqiao reservoir along the water transfer project from luanhe river to tianjin zhang et al 2020a which will pose a threat to over 200 thousand people the new channel of the beijing hangzhou grand canal passed by four important regulating reservoirs located in nansi lake basin of which the total nitrogen tn tp and chlorophyll a chl a concentration increased significantly due to accumulate contaminations yan and gao 2016 and this will affect surrounding production and living activities in 31700 km2 therefore it is necessary to evaluate the water quality of the water source and the risk of surrounding water pollution proposing disposal plans in advance before operation long term monitoring and early warning should be implemented during operation and if the sudden water pollution happens quick decision and disposal programs could be carried out in time to avoid disasters or losses for predicting and evaluating hydrodynamic and water quality of regulating reservoirs previous studies mainly utilize monitoring data analysis and numerical simulation xu et al 2020 zhuang 2016 environmental assessment based on water quality monitoring data can be carried out based on improved assessment methods which includes multivariate statistical analysis or system dynamics approaches etc ganji and nasseri 2021 zhang et al 2020b when collecting monitor data in addition to the conventional nitrogen phosphorus or algae water quality indicators attention should also be paid to the influence of unconventional indicators such as iron nickel or bacteria on water health status fornarelli and antenucci 2011 zeng et al 2015 numerical simulation is utilized to study the systematic rules for regulating reservoirs influenced by hydrodynamic environmental meteorological operational factors etc hudak 2011 song and pang 2019 both water transfer and meteorological conditions will cause great impacts on hydrodynamic and mass transport process especially in shallow or small regulating reservoirs bocaniov et al 2020 mi et al 2018 vilhena et al 2019 if the reservoir is surrounded by irregular buildings the wind field is unevenly distributed among water surface because of decentral drag coefficients and complicated topography shield effects li et al 2015 matta et al 2017 it is necessary to focus on the coupling hydrological and meteorological factors impacts on receive area such as water transfer status wind field local runoff situations meanwhile it is also important to identify and assess the pollution risk of water sources based on the risk identification and mechanism model results pollution risk assessment framework recipient s vulnerability status zhang et al 2020b and emergency operation rules can be proposed liu et al 2018a yao et al 2015 for reservoirs at risk of contamination appropriate water diversion strategy can be proposed to eliminate the water dead zones improve transfer process and water quality state hudak 2011 song and pang 2019 zhang et al 2018b all these studies on the regulating reservoir proved to be very meaningful for water source protection and management the reservoir is an open area with living and agricultural activities around it which may cause the risk of water pollution liu et al 2018b the catchments of open waterways are always surrounded by farms or residential areas etc which increases the water pollution risks of water source area zheng et al 2018 the disposal of the pollutions especially in a reservoir is difficult due to the complex flow field distribution and uncertainties of sudden water pollution accidents researchers have focused on the water environment assessment and optimized operation measures on regulating reservoir for a designated water transfer project the optimized operation measures have some negative water quality externalities such as expensive water costs connor and perry 1999 fluvial ecosystem changes ibanez and prat 2003 water quality temporal and spatial heterogeneity zhou et al 2020a donor area water shortage yin et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a etc reservoir partition analysis is benefit for hydrodynamic and water quality management work tang et al 2021 water quality protection of donor area is a vital prerequisite in order to avoid subsequent water environment problems caused by diverted water gao et al 2021 fewer study focused on both long term and short term impacts on hydrodynamic and water quality changes for interbasin water transfer projects analyzing short term and long term impacts on regional water environment may help us understand the accumulate effect and take targeted curb measures to prevent water quality deterioration dongzhang reservoir dzr is the largest regulating reservoir of pingtan and minjiang estuary water resources allocation project pmep which is going to be completed in 2022 also the ecological environment safety of dzr guarantees about 486 thousand people and nearly 17 000 ha farm land it has been identified that some domestic pollution risks induced from incomplete interception of sewage pipe networks around dongzhang reservoir by field investigation chen and yao 2021 the research about pmep water transfer impact on dzr water quality assessment has not been carried out also the spatio temporal evolution of hydrodynamic and water quality of dzr needs further analysis moreover in view of the potential emergent water pollution events the consequences caused by diffusion and the disposal measures should be put forward we took dzr as a case study to analyze the long term and short term impacts induced by water transfer project first identified the hydrodynamic and water quality features under different meteorological and water transfer conditions then based on flow velocity flow direction and distance between the reservoir and the water abstraction spot the sensitivities to sudden water pollution events of different parts in dzr are analyzed delved into the impacts on dzr caused by the total phosphorus tp concentration differences between diverted water and local water at last some monitor suggestions and the tp concentration threshold of diverted water are proposed in order to meet certain water quality requirements based on this research 2 study area pmep which is 178 km long is located in fujian province the project involves three basins minjiang river basin longjiang river basin and thirty six feet lake basin it is constructed to transfer water from fuzhou city to pingtan island fuqing city and changle city for solving water shortage crisis it involves one main water source named as minjiang river of which dazhang stream is a main branch and three main regulating reservoirs of which the largest one is dzr the storage at normal water level is 1 85 108m3 water surface area is 15 km2 the water surface area of dzr and the slope in the catchment area are small compared with other large reservoirs the water quality of dzr is ought to reach grade iii water quality standard gb3838 2002 the topography of fujian province is made up with 90 mountains and hills the hydrology and environment situations between donor area and receive area have a lot of differences judging from the past water quality evaluation results of dzr the main pollutants are nitrogen and phosphorus dzr presents a middle eutrophication level state throughout one year weng 2020 however the dazhang stream as a water source of pmep has a relatively high phosphorus concentration chen 2020 due to accumulated pollutions shown from the previous water quality monitoring data in the provincial website environment 2019 moreover phosphorus is also a key limiting factor for algae growth in dzr chen 2019 li 2012 some researches showed that once the tp concentration is higher than 0 025 mg l algae bloom may occur in dzr chen 2019 analyzing the impacts on dzr water environment of the water transfer project is helpful to understand a series of ecological changes of the reservoir in advance 3 materials and methods 3 1 principles of hydrodynamic model the dzr has little tributaries single runoff and the water depth is between 15 m and 30 m it is suitable for simulation calculations using a two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality coupling model of shallow water flow the governing equations are as follows 1 3 continuity equation ns

density f is the coriolis coefficient sxx sxy syy are radiation stress components s is the source and sink term τbx τsx τby τsy are components of effective shear stress ti j are horizontal viscous stress components 3 2 principles of water quality model based on the hydrodynamic model mentioned above and the following principles of material convection and diffusion simultaneous analysis of various material transport processes of dzr is carried out the model assumes that the concentration of each substance in the water is uniformly mixed vertically and the concentration changes only in the two dimensional plane as shown in the following equation 4 considering the digestion process of pollutants the convective diffusion coefficients as well as the degradation coefficients of different pollutants in the model are calibrated based on the available data 4 t h c x u h c x v h c x h d x c x y h d y c y k h c q s c s c where dx and dy are the diffusion coefficients in and y direction respectively c is the concentration of the pollutant k is linear decline coefficient h is total water depth u and v are the horizontal and longitudinal water velocities respectively qs is discharge of source or sink term cs is the mass concentration of source or sink term 3 3 data sources according to the data of fuqing environmental monitoring station dongzhang reservoir monitoring station is located at the exit of dongzhang reservoir the data used to establish the model include the inflow data and corresponding water level data of dongzhang reservoir in the past five years as well as the flow data in the past 50 years three typical years including wet year normal year and dry year of dzr are selected based on frequency calculation of the observed data of dongzhang reservoir from 1958 to 2019 by adapting the pearson iii distribution curve the dem grid map of dzr was taken as the geography data source the upstream discharge downstream water level and water quality data were obtained from environmental monitor station of dzr in fuqing city environment 2019 the water quality data of dazhang stream and dongzhang reservoir were selected from yongtai minhou junction section of dazhang stream monitor station and dongzhang reservoir monitor station respectively the typical meteorological data like wind velocity and direction month by month were got from the preliminary design report of the project chen and he 2016 the workflow of this research is shown in fig 2 3 4 model description 3 4 1 model setup the simulation scope of this study was the entire water area of dzr the calculation mesh shown in fig 3 was established by mesh generator compared with the water level and storage capacity of dzr rechecked in 2014 the terrain correction was carried out in order to improve the accuracy of the simulation the reservoir was generated with unconstructed grid and mesh grid was refined in a high density near the dztl water abstraction spot model boundaries source items and sink items were set according to the actual peripheral conditions of the reservoir the model included two boundaries longjiang river water inlet dam water outlet one source item dzxw water discharge spot and one sink item dztl water abstraction spot in total 3 4 2 model calibration and validation by adjusting manning coefficient and vortex viscosity coefficient the water level in 2019 was calibrated the calibration parameters in the hydrodynamic model includes eddy viscosity coefficient and manning coefficient the comparison between simulated values and observed values are shown in fig 4 the root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are used to describe the accuracy of the model it is finally determined that the friction force of the bed is 32 m 1 3 s as well as vortex viscosity coefficient is 0 28 the rmse and mae are both within 20 nse results mean the simulation values are well consistent with the observed values so this model can be used for subsequent hydrodynamic numerical simulations 5 rmse i 1 n y o i y s i 2 n m a e 1 n i 1 n y o i y s i n s e 1 i 1 n y o i y s i 2 i 1 n y o i y s 2 coupled with hydrodynamic module the evolution process of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n permanganate index codmn and total phosphorus tp in dzr were simulated it is found that dzr has a low velocity which is about 0 005 m s to 0 01 m s compared with river or canal therefore the diffusion coefficients were taken as insensitive parameters this time which were 1 m2 s the precipitation and evaporation have little influence on the water environment assessment of dzr by model sensitivity analysis the model did not take those into consideration in order to ensure the uniformity of the water environment model the reservoir center monitor point was selected to calibrate with observed data the results comparison and errors are shown in fig 5 in summary the simulation performances are very good moriasi et al 2007 the up and downs are consistent with the observed values which means this model can be used for subsequent water quality simulations of the reservoir the main parameters are shown in table 1 3 5 scenarios setting by analyzing the water quality changes of dazhangxi water replenishment discharge and thirty six feel lake water intake discharge in different months with the gradual change of month in a typical year the year with the most unfavorable water quality operation of the reservoir could be firstly determined after preliminary simulation and analysis of some hypothetical working conditions it is concluded that upstream inflow and wind field are the most influential factors on the hydrodynamic force of shallow water reservoirs such as dongzhang reservoir so the common wind field in different months of dry year and the influence of water diversion on hydrodynamic and water quality changes are analyzed 3 5 1 long term impacts predict to predict the environmental impacts on dongzhang reservoir induced by water transfer both long term and short term impact analyses are essential the water transfer discharge of pmep is adjusted according to the actual water level and storage capacity of dzr and changes continuously with the level of water throughout the year the dzxw diverted water discharge is related to the reservoir water level yang et al 2018b zhu et al 2014 the water transfer discharge processes of three typical years are shown in fig 6 the water quality indices of dzxw diverted water were shown in table 2 the water quality changes of dzr under three typical years were analyzed based on the established model 3 5 2 short term impacts predict in order to understand the subsequent cumulative ecological effects changes in the hydrodynamic field and water quality during the wet season and dry season in unfavorable year need to be analyzed in detail according to fig 5 and fig 6 the water level throughout dry year belongs to normal water transfer zone the main wind direction in dry season is wnw the main wind direction in wet season is ese the multi year average wind speed is 3 0 m s of dzr chen and he 2016 combined with external conditions the scenario settings are shown in table 2 4 results 4 1 long term impacts the long term simulation results of the interannual changes of all water quality indices at the dztl water abstraction spot are shown in fig 7 the water quality indices in dztl water abstraction spot of three typical years are extracted as shown in table 3 wet season is about 80 in the whole year which often appears in the months of april to october of dzr chen and he 2016 the rest belongs to dry season the peak concentration of the three pollutants all increase in dry year normal year or wet year especially phosphorus pollution the nh3 n concentration from january to june in dry year is higher than wet year or normal year changes in other months are subtle the codmn concentration increases in dry season it increases about 57 5 than the initials the nh3 n and codmn concentration is higher in wet season however phosphorus concentration changes of a fluctuating all year there are two peak concentrations in dry season and wet season respectively it is about 6 times higher than the initials in dry year compared with dry year water quality of dztl in normal year or wet year is less affected the tp codmn nh3 n concentrations of dzr are influenced by diverted water in a decline order if the water transfer project operates in dry year it can be seen that the tp concentration is about twice high than that in wet year or normal year nh3 n and codmn concentration also increase in dry year dry year is the most unfavorable operation year for pmep it is essential to analyze detailed changes in dry year in order to understand the ecological effects on dzr better 4 2 short term impacts by comparing distribution of the reservoir in different scenarios the main driving factors of the reservoir flow field and water quality changes are identified at the end of the simulation time the hydrodynamic simulation results are shown in fig 8 the simulation results show that the transportation and diffusion of nh3 n tp and codmn are analogous in each scenario zhou et al 2020b the diffusion and transportation status of tp pollutants are shown in fig 9 the percentage of tp concentration over standard area and end values of nh3 n codmn tp at dztl water abstraction spot is extracted shown in table4 4 2 1 factors impact analysis water transfer project impact water transfer will increase the flow velocity in some content especially the dztl water abstraction area the inflow part flow velocity in wet season and north bank part flow velocity in dry season have a great increasing range respectively comparing s1 with s5 it can be seen that the overall flow routes of the reservoir have not changed significantly after the project operates in wet season the overall flow field of the reservoir presents a state in which high flow velocity on south bank and north bank low flow velocity in the middle and a small water loop in the northeast corner comparing s4 with s8 the main stream flow route changes greatly with the dzxw diverted water in dry season the vortices in the reservoir have been reduced once water transfers when there is no water transfer the phosphorus increases in a gradient descending trend due to the longjiang river inflow pollution brought by diverted water spread from north to south in a cascade decreasing trend at the end of inflow part and south part the velocity increases greatly due to water transfer the high concentration of dzxw diverted water will cause more negative impact on the dztl water abstraction comparing s1 with s5 and s3 with s7 the pmep operates in wet season the tp concentration main range increases from a to b comparing s2 with s6 and s4 with s8 the tp main range increased from a to c the tp concentration increasing rate trends to grow in wind driven conditions the strong disturbance of diverted water maximizes the water quality changes of dzr in dry season wind field impact comparing s5 with s7 under no water transfers the flow velocity on the south bank of the reservoir is higher than that on the north bank the velocity along the dzr boundary increases greatly shallow water is easily driven by wind force comparing s6 with s8 the initial flow velocity of dry season is slow whereas the flow velocity increases significantly under wind driving comparing s1 and s5 with s2 and s6 the main stream flow velocity is higher under wind force scenarios than no wind scenarios the scenarios under wind driven conditions shows higher velocity changes the inflow part and northeast corner part velocity is mainly affected by wind field that is wind field has much more force on the flow field than water transfers the phosphorus pollution accompanied with diverted water transports along the northeast bank and northwest bank of dzr under wnw and ese wind forces respectively and the phosphorus pollution will accumulate in the northeast corner of dzr which is the main dead water area and it will pose threats to water quality safety comparing s1 and s3 with s2 and s4 wind field has more influence on dzr water quality in wet season than dry season comparing s6 with s8 and s2 with s4 under no wind scenarios the lower phosphorus dispersion rate announced the weak influence of pollution effluent from longjiang river wind force will alter the pollution dispersion direction significantly the pollution dispersion direction changes with wind induced flow the pollution accumulation zone is concentrated in north bank of dzr the primary range of the tp concentration of dzr remains unchanged whereas the concentration has slightly increased so the water quality of dzr is less affected by the wind conditions after the project operates upstream flow impact it can be seen that when there is no water transfer the overall velocity of reservoir gradually decreases along the downstream with the widened reservoir area in view of flow field distribution comparing s3 with s4 under water transfers diverted water has less impact on reservoir overall flow field changes in wet season the dztl water abstraction flow velocity increases greatly in dry season under water transfers and the tp concentration main range of the reservoir increases from b to c when upstream discharge decreases comparing s7 with s8 under no water transfers there are lots of vortices in dry season the inflow part direction is obviously from west to east along the south bank of dzr in wet season the dzr water quality all meets the grade iii standard the distribution of tp concentration in dzr is mainly affected by the upstream flow of the longjiang river the flow velocity is higher in wet season than dry season whether water transfers or not the pollution dispersion rate is higher in wet season than dry season it is necessary to focus on the water quality changes in dry season under water transfers and natural reservoir status under no water transfers in wet season 4 2 2 guideline for sudden water pollution considering hydrodynamic distributions dzr is divided into six parts which include north part south part inflow part water transfer part central island part and northeast part shown in fig 10 in order to obtain a comprehensive information of the subdomain hydrodynamic features we have computed the average velocity of each part shown in fig 11 potential influences caused by sudden water pollution accidents including conservative substance water pollution or nonconservative substance water pollution are analyzed by hydrodynamic partitions respectively the inflow part is obvious due to the shore water in south part and north part overlapped with each other under wind driven conditions so once the sudden water pollution accidents happen in west dzr it is necessary to focuse on the wind conditions immediately the velocity is slow in inflow part the vortex directions in south part and north part are opposite but the flow velocity is basically the same as to sudden water pollution accidents caused by conservative substance it is controllable before expanding large area but slow water exchange rate will reduce nonconservative substance degradation rate from the long time perspective the flow velocity of the three parts are small the risk level caused by west part pollution on water transfer is controllable the diverted water flows along dongzhang town and merged with the longjiang river inflow with few vortices in wet season but many vortices form in central island part in a clockwise direction in dry season and the water transfer part has a higher velocity than other parts during water transfer process the higher water exchange rate is benefit for sudden water pollution accidents caused by nonconservative substance but sudden water pollution accidents caused by conservative substance happens around this part should be controlled to the great extent in case of extending into the dztl water abstraction spot water transfers even should be stopped in case of affecting downstream water supply safety due to the dztl water abstraction and local water abstraction there is a small vortex in counterclockwise direction at the front of dam outlet in central island part and the velocity is low this area is also sensitive to sudden water pollution accidents but complex flow field and close distance between central island and dztl water abstraction spot pose threat to sudden water pollution disposal sometimes the dam outlet can be used as emergency flow discharge for diluting pollution if the downstream longjiang river has no other functions the northeast part which is a water stagnant zone of dzr also has a low velocity this illustrates the algae bloom phenomenon around northeast part zheng 2017 if sudden water pollution accidents happen in northeast part it will not cause great impact on the whole reservoir water pollution accidents caused by conservative substance pollution will not disperse quickly which give managers ample disposal time for water pollution accidents caused by nonconservative substance pollution it is hard to be diluted by diverted water or natural inflow so ecological modify measures are necessary from a long time perspective for this part 5 discussion it is necessary to focus on the reservoir ecological changes especially in dry season after pmep is implemented the differences between diverted water and local water will result in reservoir overall nutrition status changes among all the pollutants total phosphorus concentration increases greatly higher total phosphorus concentration may induce some other issues such as algae bloom underground water phosphorus pollution water ecological integrality detriment etc analysing water quality changes is the first step to reappraise water pollution absorption ability of dongzhang reservoir when the pmep operates north bank stream near dongzhang town and the northeast corner of dzr need more attention the northeast corner of dzr is a water dead zone accompanied with diverted water the water dead zone maybe narrowed however high tp concentration of dazhang stream will decline defense effectiveness for phosphorus interception of recipients yang et al 2018a according to the managers of dazhang stream minjiang river basin with the implement of pmep and construction of jukou reservoir sand mining activities have been controlled in recent years and the domestic or industry production events will be prohibited step by step it can be seen from table4 that the phosphorus pollution is the main issue faced by dzr especially in dry season it can be identified that total phosphorus concentration is the key water quality index to be included in any optimal management zeng et al 2015 the tp concentration threshold of dzxw diverted water in dry season is predicted for reaching the required standards of dzr bolinches et al 2020 the fitting relationship between the tp concentration of dzxw diverted water and the tp concentration of dztl water abstraction spot is in exponential function shown in fig 12 under wnw wind conditions if dzxw water concentration is between 0 13 and 0 15 mg l or even higher the tp concentration at dztl water abstraction spot will exceed grade iii water standard thus the tp concentration of diverted water needs to be curbed within the range from 0 to 0 13 mg l once the project operates for ensuring water quality safety of dztl in dry season under no wind conditions the tp concentration of diverted water needs to be curbed within the range from 0 to 0 12 mg l in dry season the water quality of dzr in other months are better when pmep operates the tp concentration threshold in dry season can be used as a highest standard reference for phosphorus pollution treatment in other months 6 conclusion in the context of pingtan and minjiang estuary water resources allocation project going to complete in fujian province water quality and hydrodynamics analysis of regulating reservoirs are very necessary a two dimensional water environment model of the most important regulation reservoir dongzhang reservoir along the project was established and calibrated it has been determined that the most unfavorable operation year is dry year by analysing long term impacts on dongzhang reservoir dongzhang reservoir is divided into six parts for sudden water pollution dispersion analysis the reservoir hydrodynamic and water quality changes were analyzed in dry year under different wind upstream flow discharge and water transfer conditions in short term the feasible tp concentration threshold for diverted water from dazhang stream was proposed areas prone to deteriorate can be estimated by the reservoir hydrodynamic partitions which are determined by the water transfer process and wind driven force when sudden water pollution accidents happen the water transfer part and central island part are sensitive to sudden water pollution accidents effective measures should be taken before sudden water pollution disperse into the two parts wind field is the main driving factor for overall hydrodynamic field the south part north part and inflow part of dzr has a lower flow velocity than water transfer part if water pollution accident happens in west part of dzr wind field is the primary factor that should be focused for predicting the pollution dispersion routes if the pollution dispersed into the water transfer part water transfer process should be stopped immediately for ensuring downstream water safety after water transfers the main flow route changes significantly in dry season from east to west direction into north to south direction along the water transfer project and small vortices have been drastically reduced also the reservoir overall flow velocity increased under water transfers which is not conducive to stagnant water accumulation but normal water transfers will not change flow field of northeast corner which is always a water dead zone more attention needs to be paid to the water environment impact on dongzhang reservoir in dry season it is worth noting that the tp concentration increases significantly under water transfers for meeting grade iii requirements of dztl diverted water tp concentration of dazhang stream should be less than 0 12 mg l it is necessary to strengthen the point and non point pollution management around dazhang stream also water quality monitoring of dongzhang reservoir especially the northeast part central island part and water transfer part after pmep implementation in dry season is essential from the perspective of space and time layout the study can provide decision making basis for operation and pollution management of the water transfer project it will support the subsequent water quality protection work also it may be helpful for ecological restoration research of dongzhang reservoir follow up researches such as algae bloom limiting factors reservoir nutrition status assessment of dongzhang reservoir

2812,regulating reservoirs play vital roles in water transfer project of which the hydraulic and water quality status are usually affected by diverted water to study the environmental impacts of pingtan and minjiang estuary water resources allocation project on regulating reservoir a two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model of dongzhang reservoir is established and calibrated combined with flow field features dongzhang reservoir is divided into six parts the sensitivities to sudden water pollution events of different parts of dongzhang reservoir are analyzed dry year is the most unfavorable operation typical year wind field is the main driving force on flow field whether the water transfer project operates the water transfers will change main flow route greatly of dongzhang reservoir in dry season mixed with diverted water from dazhang stream the total phosphorus concentration of dongzhang reservoir will increase in short term for reaching the water quality standard of dongzhang reservoir a total phosphorus concentration threshold of dazhang stream is predicted the study will guide the pollution control work along the water transfer project also it should be helpful in ecological restoration and management of longjiang basin keywords hydrodynamic water quality regulating reservoir sudden water pollution water transfer project data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction interbasin water transfer projects are constructed to alleviate water shortage crisis caused by imbalances between water resources distribution and regional water demands it could help optimize the allocation of water resources and improve the regional ecological environment fornarelli and antenucci 2011 li et al 2009 zhao et al 2020 for ensuring the water supply safety regulating reservoirs are constructed or selected along the line such as nansi lake for east route of south to north water diversion project liang et al 2010 san luis reservoir in the california state water project kraus et al 2011 shasta reservoir in the central valley project brekke et al 2009 eucumbene reservoir in the snowy mountains scheme normyle and pittock 2020 etc as a water source the water quality safety of the reservoir is related to the drinking safety of the downstream people once water pollution happens the consequences would be unimaginable for instance the lake michigan water transfer project chicago usa has a lot of controversy about water transfer because of the long term suffering of contaminants murphy and rzeszutko 1977 rasmussen et al 2014 the umiam reservoir in india is water source for interbasin water transfer project which covers an area of 1393 km2 however its internal heavy metals and bacterial flora exceeded the standards which affected the water quality of receiving basin marak et al 2020 adversely due to incomplete contamination control measures the diverted water increased total phosphorus concentration of yuqiao reservoir along the water transfer project from luanhe river to tianjin zhang et al 2020a which will pose a threat to over 200 thousand people the new channel of the beijing hangzhou grand canal passed by four important regulating reservoirs located in nansi lake basin of which the total nitrogen tn tp and chlorophyll a chl a concentration increased significantly due to accumulate contaminations yan and gao 2016 and this will affect surrounding production and living activities in 31700 km2 therefore it is necessary to evaluate the water quality of the water source and the risk of surrounding water pollution proposing disposal plans in advance before operation long term monitoring and early warning should be implemented during operation and if the sudden water pollution happens quick decision and disposal programs could be carried out in time to avoid disasters or losses for predicting and evaluating hydrodynamic and water quality of regulating reservoirs previous studies mainly utilize monitoring data analysis and numerical simulation xu et al 2020 zhuang 2016 environmental assessment based on water quality monitoring data can be carried out based on improved assessment methods which includes multivariate statistical analysis or system dynamics approaches etc ganji and nasseri 2021 zhang et al 2020b when collecting monitor data in addition to the conventional nitrogen phosphorus or algae water quality indicators attention should also be paid to the influence of unconventional indicators such as iron nickel or bacteria on water health status fornarelli and antenucci 2011 zeng et al 2015 numerical simulation is utilized to study the systematic rules for regulating reservoirs influenced by hydrodynamic environmental meteorological operational factors etc hudak 2011 song and pang 2019 both water transfer and meteorological conditions will cause great impacts on hydrodynamic and mass transport process especially in shallow or small regulating reservoirs bocaniov et al 2020 mi et al 2018 vilhena et al 2019 if the reservoir is surrounded by irregular buildings the wind field is unevenly distributed among water surface because of decentral drag coefficients and complicated topography shield effects li et al 2015 matta et al 2017 it is necessary to focus on the coupling hydrological and meteorological factors impacts on receive area such as water transfer status wind field local runoff situations meanwhile it is also important to identify and assess the pollution risk of water sources based on the risk identification and mechanism model results pollution risk assessment framework recipient s vulnerability status zhang et al 2020b and emergency operation rules can be proposed liu et al 2018a yao et al 2015 for reservoirs at risk of contamination appropriate water diversion strategy can be proposed to eliminate the water dead zones improve transfer process and water quality state hudak 2011 song and pang 2019 zhang et al 2018b all these studies on the regulating reservoir proved to be very meaningful for water source protection and management the reservoir is an open area with living and agricultural activities around it which may cause the risk of water pollution liu et al 2018b the catchments of open waterways are always surrounded by farms or residential areas etc which increases the water pollution risks of water source area zheng et al 2018 the disposal of the pollutions especially in a reservoir is difficult due to the complex flow field distribution and uncertainties of sudden water pollution accidents researchers have focused on the water environment assessment and optimized operation measures on regulating reservoir for a designated water transfer project the optimized operation measures have some negative water quality externalities such as expensive water costs connor and perry 1999 fluvial ecosystem changes ibanez and prat 2003 water quality temporal and spatial heterogeneity zhou et al 2020a donor area water shortage yin et al 2020 zhang et al 2018a etc reservoir partition analysis is benefit for hydrodynamic and water quality management work tang et al 2021 water quality protection of donor area is a vital prerequisite in order to avoid subsequent water environment problems caused by diverted water gao et al 2021 fewer study focused on both long term and short term impacts on hydrodynamic and water quality changes for interbasin water transfer projects analyzing short term and long term impacts on regional water environment may help us understand the accumulate effect and take targeted curb measures to prevent water quality deterioration dongzhang reservoir dzr is the largest regulating reservoir of pingtan and minjiang estuary water resources allocation project pmep which is going to be completed in 2022 also the ecological environment safety of dzr guarantees about 486 thousand people and nearly 17 000 ha farm land it has been identified that some domestic pollution risks induced from incomplete interception of sewage pipe networks around dongzhang reservoir by field investigation chen and yao 2021 the research about pmep water transfer impact on dzr water quality assessment has not been carried out also the spatio temporal evolution of hydrodynamic and water quality of dzr needs further analysis moreover in view of the potential emergent water pollution events the consequences caused by diffusion and the disposal measures should be put forward we took dzr as a case study to analyze the long term and short term impacts induced by water transfer project first identified the hydrodynamic and water quality features under different meteorological and water transfer conditions then based on flow velocity flow direction and distance between the reservoir and the water abstraction spot the sensitivities to sudden water pollution events of different parts in dzr are analyzed delved into the impacts on dzr caused by the total phosphorus tp concentration differences between diverted water and local water at last some monitor suggestions and the tp concentration threshold of diverted water are proposed in order to meet certain water quality requirements based on this research 2 study area pmep which is 178 km long is located in fujian province the project involves three basins minjiang river basin longjiang river basin and thirty six feet lake basin it is constructed to transfer water from fuzhou city to pingtan island fuqing city and changle city for solving water shortage crisis it involves one main water source named as minjiang river of which dazhang stream is a main branch and three main regulating reservoirs of which the largest one is dzr the storage at normal water level is 1 85 108m3 water surface area is 15 km2 the water surface area of dzr and the slope in the catchment area are small compared with other large reservoirs the water quality of dzr is ought to reach grade iii water quality standard gb3838 2002 the topography of fujian province is made up with 90 mountains and hills the hydrology and environment situations between donor area and receive area have a lot of differences judging from the past water quality evaluation results of dzr the main pollutants are nitrogen and phosphorus dzr presents a middle eutrophication level state throughout one year weng 2020 however the dazhang stream as a water source of pmep has a relatively high phosphorus concentration chen 2020 due to accumulated pollutions shown from the previous water quality monitoring data in the provincial website environment 2019 moreover phosphorus is also a key limiting factor for algae growth in dzr chen 2019 li 2012 some researches showed that once the tp concentration is higher than 0 025 mg l algae bloom may occur in dzr chen 2019 analyzing the impacts on dzr water environment of the water transfer project is helpful to understand a series of ecological changes of the reservoir in advance 3 materials and methods 3 1 principles of hydrodynamic model the dzr has little tributaries single runoff and the water depth is between 15 m and 30 m it is suitable for simulation calculations using a two dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality coupling model of shallow water flow the governing equations are as follows 1 3 continuity equation ns

density f is the coriolis coefficient sxx sxy syy are radiation stress components s is the source and sink term τbx τsx τby τsy are components of effective shear stress ti j are horizontal viscous stress components 3 2 principles of water quality model based on the hydrodynamic model mentioned above and the following principles of material convection and diffusion simultaneous analysis of various material transport processes of dzr is carried out the model assumes that the concentration of each substance in the water is uniformly mixed vertically and the concentration changes only in the two dimensional plane as shown in the following equation 4 considering the digestion process of pollutants the convective diffusion coefficients as well as the degradation coefficients of different pollutants in the model are calibrated based on the available data 4 t h c x u h c x v h c x h d x c x y h d y c y k h c q s c s c where dx and dy are the diffusion coefficients in and y direction respectively c is the concentration of the pollutant k is linear decline coefficient h is total water depth u and v are the horizontal and longitudinal water velocities respectively qs is discharge of source or sink term cs is the mass concentration of source or sink term 3 3 data sources according to the data of fuqing environmental monitoring station dongzhang reservoir monitoring station is located at the exit of dongzhang reservoir the data used to establish the model include the inflow data and corresponding water level data of dongzhang reservoir in the past five years as well as the flow data in the past 50 years three typical years including wet year normal year and dry year of dzr are selected based on frequency calculation of the observed data of dongzhang reservoir from 1958 to 2019 by adapting the pearson iii distribution curve the dem grid map of dzr was taken as the geography data source the upstream discharge downstream water level and water quality data were obtained from environmental monitor station of dzr in fuqing city environment 2019 the water quality data of dazhang stream and dongzhang reservoir were selected from yongtai minhou junction section of dazhang stream monitor station and dongzhang reservoir monitor station respectively the typical meteorological data like wind velocity and direction month by month were got from the preliminary design report of the project chen and he 2016 the workflow of this research is shown in fig 2 3 4 model description 3 4 1 model setup the simulation scope of this study was the entire water area of dzr the calculation mesh shown in fig 3 was established by mesh generator compared with the water level and storage capacity of dzr rechecked in 2014 the terrain correction was carried out in order to improve the accuracy of the simulation the reservoir was generated with unconstructed grid and mesh grid was refined in a high density near the dztl water abstraction spot model boundaries source items and sink items were set according to the actual peripheral conditions of the reservoir the model included two boundaries longjiang river water inlet dam water outlet one source item dzxw water discharge spot and one sink item dztl water abstraction spot in total 3 4 2 model calibration and validation by adjusting manning coefficient and vortex viscosity coefficient the water level in 2019 was calibrated the calibration parameters in the hydrodynamic model includes eddy viscosity coefficient and manning coefficient the comparison between simulated values and observed values are shown in fig 4 the root mean squared error rmse mean absolute error mae and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are used to describe the accuracy of the model it is finally determined that the friction force of the bed is 32 m 1 3 s as well as vortex viscosity coefficient is 0 28 the rmse and mae are both within 20 nse results mean the simulation values are well consistent with the observed values so this model can be used for subsequent hydrodynamic numerical simulations 5 rmse i 1 n y o i y s i 2 n m a e 1 n i 1 n y o i y s i n s e 1 i 1 n y o i y s i 2 i 1 n y o i y s 2 coupled with hydrodynamic module the evolution process of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n permanganate index codmn and total phosphorus tp in dzr were simulated it is found that dzr has a low velocity which is about 0 005 m s to 0 01 m s compared with river or canal therefore the diffusion coefficients were taken as insensitive parameters this time which were 1 m2 s the precipitation and evaporation have little influence on the water environment assessment of dzr by model sensitivity analysis the model did not take those into consideration in order to ensure the uniformity of the water environment model the reservoir center monitor point was selected to calibrate with observed data the results comparison and errors are shown in fig 5 in summary the simulation performances are very good moriasi et al 2007 the up and downs are consistent with the observed values which means this model can be used for subsequent water quality simulations of the reservoir the main parameters are shown in table 1 3 5 scenarios setting by analyzing the water quality changes of dazhangxi water replenishment discharge and thirty six feel lake water intake discharge in different months with the gradual change of month in a typical year the year with the most unfavorable water quality operation of the reservoir could be firstly determined after preliminary simulation and analysis of some hypothetical working conditions it is concluded that upstream inflow and wind field are the most influential factors on the hydrodynamic force of shallow water reservoirs such as dongzhang reservoir so the common wind field in different months of dry year and the influence of water diversion on hydrodynamic and water quality changes are analyzed 3 5 1 long term impacts predict to predict the environmental impacts on dongzhang reservoir induced by water transfer both long term and short term impact analyses are essential the water transfer discharge of pmep is adjusted according to the actual water level and storage capacity of dzr and changes continuously with the level of water throughout the year the dzxw diverted water discharge is related to the reservoir water level yang et al 2018b zhu et al 2014 the water transfer discharge processes of three typical years are shown in fig 6 the water quality indices of dzxw diverted water were shown in table 2 the water quality changes of dzr under three typical years were analyzed based on the established model 3 5 2 short term impacts predict in order to understand the subsequent cumulative ecological effects changes in the hydrodynamic field and water quality during the wet season and dry season in unfavorable year need to be analyzed in detail according to fig 5 and fig 6 the water level throughout dry year belongs to normal water transfer zone the main wind direction in dry season is wnw the main wind direction in wet season is ese the multi year average wind speed is 3 0 m s of dzr chen and he 2016 combined with external conditions the scenario settings are shown in table 2 4 results 4 1 long term impacts the long term simulation results of the interannual changes of all water quality indices at the dztl water abstraction spot are shown in fig 7 the water quality indices in dztl water abstraction spot of three typical years are extracted as shown in table 3 wet season is about 80 in the whole year which often appears in the months of april to october of dzr chen and he 2016 the rest belongs to dry season the peak concentration of the three pollutants all increase in dry year normal year or wet year especially phosphorus pollution the nh3 n concentration from january to june in dry year is higher than wet year or normal year changes in other months are subtle the codmn concentration increases in dry season it increases about 57 5 than the initials the nh3 n and codmn concentration is higher in wet season however phosphorus concentration changes of a fluctuating all year there are two peak concentrations in dry season and wet season respectively it is about 6 times higher than the initials in dry year compared with dry year water quality of dztl in normal year or wet year is less affected the tp codmn nh3 n concentrations of dzr are influenced by diverted water in a decline order if the water transfer project operates in dry year it can be seen that the tp concentration is about twice high than that in wet year or normal year nh3 n and codmn concentration also increase in dry year dry year is the most unfavorable operation year for pmep it is essential to analyze detailed changes in dry year in order to understand the ecological effects on dzr better 4 2 short term impacts by comparing distribution of the reservoir in different scenarios the main driving factors of the reservoir flow field and water quality changes are identified at the end of the simulation time the hydrodynamic simulation results are shown in fig 8 the simulation results show that the transportation and diffusion of nh3 n tp and codmn are analogous in each scenario zhou et al 2020b the diffusion and transportation status of tp pollutants are shown in fig 9 the percentage of tp concentration over standard area and end values of nh3 n codmn tp at dztl water abstraction spot is extracted shown in table4 4 2 1 factors impact analysis water transfer project impact water transfer will increase the flow velocity in some content especially the dztl water abstraction area the inflow part flow velocity in wet season and north bank part flow velocity in dry season have a great increasing range respectively comparing s1 with s5 it can be seen that the overall flow routes of the reservoir have not changed significantly after the project operates in wet season the overall flow field of the reservoir presents a state in which high flow velocity on south bank and north bank low flow velocity in the middle and a small water loop in the northeast corner comparing s4 with s8 the main stream flow route changes greatly with the dzxw diverted water in dry season the vortices in the reservoir have been reduced once water transfers when there is no water transfer the phosphorus increases in a gradient descending trend due to the longjiang river inflow pollution brought by diverted water spread from north to south in a cascade decreasing trend at the end of inflow part and south part the velocity increases greatly due to water transfer the high concentration of dzxw diverted water will cause more negative impact on the dztl water abstraction comparing s1 with s5 and s3 with s7 the pmep operates in wet season the tp concentration main range increases from a to b comparing s2 with s6 and s4 with s8 the tp main range increased from a to c the tp concentration increasing rate trends to grow in wind driven conditions the strong disturbance of diverted water maximizes the water quality changes of dzr in dry season wind field impact comparing s5 with s7 under no water transfers the flow velocity on the south bank of the reservoir is higher than that on the north bank the velocity along the dzr boundary increases greatly shallow water is easily driven by wind force comparing s6 with s8 the initial flow velocity of dry season is slow whereas the flow velocity increases significantly under wind driving comparing s1 and s5 with s2 and s6 the main stream flow velocity is higher under wind force scenarios than no wind scenarios the scenarios under wind driven conditions shows higher velocity changes the inflow part and northeast corner part velocity is mainly affected by wind field that is wind field has much more force on the flow field than water transfers the phosphorus pollution accompanied with diverted water transports along the northeast bank and northwest bank of dzr under wnw and ese wind forces respectively and the phosphorus pollution will accumulate in the northeast corner of dzr which is the main dead water area and it will pose threats to water quality safety comparing s1 and s3 with s2 and s4 wind field has more influence on dzr water quality in wet season than dry season comparing s6 with s8 and s2 with s4 under no wind scenarios the lower phosphorus dispersion rate announced the weak influence of pollution effluent from longjiang river wind force will alter the pollution dispersion direction significantly the pollution dispersion direction changes with wind induced flow the pollution accumulation zone is concentrated in north bank of dzr the primary range of the tp concentration of dzr remains unchanged whereas the concentration has slightly increased so the water quality of dzr is less affected by the wind conditions after the project operates upstream flow impact it can be seen that when there is no water transfer the overall velocity of reservoir gradually decreases along the downstream with the widened reservoir area in view of flow field distribution comparing s3 with s4 under water transfers diverted water has less impact on reservoir overall flow field changes in wet season the dztl water abstraction flow velocity increases greatly in dry season under water transfers and the tp concentration main range of the reservoir increases from b to c when upstream discharge decreases comparing s7 with s8 under no water transfers there are lots of vortices in dry season the inflow part direction is obviously from west to east along the south bank of dzr in wet season the dzr water quality all meets the grade iii standard the distribution of tp concentration in dzr is mainly affected by the upstream flow of the longjiang river the flow velocity is higher in wet season than dry season whether water transfers or not the pollution dispersion rate is higher in wet season than dry season it is necessary to focus on the water quality changes in dry season under water transfers and natural reservoir status under no water transfers in wet season 4 2 2 guideline for sudden water pollution considering hydrodynamic distributions dzr is divided into six parts which include north part south part inflow part water transfer part central island part and northeast part shown in fig 10 in order to obtain a comprehensive information of the subdomain hydrodynamic features we have computed the average velocity of each part shown in fig 11 potential influences caused by sudden water pollution accidents including conservative substance water pollution or nonconservative substance water pollution are analyzed by hydrodynamic partitions respectively the inflow part is obvious due to the shore water in south part and north part overlapped with each other under wind driven conditions so once the sudden water pollution accidents happen in west dzr it is necessary to focuse on the wind conditions immediately the velocity is slow in inflow part the vortex directions in south part and north part are opposite but the flow velocity is basically the same as to sudden water pollution accidents caused by conservative substance it is controllable before expanding large area but slow water exchange rate will reduce nonconservative substance degradation rate from the long time perspective the flow velocity of the three parts are small the risk level caused by west part pollution on water transfer is controllable the diverted water flows along dongzhang town and merged with the longjiang river inflow with few vortices in wet season but many vortices form in central island part in a clockwise direction in dry season and the water transfer part has a higher velocity than other parts during water transfer process the higher water exchange rate is benefit for sudden water pollution accidents caused by nonconservative substance but sudden water pollution accidents caused by conservative substance happens around this part should be controlled to the great extent in case of extending into the dztl water abstraction spot water transfers even should be stopped in case of affecting downstream water supply safety due to the dztl water abstraction and local water abstraction there is a small vortex in counterclockwise direction at the front of dam outlet in central island part and the velocity is low this area is also sensitive to sudden water pollution accidents but complex flow field and close distance between central island and dztl water abstraction spot pose threat to sudden water pollution disposal sometimes the dam outlet can be used as emergency flow discharge for diluting pollution if the downstream longjiang river has no other functions the northeast part which is a water stagnant zone of dzr also has a low velocity this illustrates the algae bloom phenomenon around northeast part zheng 2017 if sudden water pollution accidents happen in northeast part it will not cause great impact on the whole reservoir water pollution accidents caused by conservative substance pollution will not disperse quickly which give managers ample disposal time for water pollution accidents caused by nonconservative substance pollution it is hard to be diluted by diverted water or natural inflow so ecological modify measures are necessary from a long time perspective for this part 5 discussion it is necessary to focus on the reservoir ecological changes especially in dry season after pmep is implemented the differences between diverted water and local water will result in reservoir overall nutrition status changes among all the pollutants total phosphorus concentration increases greatly higher total phosphorus concentration may induce some other issues such as algae bloom underground water phosphorus pollution water ecological integrality detriment etc analysing water quality changes is the first step to reappraise water pollution absorption ability of dongzhang reservoir when the pmep operates north bank stream near dongzhang town and the northeast corner of dzr need more attention the northeast corner of dzr is a water dead zone accompanied with diverted water the water dead zone maybe narrowed however high tp concentration of dazhang stream will decline defense effectiveness for phosphorus interception of recipients yang et al 2018a according to the managers of dazhang stream minjiang river basin with the implement of pmep and construction of jukou reservoir sand mining activities have been controlled in recent years and the domestic or industry production events will be prohibited step by step it can be seen from table4 that the phosphorus pollution is the main issue faced by dzr especially in dry season it can be identified that total phosphorus concentration is the key water quality index to be included in any optimal management zeng et al 2015 the tp concentration threshold of dzxw diverted water in dry season is predicted for reaching the required standards of dzr bolinches et al 2020 the fitting relationship between the tp concentration of dzxw diverted water and the tp concentration of dztl water abstraction spot is in exponential function shown in fig 12 under wnw wind conditions if dzxw water concentration is between 0 13 and 0 15 mg l or even higher the tp concentration at dztl water abstraction spot will exceed grade iii water standard thus the tp concentration of diverted water needs to be curbed within the range from 0 to 0 13 mg l once the project operates for ensuring water quality safety of dztl in dry season under no wind conditions the tp concentration of diverted water needs to be curbed within the range from 0 to 0 12 mg l in dry season the water quality of dzr in other months are better when pmep operates the tp concentration threshold in dry season can be used as a highest standard reference for phosphorus pollution treatment in other months 6 conclusion in the context of pingtan and minjiang estuary water resources allocation project going to complete in fujian province water quality and hydrodynamics analysis of regulating reservoirs are very necessary a two dimensional water environment model of the most important regulation reservoir dongzhang reservoir along the project was established and calibrated it has been determined that the most unfavorable operation year is dry year by analysing long term impacts on dongzhang reservoir dongzhang reservoir is divided into six parts for sudden water pollution dispersion analysis the reservoir hydrodynamic and water quality changes were analyzed in dry year under different wind upstream flow discharge and water transfer conditions in short term the feasible tp concentration threshold for diverted water from dazhang stream was proposed areas prone to deteriorate can be estimated by the reservoir hydrodynamic partitions which are determined by the water transfer process and wind driven force when sudden water pollution accidents happen the water transfer part and central island part are sensitive to sudden water pollution accidents effective measures should be taken before sudden water pollution disperse into the two parts wind field is the main driving factor for overall hydrodynamic field the south part north part and inflow part of dzr has a lower flow velocity than water transfer part if water pollution accident happens in west part of dzr wind field is the primary factor that should be focused for predicting the pollution dispersion routes if the pollution dispersed into the water transfer part water transfer process should be stopped immediately for ensuring downstream water safety after water transfers the main flow route changes significantly in dry season from east to west direction into north to south direction along the water transfer project and small vortices have been drastically reduced also the reservoir overall flow velocity increased under water transfers which is not conducive to stagnant water accumulation but normal water transfers will not change flow field of northeast corner which is always a water dead zone more attention needs to be paid to the water environment impact on dongzhang reservoir in dry season it is worth noting that the tp concentration increases significantly under water transfers for meeting grade iii requirements of dztl diverted water tp concentration of dazhang stream should be less than 0 12 mg l it is necessary to strengthen the point and non point pollution management around dazhang stream also water quality monitoring of dongzhang reservoir especially the northeast part central island part and water transfer part after pmep implementation in dry season is essential from the perspective of space and time layout the study can provide decision making basis for operation and pollution management of the water transfer project it will support the subsequent water quality protection work also it may be helpful for ecological restoration research of dongzhang reservoir follow up researches such as algae bloom limiting factors reservoir nutrition status assessment of dongzhang reservoir

2813,soil moisture is a key variable controlling the energy and water balance at the land surface and satellite derived soil moisture sdsm products can therefore be helpful to constrain parameters of eco hydrological models due to coarse resolution of many sdsm products 25 km previous studies mostly focused on large catchments 500 km2 however recent developments in soil moisture remote sensing resulted in sdsm products with improved spatio temporal resolution which are potentially better suited for model calibration in small to meso scale catchments this study therefore aims at assessing the value of three recent sdsm products smapl3e scatsar and ascat direx swi with high spatio temporal resolution spatial sampling 0 5 9 km temporal resolution 1 3 d for the calibration of the process based ecohydrological model ech2o in a 66 km2 catchment in ne germany satellite derived soil water index swi data agreed well with in situ soil moisture observations pearson correlation coefficient 0 67 0 86 with a slightly better performance for smapl3e than for the other two products scatsar ascat direx swi calibrating the ecohydrological model ech2o to swi data based on smapl3e improved the dynamics of simulated soil moisture increase of pearson correlation coefficient by 0 03 while model performance for streamflow slightly deteriorated decrease of nash sutcliffe efficiency by 0 02 including volumetric soil moisture data based on in situ data or sdsm scaled to in situ data in the model calibration was necessary to further improve the model with respect to absolute soil moisture levels increase of nash sutcliffe efficiency for scaled soil moisture from 0 23 0 25 to 0 56 0 59 comparing spatial patterns of simulated soil moisture and sdsm revealed shortcomings of the simulated and the sdsm data simulated soil moisture spatial patterns are influenced by artefacts of the interpolated precipitation patterns while spatial patterns of sdsm seem too strongly damped based on this study the following recommendations may be derived for practitioners who consider including soil moisture data for model calibration 1 integrating sdsm in model calibration is beneficial for improving model internal consistency 2 where available in situ soil moisture data should be included in order to better constrain simulated absolute soil moisture levels 3 at the scale of small to meso scale catchments 100 km2 the temporal dynamics of the sdsm products evaluated in this study are likely more helpful for model calibration than their spatial patterns keywords ecohydrological model calibration satellite soil moisture smap scatsar ascat direx data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction process based ecohydrological models that integrate the energy balance hydrologic processes and vegetation dynamics are an ideal tool to investigate variations in hydrologic fluxes and storages in a changing climate however complex process based models involve a large number of model parameters beven 2002 many of these parameters cannot be sufficiently constrained by measurements and are typically derived by model calibration while streamflow remains the most commonly used variable for model calibration it is now widely acknowledged that considering only streamflow may lead to large parameter uncertainties and inconsistencies of internal model states e g beven and freer 2001 kirchner 2006 seibert and mcdonnell 2002 one way to improve process consistency of a hydrological model is through multivariate model calibration accounting for variables such as snow cover duethmann et al 2014 finger et al 2011 parajka and blöschl 2008 total water storage anomalies werth and güntner 2010 groundwater level seibert 2000 transpiration kuppel et al 2018 or soil moisture franks et al 1998 parajka et al 2009 soil moisture is a key variable for the energy and water balance at the land surface it affects the partitioning of solar radiation into latent and sensible heat as well as the partitioning of precipitation into direct runoff and catchment storage seneviratne et al 2010 classical in situ methods such as gravimetric sampling or time domain reflectometry tdr enable soil moisture measurements at point scale at high spatial and temporal resolution vereecken et al 2014 such measurements are however not widely available and mostly restricted to research sites furthermore due to their small spatial extent and high heterogeneity of soil characteristics these classical in situ methods may not be representative for larger areas satellite derived products provide near surface soil moisture estimates that are available for virtually any catchment and represent integrated values over larger spatial areas microwave sensors have been found most suitable for deriving soil moisture products from satellite data wagner et al 2007 both active microwave sensors such as the advanced scatterometer ascat figa saldaña et al 2002 wagner et al 2013 on board the series of meteorological operational metop satellites or its predecessor the active microwave instrument ami on board the european remote sensing satellites ers 1 ers 2 pulliainen et al 1998 and passive sensors such as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 imaoka et al 2010 okuyama and imaoka 2015 or radiometers of the soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 and soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 missions are used for soil moisture detection various previous studies have used satellite derived soil moisture sdsm to evaluate calibrate conceptual and process based hydrological models nijzink et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 rakovec et al 2016 silvestro et al 2015 tong et al 2021 including soil moisture in model calibration often had only small effects on streamflow model performance but increased model performance with respect to soil moisture shahrban et al 2018 tong et al 2021 however while streamflow was often not strongly affected the changes in simulated soil moisture can be relevant for the simulation of other fluxes such as evapotranspiration rajib et al 2018 integrating sdsm and land surface temperatures in the model calibration helped constrain soil model parameters that only showed a weak dependence on streamflow silvestro et al 2015 reduced parameter uncertainties were also observed for including sdsm in the calibration of a conceptual hydrological model for catchments in austria parajka et al 2009 when comparing simulated and observed soil moisture one has to keep in mind that this comparison is not straightforward due to mismatches between the measurement and the modelling scales at the horizontal scale models typically represent average soil moisture conditions over a model unit 102 106 m2 neglecting small scale heterogeneity in contrast classical in situ methods like tdr are representative for a soil volume of 5 cm around the probe while microwave based sdsm data often report soil moisture over grid sizes of 25 km which means that they often average over different land cover or soil types at the vertical scale distributed models typically represent the soil by a limited number of soil layers without resolving soil moisture variations within layers simulated and measured soil moisture may not represent soil moisture at the same depth since the measurement depths may differ from the average depths of the soil layers in the model and furthermore soil moisture at the average depth of a soil layer may differ from the average soil moisture over this layer for hydrologic applications one limitation of sdsm data are their small sampling depths microwaves only penetrate the top few cm with penetration depths of 0 5 2 cm of c band systems as e g ascat and 3 5 cm of l band systems as e g smap and thus only represent surface soil moisture ssm evapotranspiration as well as runoff generation are typically more strongly affected by root zone soil moisture than by ssm mao et al 2019 rajib et al 2018 furthermore many hydrological models do not explicitly represent ssm and model adaptations may be required to simulate ssm parajka et al 2009 wagner et al 1999 introduced a root zone soil water index swi which is derived from ssm by temporal smoothing it is equivalent to a two layer water balance model assuming that the temporal variation of root zone soil moisture is a linear function of the difference between surface and root zone soil moisture in a validation study based on 826 sensors swi data derived from various ssm products agreed better with near surface 5 cm depth in situ soil moisture measurements than the respective ssm products beck et al 2021 various studies have used swi filtered sdsm data for model calibration e g parajka et al 2006 silvestro et al 2015 sutanudjaja et al 2014 rajib et al 2018 investigated the effect of applying a swi filter to sdsm data used for model calibration they found that calibration to sdsm without a swi filter only affected simulated ssm with little effect on other simulated variables in contrast calibration to sdsm with a swi filter affected also root zone soil moisture streamflow and evapotranspiration simulations previous studies that integrated sdsm data in hydrological model calibration mostly focused on large catchments 500 km2 and often 10 000 km2 due to coarse resolution of most sdsm products recent advances in sdsm downscaling and data fusion methods led to sdsm products with improved spatio temporal resolution peng et al 2017 which may be well suited for model improvements at smaller catchment scales for example by fusing microwave radar data of the metop a b c ascat and the sentinel 1 a b csar c band synthetic aperture radar the derived scatsar product bauer marschallinger et al 2018 benefits from the daily temporal resolution of ascat and the high spatial resolution of the sentinel 1 csar and is provided at daily temporal and 1 km spatial sampling the smapl3e product chan et al 2018 provides soil moisture at a 9 km grid and is based on an interpolation technique that takes advantage of overlapping radiometer footprints an increased performance of this new generation of sdsm products is reflected in improved correlations to simulated soil moisture parajka et al 2006 versus tong et al 2021 multiobjective model calibration with high resolution sdsm products increased the robustness of streamflow simulation during evaluation but also revealed inconsistencies in spatial patterns between the products gomis cebolla et al 2022 promising results of improved streamflow simulation were obtained by integrating recent sdsm products into a hydrological model through data assimilation azimi et al 2020 despite these recent advances there is still a lack of research that investigates the value of this new generation of sdsm products for hydrological model calibration in small to meso scale catchments in this study we aim to contribute to filling this research gap by analysing the value of recent sdsm products at high spatio temporal sampling for model calibration in a meso scale lowland catchment in ne germany specific research objectives are assessing i the performance of different satellite derived swi products compared to in situ data ii the effect of including satellite derived swi data on model performance with regard to observed streamflow and soil moisture data parameter uncertainties and simulation uncertainties and iii the agreement between spatial patterns of simulated and satellite derived soil moisture for this research the process based ecohydrological model ech2o was applied it combines the simulation of water fluxes energy balance and vegetation dynamics and is therefore well suited for analysing interactions between changes in vegetation and water fluxes in a changing climate results of this study are relevant for understanding the value and limitations of using sdsm for improving the internal consistency of eco hydrological models 2 study area the demnitzer millcreek catchment is a 66 km2 lowland catchment with elevations ranging from 38 to 83 m fig 1 it is located in ne germany 55 km east of berlin and contributes to the spree river the pleistocene landscape is dominated by moraine material in the northern part of the catchment and sandier glacio fluvial sediments in the southern part dominant land uses are arable 50 mostly winter wheat barley and maize and forest 36 mostly coniferous pine forests arable land use is generally associated with loamier sands which formed brown earths in the northern part of the catchment while forests are linked to very sandy podzolic soils that are more dominant in the central and southern part of the catchment fig 1 smaller fractions of the catchment are covered by pastures 7 wetlands 4 and settlements 3 based on the period 1990 2018 mean annual precipitation is 570 mm y 1 and in a similar order of magnitude as reference evapotranspiration which is calculated as 650 700 mm y 1 smith et al 2020 snow plays only a marginal role 10 of precipitation streamflow is mainly dominated by groundwater and high flows typically occur during winter spring kleine et al 2021 low flows are observed in summer and the recent drought period resulted in parts of the stream network falling dry for several months kleine et al 2020 3 data and methods 3 1 soil moisture data 3 1 1 in situ soil moisture observations volumetric soil water content was measured under forest forest a and under arable land cropland the data were recorded at 15 min intervals and aggregated to daily values at the forest site top layer soil moisture was sampled at a depth of 20 cm with six sensors smt 100 umwelt geräte technik gmbh müncheberg germany measurement accuracy 0 025 m3 m 3 and measurements started in june 2018 for arable land top layer soil moisture was sampled at two locations at field edge at a depth of 15 cm with two sensors at each location cs 650 campbell scientific usa measurement accuracy 0 03 m3 m 3 and measurements started in march 2019 the data were aggregated by averaging over the six and four sensors for forest a and for cropland respectively fig 2 while the seasonal dynamics were similar the sandier forest site showed more pronounced short term temporal variability and higher small scale spatial variability between sensors 3 1 2 satellite derived soil moisture products we focused on three recent sdsm products with high spatio temporal resolution table 1 we applied swi transformed data rather than ssm data since applying a swi filter showed advantages for comparisons to in situ soil moisture data and when used for model calibration beck et al 2021 rajib et al 2018 two sdsm products were applied that are derived from fusion of scatterometer data of the metop a b c ascat and the sentinel 1 a b csar bauer marschallinger et al 2018 the first product is the scatsar product which is available at 1 km sampling from the copernicus global land service for the period 2015 onwards this product is based on ssm data sets derived from radar backscatter of ascat and sentinel 1 respectively of which the ascat ssm data include a temporally dynamic vegetation correction ascat and sentinel 1 ssm data are combined during the application of the swi filter the second product is the ascat direx swi data set which was provided by the vienna university of technology tu wien and is available 2007 present it is based on a precursor version of the eumetsat h saf ascat disaggregated ssm v2 product which has been generated by applying static directional downscaling parameters derived from sentinel 1 to ascat soil moisture observations compared to the ascat ssm data used for the scatsar product the ascat ssm v2 data used for the ascat direx swi product include an enhanced spatially variable vegetation parameterization with a stronger vegetation correction over vegetated areas hahn et al 2021 the swi filter has been applied to the disaggregated ascat direx ssm v2 data to derive the ascat direx swi data swi observations that were flagged as low quality e g high number of missing data due to snow or frozen soil were removed from the data the third product used is the smap enhanced level 3 smapl3e radiometer soil moisture version 3 product which is distributed at 9 km grid spacing entekhabi et al 2010 o neill et al 2021 soil moisture is derived from l band microwave data and represents ssm at 3 5 cm soil depth the product is a daily global composite of smap enhanced level 2 smapl2e soil moisture which itself is based on smap level 1c enhanced brightness temperatures chan et al 2018 we tested both the ascending overpass at 6 pm and descending overpass at 6 am products the performance was similar and the descending product was used in this study due to low performance of the soil moisture estimates for frozen soil estimates were discarded when average daily air temperature was below a threshold of 4 c derived from testing in contrast to scatsar and ascat direx swi that are provided as swi products smapl3e is provided as ssm product and the swi smoothing filter was applied to the smapl3e ssm data according to wagner et al 1999 1 swi t n i n ssm t i e t n t i t i n e t n t i t for t i t n where ssm t i is the smapl3e ssm estimate at time t i and t is a characteristic time length swi was calculated if 1 retrieval was available during t n t t n and 3 retrievals were available during t n 3t t n t beck et al 2021 the t value depends on the depth of the profile layer that is represented and further on local conditions including soil type wagner et al 1999 in the present study the depth of the profile layer that should be represented is 10 20 cm according to the depths of the in situ measurements and the depth of the top soil layer of the ecohydrological model used in this study and soil types are generally sandy we therefore evaluated swi data with t values of 2 5 and 10 d for evaluating the temporal dynamics of the sdsm data we extracted time series at the location of the in situ sites and compared them to the in situ measurements 3 2 ecohydrological modelling 3 2 1 model description we applied the ecohydrological model ech2o a spatially distributed process based model that simulates energy and water balances as well as vegetation dynamics model equations can be found in maneta and silverman 2013 and appendices of kuppel et al 2018 the spatial discretization is based on a regular raster where each raster cell can have several vegetation types vertical energy and water balance are calculated using a top down scheme from canopy to groundwater for each vegetation type and then integrated over the cell according to fractional shares of the vegetation types the energy balance scheme considers a canopy and a surface layer at the canopy level incoming short and longwave radiation are used to drive the estimation of net radiation latent heat interception evaporation and transpiration and sensible heat fluxes by iteratively solving the canopy energy balance for the effective canopy temperature at the surface level the model considers incoming radiation through and from the canopy longwave radiation emitted by the surface latent heat of evaporation sensible heat flux to the atmosphere ground heat flux heat flux into the snowpack latent heat of snowmelt and sensible heat from rainfall and solves the energy balance for the effective surface skin temperature aerodynamic resistance for the canopy layer is calculated assuming a logarithmic wind profile over canopies and bare soil and an exponential wind profile within canopies canopy resistance is calculated using a jarvis type multiplicative model as function of incoming shortwave radiation air temperature vapour pressure deficit at leaf surface and soil water potential soil resistance for the calculation of soil evaporation is estimated according to sakaguchi and zeng 2009 and increases as the soil becomes drier precipitation partitioning into snow or rain is based on an air temperature threshold set to 2 c in this study snow is simulated using a single layer approach when a snowpack is present surface temperature is assumed the same as the average snowpack temperature and ground heat fluxes are assumed negligible energy fluxes into the snowpack change the snow temperature and after reaching melt temperature further energy input generates snowmelt the water balance scheme considers canopy surface and three soil layer stores canopy interception is calculated by a linear bucket approach that depends on leaf area index lai and maximum canopy water storage in this study vegetation specific and seasonally varying lai was provided as input to the model infiltration is estimated using the green ampt approach in the top soil layer green and ampt 1911 downward percolation to deeper soil layers is gravity driven at soil moisture levels above field capacity according to soil saturation and an effective vertical hydraulic conductivity k v k h k hratio where k h is an effective horizontal hydraulic conductivity and k hratio is the anisotropy ratio exfiltration and upward water movement occurs when soil layers are fully saturated overland flow is generated by ponded surface water at the end of the time step overland flow is routed to the next downstream cell where it is allowed to re infiltrate until it reaches a cell with a stream channel where it becomes streamflow in the lowest soil layer lateral groundwater flow is simulated using a kinematic wave approximation depending on slope and k h where a channel is present groundwater may seep into the stream channel channel flow is calculated based on a nonlinear 1d kinematic wave solution 3 2 2 model setup the ech2o set up for the demnitzer millcreek catchment was based on smith et al 2021 soil types were retrieved from a soil map at the scale of 1 200 000 federal institute for geoscience and natural resources and four dominant soil types were considered brown earths on loamy sands sandy gleys peats and sandy podzols land cover information was extracted from corine 2000 data european environment agency 2016 and four dominant land cover types were represented arable land pastures coniferous forests and broadleaf forests daily climate series of air temperature minimum maximum and average wind speed and relative humidity were obtained from the german weather service dwd weather stations at lindenberg manschnow and müncheberg located at 10 20 km distance to the catchment precipitation data were additionally retrieved from two further stations in neu madlitz and fürstenwalde located at a distance of 1 km and 7 km downward shortwave and downward longwave radiation were obtained from the era5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 climate data were spatially interpolated using thiessen polygons streamflow measurements at demnitz mill are based on 3 hourly water level measurements note that within our study period no data were available before sep 2010 and only bi weekly data were available for nov 2015 may 2016 average seasonal variations of lai were derived from the modis v6 lai product mcd15a3h and adjusted with land cover specific maximum lai values based on ground measurements and literature values see smith et al 2021 the top and lower soil layer extend over 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 5 m respectively and the depths of the third soil layer were determined through calibration a spatial resolution of 500 m and a daily time step were chosen since a previous study showed acceptable model results with regard to model performance and process consistency at this resolution while still enabling relatively fast run times necessary for a high number of simulations smith et al 2021 3 2 3 model calibration and evaluation in order to assess the value of the soil moisture data for model calibration we evaluated four calibration methods using streamflow v1 streamflow and relative sdsm v2 streamflow and sdsm data scaled to in situ data v3 and streamflow and in situ volumetric soil moisture v4 table 3 we also inspected results of an uncalibrated model using simulations of randomly selected parameter sets without selection v0 in calibration method v1 the model was calibrated to daily streamflow at demnitz mill fig 1 using the nash sutcliffe criterion f nse q 2 f v 1 f nse q 1 t 1 t max q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 t max q sim t q obs 2 where q sim t and q obs t are simulated and observed streamflow at time t q obs is the mean of observed streamflow and t max is the number of time steps in calibration methods v2 v4 the model was calibrated to streamflow and soil moisture data observed satellite derived and in situ soil moisture was compared to simulated soil moisture at two sites that are representative for large parts of the catchment a cell with dominant forest land cover 79 coniferous 18 broadleaf over sandy podzolic soil pz forest and a cell with arable land cover over brown earth soil be arable which are also representative for the in situ data at forest a and cropland see fig 1 for their locations time series of simulated and sdsm were extracted for these two sites out of the three sdsm products used in this study the smapl3e product showed the best performance compared to in situ data and was therefore applied for the two calibration methods that applied sdsm v2 and v3 sdsm data are particularly well suited to derive relative soil moisture dynamics in calibration method v2 we therefore evaluated the agreement between simulated soil moisture and satellite derived swi based on correlation 3 f v 2 w q f nse q w sm 0 5 r be r pz where r be and r pz are pearson correlation coefficients between satellite derived swi data and simulated soil moisture in the top layer for the cells be arable and pz forest respectively the weights w q and w sm for the streamflow and soil moisture part of the objective function were set to w q 0 2 and w sm 0 8 after initial testing this means that an improvement of the average correlation to sdsm by 0 1 is rated equally as an improvement of the nash sutcliffe coefficient for streamflow by 0 4 a higher weight for the soil moisture part of the objective function was chosen to account for numerically higher variations of f nse q than in the streamflow part of the objective function in calibration methods v3 and v4 the model was calibrated to streamflow and absolute values of volumetric soil moisture 4 f v3 w q f nse q w sm 0 5 f nse sm be f nse sm pz where f nse sm be f nse sm pz refers to the nash sutcliffe criterion calculated for soil moisture series at the grid cells be arable and pz forest respectively for calibration method v3 the satellite derived swi data s orig t were scaled to the in situ data to derive absolute soil moisture 5 s scaled t s orig t μ swi σ swi σ ins μ ins where s s c a l e d t are the scaled sdsm data and μ swi and μ i n s are the mean values and σ swi and σ ins the standard deviations of the satellite derived swi and the in situ data respectively calculated over a common series where satellite derived swi data and in situ soil moisture from forest a and cropland were available for calibration method v4 the in situ data were used directly for the absolute soil moisture series the streamflow and soil moisture part of the objective function were weighted equally for calibration methods v3 and v4 with w q 0 5 and w sm 0 5 values of the objective functions f v1 f v4 can range from to 1 with 1 being the best possible value monte carlo simulations were used for model calibration this is an efficient approach for comparing multiple calibration settings since the same set of model simulations may be evaluated for different criteria 100 000 random parameter sets were created using latin hypercube sampling to account for parameter uncertainties the results were analysed based on ensembles of 100 best parameter sets 0 1 evaluated based on the objective function of the respective calibration method eqs 2 5 the calibrated parameters and their ranges were selected based on previous experience and sensitivity analysis smith et al 2021 and are listed in table 2 they include seven soil parameters four vegetation related parameters and four other parameters which considering four soil types and four land cover types results in a total of 48 calibrated parameters the model was calibrated for the period 2010 2014 and 2018 2020 this period was chosen in order to include years with high and low streamflow 2007 2009 was used as warm up period and 2015 2017 for model evaluation the data used for model calibration evaluation were available during the study period as follows streamflow data sep 2010 dec 2020 biweekly nov 2015 may 2016 smapl3e sdsm jan 2015 sep 2020 and in situ soil moisture data jun 2018 dec 2020 3 3 spatial patterns of simulated and satellite derived soil moisture spatial patterns of monthly averaged sdsm and simulated soil moisture were inspected and compared to evaluate both of them due to the coarser resolution of smapl3e table 1 only the two ascat based products were considered for this comparison the satellite derived data were resampled to the 500 m model grid using bilinear interpolation due to data gaps in the sdsm during the winter months and availability of the scatsar product since 2015 we restricted this analysis to the months apr nov of the years 2015 2020 in order to be able to compare the satellite derived swi to volumetric simulated soil moisture time series at each grid cell were normalised in both data sets to quantify the agreement of spatial patterns between simulated and satellite derived soil moisture we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient r and the variability ratio α defined as the ratio of the standard deviations of the satellite derived and simulated soil moisture patterns 4 results 4 1 performance of satellite derived soil water index products compared to in situ soil moisture data the satellite derived swi data correlate well to in situ top layer soil moisture pearson correlation values range between 0 64 and 0 86 over all tested t values and 0 67 0 86 for t 10 d fig 4 an increase in performance of the different sdsm products is observed in the order scatsar ascat direx swi smapl3e as the data have different units and ranges they were normalised for the visual comparison by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation fig 3 the agreement between the satellite derived and the in situ data is better for the site cropland than for the site forest a it is furthermore better for swi data with t 10 d than with lower t values fig 3 fig 4 swi data based on the smapl3e product with t 10 d were therefore used for the analyses where sdsm data were applied for model calibration with respect to seasonal variations scatsar and to some extent also ascat direx swi data tend to underestimate soil moisture in spring and to overestimate in autumn fig 3 during the wet winter period the ascat based products capture the dynamics of the in situ soil moisture better than smapl3e 4 2 effects of including satellite derived and in situ soil moisture data in model calibration 4 2 1 simulation of streamflow including soil moisture data into the model calibration generally decreased model performance for streamflow both in the calibration and evaluation period for example f nse q during the calibration period decreased from 0 61 0 6 0 62 numbers in brackets refer to interquartile ranges for calibration method v1 to 0 55 0 52 0 58 for calibration method v4 table 4 the model tends to underestimate streamflow in various years winter 2012 2013 2013 2014 2014 15 2017 2018 and deviations tend to increase when soil moisture data were included in the model calibration fig 5 4 2 2 simulation of relative soil moisture temporal variations of observed satellite derived or in situ normalised soil moisture were very well reflected by the model with average values of pearson correlation in the range of 0 75 0 8 table 4 normalised soil moisture and thus the temporal dynamics was even captured well by the uncalibrated model fig 6 a fig 7 a calibration of the model to streamflow data slightly reduced simulation uncertainty by on average 5 fig 6b fig 7b and including observed soil moisture data in the model calibration further reduced simulation uncertainties by on average 31 fig 6c fig 7c while the drying rate in spring was well captured by the model for the cropland site simulated drying in spring was too fast and too early at the forest site this mismatch also remained when the model was calibrated with in situ observed data fig 7c 4 2 3 simulation of absolute soil moisture larger differences between the calibration methods were observed for absolute than for normalised soil moisture calibration method v1 which includes streamflow and method v2 which includes streamflow and relative soil moisture both resulted in wide uncertainty bands and biases particularly for the cropland site during periods of high soil moisture fig 8 a b fig 9 a b simulation of absolute soil moisture was greatly improved when sdsm scaled to in situ data or in situ soil moisture data were included in model calibration as in calibration methods v3 and v4 this is reflected in higher nse values for absolute soil moisture based on sdsm scaled to in situ soil moisture or in situ soil moisture in calibration and evaluation average f nse sm of 0 57 table 4 as compared to calibration methods v1 and v2 average f nse sm of 0 18 in calibration method v2 average widths of the uncertainty bands were 0 1 and 0 09 m3 m 3 for the forest and cropland site respectively they were reduced by 50 to 0 04 m3 m 3 at both sites for calibration methods v3 and v4 fig 8c d fig 9c d 4 2 4 simulation of evapotranspiration we further investigated how the choice of calibration setting influenced simulated evapotranspiration noticeable differences between the calibration methods were observed during periods of low soil moisture which are characterized by high simulation uncertainties for evapotranspiration fig 10 shows simulated evapotranspiration for the summer 2018 for three calibration methods v1 v3 at two grid cells with dominant forest pz forest and arable be arable land cover simulated evapotranspiration in method v4 is very similar to v3 not shown the differences between the calibration methods are more obvious for arable land cover and affect both the mean as well as uncertainty ranges simulation uncertainties are largest for calibration method v1 and reduced for calibration methods v2 and v3 where soil moisture data were included in the model calibration simulated evapotranspiration in the entire catchment during this period tended to be higher for calibration method v1 than for the other three calibration methods table 5 these differences were dominated by differences in transpiration supplementary fig s1 since simulated soil moisture during summer 2018 was not generally lower in the calibration methods that include soil moisture in the model calibration this did not directly cause the observed differences the differences may rather be related to differences in the model parameters 4 2 5 effects on parameter uncertainties the parameters most strongly affected by including soil moisture data in model calibration were the soil parameters λ bc residual soil moisture θ r porosity ϕ and the vegetation specific parameter k root fig 11 shows cumulative density functions over the 100 best parameter sets for these parameters when calibrating the model to streamflow only calibration method v1 λ bc for the brown earth soil class was constrained to low values v1 λ bc 3 1 0 9 typical for soils with a very high sand fraction including soil moisture in the model calibration resulted in higher values for this parameter v2 λ bc 3 8 1 0 v3 λ bc 4 3 0 9 v4 λ bc 4 3 0 8 typical for loamier sands the differences between the calibration methods were not as large for θ r or ϕ but again calibration methods v3 and v4 constrained these parameters towards parameter values more typical for loamier sands for the podzol soil including absolute soil moisture data in the model calibration v3 and v4 generally affected these soil parameters in the opposite direction shifting them towards values more typical for sandy sands though the differences are weaker than for brown earth overall this shows that as expected including absolute soil moisture data shifted the soil parameters towards parameter values that are more consistent with the expected values of the different soil types i e a loamier sand for the brown earth and a sandier sand for the podzol soil type the vegetation parameters were less sensitive to the different calibration methods than the soil parameters the most sensitive vegetation parameter to the different calibration methods was k root which controls the root distribution in the different soil layers a higher value of k root suggests a higher fraction of roots in the top soil layer where soil moisture typically gets more frequently depleted to very low levels than in lower soil layers for the vegetation type arable the fraction of roots in the top soil layer increased in the order v1 v3 v4 v2 though with large uncertainty ranges larger k root values for calibration method v2 as compared to calibration method v1 led to a higher likelihood for soil moisture limitation of transpiration in calibration method v2 which could explain the different sensitivities of transpiration during dry periods fig 10 fig s1 4 3 spatial patterns of scatsar ascat direx swi and simulated soil moisture data the simulated soil moisture data have a stronger spatial variability than the sdsm data as exemplarily shown for april 2016 and july 2016 in fig 12 fig 13 a shows the temporal variation of the variability ratio α for both data sets α is generally 1 indicating larger standard deviations of the simulated soil moisture patterns as compared to the sdsm with mostly larger values for scatsar than for ascat direx swi fig 13b shows the temporal variation of spatial correlation of the sdsm to simulated soil moisture demonstrating frequent disagreement of the spatial patterns the relative spatial patterns tend to agree in some months as for example in april 2016 where simulated and satellite derived data showed relatively drier conditions in the southern and wetter conditions in the northern part of the catchment fig 12a b c however the patterns can be contradictory as for example in july 2016 fig 12b d f during spring simulated soil moisture frequently showed relatively drier normalised soil moisture in the southern and central part of the catchment fig 12e which may be related to an earlier increase of evapotranspiration under coniferous forest a tendency to similar patterns slightly earlier decrease in soil moisture in the southern part where coniferous forest dominates can also be observed in the sdsm fig 12a c fig 12f for july 2016 shows an example where simulated soil moisture patterns are influenced by interpolated precipitation patterns a more damped behaviour of the sdsm spatial patterns can be explained by a strong influence of the coarser 12 5 km ascat data from which the scatsar and ascat direx swi data are downscaled the scatsar product is generated by fusing individual ssm estimates from sentinel 1 and ascat with a higher weight of ascat ssm due to the higher frequency of ascat compared to sentinel 1 observations in case of the ascat direx swi product soil moisture for a 0 5 km grid cell is calculated as a weighted average of soil moisture from neighbouring ascat grid cells with static weights that depend on pre computed correlations between the sentinel 1 signal of the respective grid cell to the signal at the neighbouring ascat grid cells therefore spatial patterns resulting from small scale precipitation events below ascat resolution cannot captured however spatial patterns at transitions between different soil and land cover types appear to be better represented such as in this study the transition from forest on very sandy soils in the southern and central part of the catchment to arable land on loamier sands in the northern part of the catchment 5 discussion 5 1 effects of including satellite derived swi data on model performance simulation uncertainties and parameter uncertainties 5 1 1 effects on simulated soil moisture and streamflow this study found that including satellite derived swi data within a multivariate calibration improved the internal process representation as demonstrated by reduced uncertainty widths of simulated soil moisture and by improved correlation between simulated and observed satellite derived and in situ soil moisture however volumetric soil moisture data needed to be included in the model calibration for improving model performance with respect to absolute volumetric soil moisture levels for the different calibration methods median correlation between observed satellite derived or in situ and simulated soil moisture was 0 75 0 8 this reflects the high quality of sdsm data in lowland regions as well as relatively high internal consistency of the model with respect to temporal soil moisture dynamics including for the model that was calibrated to streamflow only the values were similar to those reported for lowland pixels in the rhine basin of 0 82 0 86 in a study using ers 1 2 sdsm and the coupled groundwater land surface model pcr globwb sutanudjaja et al 2014 and considerably higher than the median value of 0 4 0 52 reported for 213 catchments in austria in a study using ascat direx swi sdsm and a conceptual hbv type model tong et al 2021 increased model performance for soil moisture dynamics but small effects with respect to streamflow were also found by other studies dimitrova petrova et al 2020 tong et al 2021 depending on the weighting of the streamflow and soil moisture objective functions tong et al 2021 found an improvement of the median correlation of 30 in the calibration and 15 in the evaluation period and a median decrease in model performance for streamflow of 3 including in situ soil moisture estimates based on point estimates or a cosmic ray neutron sensor improved internal process representation in terms of reduced simulation uncertainty of simulated dynamic storage and better correlation between simulated storage and in situ measured soil moisture dimitrova petrova et al 2020 improvements in soil moisture estimation were found to be particularly large where simulated streamflow and soil moisture estimates were poor shahrban et al 2018 azimi et al 2020 found that assimilating sdsm from recent products including smapl3e and scatsar improved streamflow simulations in two italian catchments 140 km2 and 170 km2 the differences to our study in the effect on streamflow model performance may be caused by various reasons including differences in the model in the hydrologic processes in the specific catchments or in the quality of the sdsm in different regions furthermore the differences may be related to using the sdsm in a calibration approach which only affects the model parameterization versus an assimilation approach which can also correct for problems in the input data a remaining issue yet to be solved and also relevant for the present study are limitations concerning the comparability between sdsm data point scale in situ measurements and simulated soil moisture at specific model grid cells robinson et al 2008 while in situ volumetric soil moisture has been derived as an average over several probes which reduces uncertainty at point scale upscaling of these point measurements to a 500 m model grid cell is inherently related with uncertainties a further step for future work will be to explicitly consider observational uncertainties in evaluation and in input data mcmillan et al 2018 uncertainties in soil moisture could be reduced by new measurement techniques such as cosmic ray neutron sensors that are able to measure surface soil moisture over a larger radius zreda et al 2012 new sdsm products with a higher spatial resolution while keeping a high temporal resolution which may become available in the future may be able to better differentiate between soil moisture dynamics under different land cover and soil types and could enable a more direct comparison between sdsm and simulated soil moisture for models of similar resolution as the one in this study 500 m 5 1 2 effects on simulated evapotranspiration we observed a clear effect of including soil moisture data for model calibration on simulated evapotranspiration evapotranspiration under arable land cover during drought conditions was more strongly limited for calibration methods that included soil moisture in model calibration most studies on model calibration with streamflow and soil moisture data focused on effects on these two variables but effects on simulated evapotranspiration were also observed in other studies particularly when including profile soil moisture rajib et al 2018 while out of scope in this study further data should be consulted to evaluate internal process representation regarding evapotranspiration valuable information in this respect may be derived from data at different scales including for example remotely sensed land surface temperatures eddy covariance or lysimeter data as well as dendrometer and sap flow measurements 5 1 3 effects on parameter uncertainties including soil moisture data in the model calibration constrained soil parameters of the two dominant soil types more towards values that would be expected based on the soil texture while multivariate calibration with soil moisture data improved the internal consistency of the model it did not result in narrower parameter ranges as e g observed by rajib et al 2018 who found that including satellite derived ssm and particularly root zone soil moisture led to reduced parameter uncertainties similarly silvestro et al 2015 showed that parameter equifinality of soil parameters could be reduced when including sdsm in model calibration of a process based spatially distributed model the parameters that were affected most by including soil moisture in the model calibration in our study were parameters related to the water retention curve λ bc ϕ θ r which is in line with findings from previous studies for example in a study that applied five conceptual hydrological models and nine remotely sensed data products various parameters were found to be sensitive to including sdsm products with particularly strong sensitivity observed for maximum soil moisture storage nijzink et al 2018 for a large scale hydrological model with four calibration parameters esa cci soil moisture data were found helpful for calibrating minimum soil water capacity and soil saturated hydraulic conductivities lopez et al 2017 in contrast to the latter study saturated soil hydraulic conductivities k h k hratio were rather constrained by the streamflow data and hardly influenced by including soil moisture data in our study this may be explained by the high hydraulic conductivities which affected flow rates into the channel but did hardly limit and therefore had little effect on infiltration rates 5 2 performance of the satellite derived soil moisture products compared to in situ and modelled data the satellite derived data analysed here generally performed well in terms of temporal dynamics and the best performance was observed for smapl3e this agrees with other studies that found a high performance of smap compared to ascat based products beck et al 2021 differences at the seasonal time scale were most apparent larger deviations for ascat direx swi and particularly scatsar can be related to shortcomings of the vegetation parameterization and neglect of field management practices the vegetation cover absorbs and scatters part of the microwave radiation and thus reduces the sensitivity of the backscatter signal to soil moisture both ascat based products include a dynamic vegetation correction to consider these vegetation related variations in the backscatter signal making use of a different behaviour of the dependence of the backscatter signal from incidence angle for vegetation versus soil vegetation effects the amplitude of the vegetation correction can be varied with the choice of the so called dry and wet cross over angles since a recent study has shown advantages of a stronger vegetation correction this has been applied to the more recent ascat direx swi product hahn et al 2021 while the vegetation correction in the scatsar product is weaker the remaining deviations of ascat direx swi data at the seasonal time scale indicate that an even stronger vegetation correction would be beneficial for this study region particularly during spring some similarities of relative spatial patterns between ascat direx swi and scatsar soil moisture to simulated soil moisture could be observed however the direct use of these relative spatial patterns for model calibration seems not advisable small scale spatial anomalies below the ascat resolution could only partly be represented by these products during small scale summer convective storms which can result in high spatial variability of soil moisture uncertainties in spatial patterns of soil moisture are likely more related to input uncertainties rather than parameter uncertainties calibrating the model parameters to match satellite derived spatial patterns without considering uncertainties in the precipitation input therefore bears high risks of introducing disinformation into the model likely resulting in a model that is less robust and has larger uncertainty ranges beven and smith 2015 beven and westerberg 2011 in such cases it may be beneficial to use sdsm data with a high spatio temporal resolution for improving the spatial interpolation of rainfall brocca et al 2014 6 conclusions and implications this study aimed at analysing the value of recent sdsm products smapl3e scatsar and ascat direx swi for multivariate calibration focusing on a 66 km2 lowland catchment in ne germany satellite derived swi data correlated well with in situ top layer soil moisture measurements within the catchment with a slightly higher performance observed for smapl3e than for scatsar and ascat direx swi larger deviations of the latter two products were mainly due to deviations at the seasonal time scale and may be reduced by refining the vegetation correction to local conditions calibrating the ecohydrological model with satellite derived swi data within a multivariate calibration approach improved model performance with respect to soil moisture pearson correlation coefficient between simulated and satellite derived soil moisture increased from 0 76 to 0 79 during calibration and from 0 77 to 0 8 during evaluation and slightly decreased streamflow model performance f nse q decreased from 0 61 to 0 59 during calibration and from 0 42 to 0 40 during evaluation but had only small effects on the simulation of absolute soil moisture f nse sm calculated with sdsm scaled to in situ data during calibration and evaluation increased from 0 14 0 17 to 0 23 0 25 a better process representation in terms of absolute soil moisture was achieved by including in situ data or sdsm scaled to in situ data in the model calibration f nse sm calculated with sdsm scaled to in situ data during calibration and evaluation further increased to 0 56 0 59 improved process consistency was also reflected by the effect on soil parameters which were shifted towards values that would be expected based on soil type and thus assessed as more realistic the comparison of spatial soil moisture patterns of simulated and satellite derived data revealed shortcomings of both data sets at this scale catchment 100 km2 simulated soil moisture patterns were limited by input precipitation patterns that could not adequately represent spatial variability of precipitation during localised convective rainstorms and sdsm were characterized by a damped spatial variability related to a limited ability to depict the spatial variability below the resolution of ascat overall the temporal dynamics rather than the spatial patterns of the sdsm data were valuable for improving the internal consistency of the ecohydrological model for practitioners who consider including soil moisture data for model calibration the following recommendations may be derived from this study 1 integrating sdsm in model calibration is beneficial for improving model internal consistency 2 where available in situ soil moisture data should be included in order to better constrain simulated absolute soil moisture levels 3 at the scale of small to meso scale catchments 100 km2 the temporal dynamics of the sdsm products evaluated here are likely more helpful for model calibration than their spatial patterns author contributions dd designed the study performed the ecohydrological modelling and analyses and wrote the manuscript as contributed to the

2813,soil moisture is a key variable controlling the energy and water balance at the land surface and satellite derived soil moisture sdsm products can therefore be helpful to constrain parameters of eco hydrological models due to coarse resolution of many sdsm products 25 km previous studies mostly focused on large catchments 500 km2 however recent developments in soil moisture remote sensing resulted in sdsm products with improved spatio temporal resolution which are potentially better suited for model calibration in small to meso scale catchments this study therefore aims at assessing the value of three recent sdsm products smapl3e scatsar and ascat direx swi with high spatio temporal resolution spatial sampling 0 5 9 km temporal resolution 1 3 d for the calibration of the process

dynamics of simulated soil moisture increase of pearson correlation coefficient by 0 03 while model performance for streamflow slightly deteriorated decrease of nash sutcliffe efficiency by 0 02 including volumetric soil moisture data based on in situ data or sdsm scaled to in situ data in the model calibration was necessary to further improve the model with respect to absolute soil moisture levels increase of nash sutcliffe efficiency for scaled soil moisture from 0 23 0 25 to 0 56 0 59 comparing spatial patterns of simulated soil moisture and sdsm revealed shortcomings of the simulated and the sdsm data simulated soil moisture spatial patterns are influenced by artefacts of the interpolated precipitation patterns while spatial patterns of sdsm seem too strongly damped based on this study the following recommendations may be derived for practitioners who consider including soil moisture data for model calibration 1 integrating sdsm in model calibration is beneficial for improving model internal consistency 2 where available in situ soil moisture data should be included in order to better constrain simulated absolute soil moisture levels 3 at the scale of small to meso scale

calibration satellite soil moisture smap scatsar ascat direx data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction process based ecohydrological models that integrate the energy balance hydrologic processes and vegetation dynamics are an ideal tool to investigate variations in hydrologic fluxes and storages in a changing climate however complex process based models involve a large number of model parameters beven 2002 many of these parameters cannot be sufficiently constrained by measurements and are typically derived by model calibration while streamflow remains the most commonly used variable for model calibration it is now widely acknowledged that considering only streamflow may lead to large parameter uncertainties and inconsistencies of internal model states e g beven and freer 2001 kirchner 2006 seibert and mcdonnell 2002 one way to improve process consistency of a hydrological model is through multivariate model calibration accounting for variables such as snow cover duethmann et al 2014 finger et al 2011 parajka and blöschl 2008 total water storage anomalies werth and güntner 2010 groundwater level seibert 2000 transpiration kuppel et al 2018 or soil moisture franks et al 1998 parajka et al 2009 soil moisture is a key variable for the energy and water balance at the land surface it affects the partitioning of solar radiation into latent and sensible heat as well as the partitioning of precipitation into direct runoff and catchment storage seneviratne et al 2010 classical in situ methods such as gravimetric sampling or time domain reflectometry tdr enable soil moisture measurements at point scale at high spatial and temporal resolution vereecken et al 2014 such measurements are however not widely available and mostly restricted to research sites furthermore due to their small spatial extent and high heterogeneity of soil characteristics these classical in situ methods may not be representative for larger areas satellite derived products provide near surface soil moisture estimates that are available for virtually any catchment and represent integrated values over larger spatial areas microwave sensors have been found most suitable for deriving soil moisture products from satellite data wagner et al 2007 both active microwave sensors such as the advanced scatterometer ascat figa saldaña et al 2002 wagner et al 2013 on board the series of meteorological operational metop satellites or its predecessor the active microwave instrument ami on board the european remote sensing satellites ers 1 ers 2 pulliainen et al 1998 and passive sensors such as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 imaoka et al 2010 okuyama and imaoka 2015 or radiometers of the soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010 and soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 missions are used for soil moisture detection various previous studies have used satellite derived soil moisture sdsm to evaluate calibrate conceptual and process based hydrological models nijzink et al 2018 rajib et al 2018 rakovec et al 2016 silvestro et al 2015 tong et al 2021 including soil moisture in model calibration often had only small effects on streamflow model performance but increased model performance with respect to soil moisture shahrban et al 2018 tong et al 2021 however while streamflow was often not strongly affected the changes in simulated soil moisture can be relevant for the simulation of other fluxes such as evapotranspiration rajib et al 2018 integrating sdsm and land surface temperatures in the model calibration helped constrain soil model parameters that only showed a weak dependence on streamflow silvestro et al 2015 reduced parameter uncertainties were also observed for including sdsm in the calibration of a conceptual hydrological model for catchments in austria parajka et al 2009 when comparing simulated and observed soil moisture one has to keep in mind that this comparison is not straightforward due to mismatches between the measurement and the modelling scales at the horizontal scale models typically represent average soil moisture conditions over a model unit 102 106 m2 neglecting small scale heterogeneity in contrast classical in situ methods like tdr are representative for a soil volume of 5 cm around the probe while microwave based sdsm data often report soil moisture over grid sizes of 25 km which means that they often average over different land cover or soil types at the vertical scale distributed models typically represent the soil by a limited number of soil layers without resolving soil moisture variations within layers simulated and measured soil moisture may not represent soil moisture at the same depth since the measurement depths may differ from the average depths of the soil layers in the model and furthermore soil moisture at the average depth of a soil layer may differ from the average soil moisture over this layer for hydrologic applications one limitation of sdsm data are their small sampling depths microwaves only penetrate the top few cm with penetration depths of 0 5 2 cm of c band systems as e g ascat and 3 5 cm of l band systems as e g smap and thus only represent surface soil moisture ssm evapotranspiration as well as runoff generation are typically more strongly affected by root zone soil moisture than by ssm mao et al 2019 rajib et al 2018 furthermore many hydrological models do not explicitly represent ssm and model adaptations may be required to simulate ssm parajka et al 2009 wagner et al 1999 introduced a root zone soil water index swi which is derived from ssm by temporal smoothing it is equivalent to a two layer water balance model assuming that the temporal variation of root zone soil moisture is a linear function of the difference between surface and root zone soil moisture in a validation study based on 826 sensors swi data derived from various ssm products agreed better with near surface 5 cm depth in situ soil moisture measurements than the respective ssm products beck et al 2021 various studies have used swi filtered sdsm data for model calibration e g parajka et al 2006 silvestro et al 2015 sutanudjaja et al 2014 rajib et al 2018 investigated the effect of applying a swi filter to sdsm data used for model calibration they found that calibration to sdsm without a swi filter only affected simulated ssm with little effect on other simulated variables in contrast calibration to sdsm with a swi filter affected also root zone soil moisture streamflow and evapotranspiration simulations previous studies that integrated sdsm data in hydrological model calibration mostly focused on large catchments 500 km2 and often 10 000 km2 due to coarse resolution of most sdsm products recent advances in sdsm downscaling and data fusion methods led to sdsm products with improved spatio temporal resolution peng et al 2017 which may be well suited for model improvements at smaller catchment scales for example by fusing microwave radar data of the metop a b c ascat and the sentinel 1 a b csar c band synthetic aperture radar the derived scatsar product bauer marschallinger et al 2018 benefits from the daily temporal resolution of ascat and the high spatial resolution of the sentinel 1 csar and is provided at daily temporal and 1 km spatial sampling the smapl3e product chan et al 2018 provides soil moisture at a 9 km grid and is based on an interpolation technique that takes advantage of overlapping radiometer footprints an increased performance of this new generation of sdsm products is reflected in improved correlations to simulated soil moisture parajka et al 2006 versus tong et al 2021 multiobjective model calibration with high resolution sdsm products increased the robustness of streamflow simulation during evaluation but also revealed inconsistencies in spatial patterns between the products gomis cebolla et al 2022 promising results of improved streamflow simulation were obtained by integrating recent sdsm products into a hydrological model through data assimilation azimi et al 2020 despite these recent advances there is still a lack of research that investigates the value of this new generation of sdsm products for hydrological model calibration in small to meso scale catchments in this study we aim to contribute to filling this research gap by analysing the value of recent sdsm products at high spatio temporal sampling for model calibration in a meso scale lowland catchment in ne germany specific research objectives are assessing i the performance of different satellite derived swi products compared to in situ data ii the effect of including satellite derived swi data on model performance with regard to observed streamflow and soil moisture data parameter uncertainties and simulation uncertainties and iii the agreement between spatial patterns of simulated and satellite derived soil moisture for this research the process based ecohydrological model ech2o was applied it combines the simulation of water fluxes energy balance and vegetation dynamics and is therefore well suited for analysing interactions between changes in vegetation and water fluxes in a changing climate results of this study are relevant for understanding the value and limitations of using sdsm for improving the internal consistency of eco hydrological models 2 study area the demnitzer millcreek catchment is a 66 km2 lowland catchment with elevations ranging from 38 to 83 m fig 1 it is located in ne germany 55 km east of berlin and contributes to the spree river the pleistocene landscape is dominated by moraine material in the northern part of the catchment and sandier glacio fluvial sediments in the southern part dominant land uses are arable 50 mostly winter wheat barley and maize and forest 36 mostly coniferous pine forests arable land use is generally associated with loamier sands which formed brown earths in the northern part of the catchment while forests are linked to very sandy podzolic soils that are more dominant in the central and southern part of the catchment fig 1 smaller fractions of the catchment are covered by pastures 7 wetlands 4 and settlements 3 based on the period 1990 2018 mean annual precipitation is 570 mm y 1 and in a similar order of magnitude as reference evapotranspiration which is calculated as 650 700 mm y 1 smith et al 2020 snow plays only a marginal role 10 of precipitation streamflow is mainly dominated by groundwater and high flows typically occur during winter spring kleine et al 2021 low flows are observed in summer and the recent drought period resulted in parts of the stream network falling dry for several months kleine et al 2020 3 data and methods 3 1 soil moisture data 3 1 1 in situ soil moisture observations volumetric soil water content was measured under forest forest a and under arable land cropland the data were recorded at 15 min intervals and aggregated to daily values at the forest site top layer soil moisture was sampled at a depth of 20 cm with six sensors smt 100 umwelt geräte technik gmbh müncheberg germany measurement accuracy 0 025 m3 m 3 and measurements started in june 2018 for arable land top layer soil moisture was sampled at two locations at field edge at a depth of 15 cm with two sensors at each location cs 650 campbell scientific usa measurement accuracy 0 03 m3 m 3 and measurements started in march 2019 the data were aggregated by averaging over the six and four sensors for forest a and for cropland respectively fig 2 while the seasonal dynamics were similar the sandier forest site showed more pronounced short term temporal variability and higher small scale spatial variability between sensors 3 1 2 satellite derived soil moisture products we focused on three recent sdsm products with high spatio temporal resolution table 1 we applied swi transformed data rather than ssm data since applying a swi filter showed advantages for comparisons to in situ soil moisture data and when used for model calibration beck et al 2021 rajib et al 2018 two sdsm products were applied that are derived from fusion of scatterometer data of the metop a b c ascat and the sentinel 1 a b csar bauer marschallinger et al 2018 the first product is the scatsar product which is available at 1 km sampling from the copernicus global land service for the period 2015 onwards this product is based on ssm data sets derived from radar backscatter of ascat and sentinel 1 respectively of which the ascat ssm data include a temporally dynamic vegetation correction ascat and sentinel 1 ssm data are combined during the application of the swi filter the second product is the ascat direx swi data set which was provided by the vienna university of technology tu wien and is available 2007 present it is based on a precursor version of the eumetsat h saf ascat disaggregated ssm v2 product which has been generated by applying static directional downscaling parameters derived from sentinel 1 to ascat soil moisture observations compared to the ascat ssm data used for the scatsar product the ascat ssm v2 data used for the ascat direx swi product include an enhanced spatially variable vegetation parameterization with a stronger vegetation correction over vegetated areas hahn et al 2021 the swi filter has been applied to the disaggregated ascat direx ssm v2 data to derive the ascat direx swi data swi observations that were flagged as low quality e g high number of missing data due to snow or frozen soil were removed from the data the third product used is the smap enhanced level 3 smapl3e radiometer soil moisture version 3 product which is distributed at 9 km grid spacing entekhabi et al 2010 o neill et al 2021 soil moisture is derived from l band microwave data and represents ssm at 3 5 cm soil depth the product is a daily global composite of smap enhanced level 2 smapl2e soil moisture which itself is based on smap level 1c enhanced brightness temperatures chan et al 2018 we tested both the ascending overpass at 6 pm and descending overpass at 6 am products the performance was similar and the descending product was used in this study due to low performance of the soil moisture estimates for frozen soil estimates were discarded when average daily air temperature was below a threshold of 4 c derived from testing in contrast to scatsar and ascat direx swi that are provided as swi products smapl3e is provided as ssm product and the swi smoothing filter was applied to the smapl3e ssm data according to wagner et al 1999 1 swi t n i n ssm t i e t n t i t i n e t n t i t for t i t n where ssm t i is the smapl3e ssm estimate at time t i and t is a characteristic time length swi was calculated if 1 retrieval was available during t n t t n and 3 retrievals were available during t n 3t t n t beck et al 2021 the t value depends on the depth of the profile layer that is represented and further on local conditions including soil type wagner et al 1999 in the present study the depth of the profile layer that should be represented is 10 20 cm according to the depths of the in situ measurements and the depth of the top soil layer of the ecohydrological model used in this study and soil types are generally sandy we therefore evaluated swi data with t values of 2 5 and 10 d for evaluating the temporal dynamics of the sdsm data we extracted time series at the location of the in situ sites and compared them to the in situ measurements 3 2 ecohydrological modelling 3 2 1 model description we applied the ecohydrological model ech2o a spatially distributed process based model that simulates energy and water balances as well as vegetation dynamics model equations can be found in maneta and silverman 2013 and appendices of kuppel et al 2018 the spatial discretization is based on a regular raster where each raster cell can have several vegetation types vertical energy and water balance are calculated using a top down scheme from canopy to groundwater for each vegetation type and then integrated over the cell according to fractional shares of the vegetation types the energy balance scheme considers a canopy and a surface layer at the canopy level incoming short and longwave radiation are used to drive the estimation of net radiation latent heat interception evaporation and transpiration and sensible heat fluxes by iteratively solving the canopy energy balance for the effective canopy temperature at the surface level the model considers incoming radiation through and from the canopy longwave radiation emitted by the surface latent heat of evaporation sensible heat flux to the atmosphere ground heat flux heat flux into the snowpack latent heat of snowmelt and sensible heat from rainfall and solves the energy balance for the effective surface skin temperature aerodynamic resistance for the canopy layer is calculated assuming a logarithmic wind profile over canopies and bare soil and an exponential wind profile within canopies canopy resistance is calculated using a jarvis type multiplicative model as function of incoming shortwave radiation air temperature vapour pressure deficit at leaf surface and soil water potential soil resistance for the calculation of soil evaporation is estimated according to sakaguchi and zeng 2009 and increases as the soil becomes drier precipitation partitioning into snow or rain is based on an air temperature threshold set to 2 c in this study snow is simulated using a single layer approach when a snowpack is present surface temperature is assumed the same as the average snowpack temperature and ground heat fluxes are assumed negligible energy fluxes into the snowpack change the snow temperature and after reaching melt temperature further energy input generates snowmelt the water balance scheme considers canopy surface and three soil layer stores canopy interception is calculated by a linear bucket approach that depends on leaf area index lai and maximum canopy water storage in this study vegetation specific and seasonally varying lai was provided as input to the model infiltration is estimated using the green ampt approach in the top soil layer green and ampt 1911 downward percolation to deeper soil layers is gravity driven at soil moisture levels above field capacity according to soil saturation and an effective vertical hydraulic conductivity k v k h k hratio where k h is an effective horizontal hydraulic conductivity and k hratio is the anisotropy ratio exfiltration and upward water movement occurs when soil layers are fully saturated overland flow is generated by ponded surface water at the end of the time step overland flow is routed to the next downstream cell where it is allowed to re infiltrate until it reaches a cell with a stream channel where it becomes streamflow in the lowest soil layer lateral groundwater flow is simulated using a kinematic wave approximation depending on slope and k h where a channel is present groundwater may seep into the stream channel channel flow is calculated based on a nonlinear 1d kinematic wave solution 3 2 2 model setup the ech2o set up for the demnitzer millcreek catchment was based on smith et al 2021 soil types were retrieved from a soil map at the scale of 1 200 000 federal institute for geoscience and natural resources and four dominant soil types were considered brown earths on loamy sands sandy gleys peats and sandy podzols land cover information was extracted from corine 2000 data european environment agency 2016 and four dominant land cover types were represented arable land pastures coniferous forests and broadleaf forests daily climate series of air temperature minimum maximum and average wind speed and relative humidity were obtained from the german weather service dwd weather stations at lindenberg manschnow and müncheberg located at 10 20 km distance to the catchment precipitation data were additionally retrieved from two further stations in neu madlitz and fürstenwalde located at a distance of 1 km and 7 km downward shortwave and downward longwave radiation were obtained from the era5 reanalysis hersbach et al 2020 climate data were spatially interpolated using thiessen polygons streamflow measurements at demnitz mill are based on 3 hourly water level measurements note that within our study period no data were available before sep 2010 and only bi weekly data were available for nov 2015 may 2016 average seasonal variations of lai were derived from the modis v6 lai product mcd15a3h and adjusted with land cover specific maximum lai values based on ground measurements and literature values see smith et al 2021 the top and lower soil layer extend over 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 5 m respectively and the depths of the third soil layer were determined through calibration a spatial resolution of 500 m and a daily time step were chosen since a previous study showed acceptable model results with regard to model performance and process consistency at this resolution while still enabling relatively fast run times necessary for a high number of simulations smith et al 2021 3 2 3 model calibration and evaluation in order to assess the value of the soil moisture data for model calibration we evaluated four calibration methods using streamflow v1 streamflow and relative sdsm v2 streamflow and sdsm data scaled to in situ data v3 and streamflow and in situ volumetric soil moisture v4 table 3 we also inspected results of an uncalibrated model using simulations of randomly selected parameter sets without selection v0 in calibration method v1 the model was calibrated to daily streamflow at demnitz mill fig 1 using the nash sutcliffe criterion f nse q 2 f v 1 f nse q 1 t 1 t max q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 t max q sim t q obs 2 where q sim t and q obs t are simulated and observed streamflow at time t q obs is the mean of observed streamflow and t max is the number of time steps in calibration methods v2 v4 the model was calibrated to streamflow and soil moisture data observed satellite derived and in situ soil moisture was compared to simulated soil moisture at two sites that are representative for large parts of the catchment a cell with dominant forest land cover 79 coniferous 18 broadleaf over sandy podzolic soil pz forest and a cell with arable land cover over brown earth soil be arable which are also representative for the in situ data at forest a and cropland see fig 1 for their locations time series of simulated and sdsm were extracted for these two sites out of the three sdsm products used in this study the smapl3e product showed the best performance compared to in situ data and was therefore applied for the two calibration methods that applied sdsm v2 and v3 sdsm data are particularly well suited to derive relative soil moisture dynamics in calibration method v2 we therefore evaluated the agreement between simulated soil moisture and satellite derived swi based on correlation 3 f v 2 w q f nse q w sm 0 5 r be r pz where r be and r pz are pearson correlation coefficients between satellite derived swi data and simulated soil moisture in the top layer for the cells be arable and pz forest respectively the weights w q and w sm for the streamflow and soil moisture part of the objective function were set to w q 0 2 and w sm 0 8 after initial testing this means that an improvement of the average correlation to sdsm by 0 1 is rated equally as an improvement of the nash sutcliffe coefficient for streamflow by 0 4 a higher weight for the soil moisture part of the objective function was chosen to account for numerically higher variations of f nse q than in the streamflow part of the objective function in calibration methods v3 and v4 the model was calibrated to streamflow and absolute values of volumetric soil moisture 4 f v3 w q f nse q w sm 0 5 f nse sm be f nse sm pz where f nse sm be f nse sm pz refers to the nash sutcliffe criterion calculated for soil moisture series at the grid cells be arable and pz forest respectively for calibration method v3 the satellite derived swi data s orig t were scaled to the in situ data to derive absolute soil moisture 5 s scaled t s orig t μ swi σ swi σ ins μ ins where s s c a l e d t are the scaled sdsm data and μ swi and μ i n s are the mean values and σ swi and σ ins the standard deviations of the satellite derived swi and the in situ data respectively calculated over a common series where satellite derived swi data and in situ soil moisture from forest a and cropland were available for calibration method v4 the in situ data were used directly for the absolute soil moisture series the streamflow and soil moisture part of the objective function were weighted equally for calibration methods v3 and v4 with w q 0 5 and w sm 0 5 values of the objective functions f v1 f v4 can range from to 1 with 1 being the best possible value monte carlo simulations were used for model calibration this is an efficient approach for comparing multiple calibration settings since the same set of model simulations may be evaluated for different criteria 100 000 random parameter sets were created using latin hypercube sampling to account for parameter uncertainties the results were analysed based on ensembles of 100 best parameter sets 0 1 evaluated based on the objective function of the respective calibration method eqs 2 5 the calibrated parameters and their ranges were selected based on previous experience and sensitivity analysis smith et al 2021 and are listed in table 2 they include seven soil parameters four vegetation related parameters and four other parameters which considering four soil types and four land cover types results in a total of 48 calibrated parameters the model was calibrated for the period 2010 2014 and 2018 2020 this period was chosen in order to include years with high and low streamflow 2007 2009 was used as warm up period and 2015 2017 for model evaluation the data used for model calibration evaluation were available during the study period as follows streamflow data sep 2010 dec 2020 biweekly nov 2015 may 2016 smapl3e sdsm jan 2015 sep 2020 and in situ soil moisture data jun 2018 dec 2020 3 3 spatial patterns of simulated and satellite derived soil moisture spatial patterns of monthly averaged sdsm and simulated soil moisture were inspected and compared to evaluate both of them due to the coarser resolution of smapl3e table 1 only the two ascat based products were considered for this comparison the satellite derived data were resampled to the 500 m model grid using bilinear interpolation due to data gaps in the sdsm during the winter months and availability of the scatsar product since 2015 we restricted this analysis to the months apr nov of the years 2015 2020 in order to be able to compare the satellite derived swi to volumetric simulated soil moisture time series at each grid cell were normalised in both data sets to quantify the agreement of spatial patterns between simulated and satellite derived soil moisture we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient r and the variability ratio α defined as the ratio of the standard deviations of the satellite derived and simulated soil moisture patterns 4 results 4 1 performance of satellite derived soil water index products compared to in situ soil moisture data the satellite derived swi data correlate well to in situ top layer soil moisture pearson correlation values range between 0 64 and 0 86 over all tested t values and 0 67 0 86 for t 10 d fig 4 an increase in performance of the different sdsm products is observed in the order scatsar ascat direx swi smapl3e as the data have different units and ranges they were normalised for the visual comparison by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation fig 3 the agreement between the satellite derived and the in situ data is better for the site cropland than for the site forest a it is furthermore better for swi data with t 10 d than with lower t values fig 3 fig 4 swi data based on the smapl3e product with t 10 d were therefore used for the analyses where sdsm data were applied for model calibration with respect to seasonal variations scatsar and to some extent also ascat direx swi data tend to underestimate soil moisture in spring and to overestimate in autumn fig 3 during the wet winter period the ascat based products capture the dynamics of the in situ soil moisture better than smapl3e 4 2 effects of including satellite derived and in situ soil moisture data in model calibration 4 2 1 simulation of streamflow including soil moisture data into the model calibration generally decreased model performance for streamflow both in the calibration and evaluation period for example f nse q during the calibration period decreased from 0 61 0 6 0 62 numbers in brackets refer to interquartile ranges for calibration method v1 to 0 55 0 52 0 58 for calibration method v4 table 4 the model tends to underestimate streamflow in various years winter 2012 2013 2013 2014 2014 15 2017 2018 and deviations tend to increase when soil moisture data were included in the model calibration fig 5 4 2 2 simulation of relative soil moisture temporal variations of observed satellite derived or in situ normalised soil moisture were very well reflected by the model with average values of pearson correlation in the range of 0 75 0 8 table 4 normalised soil moisture and thus the temporal dynamics was even captured well by the uncalibrated model fig 6 a fig 7 a calibration of the model to streamflow data slightly reduced simulation uncertainty by on average 5 fig 6b fig 7b and including observed soil moisture data in the model calibration further reduced simulation uncertainties by on average 31 fig 6c fig 7c while the drying rate in spring was well captured by the model for the cropland site simulated drying in spring was too fast and too early at the forest site this mismatch also remained when the model was calibrated with in situ observed data fig 7c 4 2 3 simulation of absolute soil moisture larger differences between the calibration methods were observed for absolute than for normalised soil moisture calibration method v1 which includes streamflow and method v2 which includes streamflow and relative soil moisture both resulted in wide uncertainty bands and biases particularly for the cropland site during periods of high soil moisture fig 8 a b fig 9 a b simulation of absolute soil moisture was greatly improved when sdsm scaled to in situ data or in situ soil moisture data were included in model calibration as in calibration methods v3 and v4 this is reflected in higher nse values for absolute soil moisture based on sdsm scaled to in situ soil moisture or in situ soil moisture in calibration and evaluation average f nse sm of 0 57 table 4 as compared to calibration methods v1 and v2 average f nse sm of 0 18 in calibration method v2 average widths of the uncertainty bands were 0 1 and 0 09 m3 m 3 for the forest and cropland site respectively they were reduced by 50 to 0 04 m3 m 3 at both sites for calibration methods v3 and v4 fig 8c d fig 9c d 4 2 4 simulation of evapotranspiration we further investigated how the choice of calibration setting influenced simulated evapotranspiration noticeable differences between the calibration methods were observed during periods of low soil moisture which are characterized by high simulation uncertainties for evapotranspiration fig 10 shows simulated evapotranspiration for the summer 2018 for three calibration methods v1 v3 at two grid cells with dominant forest pz forest and arable be arable land cover simulated evapotranspiration in method v4 is very similar to v3 not shown the differences between the calibration methods are more obvious for arable land cover and affect both the mean as well as uncertainty ranges simulation uncertainties are largest for calibration method v1 and reduced for calibration methods v2 and v3 where soil moisture data were included in the model calibration simulated evapotranspiration in the entire catchment during this period tended to be higher for calibration method v1 than for the other three calibration methods table 5 these differences were dominated by differences in transpiration supplementary fig s1 since simulated soil moisture during summer 2018 was not generally lower in the calibration methods that include soil moisture in the model calibration this did not directly cause the observed differences the differences may rather be related to differences in the model parameters 4 2 5 effects on parameter uncertainties the parameters most strongly affected by including soil moisture data in model calibration were the soil parameters λ bc residual soil moisture θ r porosity ϕ and the vegetation specific parameter k root fig 11 shows cumulative density functions over the 100 best parameter sets for these parameters when calibrating the model to streamflow only calibration method v1 λ bc for the brown earth soil class was constrained to low values v1 λ bc 3 1 0 9 typical for soils with a very high sand fraction including soil moisture in the model calibration resulted in higher values for this parameter v2 λ bc 3 8 1 0 v3 λ bc 4 3 0 9 v4 λ bc 4 3 0 8 typical for loamier sands the differences between the calibration methods were not as large for θ r or ϕ but again calibration methods v3 and v4 constrained these parameters towards parameter values more typical for loamier sands for the podzol soil including absolute soil moisture data in the model calibration v3 and v4 generally affected these soil parameters in the opposite direction shifting them towards values more typical for sandy sands though the differences are weaker than for brown earth overall this shows that as expected including absolute soil moisture data shifted the soil parameters towards parameter values that are more consistent with the expected values of the different soil types i e a loamier sand for the brown earth and a sandier sand for the podzol soil type the vegetation parameters were less sensitive to the different calibration methods than the soil parameters the most sensitive vegetation parameter to the different calibration methods was k root which controls the root distribution in the different soil layers a higher value of k root suggests a higher fraction of roots in the top soil layer where soil moisture typically gets more frequently depleted to very low levels than in lower soil layers for the vegetation type arable the fraction of roots in the top soil layer increased in the order v1 v3 v4 v2 though with large uncertainty ranges larger k root values for calibration method v2 as compared to calibration method v1 led to a higher likelihood for soil moisture limitation of transpiration in calibration method v2 which could explain the different sensitivities of transpiration during dry periods fig 10 fig s1 4 3 spatial patterns of scatsar ascat direx swi and simulated soil moisture data the simulated soil moisture data have a stronger spatial variability than the sdsm data as exemplarily shown for april 2016 and july 2016 in fig 12 fig 13 a shows the temporal variation of the variability ratio α for both data sets α is generally 1 indicating larger standard deviations of the simulated soil moisture patterns as compared to the sdsm with mostly larger values for scatsar than for ascat direx swi fig 13b shows the temporal variation of spatial correlation of the sdsm to simulated soil moisture demonstrating frequent disagreement of the spatial patterns the relative spatial patterns tend to agree in some months as for example in april 2016 where simulated and satellite derived data showed relatively drier conditions in the southern and wetter conditions in the northern part of the catchment fig 12a b c however the patterns can be contradictory as for example in july 2016 fig 12b d f during spring simulated soil moisture frequently showed relatively drier normalised soil moisture in the southern and central part of the catchment fig 12e which may be related to an earlier increase of evapotranspiration under coniferous forest a tendency to similar patterns slightly earlier decrease in soil moisture in the southern part where coniferous forest dominates can also be observed in the sdsm fig 12a c fig 12f for july 2016 shows an example where simulated soil moisture patterns are influenced by interpolated precipitation patterns a more damped behaviour of the sdsm spatial patterns can be explained by a strong influence of the coarser 12 5 km ascat data from which the scatsar and ascat direx swi data are downscaled the scatsar product is generated by fusing individual ssm estimates from sentinel 1 and ascat with a higher weight of ascat ssm due to the higher frequency of ascat compared to sentinel 1 observations in case of the ascat direx swi product soil moisture for a 0 5 km grid cell is calculated as a weighted average of soil moisture from neighbouring ascat grid cells with static weights that depend on pre computed correlations between the sentinel 1 signal of the respective grid cell to the signal at the neighbouring ascat grid cells therefore spatial patterns resulting from small scale precipitation events below ascat resolution cannot captured however spatial patterns at transitions between different soil and land cover types appear to be better represented such as in this study the transition from forest on very sandy soils in the southern and central part of the catchment to arable land on loamier sands in the northern part of the catchment 5 discussion 5 1 effects of including satellite derived swi data on model performance simulation uncertainties and parameter uncertainties 5 1 1 effects on simulated soil moisture and streamflow this study found that including satellite derived swi data within a multivariate calibration improved the internal process representation as demonstrated by reduced uncertainty widths of simulated soil moisture and by improved correlation between simulated and observed satellite derived and in situ soil moisture however volumetric soil moisture data needed to be included in the model calibration for improving model performance with respect to absolute volumetric soil moisture levels for the different calibration methods median correlation between observed satellite derived or in situ and simulated soil moisture was 0 75 0 8 this reflects the high quality of sdsm data in lowland regions as well as relatively high internal consistency of the model with respect to temporal soil moisture dynamics including for the model that was calibrated to streamflow only the values were similar to those reported for lowland pixels in the rhine basin of 0 82 0 86 in a study using ers 1 2 sdsm and the coupled groundwater land surface model pcr globwb sutanudjaja et al 2014 and considerably higher than the median value of 0 4 0 52 reported for 213 catchments in austria in a study using ascat direx swi sdsm and a conceptual hbv type model tong et al 2021 increased model performance for soil moisture dynamics but small effects with respect to streamflow were also found by other studies dimitrova petrova et al 2020 tong et al 2021 depending on the weighting of the streamflow and soil moisture objective functions tong et al 2021 found an improvement of the median correlation of 30 in the calibration and 15 in the evaluation period and a median decrease in model performance for streamflow of 3 including in situ soil moisture estimates based on point estimates or a cosmic ray neutron sensor improved internal process representation in terms of reduced simulation uncertainty of simulated dynamic storage and better correlation between simulated storage and in situ measured soil moisture dimitrova petrova et al 2020 improvements in soil moisture estimation were found to be particularly large where simulated streamflow and soil moisture estimates were poor shahrban et al 2018 azimi et al 2020 found that assimilating sdsm from recent products including smapl3e and scatsar improved streamflow simulations in two italian catchments 140 km2 and 170 km2 the differences to our study in the effect on streamflow model performance may be caused by various reasons including differences in the model in the hydrologic processes in the specific catchments or in the quality of the sdsm in different regions furthermore the differences may be related to using the sdsm in a calibration approach which only affects the model parameterization versus an assimilation approach which can also correct for problems in the input data a remaining issue yet to be solved and also relevant for the present study are limitations concerning the comparability between sdsm data point scale in situ measurements and simulated soil moisture at specific model grid cells robinson et al 2008 while in situ volumetric soil moisture has been derived as an average over several probes which reduces uncertainty at point scale upscaling of these point measurements to a 500 m model grid cell is inherently related with uncertainties a further step for future work will be to explicitly consider observational uncertainties in evaluation and in input data mcmillan et al 2018 uncertainties in soil moisture could be reduced by new measurement techniques such as cosmic ray neutron sensors that are able to measure surface soil moisture over a larger radius zreda et al 2012 new sdsm products with a higher spatial resolution while keeping a high temporal resolution which may become available in the future may be able to better differentiate between soil moisture dynamics under different land cover and soil types and could enable a more direct comparison between sdsm and simulated soil moisture for models of similar resolution as the one in this study 500 m 5 1 2 effects on simulated evapotranspiration we observed a clear effect of including soil moisture data for model calibration on simulated evapotranspiration evapotranspiration under arable land cover during drought conditions was more strongly limited for calibration methods that included soil moisture in model calibration most studies on model calibration with streamflow and soil moisture data focused on effects on these two variables but effects on simulated evapotranspiration were also observed in other studies particularly when including profile soil moisture rajib et al 2018 while out of scope in this study further data should be consulted to evaluate internal process representation regarding evapotranspiration valuable information in this respect may be derived from data at different scales including for example remotely sensed land surface temperatures eddy covariance or lysimeter data as well as dendrometer and sap flow measurements 5 1 3 effects on parameter uncertainties including soil moisture data in the model calibration constrained soil parameters of the two dominant soil types more towards values that would be expected based on the soil texture while multivariate calibration with soil moisture data improved the internal consistency of the model it did not result in narrower parameter ranges as e g observed by rajib et al 2018 who found that including satellite derived ssm and particularly root zone soil moisture led to reduced parameter uncertainties similarly silvestro et al 2015 showed that parameter equifinality of soil parameters could be reduced when including sdsm in model calibration of a process based spatially distributed model the parameters that were affected most by including soil moisture in the model calibration in our study were parameters related to the water retention curve λ bc ϕ θ r which is in line with findings from previous studies for example in a study that applied five conceptual hydrological models and nine remotely sensed data products various parameters were found to be sensitive to including sdsm products with particularly strong sensitivity observed for maximum soil moisture storage nijzink et al 2018 for a large scale hydrological model with four calibration parameters esa cci soil moisture data were found helpful for calibrating minimum soil water capacity and soil saturated hydraulic conductivities lopez et al 2017 in contrast to the latter study saturated soil hydraulic conductivities k h k hratio were rather constrained by the streamflow data and hardly influenced by including soil moisture data in our study this may be explained by the high hydraulic conductivities which affected flow rates into the channel but did hardly limit and therefore had little effect on infiltration rates 5 2 performance of the satellite derived soil moisture products compared to in situ and modelled data the satellite derived data analysed here generally performed well in terms of temporal dynamics and the best performance was observed for smapl3e this agrees with other studies that found a high performance of smap compared to ascat based products beck et al 2021 differences at the seasonal time scale were most apparent larger deviations for ascat direx swi and particularly scatsar can be related to shortcomings of the vegetation parameterization and neglect of field management practices the vegetation cover absorbs and scatters part of the microwave radiation and thus reduces the sensitivity of the backscatter signal to soil moisture both ascat based products include a dynamic vegetation correction to consider these vegetation related variations in the backscatter signal making use of a different behaviour of the dependence of the backscatter signal from incidence angle for vegetation versus soil vegetation effects the amplitude of the vegetation correction can be varied with the choice of the so called dry and wet cross over angles since a recent study has shown advantages of a stronger vegetation correction this has been applied to the more recent ascat direx swi product hahn et al 2021 while the vegetation correction in the scatsar product is weaker the remaining deviations of ascat direx swi data at the seasonal time scale indicate that an even stronger vegetation correction would be beneficial for this study region particularly during spring some similarities of relative spatial patterns between ascat direx swi and scatsar soil moisture to simulated soil moisture could be observed however the direct use of these relative spatial patterns for model calibration seems not advisable small scale spatial anomalies below the ascat resolution could only partly be represented by these products during small scale summer convective storms which can result in high spatial variability of soil moisture uncertainties in spatial patterns of soil moisture are likely more related to input uncertainties rather than parameter uncertainties calibrating the model parameters to match satellite derived spatial patterns without considering uncertainties in the precipitation input therefore bears high risks of introducing disinformation into the model likely resulting in a model that is less robust and has larger uncertainty ranges beven and smith 2015 beven and westerberg 2011 in such cases it may be beneficial to use sdsm data with a high spatio temporal resolution for improving the spatial interpolation of rainfall brocca et al 2014 6 conclusions and implications this study aimed at analysing the value of recent sdsm products smapl3e scatsar and ascat direx swi for multivariate calibration focusing on a 66 km2 lowland catchment in ne germany satellite derived swi data correlated well with in situ top layer soil moisture measurements within the catchment with a slightly higher performance observed for smapl3e than for scatsar and ascat direx swi larger deviations of the latter two products were mainly due to deviations at the seasonal time scale and may be reduced by refining the vegetation correction to local conditions calibrating the ecohydrological model with satellite derived swi data within a multivariate calibration approach improved model performance with respect to soil moisture pearson correlation coefficient between simulated and satellite derived soil moisture increased from 0 76 to 0 79 during calibration and from 0 77 to 0 8 during evaluation and slightly decreased streamflow model performance f nse q decreased from 0 61 to 0 59 during calibration and from 0 42 to 0 40 during evaluation but had only small effects on the simulation of absolute soil moisture f nse sm calculated with sdsm scaled to in situ data during calibration and evaluation increased from 0 14 0 17 to 0 23 0 25 a better process representation in terms of absolute soil moisture was achieved by including in situ data or sdsm scaled to in situ data in the model calibration f nse sm calculated with sdsm scaled to in situ data during calibration and evaluation further increased to 0 56 0 59 improved process consistency was also reflected by the effect on soil parameters which were shifted towards values that would be expected based on soil type and thus assessed as more realistic the comparison of spatial soil moisture patterns of simulated and satellite derived data revealed shortcomings of both data sets at this scale catchment 100 km2 simulated soil moisture patterns were limited by input precipitation patterns that could not adequately represent spatial variability of precipitation during localised convective rainstorms and sdsm were characterized by a damped spatial variability related to a limited ability to depict the spatial variability below the resolution of ascat overall the temporal dynamics rather than the spatial patterns of the sdsm data were valuable for improving the internal consistency of the ecohydrological model for practitioners who consider including soil moisture data for model calibration the following recommendations may be derived from this study 1 integrating sdsm in model calibration is beneficial for improving model internal consistency 2 where available in situ soil moisture data should be included in order to better constrain simulated absolute soil moisture levels 3 at the scale of small to meso scale catchments 100 km2 the temporal dynamics of the sdsm products evaluated here are likely more helpful for model calibration than their spatial patterns author contributions dd designed the study performed the ecohydrological modelling and analyses and wrote the manuscript as contributed to the

2814,elucidating environmental controls on land surface energy partitioning at ecosystem levels is critical for better understanding water and energy cycles across landscapes however the underlying effects of changing atmospheric soil and vegetation conditions on the energy partitioning in coastal wetlands are not well understood here the temporal variations in surface evaporative fraction ef defined as latent heat flux le divided by the sum of le and sensible heat flux h and its responses to environmental conditions were analyzed at half hourly and daily timescales using measurements from a bowen ratio tower situated in an herbaceous coastal wetland in tianjin northern china results showed that net radiation rn was mainly allocated to h with an average h rn of 0 90 and daily ef was averaged at 0 14 during the study period the ef patterns in the studied coastal wetland were significantly different from those in terrestrial ecosystems which was mainly attributed to the complex interactions in local atmospheric soil and vegetation conditions specifically significant directional relationships among environmental variables were detected through the granger causality analysis gca especially at half hourly timescales the gca and boosted regression tree methods showed that energy related factors i e air temperature and rn were the dominant controls on ef poor vegetation status which was affected by salinity and flood stress primarily limited le and subsequently temporal ef variability during the wet period atmospheric conditions changed with the prevailing onshore winds resulting in the dominant control of relative humidity on ef variations overall the ef variability in coastal wetlands was not solely controlled by energy but was more tightly constrained by atmospheric conditions and vegetation dynamics which offers new insights into energy exchanges in coastal wetland ecosystems especially for determining the coupling strength between atmosphere and land surface processes keywords energy partitioning evaporative fraction granger causality atmospheric condition vegetation coastal wetland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land surface energy partitioning is a key process that controls the state of the atmospheric boundary layer through translating variations in land surface properties to the atmosphere koster et al 2004 findell et al 2011 evaporative fraction ef defined as latent heat flux le divided by the sum of le and sensible heat flux h is a routinely used metric to characterize energy partitioning processes at land surface bagley et al 2017 haghighi et al 2018 as energy fluxes intricately interact with a multitude of land surface and atmospheric variables e g surface temperature precipitation pr and vegetation ef at ecosystem levels can vary considerably over space and time haghighi et al 2018 yin et al 2019 therefore it is critically important to understand how those factors influence ef variations across different ecosystems with varying land surface conditions at monthly or shorter timescales ef over a wide range of terrestrial sites is a function of air temperature ta and humidity based on the concept of surface flux equilibrium mccoll and rigden 2020 mccoll et al 2019 theoretically with the strong sensitivity of near surface atmospheric states specifically near surface ta and specific humidity to turbulent surface fluxes le and h higher specific humidity is indicative of higher le and ef while higher ta reflects higher h and lower ef at instantaneous moments mccoll and rigden 2020 farah et al 2004 also observed that daily ef was mostly influenced by ta and relative humidity rh over both woodland and grassland sites in central kenya in addition other environmental factors can also be important in regulating ef for instance ford et al 2014 showed that ef was approximately a linear function of soil water content swc when swc was between the wilting point and a critical value 30th percentile over the united states southern great plains li et al 2013 observed that over a maize field in arid northwest china ef was more sensitive to variations in canopy conductance than meteorological variables yin et al 2019 established an equation relating the long term ef to climate dryness over the continental united states clearly as a result of the combined influences of biotic and abiotic factors ef dynamics are highly variable largely determined by land surface conditions and ecosystem types bagley et al 2017 williams and torn 2015 compared to terrestrial ecosystems wetlands are expected to show different ef patterns as hydroperiods strongly influence water and energy exchanges in wetland ecosystems malone et al 2014 for instance liu et al 2014 found that energy exchanges in a desert oasis wetland had a significant positive correlation with groundwater depth while huryna et al 2014 reported that ef was very high 0 82 with shallow groundwater tables in a pasture wetland in addition like other terrestrial ecosystems vegetation and meteorological conditions could also play important roles in energy partitioning instead of the presence of standing water or shallow groundwater tables in wetlands liu et al 2014 for example rocha and goulden 2008 showed that energy partitioning was more related to the development stage of vegetation canopy in a freshwater marsh yan et al 2020 showed that meteorological factors e g available energy and vapor pressure deficit vpd predominantly controlled the energy partitioning over a subalpine wetland although a growing body of observational and modeling studies on energy partitioning have been conducted in inland freshwater wetlands only few have been focused on coastal wetlands e g huang et al 2019 lafleur and rouse 1988 previous studies showed that energy exchanges across the land atmosphere interface in coastal wetlands played pivotal roles in controlling hydrological meteorological and biological processes at local and regional scales barr et al 2014 jia et al 2020 due to their unique geographical locations affected by land and ocean coastal wetland ecohydrological systems are characterized by the dynamic surface water regime that is related to inundation duration climate seasonality and flood frequency jolly et al 2008 and by vegetation heterogeneity that is closely linked to water availability soil properties and flood disturbance moffett et al 2012 waterlogging from rising sea level or drainage would result in vegetation dieback li et al 2010 while growing status of vegetation and land cover type have been demonstrated to largely affect ef variations in coastal wetlands guo et al 2010 sun et al 2021 in addition local climates in coastal regions are sensitive to tide and wind direction wd huang et al 2019 therefore ef dynamics in coastal wetlands are also affected by unique coastal environments lafleur and rouse 1988 sun et al 2021 for instance barr et al 2014 found that increasing salinity mitigated the responses of le to increasing ta and vpd with a negative relationship between ef and salinity in mangrove forests summer tidal dynamics could increase the ratio of h and le directly yan 2012 on the other hand onshore wind conditions i e wind blowing from ocean to land were shown to support more h and limit the role of meteorological factors on daytime evapotranspiration over the arctic coastal wetlands and an estuarine wetland huang et al 2019 liljedahl et al 2011 thus the aforementioned studies underscore the necessity of exploring the controls on ef dynamics in coastal wetlands for various research and application purposes fisher et al 2017 however there is still a lack of attempts to comprehensively explore the combined influence of atmospheric soil and vegetation conditions on ef variability and surface energy balance in coastal wetlands huang et al 2019 liljedahl et al 2011 one of the challenges to understand the impacts of different environmental variables on ef dynamics is to unravel the strong interactions among those variables detto et al 2013 here the granger causality analysis gca originated from the field of econometrics and based on a prediction theory granger 1969 is a robust method to diagnose the directional relationships between source e g environmental factors and target e g ef variables which has recently witnessed its burgeoning applications in a variety of research fields such as earth system science runge et al 2019 and ecohydrological researches yuan et al 2021 for instance detto et al 2013 showed that net radiation rn indirectly controlled soil respiration through its effects on soil temperature at subdaily timescales in a temperate forest moreover a nonlinear machine learning method namely the boosted regression tree brt elith et al 2008 has been increasingly used to quantify the relative controls of environmental variables on land surface processes han et al 2021 liu et al 2019a and carbon stocks lin et al 2016 it is expected that the combination of gca and brt techniques can offer additional views for understanding land surface energy partitioning processes particularly under complex environmental conditions such as in coastal wetlands to this end the characteristics of ef dynamics and its relationships with environmental conditions were analyzed in this study based on observations from a bowen ratio energy balance system breb located in an herbaceous coastal wetland in tianjin northern china coastal wetlands in tianjin play important roles in guaranteeing the sustainable development in the region and providing key rest stops for migratory birds in northeast asia wang et al 2020a therefore it is of regional significance to study ef dynamics and its responses to environmental conditions in the study region as explained above the gca technique was first used to determine the directional controls from environmental variables on ef dynamics followed by the use of the brt method to quantify the relative contributions of these variables to ef variations at daily and half hourly timescales the results of this study provide avenues for parameterizing water and energy exchanges between the atmosphere and coastal ecosystems and for integrating the information and function of coastal ecosystems in global system models fisher et al 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wetland selected in this study is located in the riparian zone of the ziyaxin river and about 20 km away from the bohai sea fig 1 the local climate is of a monsoonal subhumid continental type characterized by hot and humid summers and dry and cold winters mean annual potential evapotranspiration from 1960 to 2001 was 1692 7 mm mean annual pr was 549 mm with 50 falling from june to august and mean annual temperature was 12 6 qin et al 2022 hydroperiods of the study site are mainly affected by upstream water discharge and tidal inundation due to flood controls upstream water discharge mostly occurs in winter from january to march or summer july to september times in the area the tide in the coasts of tianjin belongs to irregular semi diurnal tides and spring tides can also induce flooding in this area based on the observed groundwater depth data in 2021 inundation at the study site was determined from the end of july to the end of october with a duration of nearly 50 days the salinity of groundwater in this area ranged from 0 03 to 7 9 with an average of 5 5 resulting in a brackish environmental condition dominant vegetation in the study area was phragmites australis a hydrophilic perennial plant that has strong plasticity to changes in environmental conditions such as drought and high salinity yang et al 2014 an annual herbaceous euhalophyte suaeda salsa was also present at a low coverage soil type was silt loam with silt and clay content of 68 4 and 20 7 respectively 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 meteorological measurements in this study we used the flux data le h and soil heat flux g and meteorological variables ta rh and rn that were measured by a bowen ratio tower in the coastal wetland the bowen ratio station ws br06 was placed at the south part of the study area fig 1b and c specifically a net radiometer nr lite kipp zonen delft netherlands was used to measure rn at 1 5 m above the ground the gradients of ta and rh were measured with two pairs of temperature humidity probes skh 2060 skye wales uk at 1 m and 2 m above the ground which were also used to compute vpd and energy fluxes i e le and h the lower level sensors were installed at the mean canopy height during the peak season and the distance between the two pairs was 1 m todd et al 2000 a thermocouple hfp01 hukseflux delft netherlands was used to measure g at the soil depth of 5 cm measurements were made every 1 min and then 10 minute averages were recorded by a datalogger cr1000x campbell scientific logan usa in addition an automatic weather station was also installed which measured wind speed ws fs80bp nh wuhan china wd fx81ar nh wuhan china four component radiation jqfs59 nh wuhan china and pr yxl142p nh wuhan china every 10 min due to the malfunctioning of the station the data during the period from 18 march to 6 august 2021 were used in this study note that ta and rh observations at the height of 2 m were used in the following analysis as those two factors at 1 m and 2 m exhibited similar temporal patterns 2 2 2 hydrological and vegetation measurements an observation well was constructed using polyvinyl chloride pipes of a 5 cm inner diameter with screening across groundwater tables depth to groundwater table dtgt and electric conductivity ec were measured at 10 min intervals using a vented pressure transducer aqua troll 200 in situ inc fort collins usa which did not require barometric pressure corrections note a negative dtgt value represents inundation by surface water four field campaigns were conducted in a 30 m 50 m area from may to july in 2021 table 1 during each campaign four sample plots 0 5 m 0 5 m were established to measure the height and aboveground biomass of p australis only p australis was selected because s salsa grew in a very low density with a maximum height of 20 cm and was also submerged completely in floods in addition leaf area index lai was measured with a plant canopy analyser lai 2200c li cor inc lincoln usa soil variables including soil water potential wp model 6440 davis ca usa and swc and ec cs655 campbell scientific logan usa were measured at the depths of 10 20 40 and 60 cm every 10 min and then data were stored in cr1000 due to the impact of soil salinity on the measurements of swc using cs655 wp was used as a proxy for indicating soil water status in this study 2 3 energy balance method the breb method is used to measure the partitioning of convective fluxes between le and h through the bowen ratio defined as b h le bowen 1926 on the basis of surface energy balance given by 1 rn g l e h 0 where the units of all components are in w m2 note that the breb method assumes that the fluxes are one dimensional only with no horizontal gradient and that measurement sensors are located within the equilibrium sub layer where fluxes are constant with height dyer 1974 therefore using the flux gradient approach le and h can be computed as 2 le ρ ε l p k w δ e δ z 3 h ρ c p k h δ t δ z where ρ kg m3 is air density ε kg kg is the ratio of molecular weights of water over air equal to 0 622 l kj kg is the latent heat of vaporization p kpa is air pressure cp kj kg is the specific heat of air kw m2 s and kh m2 s are the eddy diffusivity for water vapor and heat respectively and δe δz kpa m and δt δz m are the vapor pressure and temperature gradients measured between two heights respectively note that kw is assumed to be equal to kh dyer 1974 based on equations 2 and 3 the bowen ratio can be calculated as 4 b γ δ t δ e where γ kpa is the psychrometric constant γ cpp εl finally the above equations lead to 5 le rn g 1 b 6 h b 1 b r n g the measurement errors associated with the breb method have been evaluated by several studies e g bertela 1989 gavilán and berengena 2007 in general there are two sources of uncertainties 1 the breb method sometimes gives unphysical flux directions which are not consistent with the flux gradient relationship bertela 1989 guo et al 2007 2 when b approaches 1 the denominator in equations 5 and 6 approaches 0 causing impossibility of calculating le and h perez et al 1999 therefore following perez et al 1999 and guo et al 2007 unphysical and suspicious data were rejected because the rejected data mainly occurred at nighttime our study focused on daytime energy fluxes from 7 00 to 18 00 half hourly and daily data were then obtained by summing up 10 minute data finally the number of available days during the study period was 142 days with 3124 half hourly data 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 granger causality test introduced by granger 1969 the gca provides a method to detect the directional control of a source variable on a target variable which is a statistical test against the null hypothesis of no predictive causality between source and target variables yuan et al 2021 there are two assumptions underlying this method 1 the cause source variable precedes the effect target variable at future time steps meaning that gca can be used to investigate the extent to which the current value x target variable can be explained by the past value y source variable 2 any variable in the system can be linearly represented by lagged values of system variables and a residual ombadi et al 2020 in addition the time series of variables must be stationary to test the hypothesis that y causes x the bi variate granger causality for a given system between the time series of x and y at times t 1 2 is formulated as follows 7 x t i 1 j a xt x t i i 1 j b yt y t i ε t 8 x t i 1 j a xt x t i ε t where a xt and a xt are the coefficients of x t regressed on x t i in the first and second model respectively b yt is the coefficient of x t regressed on y t i and ε t and ε t are the residuals in the two models note that the lag time in eq 7 is determined by a vector autoregressive model the null hypothesis that y does not cause x is rejected if the first model improves the estimation compared to the second model with a statistically significant difference between ε t and ε t according to an f test in this study time series of soil and groundwater ec wp at the depths of 20 40 and 60 cm and dtgt were not stationary those variables did not pass the augmented dickey fuller test thus the gca was only performed between ef and other variables ta rh rn surface albedo α vpd wp at the depth of 10 cm wd and ws we used vector autoregressive models with the package vars in r version 3 5 1 r core team 2018 for gca hafner and herwartz 2009 2 4 2 boosted regression tree method to compare the results of directional controls from the gca the brt method developed by elith et al 2008 was applied to quantify the relative contributions of different drivers to daily and half hourly ef variations as a nonlinear machine learning method the brt method is different from traditional regression methods in that it uses the boosting technique to adaptively combine large numbers of relatively simple tree models to predict the relationships between predictor and response variables elith et al 2008 this method does not require any specific data distributions and thus is particularly useful for analyzing datasets with outliers missing data and interactions between predictor variables elith et al 2008 the open source brt package developed by elith et al 2008 in r was employed with four key input parameters i e learning rate lr tree complexity tc bag fraction bg and number of trees nt the lr determines the contribution of each tree to the final fitted model tc controls the tree structure and bg represents the proportion of data selected at each iteration from the full training set the nt is the number of trees required for the optimal prediction and jointly determined by lr and tc the maximum and minimum nt values were set to be 30 000 and 1 000 respectively elith et al 2008 to obtain optimal predictive results combinations of parameter values e g lr 0 003 0 005 0 01 0 03 0 05 tc from 7 to 10 by an increment of 1 and bg 0 5 0 75 were tested han et al 2021 and an optimal parameter set which provided the minimum predictive deviance between observed and predicted data was chosen to quantify the relative impacts of each predictor variable on ef variability the performance of the brt models was assessed using a 10 fold cross validated correlation method data were first randomly partitioned into 10 subsets with 9 subsets for training the model and the remaining one for testing the model performance this procedure was repeated 10 times to get the predictive results the linear relationship between observed and predicted ef values was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 note that the multicollinearity of predictor variables may affect the brt performance by over fitting the data therefore the multicollinearity of predictor variables was tested according to the pearson s correlation coefficient r and variance inflation factor vif analysis i e r 0 7 and vif 5 dormann et al 2013 before the brt analysis based on the results of the gca and multicollinearity test only ta rh rn α wp at the depth of 10 cm ws and wd were chosen as the predictor variables in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological soil and hydrological conditions at the study site fig 2 shows time series of environmental variables with considerable temporal variations at the study site during the study period ta and rh exhibited increasing trends with notable daily fluctuations ranging from 6 9 to 33 1 and from 20 to 96 respectively no obvious temporal trend was found in ws with an average of 4 13 m s and prevailing wind directions were southeast fig 1d the variable α the ratio between the outgoing and incoming solar radiation upon a surface is dependent on numerous factors including cloud cover sun angle and land surface characteristics lenters et al 2011 daily α values in this study had slight temporal variations with an average of 0 17 due to the standing dead p australis α remained at a relatively high value 0 18 before 15 may thereafter the dead plants were removed with low vegetation coverage table 1 leading to a slight decrease in α the average height aboveground biomass of p australis and lai was 39 7 cm 161 6 g m2 and 1 2 m2 m2 respectively table 1 which were substantially lower than the values reported from other coastal wetlands e g li et al 2021 during the study period mean rainfall depth was 2 0 mm with pr mainly occurring in june fig 2d shallow wp e g at 10 cm responded quickly to rainfall events while wp at 60 cm showed no obvious response even after a heavy rainfall e g on 14 june with rising ta and vegetation activities dtgt showed a steady increase before 17 july mainly due to enhanced groundwater evapotranspiration rainfall events appeared to have no effects on dtgt fig 2d and e further demonstrating that rainwater did not infiltrate into deeper soils due to the silty soil texture with low hydraulic conductivities in this coastal wetland however as influenced both by the flood of the ziyaxin river and tide of the bohai sea there was an abrupt rise in groundwater levels and the wetland remained inundated after 27 july the ec in both soil and groundwater increased noticeably likely due to evapotranspiration processes however the rapid fluctuations in soil ec after 14 june were mainly attributed to the leaching of surface soil salts upstream water discharge and tide of the sea 3 2 diurnal and daily behaviors of energy balance during the study period half hourly rn h and le showed a clear diurnal cycle for all months fig 3 a d daytime h reached a maximum level at 13 30 14 00 controlled by the diurnal variations in rn while peak le rates appeared to be about one hour earlier suggesting a weak impact of rn on le compared to le h showed much higher values and diurnal variations even in july and august which was similar to the results of rocha and goulden 2008 in a freshwater marsh in southern california and liljedahl et al 2011 in an arctic coastal wetland half hourly g showed smallest diurnal variations compared to other energy components before june the diurnal behavior of ef exhibited a concave up shape which was consistent with the assumption of daytime ef self preservation i e nearly constant during daytime gentine et al 2007 fig 3e g the large variations in ef in the early morning and late afternoon were mostly due to the rapid changes in energy fluxes and environmental variables fig 3a c and fig 1s from july to august the diurnal pattern of ef differed noticeably fig 3h which was inconsistent with most researches e g gentine et al 2011 liu et al 2019b but similar to that under bare surface conditions gentine et al 2007 it was mostly caused by the rapid rise and decline in diurnal le fig 3d and h fig 4 shows the variations in daily energy balance during the study period the notable variations in daily rn were partially due to changes in cloudiness and rainfall events referred to fig 2d in general both rn and le increased from the onset to the peak of the growing season while the fluctuations in le in july and august were also affected by meteorological conditions fig 2s daily le rn and h rn also displayed obvious temporal trends with an average of 0 14 and 0 90 respectively fig 4b interestingly the majority of rn was allocated to h rather than to le resulting in much higher daily h rn values than previously reported values from terrestrial and coastal wetland ecosystems for instance jiao et al 2018 showed that available energy partitioned to le was averaged at 61 over closed grapevine canopies in northwest china liljedahl et al 2011 found that a major portion of the midday surface energy was partitioned to h in an arctic coastal wetland but with much lower h rn 0 43 and 0 65 in wet and dry seasons respectively daily ef showed a similar pattern to those of le and le rn with a range from 0 03 to 0 71 and an average of 0 14 fig 4c diurnal and daily le and h variations offset each other to either enhance or reduce ef the values here were in general lower than those found in other coastal wetlands and terrestrial ecosystems bagley et al 2017 huryna et al 2014 for instance sun et al 2021 observed that ef over a p australis area had an average value of 0 27 in a coastal wetland in china li et al 2013 showed that the mean annual ef value was 0 66 above a maize field in arid northwest china overall our results highlighted the need to identify the factors that limited ef in this coastal wetland 3 3 directional controls from environmental variables on daily and half hourly ef fig 5 a shows the directional relationships between different environmental variables which were obtained from the gca test using daily observations during the study period in general unidirectional relationships existed between these variables except for the bi directional relationships between ta and rh and vpd and wd note that other than those direct relationships indirect relationships also existed for instance in the relationships of wd rh ta ta could be indirectly affected by wd through rh however at half hourly timescales more complex interactions emerged with more bi directional relationships which were mostly due to rapid variations in subdaily micrometeorological conditions and tighter couplings between different variables huang et al 2019 şimşek and ödül 2018 at daily timescales only ta and rh had directional controls on ef with a stronger strength of ta fig 5c at half hourly timescales ef was regulated by in order of importance rn and ta equally important vpd and α fig 5d the remaining variables had no directional relationships with daily and half hourly ef variations at a statistical significance level of 0 05 specifically at half hourly scales the control of rh over ef disappeared as energy played a more important role in controlling subdaily water and energy exchanges han et al 2021 it was also supported by the lack of granger causality of vpd rn and α over daily ef fig 5c although the remaining variables had no direct relationships with ef they could exert indirect influences for instance at daily timescales the strong control of rh could integrate the indirect impacts of wd vpd and rn on ef as indicated by their directional relationships from fig 5a this is important because the variations in ef were not just directly linked to single drivers but also reflected the outcome of ef interactions with multiple environmental variables 3 3 1 quantification of environmental drivers for controlling daily and half hourly ef dynamics to compare the gca results and understand underlying physical mechanisms the relative contributions of predictor variables to ef variations were quantified using the brt method fig 6 the constructed brt models showed good performances with high nse and r2 and low rmse values table 1s at daily timescales ta was the dominant control on ef dynamics with a contribution of 40 9 followed by wd 15 3 and rh 10 7 by comparison at half hourly timescales ef was primarily driven by rn 23 2 and ta 20 7 it was consistent with the directional strength based on the gca results fig 5c and d indicating that the controlling factors of ef varied with temporal scales with sufficient water supplies in our coastal wetland soil water had a very limited constraint on ef variations which differed from the findings in terrestrial ecosystems with much drier conditions ford et al 2014 liu et al 2019a instead the effect of atmospheric demands for water indicated by ta and rn was much stronger note that liljedahl et al 2011 showed that near surface soil moisture was important for le variability in arctic coastal wetlands but it was only observed when wp 130 kpa due to the diurnal variation in rn half hourly ef was more correlated with rn which was consistent with the finding of barr et al 2014 who showed that the availability of energy was the primary driver of half hourly le variations in mangrove forests the variable α is a crucial parameter for determining land surface energy budgets which was closely related to vegetation status and surface water conditions sumner et al 2011 however the small effect of α on ef variations in this study might be due to less variations in α at the study site with a relatively constant vegetation coverage 3 3 2 interactive impacts of wind and rh to further understand the roles of wind and rh in regulating ef variability as indicated by the gca and brt results we split the daily data into two periods based on the sudden change in soil ec on 14 june also the start of the wet period and then used the partial correlation method for the analysis table 2 overall wind played a central role in controlling ef before 14 june while rh was more important afterwards the aerodynamic resistance that is related to ws modulates the water vapor transfer through the surface boundary layer particularly under turbulent flow conditions meza 2005 therefore wind could clear moist air and regulate ef variations before 14 june as ws was relatively stable and rh remained at a high level ws became less important during the wet period which was also observed by ombadi et al 2020 this also provided an interpretation of the gca result that rh had a directional control on ws in fig 5a in coastal wetlands wd plays a critical role in regulating the interactions between different meteorological variables as stressed by lafleur and rouse 1988 and huang et al 2019 because of differences in thermal properties and air humidity between land and ocean onshore wind here defined as winds from 68 to 157 relative to north would bring cooler and moister air from the ocean huang et al 2019 leading to a higher rh and lower ta and vpd table 3 and fig 3s in addition offshore wind tended to be associated with larger α and rn during the study period table 3 and fig 3s the effect of wd on α might be largely due to its direct influence on land surface characteristics e g bulk surface resistance lafleur and rouse 1988 thereafter combined with the inherent relationship between α and rn the impact of wd on rn was detected similarly huang et al 2019 showed that wd influenced the diurnal variation in photosynthetically active radiation over a tidal salt marsh ecosystem in the yangtze delta therefore compared to terrestrial ecosystems wd can show a stronger control on the responses of ef to environmental variables in coastal wetlands which further alter energy partitioning processes huang et al 2019 for instance before the wet period the increase in wd led to the prevailing offshore winds which favored more energy partitioned into le resulting in increased le and ef at the study site tables 2 and 3 during the wet period the onshore winds with cooler and moister air mass suppressed the energy exchanges therefore rh was more important in controlling ef and le instead of wd table 2 and fig 2sa and b overall the controlling factors of ef covaried with meteorological conditions via the interactions between wind and rh at our study site 3 4 roles of salinity and vegetation soil salinity has been proved to affect vegetation growth through two stages first seed germination is inhibited or delayed and thus affects the length of growing seasons secondly soil salinity inhibits leaf emergence and canopy development resulting in reduced lai and biomass chambers et al 2003 chu et al 2019 the optimal water salinity range for p australis to grow was from 0 to 2 in a coastal wetland along the adriatic coast antonellini and mollema 2010 therefore under salt stress averaged at 3 8 for soil ec and 7 3 for groundwater ec in the study area vegetation had low aboveground biomass and lai at the study site table 1 it should be stressed that the impacts of soil salinity on water and energy fluxes through altering vegetation patterns in coastal wetlands were more likely to be important at timescales longer than daily and subdaily scales as shown in this study e g annual scales wang et al 2020b vegetation can influence energy partitioning through groundwater evapotranspiration williams and torn 2015 there was a significant correlation of dtgt with le while groundwater ec negatively affected ef before the wet period table 2 lum and barton 2020 showed that reduced transpiration was observed in coastal plants with higher salinity stress 3 in hawai i barr et al 2013 also found a negative relationship between groundwater salinity and daytime ef in mangrove forests in addition during the spring a large amount of dead or brown vegetation refer to fig 1b reduced the amount of radiant energy reaching the ground and acted as a mulch reducing soil evaporation herbst et al 2022 also demonstrated that the brown leaves were the dominant factor reducing evapotranspiration in a wetland from northwest germany meanwhile during the wet period local vegetation communities were constantly disturbed by the floods of ziyaxin river and tide of the bohai sea and then vegetation activities were limited by flood inundation overall the results of this study provide confidence that salinity and vegetation played vital roles in the substantially low le rn and high h rn in the wetland one limitation of this study is that the data available did not cover an entire year due to the malfunctioning of the breb system additional researches on water isotopes determining water use efficiency and evapotranspiration partitioning are also needed to test and further elucidate the controlling mechanisms of ef dynamics in coastal wetlands scott et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 4 conclusions in this study the breb system was employed to investigate the temporal patterns of ef dynamics and its controlling factors in an herbaceous coastal wetland in tianjin northern china the main findings of this study were 1 rn was mainly allocated to h with an average h rn of 0 90 and daily ef ranged from 0 03 to 0 71 with an average of 0 14 during the study period 2 the gca method identified strong interactions among different environmental variables and showed that energy related factors i e ta and rn were the dominant controls on ef variability especially at half hourly timescales which was also proved by the brt method 3 our results demonstrated that the controlling mechanisms of ef covaried with atmospheric conditions and vegetation dynamics that is poor vegetation status was largely affected by the salinity which primarily limited le and subsequently temporal ef variations during the wet period vegetation behaviors were limited by flood inundation and atmospheric conditions changed with the prevailing onshore wind directions which resulted in the dominant control of rh on ef the results in this study can benefit the parameterization of the energy exchange between atmosphere and coastal interfaces under changing climatic conditions credit authorship contribution statement qiong han

2814,elucidating environmental controls on land surface energy partitioning at ecosystem levels is critical for better understanding water and energy cycles across landscapes however the underlying effects of changing atmospheric soil and vegetation conditions on the energy partitioning in coastal wetlands are not well understood here the temporal variations in surface evaporative fraction ef defined as latent heat flux le divided by the sum of le and sensible heat flux h and its responses to environmental conditions were analyzed at half hourly and daily timescales using measurements from a bowen ratio tower situated in an herbaceous coastal wetland in tianjin northern china results showed that net radiation rn was mainly allocated to h with an average h rn of 0 90 and daily ef was averaged at 0 14 during the study period the ef patterns in the studied coastal wetland were significantly different from those in terrestrial ecosystems which was mainly attributed to the complex interactions in local atmospheric soil and vegetation conditions specifically significant directional relationships among environmental variables were detected through the granger causality analysis gca especially at half hourly timescales the gca and boosted regression tree methods showed that energy related factors i e air temperature and rn were the dominant controls on ef poor vegetation status which was affected by salinity and flood stress primarily limited le and subsequently temporal ef variability during the wet period atmospheric conditions changed with the prevailing onshore winds resulting in the dominant control of relative humidity on ef variations overall the ef variability in coastal wetlands was not solely controlled by energy but was more tightly constrained by atmospheric conditions and vegetation dynamics which offers new insights into energy exchanges in coastal wetland ecosystems especially for determining the coupling strength between atmosphere and land surface processes keywords energy partitioning evaporative fraction granger causality atmospheric condition vegetation coastal wetland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction land surface energy partitioning is a key process that controls the state of the atmospheric boundary layer through translating variations in land surface properties to the atmosphere koster et al 2004 findell et al 2011 evaporative fraction ef defined as latent heat flux le divided by the sum of le and sensible heat flux h is a routinely used metric to characterize energy partitioning processes at land surface bagley et al 2017 haghighi et al 2018 as energy fluxes intricately interact with a multitude of land surface and atmospheric variables e g surface temperature precipitation pr and vegetation ef at ecosystem levels can vary considerably over space and time haghighi et al 2018 yin et al 2019 therefore it is critically important to understand how those factors influence ef variations across different ecosystems with varying land surface conditions at monthly or shorter timescales ef over a wide range of terrestrial sites is a function of air temperature ta and humidity based on the concept of surface flux equilibrium mccoll and rigden 2020 mccoll et al 2019 theoretically with the strong sensitivity of near surface atmospheric states specifically near surface ta and specific humidity to turbulent surface fluxes le and h higher specific humidity is indicative of higher le and ef while higher ta reflects higher h and lower ef at instantaneous moments mccoll and rigden 2020 farah et al 2004 also observed that daily ef was mostly influenced by ta and relative humidity rh over both woodland and grassland sites in central kenya in addition other environmental factors can also be important in regulating ef for instance ford et al 2014 showed that ef was approximately a linear function of soil water content swc when swc was between the wilting point and a critical value 30th percentile over the united states southern great plains li et al 2013 observed that over a maize field in arid northwest china ef was more sensitive to variations in canopy conductance than meteorological variables yin et al 2019 established an equation relating the long term ef to climate dryness over the continental united states clearly as a result of the combined influences of biotic and abiotic factors ef dynamics are highly variable largely determined by land surface conditions and ecosystem types bagley et al 2017 williams and torn 2015 compared to terrestrial ecosystems wetlands are expected to show different ef patterns as hydroperiods strongly influence water and energy exchanges in wetland ecosystems malone et al 2014 for instance liu et al 2014 found that energy exchanges in a desert oasis wetland had a significant positive correlation with groundwater depth while huryna et al 2014 reported that ef was very high 0 82 with shallow groundwater tables in a pasture wetland in addition like other terrestrial ecosystems vegetation and meteorological conditions could also play important roles in energy partitioning instead of the presence of standing water or shallow groundwater tables in wetlands liu et al 2014 for example rocha and goulden 2008 showed that energy partitioning was more related to the development stage of vegetation canopy in a freshwater marsh yan et al 2020 showed that meteorological factors e g available energy and vapor pressure deficit vpd predominantly controlled the energy partitioning over a subalpine wetland although a growing body of observational and modeling studies on energy partitioning have been conducted in inland freshwater wetlands only few have been focused on coastal wetlands e g huang et al 2019 lafleur and rouse 1988 previous studies showed that energy exchanges across the land atmosphere interface in coastal wetlands played pivotal roles in controlling hydrological meteorological and biological processes at local and regional scales barr et al 2014 jia et al 2020 due to their unique geographical locations affected by land and ocean coastal wetland ecohydrological systems are characterized by the dynamic surface water regime that is related to inundation duration climate seasonality and flood frequency jolly et al 2008 and by vegetation heterogeneity that is closely linked to water availability soil properties and flood disturbance moffett et al 2012 waterlogging from rising sea level or drainage would result in vegetation dieback li et al 2010 while growing status of vegetation and land cover type have been demonstrated to largely affect ef variations in coastal wetlands guo et al 2010 sun et al 2021 in addition local climates in coastal regions are sensitive to tide and wind direction wd huang et al 2019 therefore ef dynamics in coastal wetlands are also affected by unique coastal environments lafleur and rouse 1988 sun et al 2021 for instance barr et al 2014 found that increasing salinity mitigated the responses of le to increasing ta and vpd with a negative relationship between ef and salinity in mangrove forests summer tidal dynamics could increase the ratio of h and le directly yan 2012 on the other hand onshore wind conditions i e wind blowing from ocean to land were shown to support more h and limit the role of meteorological factors on daytime evapotranspiration over the arctic coastal wetlands and an estuarine wetland huang et al 2019 liljedahl et al 2011 thus the aforementioned studies underscore the necessity of exploring the controls on ef dynamics in coastal wetlands for various research and application purposes fisher et al 2017 however there is still a lack of attempts to comprehensively explore the combined influence of atmospheric soil and vegetation conditions on ef variability and surface energy balance in coastal wetlands huang et al 2019 liljedahl et al 2011 one of the challenges to understand the impacts of different environmental variables on ef dynamics is to unravel the strong interactions among those variables detto et al 2013 here the granger causality analysis gca originated from the field of econometrics and based on a prediction theory granger 1969 is a robust method to diagnose the directional relationships between source e g environmental factors and target e g ef variables which has recently witnessed its burgeoning applications in a variety of research fields such as earth system science runge et al 2019 and ecohydrological researches yuan et al 2021 for instance detto et al 2013 showed that net radiation rn indirectly controlled soil respiration through its effects on soil temperature at subdaily timescales in a temperate forest moreover a nonlinear machine learning method namely the boosted regression tree brt elith et al 2008 has been increasingly used to quantify the relative controls of environmental variables on land surface processes han et al 2021 liu et al 2019a and carbon stocks lin et al 2016 it is expected that the combination of gca and brt techniques can offer additional views for understanding land surface energy partitioning processes particularly under complex environmental conditions such as in coastal wetlands to this end the characteristics of ef dynamics and its relationships with environmental conditions were analyzed in this study based on observations from a bowen ratio energy balance system breb located in an herbaceous coastal wetland in tianjin northern china coastal wetlands in tianjin play important roles in guaranteeing the sustainable development in the region and providing key rest stops for migratory birds in northeast asia wang et al 2020a therefore it is of regional significance to study ef dynamics and its responses to environmental conditions in the study region as explained above the gca technique was first used to determine the directional controls from environmental variables on ef dynamics followed by the use of the brt method to quantify the relative contributions of these variables to ef variations at daily and half hourly timescales the results of this study provide avenues for parameterizing water and energy exchanges between the atmosphere and coastal ecosystems and for integrating the information and function of coastal ecosystems in global system models fisher et al 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the wetland selected in this study is located in the riparian zone of the ziyaxin river and about 20 km away from the bohai sea fig 1 the local climate is of a monsoonal subhumid continental type characterized by hot and humid summers and dry and cold winters mean annual potential evapotranspiration from 1960 to 2001 was 1692 7 mm mean annual pr was 549 mm with 50 falling from june to august and mean annual temperature was 12 6 qin et al 2022 hydroperiods of the study site are mainly affected by upstream water discharge and tidal inundation due to flood controls upstream water discharge mostly occurs in winter from january to march or summer july to september times in the area the tide in the coasts of tianjin belongs to irregular semi diurnal tides and spring tides can also induce flooding in this area based on the observed groundwater depth data in 2021 inundation at the study site was determined from the end of july to the end of october with a duration of nearly 50 days the salinity of groundwater in this area ranged from 0 03 to 7 9 with an average of 5 5 resulting in a brackish environmental condition dominant vegetation in the study area was phragmites australis a hydrophilic perennial plant that has strong plasticity to changes in environmental conditions such as drought and high salinity yang et al 2014 an annual herbaceous euhalophyte suaeda salsa was also present at a low coverage soil type was silt loam with silt and clay content of 68 4 and 20 7 respectively 2 2 measurements 2 2 1 meteorological measurements in this study we used the flux data le h and soil heat flux g and meteorological variables ta rh and rn that were measured by a bowen ratio tower in the coastal wetland the bowen ratio station ws br06 was placed at the south part of the study area fig 1b and c specifically a net radiometer nr lite kipp zonen delft netherlands was used to measure rn at 1 5 m above the ground the gradients of ta and rh were measured with two pairs of temperature humidity probes skh 2060 skye wales uk at 1 m and 2 m above the ground which were also used to compute vpd and energy fluxes i e le and h the lower level sensors were installed at the mean canopy height during the peak season and the distance between the two pairs was 1 m todd et al 2000 a thermocouple hfp01 hukseflux delft netherlands was used to measure g at the soil depth of 5 cm measurements were made every 1 min and then 10 minute averages were recorded by a datalogger cr1000x campbell scientific logan usa in addition an automatic weather station was also installed which measured wind speed ws fs80bp nh wuhan china wd fx81ar nh wuhan china four component radiation jqfs59 nh wuhan china and pr yxl142p nh wuhan china every 10 min due to the malfunctioning of the station the data during the period from 18 march to 6 august 2021 were used in this study note that ta and rh observations at the height of 2 m were used in the following analysis as those two factors at 1 m and 2 m exhibited similar temporal patterns 2 2 2 hydrological and vegetation measurements an observation well was constructed using polyvinyl chloride pipes of a 5 cm inner diameter with screening across groundwater tables depth to groundwater table dtgt and electric conductivity ec were measured at 10 min intervals using a vented pressure transducer aqua troll 200 in situ inc fort collins usa which did not require barometric pressure corrections note a negative dtgt value represents inundation by surface water four field campaigns were conducted in a 30 m 50 m area from may to july in 2021 table 1 during each campaign four sample plots 0 5 m 0 5 m were established to measure the height and aboveground biomass of p australis only p australis was selected because s salsa grew in a very low density with a maximum height of 20 cm and was also submerged completely in floods in addition leaf area index lai was measured with a plant canopy analyser lai 2200c li cor inc lincoln usa soil variables including soil water potential wp model 6440 davis ca usa and swc and ec cs655 campbell scientific logan usa were measured at the depths of 10 20 40 and 60 cm every 10 min and then data were stored in cr1000 due to the impact of soil salinity on the measurements of swc using cs655 wp was used as a proxy for indicating soil water status in this study 2 3 energy balance method the breb method is used to measure the partitioning of convective fluxes between le and h through the bowen ratio defined as b h le bowen 1926 on the basis of surface energy balance given by 1 rn g l e h 0 where the units of all components are in w m2 note that the breb method assumes that the fluxes are one dimensional only with no horizontal gradient and that measurement sensors are located within the equilibrium sub layer where fluxes are constant with height dyer 1974 therefore using the flux gradient approach le and h can be computed as 2 le ρ ε l p k w δ e δ z 3 h ρ c p k h δ t δ z where ρ kg m3 is air density ε kg kg is the ratio of molecular weights of water over air equal to 0 622 l kj kg is the latent heat of vaporization p kpa is air pressure cp kj kg is the specific heat of air kw m2 s and kh m2 s are the eddy diffusivity for water vapor and heat respectively and δe δz kpa m and δt δz m are the vapor pressure and temperature gradients measured between two heights respectively note that kw is assumed to be equal to kh dyer 1974 based on equations 2 and 3 the bowen ratio can be calculated as 4 b γ δ t δ e where γ kpa is the psychrometric constant γ cpp εl finally the above equations lead to 5 le rn g 1 b 6 h b 1 b r n g the measurement errors associated with the breb method have been evaluated by several studies e g bertela 1989 gavilán and berengena 2007 in general there are two sources of uncertainties 1 the breb method sometimes gives unphysical flux directions which are not consistent with the flux gradient relationship bertela 1989 guo et al 2007 2 when b approaches 1 the denominator in equations 5 and 6 approaches 0 causing impossibility of calculating le and h perez et al 1999 therefore following perez et al 1999 and guo et al 2007 unphysical and suspicious data were rejected because the rejected data mainly occurred at nighttime our study focused on daytime energy fluxes from 7 00 to 18 00 half hourly and daily data were then obtained by summing up 10 minute data finally the number of available days during the study period was 142 days with 3124 half hourly data 2 4 statistical analysis 2 4 1 granger causality test introduced by granger 1969 the gca provides a method to detect the directional control of a source variable on a target variable which is a statistical test against the null hypothesis of no predictive causality between source and target variables yuan et al 2021 there are two assumptions underlying this method 1 the cause source variable precedes the effect target variable at future time steps meaning that gca can be used to investigate the extent to which the current value x target variable can be explained by the past value y source variable 2 any variable in the system can be linearly represented by lagged values of system variables and a residual ombadi et al 2020 in addition the time series of variables must be stationary to test the hypothesis that y causes x the bi variate granger causality for a given system between the time series of x and y at times t 1 2 is formulated as follows 7 x t i 1 j a xt x t i i 1 j b yt y t i ε t 8 x t i 1 j a xt x t i ε t where a xt and a xt are the coefficients of x t regressed on x t i in the first and second model respectively b yt is the coefficient of x t regressed on y t i and ε t and ε t are the residuals in the two models note that the lag time in eq 7 is determined by a vector autoregressive model the null hypothesis that y does not cause x is rejected if the first model improves the estimation compared to the second model with a statistically significant difference between ε t and ε t according to an f test in this study time series of soil and groundwater ec wp at the depths of 20 40 and 60 cm and dtgt were not stationary those variables did not pass the augmented dickey fuller test thus the gca was only performed between ef and other variables ta rh rn surface albedo α vpd wp at the depth of 10 cm wd and ws we used vector autoregressive models with the package vars in r version 3 5 1 r core team 2018 for gca hafner and herwartz 2009 2 4 2 boosted regression tree method to compare the results of directional controls from the gca the brt method developed by elith et al 2008 was applied to quantify the relative contributions of different drivers to daily and half hourly ef variations as a nonlinear machine learning method the brt method is different from traditional regression methods in that it uses the boosting technique to adaptively combine large numbers of relatively simple tree models to predict the relationships between predictor and response variables elith et al 2008 this method does not require any specific data distributions and thus is particularly useful for analyzing datasets with outliers missing data and interactions between predictor variables elith et al 2008 the open source brt package developed by elith et al 2008 in r was employed with four key input parameters i e learning rate lr tree complexity tc bag fraction bg and number of trees nt the lr determines the contribution of each tree to the final fitted model tc controls the tree structure and bg represents the proportion of data selected at each iteration from the full training set the nt is the number of trees required for the optimal prediction and jointly determined by lr and tc the maximum and minimum nt values were set to be 30 000 and 1 000 respectively elith et al 2008 to obtain optimal predictive results combinations of parameter values e g lr 0 003 0 005 0 01 0 03 0 05 tc from 7 to 10 by an increment of 1 and bg 0 5 0 75 were tested han et al 2021 and an optimal parameter set which provided the minimum predictive deviance between observed and predicted data was chosen to quantify the relative impacts of each predictor variable on ef variability the performance of the brt models was assessed using a 10 fold cross validated correlation method data were first randomly partitioned into 10 subsets with 9 subsets for training the model and the remaining one for testing the model performance this procedure was repeated 10 times to get the predictive results the linear relationship between observed and predicted ef values was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 note that the multicollinearity of predictor variables may affect the brt performance by over fitting the data therefore the multicollinearity of predictor variables was tested according to the pearson s correlation coefficient r and variance inflation factor vif analysis i e r 0 7 and vif 5 dormann et al 2013 before the brt analysis based on the results of the gca and multicollinearity test only ta rh rn α wp at the depth of 10 cm ws and wd were chosen as the predictor variables in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological soil and hydrological conditions at the study site fig 2 shows time series of environmental variables with considerable temporal variations at the study site during the study period ta and rh exhibited increasing trends with notable daily fluctuations ranging from 6 9 to 33 1 and from 20 to 96 respectively no obvious temporal trend was found in ws with an average of 4 13 m s and prevailing wind directions were southeast fig 1d the variable α the ratio between the outgoing and incoming solar radiation upon a surface is dependent on numerous factors including cloud cover sun angle and land surface characteristics lenters et al 2011 daily α values in this study had slight temporal variations with an average of 0 17 due to the standing dead p australis α remained at a relatively high value 0 18 before 15 may thereafter the dead plants were removed with low vegetation coverage table 1 leading to a slight decrease in α the average height aboveground biomass of p australis and lai was 39 7 cm 161 6 g m2 and 1 2 m2 m2 respectively table 1 which were substantially lower than the values reported from other coastal wetlands e g li et al 2021 during the study period mean rainfall depth was 2 0 mm with pr mainly occurring in june fig 2d shallow wp e g at 10 cm responded quickly to rainfall events while wp at 60 cm showed no obvious response even after a heavy rainfall e g on 14 june with rising ta and vegetation activities dtgt showed a steady increase before 17 july mainly due to enhanced groundwater evapotranspiration rainfall events appeared to have no effects on dtgt fig 2d and e further demonstrating that rainwater did not infiltrate into deeper soils due to the silty soil texture with low hydraulic conductivities in this coastal wetland however as influenced both by the flood of the ziyaxin river and tide of the bohai sea there was an abrupt rise in groundwater levels and the wetland remained inundated after 27 july the ec in both soil and groundwater increased noticeably likely due to evapotranspiration processes however the rapid fluctuations in soil ec after 14 june were mainly attributed to the leaching of surface soil salts upstream water discharge and tide of the sea 3 2 diurnal and daily behaviors of energy balance during the study period half hourly rn h and le showed a clear diurnal cycle for all months fig 3 a d daytime h reached a maximum level at 13 30 14 00 controlled by the diurnal variations in rn while peak le rates appeared to be about one hour earlier suggesting a weak impact of rn on le compared to le h showed much higher values and diurnal variations even in july and august which was similar to the results of rocha and goulden 2008 in a freshwater marsh in southern california and liljedahl et al 2011 in an arctic coastal wetland half hourly g showed smallest diurnal variations compared to other energy components before june the diurnal behavior of ef exhibited a concave up shape which was consistent with the assumption of daytime ef self preservation i e nearly constant during daytime gentine et al 2007 fig 3e g the large variations in ef in the early morning and late afternoon were mostly due to the rapid changes in energy fluxes and environmental variables fig 3a c and fig 1s from july to august the diurnal pattern of ef differed noticeably fig 3h which was inconsistent with most researches e g gentine et al 2011 liu et al 2019b but similar to that under bare surface conditions gentine et al 2007 it was mostly caused by the rapid rise and decline in diurnal le fig 3d and h fig 4 shows the variations in daily energy balance during the study period the notable variations in daily rn were partially due to changes in cloudiness and rainfall events referred to fig 2d in general both rn and le increased from the onset to the peak of the growing season while the fluctuations in le in july and august were also affected by meteorological conditions fig 2s daily le rn and h rn also displayed obvious temporal trends with an average of 0 14 and 0 90 respectively fig 4b interestingly the majority of rn was allocated to h rather than to le resulting in much higher daily h rn values than previously reported values from terrestrial and coastal wetland ecosystems for instance jiao et al 2018 showed that available energy partitioned to le was averaged at 61 over closed grapevine canopies in northwest china liljedahl et al 2011 found that a major portion of the midday surface energy was partitioned to h in an arctic coastal wetland but with much lower h rn 0 43 and 0 65 in wet and dry seasons respectively daily ef showed a similar pattern to those of le and le rn with a range from 0 03 to 0 71 and an average of 0 14 fig 4c diurnal and daily le and h variations offset each other to either enhance or reduce ef the values here were in general lower than those found in other coastal wetlands and terrestrial ecosystems bagley et al 2017 huryna et al 2014 for instance sun et al 2021 observed that ef over a p australis area had an average value of 0 27 in a coastal wetland in china li et al 2013 showed that the mean annual ef value was 0 66 above a maize field in arid northwest china overall our results highlighted the need to identify the factors that limited ef in this coastal wetland 3 3 directional controls from environmental variables on daily and half hourly ef fig 5 a shows the directional relationships between different environmental variables which were obtained from the gca test using daily observations during the study period in general unidirectional relationships existed between these variables except for the bi directional relationships between ta and rh and vpd and wd note that other than those direct relationships indirect relationships also existed for instance in the relationships of wd rh ta ta could be indirectly affected by wd through rh however at half hourly timescales more complex interactions emerged with more bi directional relationships which were mostly due to rapid variations in subdaily micrometeorological conditions and tighter couplings between different variables huang et al 2019 şimşek and ödül 2018 at daily timescales only ta and rh had directional controls on ef with a stronger strength of ta fig 5c at half hourly timescales ef was regulated by in order of importance rn and ta equally important vpd and α fig 5d the remaining variables had no directional relationships with daily and half hourly ef variations at a statistical significance level of 0 05 specifically at half hourly scales the control of rh over ef disappeared as energy played a more important role in controlling subdaily water and energy exchanges han et al 2021 it was also supported by the lack of granger causality of vpd rn and α over daily ef fig 5c although the remaining variables had no direct relationships with ef they could exert indirect influences for instance at daily timescales the strong control of rh could integrate the indirect impacts of wd vpd and rn on ef as indicated by their directional relationships from fig 5a this is important because the variations in ef were not just directly linked to single drivers but also reflected the outcome of ef interactions with multiple environmental variables 3 3 1 quantification of environmental drivers for controlling daily and half hourly ef dynamics to compare the gca results and understand underlying physical mechanisms the relative contributions of predictor variables to ef variations were quantified using the brt method fig 6 the constructed brt models showed good performances with high nse and r2 and low rmse values table 1s at daily timescales ta was the dominant control on ef dynamics with a contribution of 40 9 followed by wd 15 3 and rh 10 7 by comparison at half hourly timescales ef was primarily driven by rn 23 2 and ta 20 7 it was consistent with the directional strength based on the gca results fig 5c and d indicating that the controlling factors of ef varied with temporal scales with sufficient water supplies in our coastal wetland soil water had a very limited constraint on ef variations which differed from the findings in terrestrial ecosystems with much drier conditions ford et al 2014 liu et al 2019a instead the effect of atmospheric demands for water indicated by ta and rn was much stronger note that liljedahl et al 2011 showed that near surface soil moisture was important for le variability in arctic coastal wetlands but it was only observed when wp 130 kpa due to the diurnal variation in rn half hourly ef was more correlated with rn which was consistent with the finding of barr et al 2014 who showed that the availability of energy was the primary driver of half hourly le variations in mangrove forests the variable α is a crucial parameter for determining land surface energy budgets which was closely related to vegetation status and surface water conditions sumner et al 2011 however the small effect of α on ef variations in this study might be due to less variations in α at the study site with a relatively constant vegetation coverage 3 3 2 interactive impacts of wind and rh to further understand the roles of wind and rh in regulating ef variability as indicated by the gca and brt results we split the daily data into two periods based on the sudden change in soil ec on 14 june also the start of the wet period and then used the partial correlation method for the analysis table 2 overall wind played a central role in controlling ef before 14 june while rh was more important afterwards the aerodynamic resistance that is related to ws modulates the water vapor transfer through the surface boundary layer particularly under turbulent flow conditions meza 2005 therefore wind could clear moist air and regulate ef variations before 14 june as ws was relatively stable and rh remained at a high level ws became less important during the wet period which was also observed by ombadi et al 2020 this also provided an interpretation of the gca result that rh had a directional control on ws in fig 5a in coastal wetlands wd plays a critical role in regulating the interactions between different meteorological variables as stressed by lafleur and rouse 1988 and huang et al 2019 because of differences in thermal properties and air humidity between land and ocean onshore wind here defined as winds from 68 to 157 relative to north would bring cooler and moister air from the ocean huang et al 2019 leading to a higher rh and lower ta and vpd table 3 and fig 3s in addition offshore wind tended to be associated with larger α and rn during the study period table 3 and fig 3s the effect of wd on α might be largely due to its direct influence on land surface characteristics e g bulk surface resistance lafleur and rouse 1988 thereafter combined with the inherent relationship between α and rn the impact of wd on rn was detected similarly huang et al 2019 showed that wd influenced the diurnal variation in photosynthetically active radiation over a tidal salt marsh ecosystem in the yangtze delta therefore compared to terrestrial ecosystems wd can show a stronger control on the responses of ef to environmental variables in coastal wetlands which further alter energy partitioning processes huang et al 2019 for instance before the wet period the increase in wd led to the prevailing offshore winds which favored more energy partitioned into le resulting in increased le and ef at the study site tables 2 and 3 during the wet period the onshore winds with cooler and moister air mass suppressed the energy exchanges therefore rh was more important in controlling ef and le instead of wd table 2 and fig 2sa and b overall the controlling factors of ef covaried with meteorological conditions via the interactions between wind and rh at our study site 3 4 roles of salinity and vegetation soil salinity has been proved to affect vegetation growth through two stages first seed germination is inhibited or delayed and thus affects the length of growing seasons secondly soil salinity inhibits leaf emergence and canopy development resulting in reduced lai and biomass chambers et al 2003 chu et al 2019 the optimal water salinity range for p australis to grow was from 0 to 2 in a coastal wetland along the adriatic coast antonellini and mollema 2010 therefore under salt stress averaged at 3 8 for soil ec and 7 3 for groundwater ec in the study area vegetation had low aboveground biomass and lai at the study site table 1 it should be stressed that the impacts of soil salinity on water and energy fluxes through altering vegetation patterns in coastal wetlands were more likely to be important at timescales longer than daily and subdaily scales as shown in this study e g annual scales wang et al 2020b vegetation can influence energy partitioning through groundwater evapotranspiration williams and torn 2015 there was a significant correlation of dtgt with le while groundwater ec negatively affected ef before the wet period table 2 lum and barton 2020 showed that reduced transpiration was observed in coastal plants with higher salinity stress 3 in hawai i barr et al 2013 also found a negative relationship between groundwater salinity and daytime ef in mangrove forests in addition during the spring a large amount of dead or brown vegetation refer to fig 1b reduced the amount of radiant energy reaching the ground and acted as a mulch reducing soil evaporation herbst et al 2022 also demonstrated that the brown leaves were the dominant factor reducing evapotranspiration in a wetland from northwest germany meanwhile during the wet period local vegetation communities were constantly disturbed by the floods of ziyaxin river and tide of the bohai sea and then vegetation activities were limited by flood inundation overall the results of this study provide confidence that salinity and vegetation played vital roles in the substantially low le rn and high h rn in the wetland one limitation of this study is that the data available did not cover an entire year due to the malfunctioning of the breb system additional researches on water isotopes determining water use efficiency and evapotranspiration partitioning are also needed to test and further elucidate the controlling mechanisms of ef dynamics in coastal wetlands scott et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 4 conclusions in this study the breb system was employed to investigate the temporal patterns of ef dynamics and its controlling factors in an herbaceous coastal wetland in tianjin northern china the main findings of this study were 1 rn was mainly allocated to h with an average h rn of 0 90 and daily ef ranged from 0 03 to 0 71 with an average of 0 14 during the study period 2 the gca method identified strong interactions among different environmental variables and showed that energy related factors i e ta and rn were the dominant controls on ef variability especially at half hourly timescales which was also proved by the brt method 3 our results demonstrated that the controlling mechanisms of ef covaried with atmospheric conditions and vegetation dynamics that is poor vegetation status was largely affected by the salinity which primarily limited le and subsequently temporal ef variations during the wet period vegetation behaviors were limited by flood inundation and atmospheric conditions changed with the prevailing onshore wind directions which resulted in the dominant control of rh on ef the results in this study can benefit the parameterization of the energy exchange between atmosphere and coastal interfaces under changing climatic conditions credit authorship contribution statement qiong han
