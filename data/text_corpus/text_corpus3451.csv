17255,membrane fouling and ammonium transmembrane diffusion simultaneously pose great challenges in membrane based pre concentration of domestic wastewater for efficient subsequent resources recovery i e energy and nutrients herein amine functionalized osmotic membranes were fabricated by optimizing the grafting pathway of polyamidoamine pamam dendrimer to mitigate fouling and ammonium transmembrane diffusion compared to the control membrane the pamam grafted membranes with abundant primary amine groups possessed substantially increased hydrophilicity and positive charges i e protonated primary amines and thus exhibited superior anti fouling capability and ammonium selectivity with further increasing the pamam grafting ratio the membrane exhibited a steady enhancement in ammonium selectivity and eventually achieved an ultra high ammonium rejection of 99 4 nevertheless the anti fouling capability of such ammonium ultra selective membrane was weakened due to the suppression of the adverse impact of excessive positive charges over the beneficial effect of increased surface hydrophilicity this in turn leads to a drop of ammonium rejection below 90 during domestic wastewater concentration this study demonstrates that the membrane with a moderate primary amine loading could achieve the highest anti fouling capability with only less than 10 flux decline and meanwhile maintain an excellent ammonium rejection above 94 during raw domestic wastewater concentration this work provides theoretical guidance for fabricating simultaneously enhanced anti fouling and ammonia rejecting membranes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords primary amine functionalization forward osmosis ammonium rejection anti fouling domestic wastewater treatment 1 introduction sustainable wastewater treatment platforms that aim to recover the embedded fresh water energy and nutrients rather than dissipating them at the expense of significant energy input are gaining great popularity in the circular economy hulsen et al 2016 pang et al 2020 robles et al 2020 verstraete et al 2009 yu et al 2020 currently the integration of membrane process with anaerobic treatment such as anaerobic membrane bioreactor has attracted considerable interest in resources recovery from low strength domestic wastewater which is not suitable for direct anaerobic treatment ab hamid et al 2020 maaz et al 2019 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2017 meanwhile pre concentrating raw domestic wastewater by membrane process to a higher strength suitable for subsequent anaerobic treatment and nutrient recovery is also recognized as a promising approach due to the high degree of control and accessibility for membrane process ansari et al 2016 ansari et al 2017 gong et al 2019 compared with hydraulic pressure driven membrane technologies the osmotic pressure driven forward osmosis fo featuring low fouling propensity and low energy input for separation cath et al 2006 lutchmiah et al 2014 is emerging as the preferred membrane process for pre concentrating highly polluted raw wastewater liu et al 2016 zirehpour et al 2017 besides fo can provide diluted foulant free draw solution by extracting water from feed wastewater for downstream low pressure reverse osmosis ro to produce fresh water hube et al 2020 which is more cost effective than directly treating raw domestic wastewater with ro process where extensive pre treatment to control membrane fouling is required shaffer et al 2015b however commercial membranes exhibit unsatisfactory performance in ammonium rejection when treating wastewater e g ammonium rejection for typical commercial fo and ro membranes under typical wastewater conditions ph 6 8 is generally below 90 häyrynen et al 2009 li et al 2020 ray et al 2020 singh et al 2019 this is mainly because 1 ammonium has a very similar hydrated radius 0 11 nm and polarity to water molecule and thus renders a comparable transport behavior as water molecule within membrane holloway et al 2007 van voorthuizen et al 2005 and 2 conventional membranes used for wastewater treatment are negatively charged and hence electrostatically attract the positively charged ammonium onto the membrane surface to intensify the driving force for ammonium transmembrane diffusion arena et al 2014 bao et al 2019d as such the accumulated ammonium in the feed stream inclines to move through membrane resulting in either loss of ammonium nutrient in the concentrated feed or unacceptable ammonium content in the permeate water gu et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 it is also noted that membrane fouling is inevitable during wastewater concentration ansari et al 2018 she et al 2016 ammonium could be largely accumulated on the membrane surface under severe fouling due to the cake enhanced concentration polarization cecp effect she et al 2012 which could potentially reduce the ammonium rejection in the system therefore to improve the efficiency of wastewater concentration and minimize the loss of ammonium nutrient it is critically important to simultaneously enhance membrane anti fouling capability and ammonium selectivity recently surface amine functionalization strategies especially the introduction of primary amines on the membrane surface were found feasible to reinforce the ammonium rejection and anti fouling capability of tfc fo membranes for domestic wastewater concentration bao et al 2019a bao et al 2019b bao et al 2019c however constrained by the inferior grafting efficiency further enhancing the density of the easily protonated positively charged and highly hydrophilic primary amines on the membrane surface which has a high potential for developing a super ammonium selective and anti fouling membrane has not been achieved in addition further increasing the primary amine density on the membrane surface is likely to change the following two important membrane surface properties increasing positive charges and enhancing hydrophilicity both of which can competitively influence a typical fouling behavior she et al 2016 therefore it is strongly needed to mechanistically investigate the fouling and ammonium rejection behaviors of membranes with high surface primary amine densities which can provide an insight into optimal conditions for developing a membrane with super high anti fouling capability and ammonium selectivity in the present study the spherically structured and primary amine terminated polyamidoamine pamam dendrimer is applied for surface amine functionalization and the grafting pathway is optimized to improve the loading of primary amines on the membrane surface a series of characterizations are conducted to investigate the variations of the membrane surface morphologies and physicochemical properties with the enhancement in surface loading of primary amine the fouling behavior ammonium rejection and relationship between the anti fouling capability and ammonium rejection of membranes with wide range primary amine loadings are comprehensively investigated by both single and multi round raw domestic wastewater concentration and the associated mechanisms are discussed this work provides important theoretical guidance for the fabrication of super ammonium selective and anti fouling membranes for wastewater reclamation and nutrient recovery 2 materials and methods 2

by weihai cy dendrimer technology co ltd shandong china all chemicals were used as received without further purification sulfonated polyethersulfone spes with a sulfonation degree of 1 was provided by yanjin technology co ltd tianjin china and was dried at 80 c for 2 days before use ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm was used for all experiments 2 2 fabrication of pamam grafted tfc fo membranes the fabrication of pamam grafted tfc fo membranes generally comprises three steps namely the preparation of spes substrate by phase separation pa active layer by interfacial polymerization and pamam dendrimer grafting the first two steps for fabricating nascent tfc fo membrane could be found in our previous work and are described in detail in si section s1 as for the grafting process three different pathways were applied to graft pamam dendrimer on the membrane surface which are schematically illustrated in fig s2 first of all a one step non activation grafting method i e plain grafting pathway was used by pouring 40 ml pbs buffer ph 7 4 with certain concentration of pamam dendrimer 0 1 wt 0 2 wt 0 5 wt and 1 wt onto the nascent tfc fo membranes for 15 min in addition a one step cmpi and a two step edc nhs mediated grafting methods were explored to enhance the grafting efficiency by minimizing the invalidation of acyl chloride during the grafting process bahadir and sezginturk 2016 li et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 for the cmpi mediated grafting pathway the only difference from the plain grafting pathway was the addition of appropriate amount of cmpi and naoh the molar ratio of cmpi naoh pamam 2 4 1 into the pamam dendrimer solution li et al 2017 saenz de jubera et al 2013 for the edc nhs mediated grafting pathway the nascent tfc fo membrane was firstly reacted with the activation solution ph 5 0 which consisted of 2 mm edc 5 mm nhs 10 mm mes and 0 5 m nacl for 20 min to convert the majority of acyl chloride groups into amine reactive imide ester shaffer et al 2015a after pouring out the excess solution the membrane was rinsed with ultrapure water for 0 5 min then the resultant membrane was treated identically as the plain grafting pathway for comparison the control tfc fo membrane was prepared under the identical conditions as the plain pathway except the addition of pamam dendrimer into the grafting aqueous solution the prepared membranes were thoroughly rinsed and then stored in ultrapure water at 4 c for further use 2 3 characterization of the tfc fo membranes prior to characterization all the membrane samples were vacuum dried field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem jeol jsm 7600f japan and atomic force microscopy afm xe 100 park systems korea were used to characterize the surface morphology and roughness of the tfc fo membranes respectively confocal laser scanning microscope clsm zeiss lsm 800 germany was used to observe the distribution of primary amines on the membrane surface see section s2 in si the grafting ratio of pamam dendrimer and the densities of pamam dendrimer and primary amine on the membrane surfaces were estimated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis supra kratos analytical uk lu et al 2013 and tbo dye method zhang et al 2017 respectively the experimental procedures were illustrated in section s3 in si contact angle goniometer dataphysics oca 15 germany was applied to measure the water contact angle of membrane surface three samples of each type of membrane were tested and at least five measurements were conducted on each membrane sample besides the isoelectric point of the tfc fo membranes was analyzed by a zeta potential analyzer surpass 3 anton paar austria equipped with an automatic titration 2 4 evaluation of intrinsic separation properties and fo performances the intrinsic separation properties of the tfc fo membranes in terms of water permeability a and salt permeability b coefficients were evaluated in a crossflow ro system the experimental procedures are described in section s4 in si the fo performance of each membrane was measured in a crossflow fo setup fig s3 in the active layer facing feed solution orientation the draw solution was 1 mol l nacl aqueous solution and its concentration was maintained constant during the whole fo testing process by dosing the draw solution with a 5 mol l nacl solution controlled by conductivity measurement the specific testing conditions could be found in section s5 in si first ultrapure water was used as feed solution to evaluate the water flux and reverse solute flux of the tfc fo membranes then the feed solution was replaced with nh4cl solution of 50 mg l nh4 n to measure the ammonium selectivity of the tfc fo membranes the calculations on ammonium rejection could be found in section s6 in si during all the fo tests the concentration factor of the feed solution was set at 50 at least three replicates were performed for each membrane type to obtain a dataset within 5 standard deviation 2 5 evaluation of membrane fouling fouling reversibility and ammonia rejection raw domestic wastewater septic tank effluent refer to table s1 in si was used as the feed solution to evaluate the anti fouling capability ammonium rejection and fouling reversibility of the tfc fo membranes first a single round domestic wastewater concentration test with a feed volume reduction of 50 initial volume of 1l was conducted at the same membrane surface crossflow velocity of 10 cm s as that under non fouling conditions water samples were collected from the feed and draw solutions before and after the concentration process ammonium in water samples was measured according to the standard methods clesceri et al 2012 besides in order to observe the fouling severity the cross sectional membrane samples of the fouled membranes were taken for sem characterization under the same treatment as the virgin membrane samples then a four round domestic wastewater concentration test with a feed volume reduction of 50 in each concentration round initial volume of 1l was performed under the identical operational conditions as the single round concentration physical cleaning of whole fo system was conducted after every concentration round by flushing with ultrapure water at a membrane surface crossflow velocity of 20 cm s for 10 min during the four round test the domestic wastewater concentration and physical cleaning processes were carried out consecutively after finishing the physical cleaning both of the feed domestic wastewater and draw solution were changed with new ones for subsequent testing water samples were collected from the feed and draw solutions every 100 ml cumulative water permeation for ammonium rejection measurement besides clsm was used to visualize the foulant distribution on the physically cleaned membrane surface after the final concentration round following the methods developed by yuan et al 2015 see section s7 in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane surface properties the optimal grafting pathway that can achieve the highest primary amine loading on the membrane surface was determined by extensively characterizing the grafting efficiency of pamam dendrimer onto the grafted membrane surface with clsm xps and tbo dye methods as shown in fig s4 the pamam grafted membranes mediated by cmpi exhibited higher grafting efficiency than those via the other grafting pathways the corresponding analyses are illustrated in detail in section s8 in si therefore the subsequent work will focus on the cmpi mediating pamam grafted membranes in the following sections the cmpi mediating pamam grafted tfc fo membranes that grafted with grafting solutions containing 0 1 wt 0 2 wt 0 5 wt and 1 wt pamam dendrimer are designated as cmpi p0 1 cmpi p0 2 cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 respectively the surface morphologies and physicochemical properties of the control i e grafted with 0 wt pamam dendrimer solution and cmpi mediating pamam grafted membranes were systematically characterized as shown in fig 1 a e a typical ridge and valley morphology was presented on all the membrane surfaces the protrusions sticking out from the grafted membrane surfaces were generally more flattened and shortened in comparison to those from the control membrane the increase of the pamam dendrimer grafting ratio further shortened the protrusions on the membrane surface consistent with the increasingly shortened protrusions the membrane surface roughness fig 1f reduced with increasing the pamam dendrimer grafting ratios the morphological evolution of these membrane surfaces indicates that the pamam dendrimer was preferentially grafted in the valley regions which would be helpful for fouling reduction compared to the slight morphological variations the cmpi mediating pamam grafted membranes exhibited significant variations in surface physicochemical properties benefitting from the high grafting efficiency under cmpi mediation the pamam dendrimer grafting ratio and the resultant primary amine density fig 1g on the grafted membranes were reached to an extremely high level correspondingly all the grafted membranes exhibited much lower surface water contact angle than the control membrane fig 1h indicating that the cmpi mediating pamam grafted membranes possessed increased hydrophilicity the contact angle of the grafted membranes first decreased rapidly with increasing the pamam dendrimer grafting concentration i e with the increase in primary amine loading but not further largely decreased at relatively higher pamam dendrimer grafting concentrations i e above 0 5 wt this is because the density of the hydrophilic primary amine under cmpi mediation had almost reached the limit at such high pamam dendrimer grafting concentrations refer to fig 1g besides the surface isoelectric point iep increased from 3 for the control membrane to above 8 when the pamam dendrimer grafting concentrations were above 0 5 wt fig 1h indicating cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 were positively charged under neutral conditions this is because the ultra high primary amine loading enables ultra high protonated amines present on the membrane surfaces de jubera et al 2012 3 2 membrane intrinsic separation parameters and osmotic performance the water permeability a value and salt permeability b value coefficients only slightly decreased as the pamam dendrimer grafting ratio increased fig s5 the decreasing b value indicates that the diffusion resistance of the grafted membranes increases with the improvement of pamam dendrimer loading meanwhile the surface loaded primary amines enhanced the hydrophilicity of the grafted membranes which effectively moderated the attenuation in water permeability zhang et al 2020 fig 2 shows the fo performance of all the membranes under non fouling conditions the water flux and the reverse nacl flux of all the grafted membranes almost remained unchanged compared to the control membrane fig 2a however the presence of pamam dendrimer endowed the grafted membranes with remarkably enhanced ammonium selectivity fig 2b the control membrane with naked pa layer exhibited poor ammonium rejection of only 69 87 0 61 for nh4cl solution with 50 mg l nh4 n in comparison benefitting from the superior grafting efficiency under cmpi mediation even the cmpi p0 1 grafted with low concentration of pamam dendrimer solution still possessed a significantly enhanced ammonium rejection of 96 52 0 41 as the primary amine loading increased the ammonium rejection of the grafted membranes was further enhanced and peaked at a remarkably high value of 99 39 0 27 for cmpi p1 this suggests the adsorption of ammonium onto the membrane surface was effectively hindered by the powerful repulsion from the abundant positively charged protonated amines that loaded on the membrane surface 3 3 single round domestic wastewater concentration membrane fouling and fouling reversibility of the control and cmpi mediating pamam grafted membranes were systematically investigated with raw domestic wastewater to explore the fouling mechanisms under wide range surface loadings of primary amine first a single round concentration of raw domestic wastewater 50 feed volume reduction was conducted all the membranes exhibited similar initial water flux fig s6 but suffered varying degrees of water flux reduction fig 3 a as the concentration factor of feedwater increased although the increased salt concentration in the feed would partly lead to a decrease in water flux the osmotic pressure rise of the feedwater during the concentration process was still small when compared with the huge osmotic pressure of the draw solution since the concentration of the draw solution was maintained constant during the whole concentration process the reduction of water flux indicates the occurrence of membrane fouling specifically the control membrane exhibited a steeper water flux decline of 52 33 during the whole concentration process in comparison cmpi p0 1 and cmpi p0 2 showed significantly reduced water flux decline of 17 18 and 9 42 respectively however the further increase in surface loading of primary amine on the contrary resulted in a relapsed water flux decline of the grafted membranes by 36 30 and 39 83 for cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 respectively above all it is conclusive that the presence of primary amines can effectively enhance membrane anti fouling capability while the enhancement is weakened as the primary amine loading on the grafted membrane excessively increases owing to the best anti fouling capability cmpi p0 2 possessed the highest average water flux of 30 15 lm 2h 1 fig s6 the presence of primary amines significantly enhanced the surface hydrophilicity refer to fig 1h which leads to the formation of a hydration layer on the membrane surface that acts as a barrier preventing foulant deposition israelachvili and wennerstrom 1996 under this circumstance the anti fouling capability of the grafted membranes was strengthened compared to the control membrane however although excessive loading of primary amine endowed the membrane surface with higher hydrophilicity it would also cause the membrane surface to be positively charged i e iep of ph 8 4 and 8 6 for cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 respectively the ever increasing electrostatic attraction between the positively charged membrane surface and the negatively charged foulants induced aggravating foulant adsorption on the membrane surface and eventually suppressed the strengthened foulant isolation that endowed by the improved membrane surface hydrophilicity which in turn weakened the anti fouling capability of the grafted membranes with excessive primary amine loading besides as shown in fig 3b f the thicknesses of the corresponding fouling layers formed on the membrane surfaces also reveal the severity of fouling under different primary amine loadings the thickest fouling layer formed on the control membrane confirms the most severe fouling and most flux decline for the control membrane fouling layers on the cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 were much thicker than that on the cmpi p0 2 further confirming the adverse impact of the excessive primary amines on membrane fouling 3 4 four round domestic wastewater concentration subsequently a four round domestic wastewater concentration was performed with membrane physically cleaned after every concentration round as shown in fig 4 a the control membrane experienced a rapid decline in water flux to the lowest among all the membranes in the first concentration round r1 for the grafted membranes cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 with excessive primary amine loading exhibited much severer water flux reduction than cmpi p0 2 with moderate primary amine loading these water flux trends are consistent with that in the single round concentration after conducting physical cleaning the water flux of each membrane was partly recovered similar water flux decline trend was observed in r2 r4 in order to investigate the fouling reversibility the initial water fluxes in r2 r4 were normalized to that in r1 fig 4b generally the initial water flux of each membrane in the subsequent concentration round dropped in varying degrees compared to that in last concentration round this indicates the occurrence of irreversible membrane fouling where the foulants are adsorbed on the membrane surface in the form of chemical bonds and cannot be removed by physical cleaning singh et al 2018 specifically the control membrane with the least resistance to membrane fouling experienced the largest initial water flux decline by 8 05 12 54 and 16 95 in r2 r3 and r4 respectively among all the membranes on the contrary the grafted membranes exhibited a much smaller initial water flux decline of less than 3 52 between any two adjacent concentration rounds unexpectedly cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 that featured inferior anti fouling performance conversely possessed higher water flux recovery in r4 97 53 and 97 95 normalized to r1 respectively than that of the cmpi p0 1 and cmpi p0 2 92 27 and 96 33 normalized to r1 respectively suggesting the fouling reversibility of the grafted membranes is enhanced with the primary amine loading the improved fouling reversibility of the primary amine overloaded membranes was further verified by the clsm images of the physically cleaned membrane surfaces after r4 fig 4c g the residual foulants adsorbed on the membrane surfaces reduced as the enhancement in primary amine loading the less hydrophilic surface of the control membrane was liable to foulant adsorption due to the greater hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions meyer et al 2006 meanwhile the positively charged multivalent metal ions were prone to migrating to the negatively charged control membrane surface under electrostatic attraction among the metal ions commonly existed in domestic wastewater ca2 and mg2 were capable of forming complex with the carboxylic groups both on the organic foulants i e protein and humic acid and on the membrane surface mi and elimelech 2008 she et al 2016 thus chemically bridging organic foulants with the membrane surface in this case as illustrated in fig 4h the control membrane surface with abundant carboxylic groups fig s4e suffered severe fouling and weak fouling reversibility on the contrary the introduction of primary amines not only enhanced the membrane surface hydrophilicity but also reduced the carboxylic group density which helps to enhance both the anti fouling capability and fouling reversibility besides the increased surface charge potential of the grafted membranes i e less negative or more positive was beneficial to preventing metal ions from approaching the membrane surface moreover the reduced surface roughness of the grafted membranes refer to fig 1f was also helpful for fouling reduction therefore the grafted membrane with sufficient primary amine loading i e cmpi p0 2 exhibited superior anti fouling capability and fouling reversibility as for the grafted membranes with excessive primary amine loading i e cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 although the overloaded primary amines lead to aggravated foulant adsorption on the membrane surface it also greatly reduced the occurrence of irreversible fouling 3 5 influence of fouling on ammonium rejection the rejection of the tfc fo membranes for ammonium was investigated during the domestic wastewater concentration processes during the single round domestic wastewater concentration fig 5 a the grafted membranes exhibited much higher ammonium rejection generally above 88 87 0 55 than the control membrane 58 37 0 51 it is worth noting that a superior ammonium rejection of 94 83 0 74 was achieved by cmpi p0 2 which is advantageous to the commercial membranes especially the commercial fo membranes see table s3 however when compared to the ammonium rejection for nh4cl solution 50 mg l nh4 n refer to fig 2b under non fouling condition the ammonium rejection for domestic wastewater contained 49 6 0 2 mg l nh4 n was generally lower for all membranes the corresponding ammonium rejection decline caused by fouling fig 5a was closely correlated to the membrane fouling severity refer to fig 3a this indicates that the occurrence of membrane fouling leads to the reduction of ammonium rejection in addition the ammonium rejection of all membranes during four round domestic wastewater concentration process decreased with the progress of feed concentration in all the concentration rounds fig 5b further verifying the transmembrane diffusion of ammonium was enhanced by the occurrence of membrane fouling as for the grafted membranes although the ammonium selectivity evaluated by concentrating pure nh4cl solution refer to fig 2b persistently enhanced with the primary amine loading the ammonium rejection during single round domestic wastewater concentration fig 5a increased first but then unexpectedly decreased with further increasing the primary amine loading which peaked at the cmpi p0 2 with the value of 94 83 0 74 besides it is worth noting in fig 5b that the ammonium rejection of the cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 that featured with excessive primary amine loading was higher than that of the cmpi p0 2 in the initial stage 100 ml cumulative water permeation but then drastically decreased to a level similar to that of the cmpi p0 1 till the end of r1 during four round domestic wastewater concentration this indicates that the advantage of the high ammonium repulsion endowed by the excessive primary amine loading under non fouling or mild fouling conditions will be compromised by the severe membrane fouling above all it is conclusive that the ammonium rejection under fouling conditions was synthetically determined by the ammonium selectivity and anti fouling capability of the membrane as illustrated in fig 5c the intrinsic ammonium selectivity or ammonium repulsive force of the membranes with no or insufficient primary amine loading is weak against the adsorption of ammonium on the membrane surface besides a small amount of primary amine loaded on the membrane surface can hardly alleviate the formation of fouling layer which will further lead to the accumulation of ammonium on the membrane surface by the cecp effect and hence accelerate the transmembrane diffusion of ammonium with the increase in primary amine loading to a moderate level on the membrane surface i e cmpi p0 2 the membrane surface possessed simultaneously enhanced ammonium repulsion and weakened foulants adsorption which synergistically favor the ammonium rejection for domestic wastewater conversely excessive primary amine loading in turn aggravated membrane fouling fig 3a which makes the primary amines be encapsulated and incapacitated by foulants and thus greatly weakens the resistance to the ammonium adsorption onto the membrane surface meanwhile the deteriorated membrane fouling would also enrich ammonium on the membrane surface by the cecp effect under this circumstance the ammonium rejection of the primary amine overloaded membranes i e cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 declines with the addition of redundant primary amines during domestic wastewater concentration similar to the water flux recovery behavior after cleaning the ammonium rejection of each membrane was also recovered to varying degrees with regard to the different primary amine loadings on the membrane surface fig 5b specifically as shown in fig s7 when compared to the ammonium rejection in the initial stage 100 ml cumulative water permeation in r1 the corresponding ammonium rejection of the control membrane varied slightly in r2 r4 less than 0 5 this demonstrates that although the irreversible fouling that formed on the membrane surface exerted additional resistance to both water and ammonium diffusion the ammonium rejection of the control membrane remained nearly unchanged however even suffered much milder irreversible fouling the grafted membranes exhibited larger decline in initial ammonium rejection compared to the control membrane in the same concentration round for one specific grafted membrane since the membrane fouling occurred in the initial stages of each concentration round is mild and indistinctive refer to fig 4a the concentration of the concomitantly enriched ammonium above the membrane surface via cecp effect in the initial stages of each concentration round is also similar therefore the larger decline in ammonium rejection of the grafted membrane in the initial stages of r2 r4 was mainly attributed to the weakened ammonium repulsion this further indicates that the irreversible fouling together with the initial fouling very mild and negligible would encapsulate the pamam dendrimer and thus incapacitate the primary amine on ammonium rejection in this case the primary amine overloaded membranes with greater fouling reversibility i e cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 exhibited lower ammonium rejection decline than the other grafted membranes in the initial stages of r2 r4 4 implications this study suggests that the highly anti fouling and ammonium rejecting membranes should meet the following two important criteria firstly the membrane surface should be super hydrophilic to provide strong resistance against fouling secondly the membrane surface should have sufficient positively charged functional groups to provide powerful electrostatic repulsion to the positively charged ammonium ions however excessive introduction of positively charged functional groups will turn the membrane surface to be positively charged and enhance the attraction of negatively charged foulants therefore the competing effects of increased surface charge and hydrophilicity on fouling pose a great challenge for fabricating a membrane with simultaneously enhanced anti fouling capability and ammonium rejection considering that severe fouling will in turn reduce ammonium rejection it is relatively more important to improve anti fouling capability when the ammonium selectivity is not largely sacrificed therefore a promising strategy might be via enhancing the membrane surface hydrophilicity as much as possible while tuning the membrane surface to be slightly negatively charged by introducing more positively charged functional groups as demonstrated in this study surface primary amine functionalization using pamam dendrimer is a promising method for fabricating this type of membranes 5 conclusions in this study pamam grafted tfc membranes were fabricated for wastewater treatment and nutrient enrichment with optimized pamam dendrimer grafting pathway via cmpi mediation an ultra high amount of primary amines can be loaded on the membrane surface by studying the pamam grafted membranes for raw domestic wastewater concentration it is demonstrated that primary amine functionalized membranes have a great potential to mitigate fouling and ammonium transmembrane diffusion this is because the abundant primary amine groups can increase both membrane surface hydrophilicity which can reduce foulant deposition and the surface positive charges via protonation which can increase the electrostatic repulsion to the ammonium ions transporting onto the membrane while the ammonium rejection increased steadily with increasing the primary amine loading on the membrane surface the fouling behavior was competitively influenced by increased surface hydrophilicity and the amount of positively charged groups on the membrane surface in the range of relatively low primary amine loading since the membrane surface is negatively charged membrane fouling behavior is dominated by the surface hydrophilicity thus increasing primary amine loading leads to reduced fouling due to increased hydrophilicity in the range of relatively high primary amine loading membrane surface is positively charged due to substantially increased positively charged groups protonated amine groups which plays a more important role in typical fouling than the increased hydrophilicity thus increasing primary amine loading in this range leads to exacerbated fouling the severe fouling will compromise the ammonium rejection due to the change of original surface property as well as the cake enhanced concentration polarization declaration of competing interest the

17255,membrane fouling and ammonium transmembrane diffusion simultaneously pose great challenges in membrane based pre concentration of domestic wastewater for efficient subsequent resources recovery i e energy and nutrients herein amine functionalized osmotic membranes were fabricated by optimizing the grafting pathway of polyamidoamine pamam dendrimer to mitigate fouling and ammonium transmembrane diffusion compared to the control membrane the pamam grafted membranes with abundant primary amine groups possessed substantially increased hydrophilicity and positive charges i e protonated primary amines and thus exhibited superior anti fouling capability and ammonium selectivity with further increasing the pamam grafting ratio the membrane exhibited a steady enhancement in ammonium selectivity and eventually achieved an ultra high ammonium rejection of 99 4 nevertheless the anti fouling capability of such ammonium ultra selective membrane was weakened due to the suppression of the adverse impact of excessive positive charges over the beneficial effect of increased surface hydrophilicity this in turn leads to a drop of ammonium rejection below 90 during domestic wastewater concentration this study demonstrates that the membrane with a moderate primary amine loading could achieve the highest anti fouling capability with only less than 10 flux decline and meanwhile maintain an excellent ammonium rejection above 94 during raw domestic wastewater concentration this work provides theoretical guidance for fabricating simultaneously enhanced anti fouling and ammonia rejecting membranes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords primary amine functionalization forward osmosis ammonium rejection anti fouling domestic wastewater treatment 1 introduction sustainable wastewater treatment platforms that aim to recover the embedded fresh water energy and nutrients rather than dissipating them at the expense of significant energy

water molecule within membrane holloway et al 2007 van voorthuizen et al 2005 and 2 conventional membranes used for wastewater treatment are negatively charged and hence electrostatically attract the positively charged ammonium onto the membrane surface to intensify the driving force for ammonium transmembrane diffusion arena et al 2014 bao et al 2019d as such the accumulated ammonium in the feed stream inclines to move through membrane resulting in either loss of ammonium nutrient in the concentrated feed or unacceptable ammonium content in the permeate water gu et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 it is also noted that membrane fouling is inevitable during wastewater concentration ansari et al 2018 she et al 2016 ammonium could be largely accumulated on the membrane surface under severe fouling due to the cake enhanced concentration polarization cecp effect she et al 2012 which could potentially reduce the ammonium rejection in the system therefore to improve the efficiency of wastewater concentration and minimize the loss of ammonium nutrient it is critically important to simultaneously enhance membrane anti fouling capability and ammonium selectivity recently surface amine functionalization strategies especially the introduction of primary amines on the membrane surface were found feasible to reinforce the ammonium rejection and anti fouling capability of tfc fo membranes for domestic wastewater concentration bao et al 2019a bao et al 2019b bao et al 2019c however constrained by the inferior grafting efficiency further enhancing the density of the easily protonated positively charged and highly hydrophilic primary amines on the membrane surface which has a high potential for developing a super ammonium selective and anti fouling membrane has not been achieved in addition further increasing the primary amine density on the membrane surface is likely to change the following two important membrane surface properties increasing positive charges and enhancing hydrophilicity both of which can competitively influence a typical fouling behavior she et al 2016 therefore it is strongly needed to mechanistically investigate the fouling and ammonium rejection behaviors of membranes with high surface primary amine densities which can provide an insight into optimal conditions for developing a membrane with super high anti fouling capability and ammonium selectivity in the present study the spherically structured and primary amine terminated polyamidoamine pamam dendrimer is applied for surface amine functionalization and the grafting pathway is optimized to improve the loading of primary amines on the membrane surface a series of characterizations are conducted to investigate the variations of the membrane surface morphologies and physicochemical properties with the enhancement in surface loading of primary amine the fouling behavior ammonium rejection and relationship between the anti fouling capability and ammonium rejection of membranes with wide range primary amine loadings are comprehensively investigated by both single and multi round raw domestic wastewater concentration and the associated mechanisms are discussed this work provides important theoretical guidance for the fabrication of super ammonium selective and anti fouling membranes for wastewater reclamation and nutrient recovery 2 materials and methods 2

yanjin technology co ltd tianjin china and was dried at 80 c for 2 days before use ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm was used for all experiments 2 2 fabrication of pamam grafted tfc fo membranes the fabrication of pamam grafted tfc fo membranes generally comprises three steps namely the preparation of spes substrate by phase separation pa active layer by interfacial polymerization and pamam dendrimer grafting the first two steps for fabricating nascent tfc fo membrane could be found in our previous work and are described in detail in si section s1 as for the grafting process three different pathways were applied to graft pamam dendrimer on the membrane surface which are schematically illustrated in fig s2 first of all a one step non activation grafting method i e plain grafting pathway was used by pouring 40 ml pbs buffer ph 7 4 with certain concentration of pamam dendrimer 0 1 wt 0 2 wt 0 5 wt and 1 wt onto the nascent tfc fo membranes for 15 min in addition a one step cmpi and a two step edc nhs mediated grafting methods were explored to enhance the grafting efficiency by minimizing the invalidation of acyl chloride during the grafting process bahadir and sezginturk 2016 li et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 for the cmpi mediated grafting pathway the only difference from the plain grafting pathway was the addition of appropriate amount of cmpi and naoh the molar ratio of cmpi naoh pamam 2 4 1 into the pamam dendrimer solution li et al 2017 saenz de jubera et al 2013 for the edc nhs mediated grafting pathway the nascent tfc fo membrane was firstly reacted with the activation solution ph 5 0 which consisted of 2 mm edc 5 mm nhs 10 mm mes and 0 5 m nacl for 20 min to convert the majority of acyl chloride groups into amine reactive imide ester shaffer et al 2015a after pouring out the excess solution the membrane was rinsed with ultrapure water for 0 5 min then the resultant membrane was treated identically as the plain grafting pathway for comparison the control tfc fo membrane was prepared under the identical conditions as the plain pathway except the addition of pamam dendrimer into the grafting aqueous solution the prepared membranes were thoroughly rinsed and then stored in ultrapure water at 4 c for further use 2 3 characterization of the tfc fo membranes prior to characterization all the membrane samples were vacuum dried field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem jeol jsm 7600f japan and atomic force microscopy afm xe 100 park systems korea were used to characterize the surface morphology and roughness of the tfc fo membranes respectively confocal laser scanning microscope clsm zeiss lsm 800 germany was used to observe the distribution of primary amines on the membrane surface see section s2 in si the grafting ratio of pamam dendrimer and the densities of pamam dendrimer and primary amine on the membrane surfaces were estimated by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis supra kratos analytical uk lu et al 2013 and tbo dye method zhang et al 2017 respectively the experimental procedures were illustrated in section s3 in si contact angle goniometer dataphysics oca 15 germany was applied to measure the water contact angle of membrane surface three samples of each type of membrane were tested and at least five measurements were conducted on each membrane sample besides the isoelectric point of the tfc fo membranes was analyzed by a zeta potential analyzer surpass 3 anton paar austria equipped with an automatic titration 2 4 evaluation of intrinsic separation properties and fo performances the intrinsic separation properties of the tfc fo membranes in terms of water permeability a and salt permeability b coefficients were evaluated in a crossflow ro system the experimental procedures are described in section s4 in si the fo performance of each membrane was measured in a crossflow fo setup fig s3 in the active layer facing feed solution orientation the draw solution was 1 mol l nacl aqueous solution and its concentration was maintained constant during the whole fo testing process by dosing the draw solution with a 5 mol l nacl solution controlled by conductivity measurement the specific testing conditions could be found in section s5 in si first ultrapure water was used as feed solution to evaluate the water flux and reverse solute flux of the tfc fo membranes then the feed solution was replaced with nh4cl solution of 50 mg l nh4 n to measure the ammonium selectivity of the tfc fo membranes the calculations on ammonium rejection could be found in section s6 in si during all the fo tests the concentration factor of the feed solution was set at 50 at least three replicates were performed for each membrane type to obtain a dataset within 5 standard deviation 2 5 evaluation of membrane fouling fouling reversibility and ammonia rejection raw domestic wastewater septic tank effluent refer to table s1 in si was used as the feed solution to evaluate the anti fouling capability ammonium rejection and fouling reversibility of the tfc fo membranes first a single round domestic wastewater concentration test with a feed volume reduction of 50 initial volume of 1l was conducted at the same membrane surface crossflow velocity of 10 cm s as that under non fouling conditions water samples were collected from the feed and draw solutions before and after the concentration process ammonium in water samples was measured according to the standard methods clesceri et al 2012 besides in order to observe the fouling severity the cross sectional membrane samples of the fouled membranes were taken for sem characterization under the same treatment as the virgin membrane samples then a four round domestic wastewater concentration test with a feed volume reduction of 50 in each concentration round initial volume of 1l was performed under the identical operational conditions as the single round concentration physical cleaning of whole fo system was conducted after every concentration round by flushing with ultrapure water at a membrane surface crossflow velocity of 20 cm s for 10 min during the four round test the domestic wastewater concentration and physical cleaning processes were carried out consecutively after finishing the physical cleaning both of the feed domestic wastewater and draw solution were changed with new ones for subsequent testing water samples were collected from the feed and draw solutions every 100 ml cumulative water permeation for ammonium rejection measurement besides clsm was used to visualize the foulant distribution on the physically cleaned membrane surface after the final concentration round following the methods developed by yuan et al 2015 see section s7 in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane surface properties the optimal grafting pathway that can achieve the highest primary amine loading on the membrane surface was determined by extensively characterizing the grafting efficiency of pamam dendrimer onto the grafted membrane surface with clsm xps and tbo dye methods as shown in fig s4 the pamam grafted membranes mediated by cmpi exhibited higher grafting efficiency than those via the other grafting pathways the corresponding analyses are illustrated in detail in section s8 in si therefore the subsequent work will focus on the cmpi mediating pamam grafted membranes in the following sections the cmpi mediating pamam grafted tfc fo membranes that grafted with grafting solutions containing 0 1 wt 0 2 wt 0 5 wt and 1 wt pamam dendrimer are designated as cmpi p0 1 cmpi p0 2 cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 respectively the surface morphologies and physicochemical properties of the control i e grafted with 0 wt pamam dendrimer solution and cmpi mediating pamam grafted membranes were systematically characterized as shown in fig 1 a e a typical ridge and valley morphology was presented on all the membrane surfaces the protrusions sticking out from the grafted membrane surfaces were generally more flattened and shortened in comparison to those from the control membrane the increase of the pamam dendrimer grafting ratio further shortened the protrusions on the membrane surface consistent with the increasingly shortened protrusions the membrane surface roughness fig 1f reduced with increasing the pamam dendrimer grafting ratios the morphological evolution of these membrane surfaces indicates that the pamam dendrimer was preferentially grafted in the valley regions which would be helpful for fouling reduction compared to the slight morphological variations the cmpi mediating pamam grafted membranes exhibited significant variations in surface physicochemical properties benefitting from the high grafting efficiency under cmpi mediation the pamam dendrimer grafting ratio and the resultant primary amine density fig 1g on the grafted membranes were reached to an extremely high level correspondingly all the grafted membranes exhibited much lower surface water contact angle than the control membrane fig 1h indicating that the cmpi mediating pamam grafted membranes possessed increased hydrophilicity the contact angle of the grafted membranes first decreased rapidly with increasing the pamam dendrimer grafting concentration i e with the increase in primary amine loading but not further largely decreased at relatively higher pamam dendrimer grafting concentrations i e above 0 5 wt this is because the density of the hydrophilic primary amine under cmpi mediation had almost reached the limit at such high pamam dendrimer grafting concentrations refer to fig 1g besides the surface isoelectric point iep increased from 3 for the control membrane to above 8 when the pamam dendrimer grafting concentrations were above 0 5 wt fig 1h indicating cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 were positively charged under neutral conditions this is because the ultra high primary amine loading enables ultra high protonated amines present on the membrane surfaces de jubera et al 2012 3 2 membrane intrinsic separation parameters and osmotic performance the water permeability a value and salt permeability b value coefficients only slightly decreased as the pamam dendrimer grafting ratio increased fig s5 the decreasing b value indicates that the diffusion resistance of the grafted membranes increases with the improvement of pamam dendrimer loading meanwhile the surface loaded primary amines enhanced the hydrophilicity of the grafted membranes which effectively moderated the attenuation in water permeability zhang et al 2020 fig 2 shows the fo performance of all the membranes under non fouling conditions the water flux and the reverse nacl flux of all the grafted membranes almost remained unchanged compared to the control membrane fig 2a however the presence of pamam dendrimer endowed the grafted membranes with remarkably enhanced ammonium selectivity fig 2b the control membrane with naked pa layer exhibited poor ammonium rejection of only 69 87 0 61 for nh4cl solution with 50 mg l nh4 n in comparison benefitting from the superior grafting efficiency under cmpi mediation even the cmpi p0 1 grafted with low concentration of pamam dendrimer solution still possessed a significantly enhanced ammonium rejection of 96 52 0 41 as the primary amine loading increased the ammonium rejection of the grafted membranes was further enhanced and peaked at a remarkably high value of 99 39 0 27 for cmpi p1 this suggests the adsorption of ammonium onto the membrane surface was effectively hindered by the powerful repulsion from the abundant positively charged protonated amines that loaded on the membrane surface 3 3 single round domestic wastewater concentration membrane fouling and fouling reversibility of the control and cmpi mediating pamam grafted membranes were systematically investigated with raw domestic wastewater to explore the fouling mechanisms under wide range surface loadings of primary amine first a single round concentration of raw domestic wastewater 50 feed volume reduction was conducted all the membranes exhibited similar initial water flux fig s6 but suffered varying degrees of water flux reduction fig 3 a as the concentration factor of feedwater increased although the increased salt concentration in the feed would partly lead to a decrease in water flux the osmotic pressure rise of the feedwater during the concentration process was still small when compared with the huge osmotic pressure of the draw solution since the concentration of the draw solution was maintained constant during the whole concentration process the reduction of water flux indicates the occurrence of membrane fouling specifically the control membrane exhibited a steeper water flux decline of 52 33 during the whole concentration process in comparison cmpi p0 1 and cmpi p0 2 showed significantly reduced water flux decline of 17 18 and 9 42 respectively however the further increase in surface loading of primary amine on the contrary resulted in a relapsed water flux decline of the grafted membranes by 36 30 and 39 83 for cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 respectively above all it is conclusive that the presence of primary amines can effectively enhance membrane anti fouling capability while the enhancement is weakened as the primary amine loading on the grafted membrane excessively increases owing to the best anti fouling capability cmpi p0 2 possessed the highest average water flux of 30 15 lm 2h 1 fig s6 the presence of primary amines significantly enhanced the surface hydrophilicity refer to fig 1h which leads to the formation of a hydration layer on the membrane surface that acts as a barrier preventing foulant deposition israelachvili and wennerstrom 1996 under this circumstance the anti fouling capability of the grafted membranes was strengthened compared to the control membrane however although excessive loading of primary amine endowed the membrane surface with higher hydrophilicity it would also cause the membrane surface to be positively charged i e iep of ph 8 4 and 8 6 for cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 respectively the ever increasing electrostatic attraction between the positively charged membrane surface and the negatively charged foulants induced aggravating foulant adsorption on the membrane surface and eventually suppressed the strengthened foulant isolation that endowed by the improved membrane surface hydrophilicity which in turn weakened the anti fouling capability of the grafted membranes with excessive primary amine loading besides as shown in fig 3b f the thicknesses of the corresponding fouling layers formed on the membrane surfaces also reveal the severity of fouling under different primary amine loadings the thickest fouling layer formed on the control membrane confirms the most severe fouling and most flux decline for the control membrane fouling layers on the cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 were much thicker than that on the cmpi p0 2 further confirming the adverse impact of the excessive primary amines on membrane fouling 3 4 four round domestic wastewater concentration subsequently a four round domestic wastewater concentration was performed with membrane physically cleaned after every concentration round as shown in fig 4 a the control membrane experienced a rapid decline in water flux to the lowest among all the membranes in the first concentration round r1 for the grafted membranes cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 with excessive primary amine loading exhibited much severer water flux reduction than cmpi p0 2 with moderate primary amine loading these water flux trends are consistent with that in the single round concentration after conducting physical cleaning the water flux of each membrane was partly recovered similar water flux decline trend was observed in r2 r4 in order to investigate the fouling reversibility the initial water fluxes in r2 r4 were normalized to that in r1 fig 4b generally the initial water flux of each membrane in the subsequent concentration round dropped in varying degrees compared to that in last concentration round this indicates the occurrence of irreversible membrane fouling where the foulants are adsorbed on the membrane surface in the form of chemical bonds and cannot be removed by physical cleaning singh et al 2018 specifically the control membrane with the least resistance to membrane fouling experienced the largest initial water flux decline by 8 05 12 54 and 16 95 in r2 r3 and r4 respectively among all the membranes on the contrary the grafted membranes exhibited a much smaller initial water flux decline of less than 3 52 between any two adjacent concentration rounds unexpectedly cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 that featured inferior anti fouling performance conversely possessed higher water flux recovery in r4 97 53 and 97 95 normalized to r1 respectively than that of the cmpi p0 1 and cmpi p0 2 92 27 and 96 33 normalized to r1 respectively suggesting the fouling reversibility of the grafted membranes is enhanced with the primary amine loading the improved fouling reversibility of the primary amine overloaded membranes was further verified by the clsm images of the physically cleaned membrane surfaces after r4 fig 4c g the residual foulants adsorbed on the membrane surfaces reduced as the enhancement in primary amine loading the less hydrophilic surface of the control membrane was liable to foulant adsorption due to the greater hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions meyer et al 2006 meanwhile the positively charged multivalent metal ions were prone to migrating to the negatively charged control membrane surface under electrostatic attraction among the metal ions commonly existed in domestic wastewater ca2 and mg2 were capable of forming complex with the carboxylic groups both on the organic foulants i e protein and humic acid and on the membrane surface mi and elimelech 2008 she et al 2016 thus chemically bridging organic foulants with the membrane surface in this case as illustrated in fig 4h the control membrane surface with abundant carboxylic groups fig s4e suffered severe fouling and weak fouling reversibility on the contrary the introduction of primary amines not only enhanced the membrane surface hydrophilicity but also reduced the carboxylic group density which helps to enhance both the anti fouling capability and fouling reversibility besides the increased surface charge potential of the grafted membranes i e less negative or more positive was beneficial to preventing metal ions from approaching the membrane surface moreover the reduced surface roughness of the grafted membranes refer to fig 1f was also helpful for fouling reduction therefore the grafted membrane with sufficient primary amine loading i e cmpi p0 2 exhibited superior anti fouling capability and fouling reversibility as for the grafted membranes with excessive primary amine loading i e cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 although the overloaded primary amines lead to aggravated foulant adsorption on the membrane surface it also greatly reduced the occurrence of irreversible fouling 3 5 influence of fouling on ammonium rejection the rejection of the tfc fo membranes for ammonium was investigated during the domestic wastewater concentration processes during the single round domestic wastewater concentration fig 5 a the grafted membranes exhibited much higher ammonium rejection generally above 88 87 0 55 than the control membrane 58 37 0 51 it is worth noting that a superior ammonium rejection of 94 83 0 74 was achieved by cmpi p0 2 which is advantageous to the commercial membranes especially the commercial fo membranes see table s3 however when compared to the ammonium rejection for nh4cl solution 50 mg l nh4 n refer to fig 2b under non fouling condition the ammonium rejection for domestic wastewater contained 49 6 0 2 mg l nh4 n was generally lower for all membranes the corresponding ammonium rejection decline caused by fouling fig 5a was closely correlated to the membrane fouling severity refer to fig 3a this indicates that the occurrence of membrane fouling leads to the reduction of ammonium rejection in addition the ammonium rejection of all membranes during four round domestic wastewater concentration process decreased with the progress of feed concentration in all the concentration rounds fig 5b further verifying the transmembrane diffusion of ammonium was enhanced by the occurrence of membrane fouling as for the grafted membranes although the ammonium selectivity evaluated by concentrating pure nh4cl solution refer to fig 2b persistently enhanced with the primary amine loading the ammonium rejection during single round domestic wastewater concentration fig 5a increased first but then unexpectedly decreased with further increasing the primary amine loading which peaked at the cmpi p0 2 with the value of 94 83 0 74 besides it is worth noting in fig 5b that the ammonium rejection of the cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 that featured with excessive primary amine loading was higher than that of the cmpi p0 2 in the initial stage 100 ml cumulative water permeation but then drastically decreased to a level similar to that of the cmpi p0 1 till the end of r1 during four round domestic wastewater concentration this indicates that the advantage of the high ammonium repulsion endowed by the excessive primary amine loading under non fouling or mild fouling conditions will be compromised by the severe membrane fouling above all it is conclusive that the ammonium rejection under fouling conditions was synthetically determined by the ammonium selectivity and anti fouling capability of the membrane as illustrated in fig 5c the intrinsic ammonium selectivity or ammonium repulsive force of the membranes with no or insufficient primary amine loading is weak against the adsorption of ammonium on the membrane surface besides a small amount of primary amine loaded on the membrane surface can hardly alleviate the formation of fouling layer which will further lead to the accumulation of ammonium on the membrane surface by the cecp effect and hence accelerate the transmembrane diffusion of ammonium with the increase in primary amine loading to a moderate level on the membrane surface i e cmpi p0 2 the membrane surface possessed simultaneously enhanced ammonium repulsion and weakened foulants adsorption which synergistically favor the ammonium rejection for domestic wastewater conversely excessive primary amine loading in turn aggravated membrane fouling fig 3a which makes the primary amines be encapsulated and incapacitated by foulants and thus greatly weakens the resistance to the ammonium adsorption onto the membrane surface meanwhile the deteriorated membrane fouling would also enrich ammonium on the membrane surface by the cecp effect under this circumstance the ammonium rejection of the primary amine overloaded membranes i e cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 declines with the addition of redundant primary amines during domestic wastewater concentration similar to the water flux recovery behavior after cleaning the ammonium rejection of each membrane was also recovered to varying degrees with regard to the different primary amine loadings on the membrane surface fig 5b specifically as shown in fig s7 when compared to the ammonium rejection in the initial stage 100 ml cumulative water permeation in r1 the corresponding ammonium rejection of the control membrane varied slightly in r2 r4 less than 0 5 this demonstrates that although the irreversible fouling that formed on the membrane surface exerted additional resistance to both water and ammonium diffusion the ammonium rejection of the control membrane remained nearly unchanged however even suffered much milder irreversible fouling the grafted membranes exhibited larger decline in initial ammonium rejection compared to the control membrane in the same concentration round for one specific grafted membrane since the membrane fouling occurred in the initial stages of each concentration round is mild and indistinctive refer to fig 4a the concentration of the concomitantly enriched ammonium above the membrane surface via cecp effect in the initial stages of each concentration round is also similar therefore the larger decline in ammonium rejection of the grafted membrane in the initial stages of r2 r4 was mainly attributed to the weakened ammonium repulsion this further indicates that the irreversible fouling together with the initial fouling very mild and negligible would encapsulate the pamam dendrimer and thus incapacitate the primary amine on ammonium rejection in this case the primary amine overloaded membranes with greater fouling reversibility i e cmpi p0 5 and cmpi p1 exhibited lower ammonium rejection decline than the other grafted membranes in the initial stages of r2 r4 4 implications this study suggests that the highly anti fouling and ammonium rejecting membranes should meet the following two important criteria firstly the membrane surface should be super hydrophilic to provide strong resistance against fouling secondly the membrane surface should have sufficient positively charged functional groups to provide powerful electrostatic repulsion to the positively charged ammonium ions however excessive introduction of positively charged functional groups will turn the membrane surface to be positively charged and enhance the attraction of negatively charged foulants therefore the competing effects of increased surface charge and hydrophilicity on fouling pose a great challenge for fabricating a membrane with simultaneously enhanced anti fouling capability and ammonium rejection considering that severe fouling will in turn reduce ammonium rejection it is relatively more important to improve anti fouling capability when the ammonium selectivity is not largely sacrificed therefore a promising strategy might be via enhancing the membrane surface hydrophilicity as much as possible while tuning the membrane surface to be slightly negatively charged by introducing more positively charged functional groups as demonstrated in this study surface primary amine functionalization using pamam dendrimer is a promising method for fabricating this type of membranes 5 conclusions in this study pamam grafted tfc membranes were fabricated for wastewater treatment and nutrient enrichment with optimized pamam dendrimer grafting pathway via cmpi mediation an ultra high amount of primary amines can be loaded on the membrane surface by studying the pamam grafted membranes for raw domestic wastewater concentration it is demonstrated that primary amine functionalized membranes have a great potential to mitigate fouling and ammonium transmembrane diffusion this is because the abundant primary amine groups can increase both membrane surface hydrophilicity which can reduce foulant deposition and the surface positive charges via protonation which can increase the electrostatic repulsion to the ammonium ions transporting onto the membrane while the ammonium rejection increased steadily with increasing the primary amine loading on the membrane surface the fouling behavior was competitively influenced by increased surface hydrophilicity and the amount of positively charged groups on the membrane surface in the range of relatively low primary amine loading since the membrane surface is negatively charged membrane fouling behavior is dominated by the surface hydrophilicity thus increasing primary amine loading leads to reduced fouling due to increased hydrophilicity in the range of relatively high primary amine loading membrane surface is positively charged due to substantially increased positively charged groups protonated amine groups which plays a more important role in typical fouling than the increased hydrophilicity thus increasing primary amine loading in this range leads to exacerbated fouling the severe fouling will compromise the ammonium rejection due to the change of original surface property as well as the cake enhanced concentration polarization declaration of competing interest the

17256,improved settleability has become an essential feature of new wastewater treatment innovations to accelerate adoption of such new technologies improved clarifier models are needed to help with designing and predicting improvement in settleability in general the level of mathematics of settling clarifier models has gone far beyond the level of existing experimental methods available to support these models to date even for simple one dimensional 1d clarifier models no experimental method has been described for flocculent settling coefficient rp as a consequence rp cannot be considered as a sludge characteristic and is used as a calibration parameter to achieve observed effluent quality in this study we focused on the development of an empirical function based on a simple and practical experimental approach for the calculation of the rp value from sludge characteristics this approach provided a similar approach as currently taken for hindered settling coefficient calculations veslind equation and allowed for the model to predict effluent quality thus increasing the power of the 1d model the threshold of flocculation tof which describes the collision efficiency of particles directly correlated with the effluent quality of the five tested activated sludge systems and was selected as experimental method the proposed empirical function between tof and rp was validated for four years of validating data with five different sludge types operated under different operational conditions and configurations the good effluent quality prediction with this approach brings us one step closer in making the clarification models more predictive towards effluent quality and clarifier performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords takács model vesilind parameters flocculation secondary clarifier stokesian settling discrete settling 1 introduction a clear trend towards application of intensified and resource efficient technologies has been observed as wastewater treatment plants wwtps are moving towards resource recovery facilities high rate activated sludge processes shortcut nitrogen removal biological phosphorus removal bio p and aerobic granulation are only a few examples of such trending technologies bengtsson et al 2018 bunce et al 2018 you et al 2020 given that current clarifiers are often the largest footprint bottleneck to achieve intensification ekama and marais 2002 improving settleability clarifier capacity and effluent quality has become an essential feature for wwtp of the future until today the flux curve theory kynch 1952 and vesilind equation vesilind 1968 are the basis for design of secondary clarifiers and for determination of the capacity of clarifiers the flux theory was later expanded to include the entire concentration range to be able to predict effluent quality and was implemented in a 10 layers one dimensional 1d clarifier model model as a sum of a double exponential function vs v0 exp rh x v0 exp rp x takács et al 1991 while easy to understand krebs 1995 argued that the current 1d models where too inaccurate to no potential for effluent quality prediction in general as a result of solving the above limitations the level of mathematics of clarifier models has gone far beyond the level of existing experimental methods and measurement quality with which these models are supported de clercq et al 2003a 2008 diehl 2008 griborio 2004 plósz et al 2007 torfs et al 2017 a need for the implementation of clarification settling and compression behavior with measurable parameters over the entire concentration range has been stressed before li and stenstrom 2014a plósz et al 2012 the lack of a measurable parameter for discrete settling was the main reason why effluent quality was calibrated within both 1d and 2d models with the flocculent settling coefficient rp li and stenstrom 2014a plósz et al 2012 the current calibration based approach does not allow for accurate effluent quality prediction for scenarios outside the calibration dataset de clercq et al 2003 li and stenstrom 2014a sin et al 2009 torfs et al 2013b to date no experimental method has been described for rp and thus rp cannot be considered as a sludge characteristic there has been strong evidence that flocculent settling was the main settling regime in clarifiers driving clarifier performance and hindered settling only occurred during clarifier failure kinnear 2002 mancell egala et al 2016 it is therefore logical that no clear correlation between effluent quality and the current conventional settling parameters such as sludge volume index svi and vesilind parameters which are all based on non stokesian settling hindered and compression settling existed mancell egala et al 2017b moreover ekama et al 1997 stated that computational fluid dynamic models that incorporated current conventional measurements failed to determine the true clarifier capacity it is clear that a direct simple and practical experimental method linked to stokesian settling discrete and flocculent settling would be essential to estimate clarifier performance and effluent quality moreover the ability to predict effluent quality based on a measurable property would allow for extrapolation of technology implementation results of one wwtp to another the latter will help to understand impact of new technologies and accelerate their implementation in practice the threshold of flocculation tof method was developed by mancell egala et al 2017a building further on the core work of griborio 2004 measuring the transition from discrete to flocculent settling with a more reproducible mechanistic approach tof describes the minimum solids concentration needed to get a significant formation of flocs settling with a velocity larger than 1 5 m h within a settling time of 2 minutes the latter boundary conditions were determined based on testing with a broad range of activated sludge systems including hybrid and granular systems allowing the confidence of providing enough sensitivity throughout different applications mancell egala et al 2017a tof can easily and routinely be measured by plant operators by performing a series of sludge dilution in a batch settling experiment in addition tof is directly linked to the collision efficiency and attachment of particles and is thus dependent on the non settling fraction particle charge particle density particle size extracellular polymeric substances eps characteristics etc mancell egala et al 2017a rahman et al 2016 van winckel et al 2019 in this study our focus was the development of a simple experimental approach based on the gravimetrical flocculation behavior of activated sludge tof value for the measurement of the flocculent settling coefficient rp value conventionally used as a model calibration parameter an equation to calculate the flocculation settling coefficient rp based on tof measurements from full scale sludge samples was developed similar to the non stokesian settling regime which uses the vesilind equation to calculate the vesilind parameters prediction of effluent quality using the 1d takács model with incorporation of the calculated rp values was validated on a full scale high rate activated sludge system two secondary treatment systems and two biological nitrogen removal systems this approach brings us one step closer in making the clarification models more predictive towards effluent quality and clarifier performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated systems studied blue plains advanced wastewater

mlss return activated sludge ras solids and effluent suspended solids ess were collected at the plant on daily basis twenty four hour solids and flow data were used to determine the mass balance quality for the day of sampling only when the solids mass balance was within 30 error the clarifier operation was considered stable for the 24 hour period and the grab sample for settling measurements was considered representative this threshold mass balance represented about 60 of the overall data set and was similar to previously reported mass balance errors from practice majewsky et al 2013 puig et al 2008 all the experiments were performed within two hours of sampling mixed liquor samples to avoid the change of active biomass properties the long periods of sampling up to four years allowed to capture seasonal changes in sludge characteristics and operational conditions secondary east secondary west and bnr1 systems were used as the training data used for developing the rp tof equation the specific periods of sampling were from november 2016 to july 2017 validation of the proposed rp calculation approach was done based on data from secondary east november 2014 to september 2018 secondary west november 2014 to september 2018 hras february 2015 to july 2015 bnr1 november 2014 to september 2018 and bnr2 june to july 2018 2 3 tof and floc strength factor measurements the tof parameter was determined by the method described in mancell egala et al 2017a six to eight batches of different target tss concentration within flocculent settling regime 20 to 1000 mg tss l were prepared with maximum 25 mg tss l differences between dilutions below 200 mg tss l and 50 mg tss l differences above 200 mg tss l this resulted in a maximum error in tof of 25 50 mg tss l using a funnel 4 l of sludge from each batch was added to a modified graduated cylinder acquired from thermo scientifictm nalgenetm volume 4 l diameter 0 1 m designed to have two ports at 5 cm depth the sludge was given 2 min for settling time resulting in a selection for a critical settling velocity csv of 1 5 m h the tof parameter was determined by the initial tss concentration at which a significant removal of tss over the top 5 cm of the column was achieved under the settling conditions applied the shear resistance of flocs was measured based on the method described by leentvaar and rebhun 1983 experimental adjustments were made to apply the method into a similar modified graduated cylinder as used for tof measurement in addition the units of the shear resistance further referred to as floc strength factor were adjusted to more directly link to settling velocities as proposed in van winckel et al 2019 to measure the floc strength factor sludge samples were diluted into a batch target tss concentration lower than the tof concentration 300 mg tss l in practice reactors and channels to the clarifier were typically operated under suboptimal hydrodynamic shear with recorded shear rate g at around 20 s 1 parker et al 2001 thus in this method flocs were exposed a wide range of shear rates from 20 to 320 s 1 to capture the shift from growth and breakage of flocs applying the same tof settling column above 4 l of sludge was exposed different shear rates g ranging from 20 to 320 s 1 rates using ika eurostar 60 control stirrer and two impeller mixer at a constant mixing time of 10 min similar setup used by van winckel et al 2019 after stirring and thus orthokinetic flocculation the sludge was allowed to settle during 2 min and sample was collected at the top 5 cm of settling column at csv of 1 5 m h the floc strength factor was calculated as the absolute slope expressing the loss of the fraction of biomass 1 5 m h in relation to the g force s 1 increase applied a smaller absolute slope number and thus lower floc strength factor indicated a higher the shear resistance 2 4 non stokesian settling measurements flux curve analysis was performed to determine the vesilind parameters and to characterize hindered settling of each sludge including maximum settling velocity v0 and hinder settling coefficient rh vesilind 1968 sludge types were diluted into five different target tss concentrations within hinder settling regime 3500 5000 mg tss l after which they were poured into five settling columns height 1 5 m diameter 0 1 m as described in detail in mancell egala et al 2017b the change of height of the solid liquid interface was gathered versus time to develop the flux curve sludge volume index svi and initial settling velocity isv were determined at 3 5 g tss l in a nalgene two liters settleometer according to standard methods apha 2005 svi5 and svi30 were calculated based on the height of solid liquid at 5 min and 30 min apha 2005 tss was measured based on standard method apha 2005 the limit of stokesian settling loss coefficient identified the sludge concentration where flocculent settling stokesian settling transitioned into hindered settling non stokesian settling and was measured according to mancell egala et al 2016 to detect the loss the initial concentration must start at high sludge concentration suggested as 3500 mg tss l a series of dilutions were made with the maximum gap between dilutions of 100 mg tss l using process water two litter of sample was placed into a nalgene settleometer and a backlight was set up to identify the settling behavior easier after slightly mixing a baffle was used to deplete the energy and allow for settling to occur settling was observed visually during hindered settling a clear interface between liquid and solid can be easily visualized loss was the highest concentration observing no interface 2 5 modeling approach a 1d layer clarifier model was used based on the solid flux and mass balance concept takács et al 1991 only data points in which the mass balance error over the full scale clarifier was within 30 error were taken into consideration for development of the rp measurement equation to avoid interferences of sludge blanket changes rain events dynamics etc the clarification model used in this work was a modified takács model including a double exponential from the original model takács et al 1991 with a third exponential term empirically avoiding overprediction of the ras concentrations due to compression figure s1a default values for boundary settling velocity v0 270 m d and compression boundary xcompron 6000 mg tss l and compression settling coefficient rcompr 0 5 l g tss were used as given in the sumo software triple exponential layered clarifier model dynamita 2017 sensitivity analysis of these parameters were done at the end of the study to define their impact on the achieved results fig s1 there is no standard experimental method to measure non settling fraction xmin thus xmin was defined as 25 of the average effluent suspended solids ess of the ten lowest ess numbers for that system as xmin was different for each system and periods studied a correction of tof for xmin was done to eliminate its impact the measured vesilind parameters v0 and rh were used to calibrate model s underflow flux based on flux curve experiment vesilind 1968 to calibrate the model fully the flocculation coefficient rp was used as a fitting parameter to match the model s predicted effluent suspended solids ess with the measured plant ess the workflow for model calibration is given in fig 3a after establishing an empirical relationship between tof and the rp value gathered from model calibration workflow fig 3a validation of this equation was done by comparing the model output using a calculated rp fig 3b with the conventional rp estimated from conventional calibration fig 3a 3 results a comparison of the operational conditions of the tested systems and the average settling parameters are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively this study covered a wide range of srt 1 5 25 days surface overflow rates sor 0 6 1 85 m3 m2 h solids loading rates slr 39 5 117 kg tss m2 d and resulting effluent suspended solids ess 2 47 mg tss l table 1 it was hypothesized that testing the proposed ess prediction approach on a wide range of flocculant systems will increase the chance for a global applicability 3 1 tof describes clarifier performance the conventional settling parameters are listed in table 2 east and west secondary high rate sludge settling performance were poorest with a higher svi30 compared to the bnr1 system low rate table 2 increased loss concentrations were observed when decreased svi30 levels were measured the loss concentration of bnr1 was slightly higher than east and west secondary systems indicating that east and west secondary sludge systems had slightly lower settling velocities compared to against bnr1 system and lower clarifier capacity table 2 the latter related well with vesilind paramters v0 and rh showing that bnr1 sludge under hindered conditions settled faster than east and west secondary with higher vesilind parameters table 2 overall bnr1 sludge had better hindered settling behavior in comparison to east and west secondary sludge systems this linked well to clarifier performance showing that the bnr1 system achieved good ess around 6 08 2 59 mg tss l while the east and west secondary systems had poorer ess around 31 5 15 1 and 17 7 4 45 mg tss l respectively in addition no good correlation between svi30 svi5 svi30 vesilind parameters rh v0 and loss with ess was found r2 0 4 fig 1 thus current conventional settling parameters could not describe the clarifier performance which was mostly driven by flocculent settling behavior in addition no good correlation between svi30 and tof was found fig 1h a similar trend was found for validating data of east and west secondary systems and the bnr1 system table 2 furthermore the hras system high rate had similar settling properties as east and west secondary systems but the hras system had the highest svi30 128 ml g tss this illustrated that hras flocs cannot compact well the bnr2 low rate system sludge had good flocculation behavior with a tof at 184 mg tss l and it was thus similar to the bnr1 system table 2 however the bnr2 system had the highest rh value measured at 0 68 0 13 l g tss and lowest svi30 thus bnr2 had the highest fraction of fast settling and compact flocs of all studied systems in contrast to the non stokesian parameters tof demonstrated a strong linear correlation with ess r2 0 905 for the full data set including all three systems fig 2 a east and west secondary systems were high rate activated sludge processes operated at short srt high rate system table 1 resulting in higher ess and higher tof values 598 219 mg tss l and 358 113 mg tss l for east and west secondary systems respectively table 2 while bnr1 system achieved a good collision efficiency resulting in significantly lower tof 133 38 mg tss l and lower ess table 1 2 overall all the validating data fell quite well within 95 prediction interval except for the east secondary system during 2018 fig 2b during 2018 the east secondary clarifiers were operated under a significantly high sor at 1 85 0 145 m3 m2 h and slr at 117 16 6 kg tss m2 d which was 1 54 and 1 68 times higher than regular sor and slr respectively the latter might explain why this data fell outside the 95 prediction interval floc shear resistance measured as floc strength factor indicated that the bnr1 system had strong flocs with a floc strength factor of 0 328 0 059 tss s while east and west secondary systems had weak flocs with floc strength factors of 0 873 0 315 and 0 629 0 131 tss s respectively however collision efficiency tof and shear resistance floc strength factor could not be measured independently leading to a correlation between tof and floc strength factor fig 1i sludge types with high collision efficiency low tof could restore from sludge breakup as a result of shear more rapidly leading to smaller floc strength factors due to the lack of independence of the parameters only tof measurements were used for description of flocculation setting behavior in validation data sets 3 2 development of empirical rp calculation based on tof the experimental data set was split up in a training set used to build the empirical function and a validation set used to validate the function built the workflow for the training data november 2016 june 2017 is shown in fig 3 the flocculation rate coefficients rp were derived from the calibration of the 1d modified takács model to fit the measured plant ess for all points of the training data set the quality of the model calibration is shown in fig 4 measured ess and model results for ess were a perfect match as a result of rp calibration fig 4a modeled ras concentrations were a result of measured vesilind parameters and represented measured ras concentrations well fig 4b using rp data from the latter model calibrations a strong power function existed between rp and measured ess with r2 of 0 96 the power function was a result of the takács model structure and therefore independent of the settling characteristics fig 5 a due to the power function relationship between rp and ess and the linear relationship between ess and tof fig 2 a power relationship was expected between tof and rp fig 5b shows the empirical relationship between rp from the calibration approach using the training data set and measured tof values corrected for non settling solids xmin with r2 0 87 note that all three systems nicely fit on the same function and cover a broad range of tof values 50 900 mg tss l in addition the 95 confidence and prediction interval of the achieved equation is shown in fig 5b fig 6 a b c and d show the strength of correlation between predicted and measured rp and predicted and measured ess for the training data set 3 3 validation of the rp tof function experimental data for east west and bnr1 systems from a later period july 2017 october 2017 with similar operational conditions was used to validate the empirical function in addition two new systems hras and bnr2 were used to validate the empirical function for a broader range of operational conditions table 1 and settling properties table 2 fig 6c shows the model calibrated rp versus the calculated rp based on the proposed empirical function rp 2 96 tof xmin 1 154 achieved from the training data fig 5b fig 6d shows the predicted effluent solids versus the measured effluent solids for the validation data overall the predicted effluent quality of the validation data fell well within 95 prediction intervals determined by the training data data from the two new systems hras and bnr2 were equally well predicted compared to the east east 2018 west and bnr1 systems 3 4 sensitivity analysis of proposed model approach the impact of the non settling suspended solids concentration xmin was taken care of by correcting the tof value for xmin thus allowing to include different systems with different xmin impacts table 2 no impact of the boundary settling velocity above 200 m d figure s1c which was lower than measured velocities mancell egala 2017b and the default value of 270 m d was observed on calculated versus calibrated rp figure s1c empirical compensation for compression figure s1a was kept constant within this study as no experimental methods for calibration were available the compression behavior mainly determined the sludge blanket dynamics and not the effluent quality when a clarifier operated below its failure rate therefore the proposed experimental determination of rp based on tof will hold true even after more detailed incorporation of compression behavior figure s1b lastly steady state model runs were performed for all tested days during training and validation assuming stable operation of the systems we excluded measurement days with tss mass balance errors based on 24 hour composite tss samples over the clarifiers above 30 as this would indicate more dynamic behavior potentially sludge blanket height changes significant wasting changes and dramatical sludge property changes etc based on the prediction interval shown in fig 6b ess prediction errors for certain training data points were quite significant with absolute prediction errors up to 10 mg tss l figure s1d when taking into account three days instead of one day mass balance errors thus including the day before settling tests the day of settling tests error 30 and the day after the settling tests data points with an average 3 day mass balance errors above 20 resulted in increased prediction errors figure s1d the errors were mainly caused by significant changes in wasting flow rates for several hours due to process limitations in the biosolids facility resulting in the needs to hold more sludge in the activated sludge systems or start wasting at increased rates in a later stage dynamic simulation of these events could potentially lead to decreases in prediction errors 4 discussion 4 1 settling methods for clarifier performance monitoring with discrete and flocculant settling being the dominant settling regimes in full scale clarifiers mancell egala et al 2016 it was not a surprise that in this study no correlation was found between any conventional settling parameter and effluent quality fig 1 this was similar to previous reports kinnear 2002 mancell egala et al 2017b the transition parameter loss showed no clear correlation with ess fig 1c indicating a disconnect between hindered settling and compression characteristics and flocculant settling properties for example pin point flocs characterized by high tof thus leading to high ess can show good hindered settling and compression properties due to lower charge interactions and thus better compression van winckel et al 2019 thus tof and loss provided independent information flocculation properties in this study were characterized by tof and the floc strength factor van winckel et al 2019 and jarvis et al 2005 indicated the importance of understanding floc strength as hydrodynamic conditions impact floc growth and flocs break up however the tof parameter already described the intrinsic characteristics of the floc determining collision efficiency mancell egala et al 2017a and floc strength could not be determined independently correlation factor r2 0 576 only tof was used to describe flocculation properties a strong correlation between tof and ess was observed for stably operating systems mass balance error below 30 similar trend of lower tof leading to lower ess although not in such clear linear correlation was observed before for high rate contact stabilization systems rahman et al 2016 and full scale secondary systems mancell egala et al 2017b the weaker correlation observed in mancell egala et al 2017b can be explained by two factors i this study determined tof up to a precision of 50 mg tss l and measured tof as low as 20 mg tss l rather than a minimum of 100 mg tss l as described by mancell egala et al 2017b ii mancell egala et al 2017b did not exclude data points with large mass balance errors no steady state check therefore the 24 hour composite ess level might not reflect ess conditions during the grab sampling for tof in addition the 24 hour composite ess sample was taken using a constant pumping flow rate rather than dynamic with influent flow this supported the mass balance cleaning approach to exclude highly dynamic days especially in combination with steady state clarifier modeling in systems such as hras east and west with srt 2 days and a large overall tof range 56 904 mg tss l it was hypothesized that flocculation properties might be dynamic over 24 hours due to dynamics in loading rates and srt flocculation limitations have been correlated before with low protein pn to polysaccharide ps ratio in the eps li and yang 2007 van winckel et al 2019 high organic loading rate barbusiński and kościelniak 1995 low srt rahman et al 2017 temperature and unfavorable wastewater characteristics roberts and olsson 1975 to date the overall link between the sludge composition and clarifier performance is unclear however this study for the first times shows a clear link between flocculation properties described by tof and ess the measurement of tof as a regular operational sludge property in wwtp could provide valuable information on flocculation property changes and could explain ess dynamics unlike conventional practice of measuring svi 4 2 clarifier prediction versus clarifier calibration a wide range of settling characteristics from bad settling systems east west and hras to good settling systems bnr1 and bnr2 was covered within training and validation data sets table 2 the high dynamics in operational and loading conditions witthin the hras system east secondary system and west secondary system resulted in a wide range of tof xmin values 97 904 mg tss l subsequent wide range of rp 0 022 0 00098 l mg tss and thus ess 5 56 mg tss l figs 5 6 in contrast brn1 and brn2 systems were operated at a longer srt systems low rate system producing more stable and compact flocs in comparison to the short srt systems high rate mancell egala et al 2017b and thus recorded a higher range of rp 0 004 to 0 037 l mg tss and a lower range of ess 2 to 11 mg tss l the broad range of rp values recorded in this study were within the range from previously reported systems li and stenstrom 2014b plósz et al 2007 takacs et al 1991 vlasschaert 2013 overall due to long time data collection four years different seasons operational conditions loading rate and srt fluctuations were covered within this study table 1 this wide and large data set from full scale systems avoided system specificity of the developed empirical rp calculation indeed the proposed empirical function rp 2 96 tof xmin 1 158 r2 0 87 allowed for good prediction of ess for all data sets tested this highlighted that the tof measurements provided clear intrinsic floc property information that was directly relevant to clarification from previous studies flocculent settling was suggested as the critical settling regime in under loaded clarifier kinnear 2002 mancell egala et al 2017b and thus flocculation kinetic changes might significantly impact effluent quality it should be highlighted that the general correlation between tof and ess was not maintained when clarifier hydraulics were changed outside a certain range in this case sor 1 85 m3 m2 h see east system 2018 fig 2b the latter indicated the impact of sor on effluent quality depending on the floc settling velocity distribution van winckel et al in review however the tof measurement was able to capture the floc characteristics well and led to an estimation of low rp value fig 6c as a result despite being an outlier in fig 6d ess was well predicted by the clarifier model and calculated rp the latter confirmed the power of tof measurements to capture floc characteristics given the approach of steady state clarifier modeling using 24 hour composite tss data but with grab sample based settling data a significant impact of clarifier dynamics was observed when only looking into avoiding a mass balance error less than 30 an average ess prediction error of 3 8 3 18 mg tss l was observed figure s1d it should be noted that part of this error could have been associated with tof measurement errors for tof values below 200 mg tss l tof was determined with 25 mg tss l precision leading to maximum ess prediction errors of about 1 49 0 15 mg tss l figure s2b for tof numbers above 200 mg tss l ess prediction errors were maintained at a maximum of 4 17 0 39 mg tss l although tof measurement had a lower precision of 50 mg tss l figure s2b prediction power was acceptable when compared to the poor ess prediction of calibrated clarifier models outside the calibration data set de clercq et al 2003 li and stenstrom 2014b sin et al 2009 torfs et al 2013b the proposed experimental approach for determination of rp formed an analogue approach to the calculation of vesilind parameter rh v0 for the hindered settling zone generally the empirical function for hindered settling has been accepted well in practice li and stenstrom 2014a therefore we believe that the proposed similar approach for the flocculation regime will find adoption in practice especially when seeking clarifier performance predictions for technology implementation for which tof target values are known however without general adoption of tof measurements and thus known targets for tof for different technologies or operational changes the lack of connection between the clarifier model and the process model hampers prediction of settling changes the next step should therefore include to connect the tof parameter changes to sludge composition changes that are driven by operational condition changes in addition further validation on other full scale systems will help to refine the empirical equation and optimize ess prediction errors over a wide range of conditions and systems 5 conclusion in this study we focused on the development of an empirical function based on a simple and practical experimental approach for the calculation of the rp value from sludge characteristics this approach provided a similar approach as currently taken for hindered settling coefficient calculations vesilind equation and allowed for the model to predict effluent quality thus increasing the power of the 1d clarifier model the threshold of flocculation tof directly correlated with the effluent quality of the five tested activated sludge systems and was selected as experimental method to develop an empirical function to calculate rp the proposed empirical function between tof and rp was validated for a wide range of sludge types which operated under different operational conditions and configurations this novel approach adds mechanistic meaning to the rp value conventionally used as calibration parameter and brings us one step closer to a practical approach for enhancing the predictive power of

17256,improved settleability has become an essential feature of new wastewater treatment innovations to accelerate adoption of such new technologies improved clarifier models are needed to help with designing and predicting improvement in settleability in general the level of mathematics of settling clarifier models has gone far beyond the level of existing experimental methods available to support these models to date even for simple one dimensional 1d clarifier models no experimental method has been described for flocculent settling coefficient rp as a consequence rp cannot be considered as a sludge characteristic and is used as a calibration parameter to achieve observed effluent quality in this study we focused on the development of an empirical function based on a simple and practical experimental approach for the calculation of the rp value from sludge characteristics this approach provided a similar approach as currently taken for hindered settling coefficient calculations veslind equation and allowed for the model to predict effluent quality thus increasing the power of the 1d model the threshold of flocculation tof which describes the collision efficiency of particles directly correlated with the effluent quality of the five tested activated sludge systems and was selected as experimental method the proposed empirical function between tof and rp was validated for four years of validating data with five different sludge types operated under different operational conditions and configurations the good effluent quality prediction with this approach brings us one step closer in making the clarification models more predictive towards effluent quality and clarifier performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords takács model vesilind parameters flocculation secondary clarifier stokesian settling discrete settling 1 introduction a clear trend towards application of intensified and resource efficient technologies has been observed as wastewater treatment plants wwtps are moving towards resource recovery facilities high rate activated sludge processes shortcut nitrogen removal biological phosphorus removal bio p and aerobic granulation are only a few examples of such trending technologies bengtsson et al 2018 bunce et al 2018 you et al 2020 given that current clarifiers are often the largest footprint bottleneck to achieve intensification ekama and marais 2002 improving settleability clarifier capacity and effluent quality has become an essential feature for wwtp of the future until today the flux curve theory kynch 1952 and vesilind equation vesilind 1968 are the basis for design of secondary clarifiers and for determination of the capacity of clarifiers the flux theory was later expanded to include the entire concentration range to be able to predict effluent quality and was implemented in a 10 layers one dimensional 1d clarifier model model as a sum of a double exponential function vs v0 exp rh x v0 exp rp x takács et al 1991 while easy to understand krebs 1995 argued that the current 1d models where too inaccurate to no potential for effluent quality prediction in general as a result of solving the above limitations the level of mathematics of clarifier models has gone far beyond the level of existing experimental methods and measurement quality with which these models are supported de clercq et al 2003a 2008 diehl 2008 griborio 2004 plósz et al 2007 torfs et al 2017 a need for the implementation of clarification settling and compression behavior with measurable parameters over the entire concentration range has been stressed before li and stenstrom 2014a plósz et al 2012 the lack of a measurable parameter for discrete settling was the main reason why effluent quality was calibrated within both 1d and 2d models with the flocculent settling coefficient rp li and stenstrom 2014a plósz et al 2012 the current calibration based approach does not allow for accurate effluent quality prediction for scenarios outside the calibration dataset de clercq et al 2003 li and stenstrom 2014a sin et al 2009 torfs et al 2013b to date no experimental method has been described for rp and thus rp cannot be considered as a sludge characteristic there has been strong evidence that flocculent settling was the main settling regime in clarifiers driving clarifier performance and hindered settling only occurred during clarifier failure kinnear 2002 mancell egala et al 2016 it is therefore logical that no clear correlation between effluent quality and the current conventional settling parameters such as sludge volume index svi and vesilind parameters which are all based on non stokesian settling hindered and compression settling existed mancell egala et al 2017b moreover ekama et al 1997 stated that computational fluid dynamic models that incorporated current conventional measurements failed to determine the true clarifier capacity it is clear that a direct simple and practical experimental method linked to stokesian settling discrete and flocculent settling would be essential to estimate clarifier performance and effluent quality moreover the ability to predict effluent quality based on a measurable property would allow for extrapolation of technology implementation results of one wwtp to another the latter will help to understand impact of new technologies and accelerate their implementation in practice the threshold of flocculation tof method was developed by mancell egala et al 2017a building further on the core work of griborio 2004 measuring the transition from discrete to flocculent settling with a more reproducible mechanistic approach tof describes the minimum solids concentration needed to get a significant formation of flocs settling with a velocity larger than 1 5 m h within a settling time of 2 minutes the latter boundary conditions were determined based on testing with a broad range of activated sludge systems including hybrid and granular systems allowing the confidence of providing enough sensitivity throughout different applications mancell egala et al 2017a tof can easily and routinely be measured by plant operators by performing a series of sludge dilution in a batch settling experiment in addition tof is directly linked to the collision efficiency and attachment of particles and is thus dependent on the non settling fraction particle charge particle density particle size extracellular polymeric substances eps characteristics etc mancell egala et al 2017a rahman et al 2016 van winckel et al 2019 in this study our focus was the development of a simple experimental approach based on the gravimetrical flocculation behavior of activated sludge tof value for the measurement of the flocculent settling coefficient rp value conventionally used as a model calibration parameter an equation to calculate the flocculation settling coefficient rp based on tof measurements from full scale sludge samples was developed similar to the non stokesian settling regime which uses the vesilind equation to calculate the vesilind parameters prediction of effluent quality using the 1d takács model with incorporation of the calculated rp values was validated on a full scale high rate activated sludge system two secondary treatment systems and two biological nitrogen removal systems this approach brings us one step closer in making the clarification models more predictive towards effluent quality and clarifier performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated systems studied blue plains advanced wastewater treatment plant awwtp dc water is one of the largest advanced sewage treatment plants in the world treating over 1 1 million cubic meters of sewage per day and serving the district of columbia and parts of maryland and virginia in the usa three full scale activated sludge systems at the blue plains awwtp consist of secondary east 1 2 day srt secondary west 1 2 day srt and a biological nutrient removal system bnr1 20 25 day srt the waste activated sludge from the bnr1 system was bioaugmented solely into the secondary east system before september 2016 and was added in equal amounts to both secondary east and west afterwards bioaugmentation of bnr1 sludge in the secondary systems was applied to allow for some nitrogen removal to improve sorption of colloids and effluent quality and to improve oxygen transfer rates in the secondary system bailey jr et al 2008 the main difference for the secondary west system before september 2016 was that this system was operated as a complete independent high rate secondary system the latter conditions were highlighted within the validation data as a new system referred to as high rate activated sludge hras alexandria renew enterprises is an advanced water resource recovery public utility in alexandria virginia usa for this study the biological nitrogen removal system bnr2 was operated at 15 20 days srt the specific operational conditions and settling characteristics of each systems are compiled in tables 1 and 2 2 2 training and validation data collection twenty four hour composite samples for mixed liquor suspended solids mlss return activated sludge ras solids and effluent suspended solids ess were collected at the plant on daily basis twenty four hour solids and flow data were used to determine the mass balance quality for the day of sampling only when the solids mass balance was within 30 error the clarifier operation was considered stable for the 24 hour period and the grab sample for settling measurements was considered representative this threshold mass balance represented about 60 of the overall data set and was similar to previously reported mass balance errors from practice majewsky et al 2013 puig et al 2008 all the experiments were performed within two hours of sampling mixed liquor samples to avoid the change of active biomass properties the long periods of sampling up to four years allowed to capture seasonal changes in sludge characteristics and operational conditions secondary east secondary west and bnr1 systems were used as the training data used for developing the rp tof equation the specific periods of sampling were from november 2016 to july 2017 validation of the proposed rp calculation approach was done based on data from secondary east november 2014 to september 2018 secondary west november 2014 to september 2018 hras february 2015 to july 2015 bnr1 november 2014 to september 2018 and bnr2 june to july 2018 2 3 tof and floc strength factor measurements the tof parameter was determined by the method described in mancell egala et al 2017a six to eight batches of different target tss concentration within flocculent settling regime 20 to 1000 mg tss l were prepared with maximum 25 mg tss l differences between dilutions below 200 mg tss l and 50 mg tss l differences above 200 mg tss l this resulted in a maximum error in tof of 25 50 mg tss l using a funnel 4 l of sludge from each batch was added to a modified graduated cylinder acquired from thermo scientifictm nalgenetm volume 4 l diameter 0 1 m designed to have two ports at 5 cm depth the sludge was given 2 min for settling time resulting in a selection for a critical settling velocity csv of 1 5 m h the tof parameter was determined by the initial tss concentration at which a significant removal of tss over the top 5 cm of the column was achieved under the settling conditions applied the shear resistance of flocs was measured based on the method described by leentvaar and rebhun 1983 experimental adjustments were made to apply the method into a similar modified graduated cylinder as used for tof measurement in addition the units of the shear resistance further referred to as floc strength factor were adjusted to more directly link to settling velocities as proposed in van winckel et al 2019 to measure the floc strength factor sludge samples were diluted into a batch target tss concentration lower than the tof concentration 300 mg tss l in practice reactors and channels to the clarifier were typically operated under suboptimal hydrodynamic shear with recorded shear rate g at around 20 s 1 parker et al 2001 thus in this method flocs were exposed a wide range of shear rates from 20 to 320 s 1 to capture the shift from growth and breakage of flocs applying the same tof settling column above 4 l of sludge was exposed different shear rates g ranging from 20 to 320 s 1 rates using ika eurostar 60 control stirrer and two impeller mixer at a constant mixing time of 10 min similar setup used by van winckel et al 2019 after stirring and thus orthokinetic flocculation the sludge was allowed to settle during 2 min and sample was collected at the top 5 cm of settling column at csv of 1 5 m h the floc strength factor was calculated as the absolute slope expressing the loss of the fraction of biomass 1 5 m h in relation to the g force s 1 increase applied a smaller absolute slope number and thus lower floc strength factor indicated a higher the shear resistance 2 4 non stokesian settling measurements flux curve analysis was performed to determine the vesilind parameters and to characterize hindered settling of each sludge including maximum settling velocity v0 and hinder settling coefficient rh vesilind 1968 sludge types were diluted into five different target tss concentrations within hinder settling regime 3500 5000 mg tss l after which they were poured into five settling columns height 1 5 m diameter 0 1 m as described in detail in mancell egala et al 2017b the change of height of the solid liquid interface was gathered versus time to develop the flux curve sludge volume index svi and initial settling velocity isv were determined at 3 5 g tss l in a nalgene two liters settleometer according to standard methods apha 2005 svi5 and svi30 were calculated based on the height of solid liquid at 5 min and 30 min apha 2005 tss was measured based on standard method apha 2005 the limit of stokesian settling loss coefficient identified the sludge concentration where flocculent settling stokesian settling transitioned into hindered settling non stokesian settling and was measured according to mancell egala et al 2016 to detect the loss the initial concentration must start at high sludge concentration suggested as 3500 mg tss l a series of dilutions were made with the maximum gap between dilutions of 100 mg tss l using process water two litter of sample was placed into a nalgene settleometer and a backlight was set up to identify the settling behavior easier after slightly mixing a baffle was used to deplete the energy and allow for settling to occur settling was observed visually during hindered settling a clear interface between liquid and solid can be easily visualized loss was the highest concentration observing no interface 2 5 modeling approach a 1d layer clarifier model was used based on the solid flux and mass balance concept takács et al 1991 only data points in which the mass balance error over the full scale clarifier was within 30 error were taken into consideration for development of the rp measurement equation to avoid interferences of sludge blanket changes rain events dynamics etc the clarification model used in this work was a modified takács model including a double exponential from the original model takács et al 1991 with a third exponential term empirically avoiding overprediction of the ras concentrations due to compression figure s1a default values for boundary settling velocity v0 270 m d and compression boundary xcompron 6000 mg tss l and compression settling coefficient rcompr 0 5 l g tss were used as given in the sumo software triple exponential layered clarifier model dynamita 2017 sensitivity analysis of these parameters were done at the end of the study to define their impact on the achieved results fig s1 there is no standard experimental method to measure non settling fraction xmin thus xmin was defined as 25 of the average effluent suspended solids ess of the ten lowest ess numbers for that system as xmin was different for each system and periods studied a correction of tof for xmin was done to eliminate its impact the measured vesilind parameters v0 and rh were used to calibrate model s underflow flux based on flux curve experiment vesilind 1968 to calibrate the model fully the flocculation coefficient rp was used as a fitting parameter to match the model s predicted effluent suspended solids ess with the measured plant ess the workflow for model calibration is given in fig 3a after establishing an empirical relationship between tof and the rp value gathered from model calibration workflow fig 3a validation of this equation was done by comparing the model output using a calculated rp fig 3b with the conventional rp estimated from conventional calibration fig 3a 3 results a comparison of the operational conditions of the tested systems and the average settling parameters are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively this study covered a wide range of srt 1 5 25 days surface overflow rates sor 0 6 1 85 m3 m2 h solids loading rates slr 39 5 117 kg tss m2 d and resulting effluent suspended solids ess 2 47 mg tss l table 1 it was hypothesized that testing the proposed ess prediction approach on a wide range of flocculant systems will increase the chance for a global applicability 3 1 tof describes clarifier performance the conventional settling parameters are listed in table 2 east and west secondary high rate sludge settling performance were poorest with a higher svi30 compared to the bnr1 system low rate table 2 increased loss concentrations were observed when decreased svi30 levels were measured the loss concentration of bnr1 was slightly higher than east and west secondary systems indicating that east and west secondary sludge systems had slightly lower settling velocities compared to against bnr1 system and lower clarifier capacity table 2 the latter related well with vesilind paramters v0 and rh showing that bnr1 sludge under hindered conditions settled faster than east and west secondary with higher vesilind parameters table 2 overall bnr1 sludge had better hindered settling behavior in comparison to east and west secondary sludge systems this linked well to clarifier performance showing that the bnr1 system achieved good ess around 6 08 2 59 mg tss l while the east and west secondary systems had poorer ess around 31 5 15 1 and 17 7 4 45 mg tss l respectively in addition no good correlation between svi30 svi5 svi30 vesilind parameters rh v0 and loss with ess was found r2 0 4 fig 1 thus current conventional settling parameters could not describe the clarifier performance which was mostly driven by flocculent settling behavior in addition no good correlation between svi30 and tof was found fig 1h a similar trend was found for validating data of east and west secondary systems and the bnr1 system table 2 furthermore the hras system high rate had similar settling properties as east and west secondary systems but the hras system had the highest svi30 128 ml g tss this illustrated that hras flocs cannot compact well the bnr2 low rate system sludge had good flocculation behavior with a tof at 184 mg tss l and it was thus similar to the bnr1 system table 2 however the bnr2 system had the highest rh value measured at 0 68 0 13 l g tss and lowest svi30 thus bnr2 had the highest fraction of fast settling and compact flocs of all studied systems in contrast to the non stokesian parameters tof demonstrated a strong linear correlation with ess r2 0 905 for the full data set including all three systems fig 2 a east and west secondary systems were high rate activated sludge processes operated at short srt high rate system table 1 resulting in higher ess and higher tof values 598 219 mg tss l and 358 113 mg tss l for east and west secondary systems respectively table 2 while bnr1 system achieved a good collision efficiency resulting in significantly lower tof 133 38 mg tss l and lower ess table 1 2 overall all the validating data fell quite well within 95 prediction interval except for the east secondary system during 2018 fig 2b during 2018 the east secondary clarifiers were operated under a significantly high sor at 1 85 0 145 m3 m2 h and slr at 117 16 6 kg tss m2 d which was 1 54 and 1 68 times higher than regular sor and slr respectively the latter might explain why this data fell outside the 95 prediction interval floc shear resistance measured as floc strength factor indicated that the bnr1 system had strong flocs with a floc strength factor of 0 328 0 059 tss s while east and west secondary systems had weak flocs with floc strength factors of 0 873 0 315 and 0 629 0 131 tss s respectively however collision efficiency tof and shear resistance floc strength factor could not be measured independently leading to a correlation between tof and floc strength factor fig 1i sludge types with high collision efficiency low tof could restore from sludge breakup as a result of shear more rapidly leading to smaller floc strength factors due to the lack of independence of the parameters only tof measurements were used for description of flocculation setting behavior in validation data sets 3 2 development of empirical rp calculation based on tof the experimental data set was split up in a training set used to build the empirical function and a validation set used to validate the function built the workflow for the training data november 2016 june 2017 is shown in fig 3 the flocculation rate coefficients rp were derived from the calibration of the 1d modified takács model to fit the measured plant ess for all points of the training data set the quality of the model calibration is shown in fig 4 measured ess and model results for ess were a perfect match as a result of rp calibration fig 4a modeled ras concentrations were a result of measured vesilind parameters and represented measured ras concentrations well fig 4b using rp data from the latter model calibrations a strong power function existed between rp and measured ess with r2 of 0 96 the power function was a result of the takács model structure and therefore independent of the settling characteristics fig 5 a due to the power function relationship between rp and ess and the linear relationship between ess and tof fig 2 a power relationship was expected between tof and rp fig 5b shows the empirical relationship between rp from the calibration approach using the training data set and measured tof values corrected for non settling solids xmin with r2 0 87 note that all three systems nicely fit on the same function and cover a broad range of tof values 50 900 mg tss l in addition the 95 confidence and prediction interval of the achieved equation is shown in fig 5b fig 6 a b c and d show the strength of correlation between predicted and measured rp and predicted and measured ess for the training data set 3 3 validation of the rp tof function experimental data for east west and bnr1 systems from a later period july 2017 october 2017 with similar operational conditions was used to validate the empirical function in addition two new systems hras and bnr2 were used to validate the empirical function for a broader range of operational conditions table 1 and settling properties table 2 fig 6c shows the model calibrated rp versus the calculated rp based on the proposed empirical function rp 2 96 tof xmin 1 154 achieved from the training data fig 5b fig 6d shows the predicted effluent solids versus the measured effluent solids for the validation data overall the predicted effluent quality of the validation data fell well within 95 prediction intervals determined by the training data data from the two new systems hras and bnr2 were equally well predicted compared to the east east 2018 west and bnr1 systems 3 4 sensitivity analysis of proposed model approach the impact of the non settling suspended solids concentration xmin was taken care of by correcting the tof value for xmin thus allowing to include different systems with different xmin impacts table 2 no impact of the boundary settling velocity above 200 m d figure s1c which was lower than measured velocities mancell egala 2017b and the default value of 270 m d was observed on calculated versus calibrated rp figure s1c empirical compensation for compression figure s1a was kept constant within this study as no experimental methods for calibration were available the compression behavior mainly determined the sludge blanket dynamics and not the effluent quality when a clarifier operated below its failure rate therefore the proposed experimental determination of rp based on tof will hold true even after more detailed incorporation of compression behavior figure s1b lastly steady state model runs were performed for all tested days during training and validation assuming stable operation of the systems we excluded measurement days with tss mass balance errors based on 24 hour composite tss samples over the clarifiers above 30 as this would indicate more dynamic behavior potentially sludge blanket height changes significant wasting changes and dramatical sludge property changes etc based on the prediction interval shown in fig 6b ess prediction errors for certain training data points were quite significant with absolute prediction errors up to 10 mg tss l figure s1d when taking into account three days instead of one day mass balance errors thus including the day before settling tests the day of settling tests error 30 and the day after the settling tests data points with an average 3 day mass balance errors above 20 resulted in increased prediction errors figure s1d the errors were mainly caused by significant changes in wasting flow rates for several hours due to process limitations in the biosolids facility resulting in the needs to hold more sludge in the activated sludge systems or start wasting at increased rates in a later stage dynamic simulation of these events could potentially lead to decreases in prediction errors 4 discussion 4 1 settling methods for clarifier performance monitoring with discrete and flocculant settling being the dominant settling regimes in full scale clarifiers mancell egala et al 2016 it was not a surprise that in this study no correlation was found between any conventional settling parameter and effluent quality fig 1 this was similar to previous reports kinnear 2002 mancell egala et al 2017b the transition parameter loss showed no clear correlation with ess fig 1c indicating a disconnect between hindered settling and compression characteristics and flocculant settling properties for example pin point flocs characterized by high tof thus leading to high ess can show good hindered settling and compression properties due to lower charge interactions and thus better compression van winckel et al 2019 thus tof and loss provided independent information flocculation properties in this study were characterized by tof and the floc strength factor van winckel et al 2019 and jarvis et al 2005 indicated the importance of understanding floc strength as hydrodynamic conditions impact floc growth and flocs break up however the tof parameter already described the intrinsic characteristics of the floc determining collision efficiency mancell egala et al 2017a and floc strength could not be determined independently correlation factor r2 0 576 only tof was used to describe flocculation properties a strong correlation between tof and ess was observed for stably operating systems mass balance error below 30 similar trend of lower tof leading to lower ess although not in such clear linear correlation was observed before for high rate contact stabilization systems rahman et al 2016 and full scale secondary systems mancell egala et al 2017b the weaker correlation observed in mancell egala et al 2017b can be explained by two factors i this study determined tof up to a precision of 50 mg tss l and measured tof as low as 20 mg tss l rather than a minimum of 100 mg tss l as described by mancell egala et al 2017b ii mancell egala et al 2017b did not exclude data points with large mass balance errors no steady state check therefore the 24 hour composite ess level might not reflect ess conditions during the grab sampling for tof in addition the 24 hour composite ess sample was taken using a constant pumping flow rate rather than dynamic with influent flow this supported the mass balance cleaning approach to exclude highly dynamic days especially in combination with steady state clarifier modeling in systems such as hras east and west with srt 2 days and a large overall tof range 56 904 mg tss l it was hypothesized that flocculation properties might be dynamic over 24 hours due to dynamics in loading rates and srt flocculation limitations have been correlated before with low protein pn to polysaccharide ps ratio in the eps li and yang 2007 van winckel et al 2019 high organic loading rate barbusiński and kościelniak 1995 low srt rahman et al 2017 temperature and unfavorable wastewater characteristics roberts and olsson 1975 to date the overall link between the sludge composition and clarifier performance is unclear however this study for the first times shows a clear link between flocculation properties described by tof and ess the measurement of tof as a regular operational sludge property in wwtp could provide valuable information on flocculation property changes and could explain ess dynamics unlike conventional practice of measuring svi 4 2 clarifier prediction versus clarifier calibration a wide range of settling characteristics from bad settling systems east west and hras to good settling systems bnr1 and bnr2 was covered within training and validation data sets table 2 the high dynamics in operational and loading conditions witthin the hras system east secondary system and west secondary system resulted in a wide range of tof xmin values 97 904 mg tss l subsequent wide range of rp 0 022 0 00098 l mg tss and thus ess 5 56 mg tss l figs 5 6 in contrast brn1 and brn2 systems were operated at a longer srt systems low rate system producing more stable and compact flocs in comparison to the short srt systems high rate mancell egala et al 2017b and thus recorded a higher range of rp 0 004 to 0 037 l mg tss and a lower range of ess 2 to 11 mg tss l the broad range of rp values recorded in this study were within the range from previously reported systems li and stenstrom 2014b plósz et al 2007 takacs et al 1991 vlasschaert 2013 overall due to long time data collection four years different seasons operational conditions loading rate and srt fluctuations were covered within this study table 1 this wide and large data set from full scale systems avoided system specificity of the developed empirical rp calculation indeed the proposed empirical function rp 2 96 tof xmin 1 158 r2 0 87 allowed for good prediction of ess for all data sets tested this highlighted that the tof measurements provided clear intrinsic floc property information that was directly relevant to clarification from previous studies flocculent settling was suggested as the critical settling regime in under loaded clarifier kinnear 2002 mancell egala et al 2017b and thus flocculation kinetic changes might significantly impact effluent quality it should be highlighted that the general correlation between tof and ess was not maintained when clarifier hydraulics were changed outside a certain range in this case sor 1 85 m3 m2 h see east system 2018 fig 2b the latter indicated the impact of sor on effluent quality depending on the floc settling velocity distribution van winckel et al in review however the tof measurement was able to capture the floc characteristics well and led to an estimation of low rp value fig 6c as a result despite being an outlier in fig 6d ess was well predicted by the clarifier model and calculated rp the latter confirmed the power of tof measurements to capture floc characteristics given the approach of steady state clarifier modeling using 24 hour composite tss data but with grab sample based settling data a significant impact of clarifier dynamics was observed when only looking into avoiding a mass balance error less than 30 an average ess prediction error of 3 8 3 18 mg tss l was observed figure s1d it should be noted that part of this error could have been associated with tof measurement errors for tof values below 200 mg tss l tof was determined with 25 mg tss l precision leading to maximum ess prediction errors of about 1 49 0 15 mg tss l figure s2b for tof numbers above 200 mg tss l ess prediction errors were maintained at a maximum of 4 17 0 39 mg tss l although tof measurement had a lower precision of 50 mg tss l figure s2b prediction power was acceptable when compared to the poor ess prediction of calibrated clarifier models outside the calibration data set de clercq et al 2003 li and stenstrom 2014b sin et al 2009 torfs et al 2013b the proposed experimental approach for determination of rp formed an analogue approach to the calculation of vesilind parameter rh v0 for the hindered settling zone generally the empirical function for hindered settling has been accepted well in practice li and stenstrom 2014a therefore we believe that the proposed similar approach for the flocculation regime will find adoption in practice especially when seeking clarifier performance predictions for technology implementation for which tof target values are known however without general adoption of tof measurements and thus known targets for tof for different technologies or operational changes the lack of connection between the clarifier model and the process model hampers prediction of settling changes the next step should therefore include to connect the tof parameter changes to sludge composition changes that are driven by operational condition changes in addition further validation on other full scale systems will help to refine the empirical equation and optimize ess prediction errors over a wide range of conditions and systems 5 conclusion in this study we focused on the development of an empirical function based on a simple and practical experimental approach for the calculation of the rp value from sludge characteristics this approach provided a similar approach as currently taken for hindered settling coefficient calculations vesilind equation and allowed for the model to predict effluent quality thus increasing the power of the 1d clarifier model the threshold of flocculation tof directly correlated with the effluent quality of the five tested activated sludge systems and was selected as experimental method to develop an empirical function to calculate rp the proposed empirical function between tof and rp was validated for a wide range of sludge types which operated under different operational conditions and configurations this novel approach adds mechanistic meaning to the rp value conventionally used as calibration parameter and brings us one step closer to a practical approach for enhancing the predictive power of

17257,residual dissolved aluminum al in drinking water is becoming a serious concern due to its high potential risks to human health however the mechanism by which residual dissolved al forms is yet to be elucidated in detail in this study the effects of pre oxidation by ozonation and chlorination on the properties of dissolved organic matter dom and residual al concentrations remaining in solution after coagulation were explored in a pilot scale test changes in the dom properties caused by the water treatment process were characterized by ultraviolet visible absorbance spectroscopy theprotonation active sites carboxylic and phenolic type groupsof dom were quantified by spectral parameter dlna400 differential log transformed spectra at wavelength 400 nm in combination with the revised non ideal competitive adsorption model the results show that ozonation and chlorination significantly affect the properties of dom and the amount of residual dissolved al in coagulated drinking water this effect was associated with the changes in the carboxylic and phenolic type groups in dom results of the study show that residual dissolved al in coagulated water can be controlled by affecting theal binding sites in dom by pre oxidation before coagulation the nature of pre oxidation agent and its dosage should be selected depending on the quality of the raw water to be treated ozonation was concluded to be preferable pre oxidation agent for the water in examined this study keywords coagulation pre oxidation dissolved organic matter residual dissolved aluminum ultraviolet visible absorbance spectroscopy 1 introduction the problem of residual dissolved aluminum al in potable water has attracted considerable attention because it can lead to health problems such as alzheimer s disease and cause mutations in somatic and germ cells corkins et al 2019 khalifa et al 2020 niu 2018 verma et al 2020 the world health organization recommends to keep the residual al content in drinking water below 0 2 mg l 1 even stricter guidelines are recommended in some countries for example the guideline recommended by the epa is 0 05 mg l 1 in the usa reiber et al 1995 the excess in the al concentration in drinking water has been shown to be mainly caused by the application of al based coagulants benschoten and edzwald 1990 ma et al 2017 yang et al 2010a it has also been found that al concentrations in watercoagulatedwithal based coagulants changes significantly with the season and water type benschoten and edzwald 1990 brausch et al 2012 ma et al 2017 yang et al

2007 appear to comprise the predominant fraction of the residual al in treated drinking water yang et al 2010b pre hydrolyzed al based coagulation e g polymer aluminum chloride pacl were recommended in view of low content of monomeric al species yan et al 2007 dom is a heterogeneous mixture of polydisperse polyelectrolytic molecules generated via the decomposition of plant microbial and animal biomass leenheer and croue 2003 the quantitation of dom properties in general and al dom interactions under practically coagulation conditions in particular remains a great challenge zhou et al 2017 common methods of quantifying functional groups in dom and their reactivity with al ions involve potentiometric titration and fluoride ion selective electrodes respectively chappaz and curtis 2013 gupta et al 2002 marsac et al 2012 pinheiro et al 2000 these methods require the concentration of dom to be one or two orders of magnitude higher than those in practical drinking water treatment conditions in case dom concentrations are typically below 2 to 3 mg doc l 1 this challenge can be circumvented by employing an alternative approach that tracks the behavior of dom chromophores as a function of ph and or al concentrations using the differential ultraviolet visible uv vis absorbance spectroscopy principle developed in previous research yan et al 2013a yan and korshin 2014 relevant studies have demonstrated that dom chromophores are sensitive to the interactions with many cations such as protons al3 ca2 mg2 cu2 and cr3 and their competitors yan et al 2013a yan and korshin 2014 yan et al 2013b pre oxidation processes have been widely applied in water treatment before coagulation to enhance the performance of coagulation and or algae removal ma et al 2001 xie et al 2016 previous studies have found that both o3 and cl2 the two most widely used oxidants react with dom and break up of molecules into smaller fragments and a decrease of their aromaticity the oxidation of dom with o3 have been observed to cause the formation of a significant amount of ozonation by products i e carboxylic acids aldehydes and ketones chiang et al 2002 korshin et al 1997 rositano et al 2001 swietlik and ewa 2004 however effects of pre oxidation on the properties of dom and on residual dissolved al in treated water have not been fully investigated in this study effects of pre oxidation on residual al in coagulated water was studied in a pilot scale water treatment plant changes in the properties of dom caused by pre ozonation and pre chlorination and coagulation were investigated based on uv vis absorbance spectroscopy the objectives of this study are the following 1 to ascertain the effects of different pre oxidation methods and subsequent coagulation on the characteristics of dom in a north china s water source 2 to determine the relationship between the characteristics of dom and residual dissolved al after pre oxidation the results of this study

λ 1 k h a s h r e f m h a s d 1 n a las λ 1 k l a s h r e f m l a s in the above formula dlna las and dlna has correspond to the maximum change in absorbance associated with low affinity protonation active sites las and high affinity protonation active sites has corresponding to the deprotonation of carboxylic and phenolic type functional groups respectively yan et al 2016 yan et al 2014 in this study dlna las and dlna has refer to dlna values at wavelengths of 400 nm the parameters p k has and p k has are the median values of the proton affinity distributions of las and has respectively m las and m has define the width of these distributions respectively and are measures of the heterogeneity of dom kinniburgh et al 1999 yan et al 2016 yan et al 2014 the model calculations were fitted using matlab 2010a with a genetic toolbox 3 results and discussion 3 1 residual dissolved al and dom in coagulated waters coagulation experiments were carried out without and with pre ozonation and pre chlorination consecutively results of the measurement of residual dissolved al concentrations are shown in fig 1 and those of the doc and uv254 are shown in figure s2 these figures show that the residual doc and uv254 decrease continuously with the increase in the coagulant dosage while residual dissolved al first increases and then decreases the maximum residual al concentration was observed at the coagulant dosage of approximately 0 08 mmol l 1 the trends were similar for coagulation with and without pre oxidation but the concentration of residual dissolved al was significantly affected by ozonation and chlorination the concentration of residual dissolved al increased monotonically as the chlorination dosage increases but it decreased monotonically as the ozone dosage increased this phenomenon indicates that the pre oxidation treatment with different types and concentrations of the oxidants has a significant effect on the concentration of residual al in the coagulated water 3 2 effects of pre oxidation on the dom properties prior research has provided indications that pre oxidation changes dom properties affects the performance of coagulants and residual al concentrations chiang et al 2002 korshin et al 1997 rositano et al 2001 swietlik and ewa 2004 effects of peroxidation have not been fully ascertained due to the limitations of the experimental methods that must detect subtle changes in dom properties and reactivity under different coagulation conditions to further explore the relationship between dom and residual dissolved al we investigated the changes of dom properties during pre oxidation figure s2 shows that both doc and uv254 in raw water decrease during chlorination and ozonation suva254 values before and after pre oxidation were also calculated figure s3 suva254 in raw water drops rapidly after adding ozone and chlorine especially for ozone it mayindicate that there are significant differences between the different pre oxidation modes to investigate properties of dom in raw water in more detail changes in the absorbance spectra of dom in the raw water samples before and after pre oxidation were quantified by spectrophotometric titrations results of these titrations were processed and interpreted based on the differential absorbance approach fig 2 shows the ph differential absorbance spectra das obtained before and after pre oxidation das of dom induced by the deprotonation of the protonated dom chromophores increases significantly as the ph increases especially for wavelengths below 320 nm das of raw water has a characteristic peak at a wavelength of 275 nm and the intensity of this characteristic peak increases with the dosage of chlorine in the das of the raw water treated with ozone there is also a distinct peak at 275 nm but it gradually decreases with the increase in ozone dosage these results can be interpreted assuming that the chlorination tends to break up some large dom molecules and generate their smaller fragments resulting in a change in the properties of dom in addition to this mode of action that is even more prevalent for ozonation ozone can degrade some of the macromolecules hydrophobic aromatic organic groups even can mineralize them swietlik and ewa 2004 the das determined using the results of the spectrophotometric titrations clearly ascertain that the characteristics of dom changed significantly after pre oxidation prior studies have found that the spectral parameter dlna400 obtained in spectrophotometric titrations can reflect the protonation deprotonation behavior of the phenolic and carboxyl species in dom and the amount of protonation active sites per mg l 1of doc in dom yan et al 2016 yan et al 2017a yan et al 2017b the dlna400 vs ph datasets are shown in fig 3 they were interpreted based on the nica model theory which was used to determine the amount of las and has in dom the corresponding results are shown in table s2 a very good agreement between the experimental and model dlna400 data generated using the revised nica model eq 1 for all examined samples r2 0 98 dlna400 increased with increasing ph in all cases and showed two different ranges namely approximately ph7 and ph7 thus reflecting the responses of carboxylic and phenolic type groups in dom respectively yan et al 2014 2016a as shown in table s2 the amount of chlorine added increases the amount of the carboxylic type groupsper mg l 1 of docincreasedrapidly until the chlorine dosage cl2 doc 0 2 and then it decreased slightly for chlorine dosages cl2 doc 0 4 and cl2 doc 0 8 in contrast the amount of phenolic type groupsper mg l 1 of doc decreased slightly until the chlorine dosage cl2 doc 0 2 then it increased for chlorine dosage cl2 doc 0 4 and remained almost unchanged for dosage cl2 doc 0 8 in general the amount of protonation active sites per mg l 1of doc in domconstantly increased as the amount of chlorine added increased on the other hand the amount of the carboxylic type groupsper mg l 1 of doc increased slightly for ozone dosage o3 doc 0 2 it decreased rapidly for ozone dosage o3 doc 0 4 and remained almost unchanged for ozone dosage o3 doc 0 8 however the amount of phenolic type groups per mg l 1 of doc changed non monotonically with the increase in o3 concentrations on the whole the amount of protonation active sites per mg l 1of doc in dom decreased consistently as the amount of ozone added increased the total amount of the protonation active sites doc dlnalas dlnahas in the dom in the raw water before and after pre oxidation is shown in fig 4 it demonstrates that as the dosage of chlorine increases the amount of protonation active sites in the raw water increases because these sites are likely to be engaged in the formations of complexes with al3 pre chlorination may lead to increases of residual al concentrations in coagulated water on the contrary increase in the ozone dosage cause the amount of protonation active sites in the raw water to decrease gradually this can reduce the extent of al complexation and with the resultant decreases of residual al concentration in the coagulated water 3 3 correlation between residual dissolved al and properties of dom pre before coagulation to show the effect of the dom properties with and without pre oxidation on the presence of residual dissolved al in coagulated waters the amount of protonation active sites in the water before coagulation were compared with the residual dissolved al data at coagulant dosages of 0 04 0 06 0 08 0 10 and 0 12 mmol al l 1 fig 5 the concentration of residual al before and after chlorination and ozonation exhibited good linearity with the total amount of protonation active sites at the various dosages of al with r2 values of 0 88 this result demonstrates that the concentration of residual dissolved al is strongly affected by dom properties notably by the amount of the protonation active sites that can be engaged in the formation of al3 dom complexes 3 4 correlation between residual dissolved al and dom properties of coagulated water to explore the nature of the correlation between the concentration of residual dissolved al and the dom properties dom in the coagulated water was characterized using spectrophotometric titrations results of these measurements are shown in figure s4 the result at the coagulant dosage of 0 08 mmol al l 1 was selected as an example das of coagulated water with and without pre chlorination both show two peaks with obvious dom deprotonation at wavelengths of 275 and 375 nm the intensity of these peaks increases with the chlorine concentration however there is onlya distinct peak at 275 nm in the das of the coagulated water without pre ozonation the intensity and size of the peak at 275 nm gradually decreases with the increase in the ozone dosage and forms a new peak at 375 nm furthermore the peaks become smoother fig 6 shows the dlna400 values as a function of the ph in coagulated waters with and without pre oxidation there is a clear difference between the protonation properties of dom chromophores after coagulation with and without pre oxidation as shown in table s3 the amount of carboxylic type groups per mg l 1 of doc increases rapidly at the chlorination dosage cl2 doc 0 2 and increases further at the chlorination dosage cl2 doc 0 4 then it decreases for the dosage cl2 doc 0 8 the amount of phenolic type groups per mg l 1 of doc has a trend opposite to that of the carboxylic type groups i e it decreases first and then increases however the amounts of carboxylic and phenolic type groups per mg l 1 of doc as well as the amount of protonation active sites per mg l 1 of doc in dom decrease continuously as the dosage of ozone increased the amount of protonation active sites in the dom after coagulation was compared with the residual dissolved al data at a coagulant dosage of 0 08 mmol l 1 and the results are shown in fig 7 the residual dissolved al concentrations and the total amount of protonation active sites are linearity correlated r2 0 91 and 0 96 for chlorination and ozonation respectively this provides an additional confirmation of the notion that concentrations of residual dissolved al in coagulated water are strongly affected by the amount of protonation active sites of dom in the water after coagulation 4 practical implications this study demonstrated that concentrations of residual dissolved al are affected by dom properties notably the abundance of the protonation active groups in dom the results also demonstrate that the differential absorbance spectroscopy approach is a powerful tool to probe the potentially subtle changes of dom properties and its reactivity in pre oxidation and coagulation processes this approach can be expanded to other drinking water treatment processes especially because this method does not require any sample preconcentration while the das technique is inherently highly sensitive accessible and ease to implement the observations presented in this study provide useful information and an actionable approach for controlling residual al in practical water treatment operations especially in the context of controlling dom properties via pre oxidation ozonation chlorination and other oxidative methods are widely used in water treatment before coagulation the changes in the protonation active groups that determine al solubility are dependent on the oxidant type and dosage as well as the site specific properties of dom further work will establish quantifiable correlations between site specific dom properties and on the other hand the type and dosage of oxidant optimal for practical applications 5 conclusion 1 pre oxidation causes significant changesin the properties of dom present in treated water these changes notably those of protonation active functional groups can be successfully quantified by spectral parameters such as dlna400and interpreted based on the revised nica model 2 the extent of the observed changes in dom functional groups depended on the type and dosage of the oxidant 3 the concentration of residual dissolved al in the coagulated water was closely related to the total amount of al binging sites of dom in the water before and its after coagulation 4 for water quality engineering practices concentrations of residual dissolved al present in coagulated water can be suppressed by controlling the amount of protonation activesites in dom in raw water before its coagulation this can be done via pre oxidation step the pre oxidanttype and dosage should be selected depending on the quality of the raw water to be treated pre ozonation was determined to be more suitable for the water quality of examined in

17257,residual dissolved aluminum al in drinking water is becoming a serious concern due to its high potential risks to human health however the mechanism by which residual dissolved al forms is yet to be elucidated in detail in this study the effects of pre oxidation by ozonation and chlorination on the properties of dissolved organic matter dom and residual al concentrations remaining in solution after coagulation were explored in a pilot scale test changes in the dom properties caused by the water treatment process were characterized by ultraviolet visible absorbance spectroscopy theprotonation active sites carboxylic and phenolic type groupsof dom were quantified by spectral parameter dlna400 differential log transformed spectra at wavelength 400 nm in combination with the revised non ideal competitive adsorption model the results show that ozonation and chlorination significantly affect the properties of dom and the amount of residual dissolved al in coagulated drinking water this effect was associated with the changes in the carboxylic and phenolic type groups in dom results of the study show that residual dissolved al in coagulated water can be controlled by affecting theal binding sites in dom by pre oxidation before coagulation the nature of pre oxidation agent and its dosage should be selected depending on the quality of the raw water to be treated ozonation was concluded to be preferable pre oxidation agent for the water in examined this study keywords coagulation pre oxidation dissolved organic matter residual dissolved aluminum ultraviolet visible absorbance spectroscopy 1 introduction the problem of residual dissolved aluminum al in potable water has attracted considerable attention because it can lead to health problems such as alzheimer s disease and cause mutations in somatic and germ cells corkins et al 2019 khalifa et al 2020 niu 2018 verma et al 2020 the world health organization recommends to keep the residual al content in drinking water below 0 2 mg l 1 even stricter guidelines are recommended in some countries for example the guideline recommended by the epa is 0 05 mg l 1 in the usa reiber et al 1995 the excess in the al concentration in drinking water has been shown to be mainly caused by the application of al based coagulants benschoten and edzwald 1990 ma et al 2017 yang et al 2010a it has also been found that al concentrations in watercoagulatedwithal based coagulants changes significantly with the season and water type benschoten and edzwald 1990 brausch et al 2012 ma et al 2017 yang et al 2010a yang et al 2010b approaches for controlling residual al concentrations in treated water have been extensively investigated benschoten and edzwald 1990 brausch et al 2012 ma et al 2017 yang et al 2010a yang et al 2010b but mechanisms associated with excessive al levels are yet to be elucidated in more detail when an al based coagulant is added to water al3 rapidly undergoes hydrolysis reactions to form other dissolved al species or al hydroxide precipitates including monomers al oh 2 al oh 2 and al oh 4 dimer al2 oh 2 4 trimer al3 oh 4 5 tridecamer al13o4 oh 24 7 and amorphous

filtrationwhich are common in modern water treatment plants driscoll and letterman 1995 the speciation of residual al that remain in the water after solid liquid separation is dominated by al complexes with fluoride phosphate sulfate hydroxyl ions and especially dissolved organic matter dom rubin and hayden 1969 yang et al 2010a if fact soluble al dom complexes duan et al 2014 yan et al 2007 appear to comprise the predominant fraction of the residual al in treated drinking water yang et al 2010b pre hydrolyzed al based coagulation e g polymer aluminum chloride pacl were recommended in view of low content of monomeric al species yan et al 2007 dom is a heterogeneous mixture of polydisperse polyelectrolytic molecules generated via the decomposition of plant microbial and animal biomass leenheer and croue 2003 the quantitation of dom properties in general and al dom interactions under practically coagulation conditions in particular remains a great challenge zhou et al 2017 common methods of quantifying functional groups in dom and their reactivity with al ions involve potentiometric titration and fluoride ion selective electrodes respectively chappaz and curtis 2013 gupta et al 2002 marsac et al 2012 pinheiro et al 2000 these methods require the concentration of dom to be one or two orders of magnitude higher than those in practical drinking water treatment conditions in case dom concentrations are typically below 2 to 3 mg doc l 1 this challenge can be circumvented by employing an alternative approach that tracks the behavior of dom chromophores as a function of ph and or al concentrations using the differential ultraviolet visible uv vis absorbance spectroscopy principle developed in previous research yan et al 2013a yan and korshin 2014 relevant studies have demonstrated that dom chromophores are sensitive to the interactions with many cations such as protons al3 ca2 mg2 cu2 and cr3 and their competitors yan et al 2013a yan and korshin 2014 yan et al 2013b pre oxidation processes have been widely applied in water treatment before coagulation to enhance the performance of coagulation and or algae removal ma et al 2001 xie et al 2016 previous studies have found that both o3 and cl2 the two most widely used oxidants react with dom and break up of molecules into smaller fragments and a decrease of their aromaticity the oxidation of dom with o3 have been observed to cause the formation of a significant amount of ozonation by products i e carboxylic acids aldehydes and ketones chiang et al 2002 korshin et al 1997 rositano et al 2001 swietlik and ewa 2004 however effects of pre oxidation on the properties of dom and on residual dissolved al in treated water have not been fully investigated in this study effects of pre oxidation on residual al in coagulated water was studied in a pilot scale water treatment plant changes in the properties of dom caused by pre ozonation and pre chlorination and coagulation were investigated based on uv vis absorbance spectroscopy the objectives of this study are the following 1 to ascertain the effects of different pre oxidation methods and subsequent coagulation on the characteristics of dom in a north china s water source 2 to determine the relationship between the characteristics of dom and residual dissolved al after pre oxidation the results of this study

pre chlorination consecutively results of the measurement of residual dissolved al concentrations are shown in fig 1 and those of the doc and uv254 are shown in figure s2 these figures show that the residual doc and uv254 decrease continuously with the increase in the coagulant dosage while residual dissolved al first increases and then decreases the maximum residual al concentration was observed at the coagulant dosage of approximately 0 08 mmol l 1 the trends were similar for coagulation with and without pre oxidation but the concentration of residual dissolved al was significantly affected by ozonation and chlorination the concentration of residual dissolved al increased monotonically as the chlorination dosage increases but it decreased monotonically as the ozone dosage increased this phenomenon indicates that the pre oxidation treatment with different types and concentrations of the oxidants has a significant effect on the concentration of residual al in the coagulated water 3 2

dom properties during pre oxidation figure s2 shows that both doc and uv254 in raw water decrease during chlorination and ozonation suva254 values before and after pre oxidation were also calculated figure s3 suva254 in raw water drops rapidly after adding ozone and chlorine especially for ozone it mayindicate that there are significant differences between the different pre oxidation modes to investigate properties of dom in raw water in more detail changes in the absorbance spectra of dom in the raw water samples before and after pre oxidation were quantified by spectrophotometric

doc in dom decreased consistently as the amount of ozone added increased the total amount of the protonation active sites doc dlnalas dlnahas in the dom in the raw water before and after pre oxidation is shown in fig 4 it demonstrates that as the dosage of chlorine increases the amount of protonation active sites in the raw water increases because these sites are likely to be engaged in the

the amounts of carboxylic and phenolic type groups per mg l 1 of doc as well as the amount of protonation active sites per mg l 1 of doc in dom decrease continuously as the dosage of ozone increased the amount of protonation active sites in the dom after coagulation was compared with the residual dissolved al data at a coagulant dosage of 0 08 mmol l 1 and the results are shown in fig 7 the residual dissolved al concentrations and the total amount of protonation active sites are linearity correlated r2 0 91 and 0 96 for chlorination and ozonation respectively this provides an additional

17258,to evaluate the green photocatalytic disinfection for practical applications disinfection of different types of real sewage using magnetic photocatalyst rgo fe n tio2 fe3o4 sio2 rgofentfs under simulated solar light was investigated low salinity sewage after tertiary treatment low salinity sewage after secondary biological treatment high salinity sewage after secondary biological treatment and high salinity sewage after chemically enhanced primary treatment the classification of the sewage as high and low salinity is based on the regions of sewage source that use seawater and freshwater for toilet flushing respectively it shows potential of solar light driven photocatalytic disinfection in low salinity sewage around 20 min for sewage after tertiary treatment and 45 min for sewage after secondary treatment of photocatalytic disinfection are required for sewage to meet the discharge standard and no bacterial regrowth is observed in the treated sewage after 48 h however due to the poorer water quality the high salinity sewage requires a relatively long reaction time more than 240 min to meet the discharge standard showing minimal practical significance further the complex characteristics of real sewage such as organic matter suspended matter multivalent ions ph and do level significantly influence photocatalytic disinfection and should be carefully reviewed in evaluating the photocatalytic disinfection of sewage besides rgofentfs shows a good reusability over three cycles for photocatalytic disinfection of low salinity sewage samples moreover the non toxicity indicated by phytoplankton in seawater of both rgofentfs 3 g l and treated low salinity sewage demonstrates the feasibility of the practical application of photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs under irradiation of solar light graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photocatalytic disinfection real sewage solar light tio2 toxicity assessment sewage characteristics 1 introduction pathogenic microbes in sewage may cause waterborne diseases to human beings and wildlife to prevent the spread of disease and to safeguard human health disinfection treatment is necessary for the sewage treatment process to reduce microbes e g e coli a representative type of bacteria in wastewater to a level in compliance with the discharge standards conventional disinfection methods such as chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet irradiation have limitations of either being chemical or energy intensive with the formation of toxic disinfection by products khadgi et al 2017 sun et al 2014 wang et al 2018 as an alternative disinfection technology photocatalysis has attracted wide attention due to its environmental sustainability good performance and capability of harnessing green energy wang et al 2017 it offers the possibility of using the abundant and renewable solar light energy in sewage disinfection treatment tio2 has been one of the most explored photocatalysts over the past few decades due to its physicochemical inertness nontoxicity and low price asahi et al 2014 coto et al 2017 levchuk et al 2019 li et al 2016 however limitations such as restricted activity to uv light and high recombination of charge carriers have restricted tio2 s practical applications asahi et al 2014 li et al 2015 li et al 2016 doping is a facile method to narrow tio2 s bandgap for the activity under an extended light spectrum after metal and non metal e g fe and n codoping the light spectrum that activates tio2 can be extended from the uv region to include visible light as well thus allowing the codoped tio2 to be activated under solar light kalantari et al 2017 kim et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 in addition the high recombination of charge carriers is another factor that limits the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 as the separated charge carriers are involved in the formation of reactive species during the photocatalytic disinfection reaction asahi et al 2014 combination of tio2 with reduced graphene oxide rgo which is a carbon based material with high conductivity allows the migration of photocatalytically generated electrons from the bulk of the tio2 to rgo sheets and subsequently the composite surface and hence hindering the recombination and improving the photocatalytic efficiency liu et al 2018 for the photocatalytic disinfection of water and sewage using tio2 based photocatalysts a slurry system with photocatalyst particles dispersed in the solution offers enhanced reactive sites for higher photocatalytic efficiency chong et al 2010a however the separation of the photocatalyst from treated solution is a challenge hence the induction of magnetic property to the tio2 composites by combining with magnetic fe3o4 sio2 core is highly beneficial for the easy and effective separation of tio2 based photocatalysts from treated sewage he et al 2019 accordingly solar light driven magnetic rgo fe n tio2 fe3o4 sio2 rgofentfs was developed for photocatalytic disinfection other than the photocatalysts in the process of photocatalytic disinfection of sewage microbes is another crucial issue schneider et al 2014 smith and rodrigues 2015 focus should be placed on both the photocatalysts and sewage characteristics for a comprehensive understanding of photocatalytic disinfection process research studies aiming at the development of photocatalyst materials have been carried out rahimi et al 2015 yang et al 2018 zeng et al 2017 moreover the practical application of the technology is a concern lado ribeiro et al 2019 moreno andrés et al 2020 ribeiro et al 2019 rincón and pulgarin 2004 sreeja and shetty k 2017 to explore the practical application of photocatalytic disinfection investigation conducted with real sewage is required as water characteristics can influence the photocatalytic disinfection performance chong et al 2010a chong et al 2010b horovitz et al 2018 levchuk et al 2019 rincón and pulgarin 2004 understanding the effects of the sewage characteristics on photocatalytic disinfection in real sewage informs and guides decisions regarding how much the technology can tolerate fluctuation in sewage characteristics after disinfection treatment the treated sewage is then discharged to marine water the toxicity assessment of the treated sewage discharged to the ecosystem is also a vital section in the evaluation of a technology seubert et al 2017 in addition photocatalyst materials may be discharged with the effluent to the environment even after the separation of the materials from the treated sewage understanding the effects of the photocatalysts on the marine system is beneficial to a comprehensive evaluation of the technology toxicity assessment of the technology other than sewage treatment is also a trend of recent study aruoja et al 2009 rueda marquez et al 2020 sendra et al 2017 phytoplankton is highly productive in coastal ecosystems and comprises the base for the coastal food webs with a wide distribution miller et al 2010 as a primary specie of the food web in the ecosystem phytoplankton has been used as pollution indicator species in toxicity assessment due to its high surface volume ratio phytoplankton can rapidly obtain equilibrium with the surroundings and quickly respond to suspended toxicants with high uptake miller et al 2010 the impacts of photocatalyst and treated sewage on phytoplankton can predict their potential effects on the ecosystem in which phytoplankton forms the basis of the food webs in this study the photocatalytic disinfection performance of rgofentfs was evaluated in four different sewage effluents collected from local stws covering typical treatment types 1 low salinity sewage after tertiary treatment lt 2 low salinity sewage after secondary biological treatment lb 3 high salinity sewage after secondary biological treatment hb and 4 high salinity sewage after chemically enhanced primary treatment hc in hong kong some regions use seawater to flush toilets while others use freshwater therefore sewage for local stws is typically classified as high salinity for regions using seawater flushing and low salinity for regions using freshwater flushing thus sewage in this study is also classified based on high low salinity the effects of the water characteristics organic matter suspended matter inorganic ions ph and dissolved oxygen level of lt and lb sewage samples on the photocatalytic disinfection performance under simulated solar light were studied to evaluate the potential application of rgofentfs in a real environment besides the reusability of rgofentfs over three cycles for photocatalytic disinfection of low salinity sewage samples was investigated last but not least the toxicity of rgofentfs and sewage before and after photocatalytic disinfection reaction on the ecosystem was assessed by a bioassay test using phytoplankton in seawater as an indicator 2 methodology 2 1 synthesis and characterization of rgofentfs all chemicals used in this study are listed in text s1 and were used as received without further purification rgofentfs was synthesized through a multi step method as described in text s2 briefly magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles were firstly synthesized through a coprecipitation method and then coated with sio2 via the modified stöber method obtaining the magnetic fe3o4 sio2 he et al 2019 secondly the magnetic core was combined with the fe n codoped tio2 by sol gel method and subsequently combined with graphene oxide finally calcination of the obtained material was performed to crystalize fe n tio2 structure and to reduce graphene oxide obtaining rgofentfs was characterized as described in text s3 2 2 collection and characterization of sewage samples different types of sewage samples were taken from four stws low salinity sewage after tertiary treatment lt low salinity sewage after secondary treatment lb high salinity sewage after secondary biological treatment hb and high salinity sewage after chemically enhanced primary treatment i e flocculation process using ferric chloride and polymer hc they cover the typical types of sewage in hong kong the sampling point in each stws was upstream of the disinfection operation unit after the effluent of tertiary secondary cept treatment process the collection procedure and preservation were conducted as described in text s4 the characteristics of sewage samples were measured following the methods described in text s5 2 3 photocatalytic disinfection test 2 3 1 experimental apparatus in the photocatalytic disinfection reaction rgofentfs particles was suspended in 50 ml of sewage by vigorous stirring in a 125 ml conical flask under the irradiation of a solar simulator 300 w xenon light pls sxe300uv perfectlight technology beijing with an air mass 1 5 global filter simulating the solar irradiation the experimental setup is demonstrated in fig s1 the sewage temperature during the reaction was maintained using a fan at about 25 c the simulated solar light has an irradiation intensity 816 w m2 and a light spectrum fig s2 similar to authentic solar light 2 3 2 photocatalytic disinfection in sewage the photocatalytic disinfection performance for different types of sewage was studied using the sewage samples within one week after collection the sewage samples were used for experiments as collected without pre treatment the dosage of rgofentfs used in the photocatalytic disinfection of the lt sample was 1 g l for lb sewage the effect of dosage 1 2 3 and 4 g l was studied 3 g l was selected for the photocatalytic disinfection of hb and hc sewage samples since this study concerns real sewage for practical applications specific discharge standards of e coli table s1 are used as criteria for evaluating the photocatalytic disinfection performance the discharge standards of e coli are 1500 cfu 100 ml for lt and lb sewage 15 000 cfu 100 ml for hb sewage and 900 000 cfu 100 ml for hc sewage hkdsd 2020a b in addition to evaluate the impact of solar light irradiation on the bacteria in the sewage samples light control tests were performed under the same experimental conditions of the photocatalytic disinfection without the addition of rgofentfs after disinfection the bacterial regrowth was also examined rgofentfs was magnetically separated from the treated sewage sample which was subsequently kept in the dark at room temperature the e coli density was measured after 24 h and 48 h to monitor the bacterial regrowth besides as described in text s6 rgofentfs was used for three cycles of reaction to study its reusability in real sewage the tests of photocatalytic disinfection in this study were conducted in triplicate 2 3 3 effects of sewage characteristics on photocatalytic disinfection compared to hb and hc sewage samples lt and lb sewage samples require short reaction times of photocatalytic disinfection to meet their specific discharge standards indicating the application potential of the technology for these two types of sewage therefore the effects of sewage characteristics on the photocatalytic disinfection were studied for only lt and lb but not hb and hc samples for tests studying the sewage characteristics effects a new batch of lt and lb sewage samples characterized as summarized in table s2 were collected the sewage samples for experiments were prepared by adjusting the characteristic value and adding cultured intrinsic e coli as described in text s7 1 only one parameter was adjusted in each test and the variation of characteristics was based on the initial value in the sewage samples as shown in table s3 and table s4 2 due to the natural decay of bacteria e coli was isolated from the sewage samples cultured then added to the source sewage to maintain consistent initial e coli densities 3 8 log and 5 1 log cfu 100 ml for the lt and lb sewage samples respectively other experimental conditions were consistent with that of photocatalytic disinfection the dosages of rgofentfs for photocatalytic disinfection of the lt and lb sewage were 1 and 3 g l respectively 2 3 4 bacteria enumeration density of e coli was measured through the membrane filtration technique using m lauryl sulfate broth as the selective medium for e coli hkepd 1991 this method is described in detailed in text s8 2 4 toxicity assessment using phytoplankton as an indicator the toxicity effects of the photocatalyst and sewage samples were determined by studying their impacts on the phytoplankton density compared to that of the control and further predicting their potential impacts on the ecosystem miller et al 2010 seawater containing phytoplankton without any addition was used as the control sample a sample with di water addition was employed to determine the impact of the salinity reduction due to the dilution of seawater phytoplankton collection and sample preparation for toxicity assessment were conducted as described in text s9 the volume ratio of the addition untreated treated sewage and di water to seawater was 1 10 as shown in table s5 the tests were conducted with three parallel measurements for each data point n 3 2 5 data analysis data of the experiments were analyzed using anova analysis statistically significant differences between the groups of data are identified by the p value no asterisk p 0 05 no statistically significant differences p 0 05 significant different p 0 01 highly significant different p 0 001 extremely significant different 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 characterizations of sewage samples four typical sewage samples lt lb hb and hc have been characterized as summarized in table 1 due to the more advanced treatment process the lt sewage sample has the most satisfactory quality with the lowest organic content presented in toc tss turbidity as well as the lowest initial e coli density overall the water quality of the collected sewage samples follows the descending order of lt lb hb hc the detailed comparison was described in text s10 3 1 2 characterization of rgofentfs 3 1 2 1 uv vis the optical property of rgofentfs was determined by measuring the uv vis drs as shown in fig 1 a compared to pristine tio2 which can absorb only uv light asahi et al 2014 the absorption spectrum of rgofentfs is extended to visible light region with particularly broad absorption peak from 300 to 550 nm this suggests rgofentfs has a solar light driven property which covers both the uv and visible regions 3 1 2 2 xrd and vsm the crystalline structures of fe3o4 and rgofentfs were analyzed using xrd fig 1b the xrd pattern of fe3o4 indexes its cubic phase with the characteristic diffraction peaks of 35 5 44 6 57 3 and 62 5 matching the jcpds card 72 2303 in the rgofentfs curve major diffraction peaks at 25 4 38 4 47 8 54 6 and 65 1 matching the pattern of jcpds card 73 1764 evidence the crystalline structure of anatase tio2 in the rgofentfs composite he et al 2019 due to the shielding of the outer layer of the tio2 based structure of the composites some fe3o4 peaks of this spectrum are weakened or eliminated only the peaks corresponding to fe3o4 at 44 6 and 62 5 are detected on the other hand the magnetic property of rgofentfs provided by fe3o4 indicates its presence in the composite fig 1c rgofentfs is superparamagnetic with a saturation magnetization value of 3 64 emu g a property that gains facile magnetic separation of the photocatalyst from the treated aqueous media he et al 2019 3 1 2 3 raman the rgo component of the composite was analyzed by raman microscopy fig 1d with two representative characteristic peaks of the d band and g band at around 1350 and 1580 cm 1 for the graphene structure materials the intensities of these two bands have been employed to determine the disorder and defects in the graphene structure lópez díaz et al 2017 xu et al 2018 in the reduction of graphene oxide oxygen functional groups are removed by chemical or thermal treatment the graphene structure probably loss some carbon atoms connected to the oxygen functional groups resulting in the formation of defects and disorder a higher id ig indicates the stronger disorder and defects caused by the reduction of graphene oxide an id ig value of higher than 1 typically indicates the successful reduction of graphene oxide lópez díaz et al 2017 xu et al 2018 rgofentfs has an id ig of 1 14 suggesting the reduction of go after the thermal treatment and presence of rgo in the composites 3 2 photocatalytic disinfection of sewage 3 2 1 photocatalytic disinfection of different types of sewage the photocatalytic disinfection performance of rgofentfs was evaluated in sewage effluent samples collected from four typical stws which cover the typical local treatment types lt lb hb and hc the lt sewage samples can meet the discharge standard of 1500 cfu 100 ml of e coli after photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs 1 g l after around 20 min under simulated solar light fig 2 a this shows the potential of photocatalytic disinfection for application in lt sewage under natural solar irradiation for sewage with poorer water quality presented in higher characteristic values a higher dosage for the reaction may be needed to overcome the adverse effects of the poorer water quality on the photocatalytic performance as it provides more surface reactive sites for reaction and introduces a higher disinfection capacity however photocatalyst particles themselves induce light scattering effect which on the other hand may reduce the incident light to the photocatalyst surface to study the effect of the rgofentfs dosage on poorer quality sewage photocatalytic disinfection of lb sewage under dosages of 1 2 3 and 4 g l were compared fig s3 in lb sewage photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of rgofentfs is improved with the increase of dosage whose value is below 3 g l but is inhibited as the dosage further increased to 4 g l therefore a dosage of 3 g l was used for sewage of poorer quality i e lb hb and hc except for the poor disinfection performance for hc sewage fig 2d both lb and hb sewage samples fig 2b c could meet the discharge standard after 45 and 240 min of photocatalytic disinfection reaction respectively using rgofentfs under simulated solar light compared to the results of the light control tests fig 2 the presence of rgofentfs significantly improves the disinfection performance for lt lb and hb sewage under simulated solar light indicating the photocatalytic capacity of rgofentfs for disinfection of sewage and decrease of e coli density was not observed in hc sewage in the light control different performances in disinfection of different types of sewage samples may be due to the specific sewage characteristics the decrease of photocatalytic disinfection efficacy follows the descending order of sewage quality the characteristic parameters of sewage samples as shown in table 1 can be classified into three main groups organic matter i e toc and tn suspended matter i e tss turbidity and bacterial density and ions cations and anions among the four sewage samples hc sewage has the highest content for all parameters which may lead to the inefficient photocatalytic disinfection whereas the lt sewage sample has the best quality according to its lowest organic and suspended matter as well as the lowest e coli density these conditions allow the treated lt sewage meet the bacterial discharge standard in a very feasible reaction time of less than 30 min lb sewage sample has a higher contents of organic and suspended matter and one order of magnitude higher for e coli density than lt sewage sample resulting in a longer reaction time for meeting the discharge standard although hb and lb sewage samples are both effluent after secondary treatment the hb sewage sample exhibits higher organic and suspended matter and higher ion concentration this property is in line with the lower photocatalytic disinfection efficiency the key parameters of sewage characteristics classified in the above three main groups should be emphasized as they can interfere with the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency firstly the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of the photocatalyst is achieved by the photocatalytic generation of the reactive species which attack and induce the disinfection of the bacteria he et al 2019 organic matter in the sewage could compete with e coli for the reactive species and hence suppressing the disinfection performance garcía fernández et al 2015 secondly suspended matter causing high turbidity can reduce the penetration of light over a wide range that activates the photocatalyst for disinfection and may also shield the bacteria and protect them from attacks by reactive species chatterjee et al 2017 garcía fernández et al 2015 thirdly ions in the solution may attach to the photocatalyst surface and occupy the reactive sites levchuk et al 2019 marugán et al 2010 and consequently impact the surface charges of both bacteria and photocatalyst liang et al 2017 therefore for the practical application of photocatalytic disinfection of sewage it is important to get a comprehensive assessment of the photocatalytic disinfection process by understanding the influence of the sewage characteristics on the disinfection performance in addition due to the relatively long reaction time and the low efficiency the technology indicates low potential for hb and hc sewage samples therefore further investigation bacterial regrowth and the effects of sewage characteristics was not conducted for hb and hc sewage 3 2 2 bacterial regrowth for the evaluation of the photocatalytic disinfection it is necessary to monitor the disinfected bacteria and to verify the irreversible bacterial cell damage caused by the disinfection reaction as shown in fig 2e f the e coli density of lt and lb sewage samples both meet the discharge standard of 1500 cfu 100 ml after 30 min and 60 min of photocatalytic disinfection reaction respectively after the photocatalytic disinfection reaction the e coli densities of these treated sewage samples lt and lb show a gradual decrease which is likely due to natural decay of the bacteria maraccini et al 2016 and maintain the values under the discharge standards after 24 h and 48 h indicating that the disinfected e coli does not regrow in the lt and lb sewage samples and the e coli density of these sewage samples can maintain a level lower than the discharge standard fig 2e f 3 3 effects of sewage characteristics on photocatalytic disinfection photocatalytic disinfection treatment is a process of interaction between the activated photocatalytic materials and the sewage other than the photocatalyst the sewage characteristics also affect the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency as discussed in the photocatalytic disinfection of different types of sewage the sewage characteristics organic matter suspended solids inorganic ions ph and do level are involved in the variation of disinfection performances using rgofentfs therefore the effects of the sewage characteristics on the photocatalytic disinfection were evaluated for the lt and lb sewage samples which can meet the discharge bacterial standard after a relatively short reaction time characterization of sewage samples for this section is shown in table s2 the experimental conditions and rgofentfs dosages 1 and 3 g l for lt and lb sewage samples respectively were the same as that in section 3 2 3 3 1 effect of organic matter disinfection performance was studied under varied toc values adjusted by adding commercial nom as they present the content of organic matter of sewage fig 3 a shows that the suppression of disinfection efficiency for lt sewage is tolerable when toc is twice the original value at 10 1 mg l as under this condition the treated lt sewage can meet the discharge standard however a further increase in toc leads to the failure in meeting the discharge standard compared to the lt sewage photocatalytic disinfection of lb sewage samples is more sensitive to toc increase fig 3b for lb sewage the disinfection efficiency falls from the e coli reduction of 1 98 log to 1 41 log and could not meet the discharge standard when the toc is twice the original value further inhibition of photocatalytic disinfection performance is also found as toc increases the photocatalytic disinfection performance of rgofentfs for lt and lb sewage samples is significantly suppressed by the increase of organic matter organic matter may affect the photocatalytic disinfection in two ways to absorb and block out incident light on the photocatalyst surface korshin et al 2009 and to compete with bacteria for photocatalytically generated reactive species garcía fernández et al 2015 to prove this hypothesis the absorption of incident light by increased toc by adding nom was analyzed by measuring the light absorption spectrum of lb sewage and the competition of nom for reactive species was investigated by analyzing the change of nom as illustrated in fig 3c the increase of toc enhances the absorption of the uv vis spectrum of the lb sewage especially for light below 500 nm this absorption light range unfortunately overlaps the absorption peak of rgofentfs at 250 500 nm fig 1a and hence blocking out the incident light for rgofentfs excitation and resulting in lower photocatalytic disinfection efficiency besides weakening the incident light the dissolved organic matter may compete with bacteria for reactive species the changes of nom during the reaction were monitored by excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy eem images in fig s4 shows the fluorescent intensity of humic substance a representative nom component in red circles excitation emission of 350 430 nm decreases after 60 min of reaction in both original and toc adjusted lb sewage the degradation of humic substance during the photocatalytic disinfection of lb sewage indicates the attack of reactive species to humic substance and its competition with bacteria for reactive species 3 3 2 effect of suspended matter suspended matter content of sewage is presented in turbidity and indicates the esthetic quality besides the effect on the bacteria suspended matter may influence the path of light and reduce the light penetration in the aqueous media hindering the activation of photocatalyst therefore inhibition of photocatalytic disinfection efficiency by sewage with high turbidity was investigated herein as shown in fig 3d f the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency drastically decreases with an increase of the turbidity value for the lt sewage fig 3d with an original turbidity of 0 6 ntu a reduction of 1 1 log of e coli is found after 30 min of reaction meeting the discharge standard when increasing the turbidity to five times and ten times the original value the disinfection performance significantly decreases to 0 6 and 0 3 log reduction of e coli respectively surpassing the discharge standard a similar effect is obtained in the disinfection of lb sewage after 60 min of reaction fig 3d a 1 98 log reduction of e coli is achieved in lb sewage under the original turbidity of 1 6 ntu and meets the discharge standard when the turbidity value is five and ten times the original value at 8 3 and 15 6 ntu the photocatalytic disinfection of lb sewage sample exhibits a significant inhibition and the treated lb sewage cannot meet the discharge standard it demonstrates the sensitivity of photocatalytic disinfection of sewage to the turbidity level to explain the adverse effect of high turbidity on photocatalysis the uv vis absorption spectra of lb sewage samples with different turbidity were analyzed as shown in fig 3f the increased turbidity results in the higher absorption of light in sewage at the wavelength between around 240 to 800 nm unlike organic matter which has enhanced light absorption at a narrow range suspended matter inhibits the light penetration at almost a full solar spectrum therefore suspended matter in sewage can probably inhibit the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency regardless of the optical property of photocatalysts i e the peak uv vis adsorption 3 3 3 effects of ions the adsorption of inorganic ions on the photocatalyst surface can affect the electrostatic behaviors of photocatalyst and occupy the reactive sites for photocatalysis reaction levchuk et al 2019 marugán et al 2010 the ion concentration is therefore a crucial step in photocatalytic disinfection performance the effect of ions ca2 mg 2 k no3 so4 2 and po4 3 on the photocatalytic disinfection was studied herein in each test the concentration of only one ion was adjusted by adding corresponding salts for example in the test studying the effect of ca2 only the concentration of ca2 was changed all other cations e g mg2 and k are kept unchanged as shown in fig 4 a b the increase of ions shows a slight inhibition of photocatalytic disinfection efficiency to lt sewage even when the ion concentration ca2 mg 2 k no3 so4 2 and po4 3 increases to 10 times the original value rgofentfs shows stable photocatalytic disinfection performance for lt sewage and the treated sewage can meet the discharge standard after 30 min of reaction indicating photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs is not sensitive to the increase of ion concentration under the studied range in lt sewage sample however the stronger effect of ions is found for lb sewage fig 4d e as the ion concentration increases to 5 times the original concentration the treated lb sewage samples cannot meet the discharge standard after 60 min of reaction due to the suppressed photocatalytic disinfection efficiency the insignificant effect of ions on lt sewage is likely due to the lower concentration of ions as the ionic variation is also at a low level compared to the lb sewage the ionic effect on photocatalytic disinfection of lb sewage with higher ion concentration is more significant among the studied ions the multivalent ions ca2 mg2 so4 2 indicates a more significant adverse effect than monovalent ions k and no3 on photocatalytic disinfection performances this is probably due to the stronger adsorption of multivalent ions such as ca2 mg2 and so4 2 than monovalent ions on photocatalyst surface which consequently blocks the reactive sites of photocatalysts for disinfection levchuk et al 2019 marugán et al 2010 the po4 3 concentration in lt sewage 3 9 mg p l is higher than in lb sewage 2 3 mg p l however its effect on the photocatalytic disinfection performance for lt sewage is less significant it may be due to the transformation of po4 3 to h2po4 monovalent under ph of 4 0 in lt sewage as the monovalent h2po4 shows less adsorption on photocatalyst on the contrary hpo4 2 multivalent is dominant under the ph of 7 3 in lb sewage salinity is a characteristic of dissolved inorganic salts and thus it is also considered as the effects of ions in the study to mimic the fluctuation of sewage salinity nacl was added to the sewage sample without changing other ions the effect of nacl on the photocatalytic disinfection was studied to estimate the effect of salinity photocatalytic disinfection efficiency for low salinity sewage lt and lb is stable under the fluctuation of nacl level at a low range as both treated sewage samples meet the discharge standard under the studied nacl levels fig 4c f for the lb sewage although its nacl concentration increases 10 times to a similar cl level of the high salinity hb sewage table 1 the treated lb sewage can still meet the discharge standard without significant variation in the disinfection performance in hb sewage the high salinity is also accompanied by a high concentration of other multivalent ions e g ca2 mg2 so4 2 etc they probably induced synergetic effects on photocatalytic reaction other than the only effect of monovalent ions of na and cl this result further indicates the less inhibition effect of monovalent ions e g na cl on photocatalytic disinfection 3 3 4 effect of ph as an intrinsic characteristic of sewage ph varies in different seasons and may cause fluctuation of photocatalytic disinfection efficiency to study the effect of ph on photocatalytic disinfection the disinfection performance of lt and lb sewage under different ph values was investigated the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency for lt sewage sample with ph values of 4 0 original 5 8 and 7 5 were compared fig 5 a under acidic conditions with ph of 4 and 5 8 the treated sewage sample can meet the discharge standard with a similar reduction of e coli of 1 1 log from 3 8 log cfu 100 ml to around 2 7 log cfu 100 ml when the ph increases to 7 5 although the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency is significantly decreased the discharge standard can still be satisfied with 0 67 log reduction of e coli correspondingly inhibition of disinfection efficiency under the basic condition is also observed in lb sewage as shown in fig 5b the treated lb sewage sample can meet the discharge standard with the e coli reduction of 2 29 log under ph 5 34 and 1 98 log under ph 7 29 after 60 min of simulated solar light irradiation as the condition turned out to be more basic under a ph of 8 50 the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency cannot meet the discharge standard with a decreased result of a 1 28 log reduction of e coli it demonstrates that the efficiency of photocatalytic disinfection could be inhibited by increased ph the ph effects on photocatalytic disinfection may occur by affecting the formation of reactive species and by transforming the electrostatic interaction between bacteria and photocatalyst in acidic conditions h improves the transformation of o2 to h2o2 a strong and relatively stable oxidant for disinfection benefitting the electron hole separation he et al 2019 however as the ph increases with the increase of oh deprotonation of h2o2 occurs forming ho2 to scavenge the reactive species of oh eqs 1 and 2 hence the inhibition of photocatalytic reaction buthiyappan et al 2015 chen et al 2020 in addition ph may influence the surface charges of bacteria and photocatalysts and thus it affects their interaction rincón and pulgarin 2004 1 h2o2 oh h2o ho2 2 ho2 oh h h2o o2 the zeta potential of rgofentfs 1 g l dispersed in di water was measured using a zeta potential analyzer zetaplus laborscience s a greece showing the zero point charge ph phzpc to be 7 9 bacteria are typically negatively charged under ph 3 10 harden and harris 1953 under acidic to neutral condition the rgofentfs has a positively charged surface and attracts the negatively charged bacteria favorable for disinfection its surface charge becomes less positive under basic condition and reversing to a negative charge at ph higher than 7 9 resulting in the rgofentfs being repelled to the negatively charged bacteria unfavorable for disinfection 3 3 5 effect of do level the do level of sewage is dependent on the weather of the stws in this study the do level of the sewage sample was reduced to an unsaturated condition of around 4 and 6 mg l by nitrogen stripping since the saturated do of lt and lb sewage samples was around 8 mg l under the ambient conditions in the lab as shown in fig 5c d the reduction of do level results in inhibition of photocatalytic disinfection performance however lt sewage can better tolerate the decrease of do level compared with lb sewage for the lt sewage sample fig 5c although a substantial decrease of do to 4 mg l leads to a weakened disinfection performance after 30 min of reaction the treated sewage sample could still meet the discharge standard under the do over the range of 4 0 to 8 2 mg l however as the do level decreases to 6 2 mg l the treated lb sewage sample could not meet the discharge standard after 60 min of reaction as illustrated in fig 5d the lower tolerance of photocatalytic disinfection to the decrease of do level in lb sewage is likely due to the higher disinfection efficiency required for compliance with the discharge standard the inhibition may be due to the role of dissolved oxygen in the reaction as it is the precursor of the reactive species of o2 and h2o2 eqs 3 and 4 the formation of reactive species is inhibited under low do level and hence hindering the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency chong et al 2010b 3 o2 e o2 4 2 o2 2h o2 h2o2 3 4 reusability of magnetic rgofentfs a benefit of magnetic photocatalysis is the reusability and green property of the photocatalyst materials to reuse the magnetic photocatalysts after treatment efficient separation from treated sewage is required the magnetic core fe3o4 sio2 of rgofentfs enables easy separation as shown in fig s5 80 of rgofentfs is successfully separated from the di water after 10 s in the presence of a magnet 200 mt the magnetic separation efficiency reached 99 after 5 min and stabilized with a slight increase to 99 6 after 10 min due to the excellent magnetic property when exposed to an external magnetic field rgofentfs exhibits the potential for easy and efficient separation from treated sewage after the reaction and can then be reused for subsequent disinfection treatment to evaluate the stability of the photocatalyst and its potential for cycling in the low salinity lt and lb sewage the photocatalytic disinfection performance of rgofentfs for three cycles of reaction were studied as shown in fig 6 a lt sewage sample after photocatalytic disinfection reaction using rgofentfs achieves a e coli reduction of 1 1 log 1 04 log and 1 0 log after each cycle of 30 min reaction respectively for the three cycles of reaction the treated lt sewage samples all meet the discharge standard of 1500 cfu 100 ml of e coli similarly a good cycling performance is also obtained in the disinfection of lb sewage sample fig 6b the cycling photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs is stable exhibiting e coli reduction of 1 97 log 1 92 log and 1 97 log after each cycle of the 60 min reaction under simulated solar light for each cycle the treated lb sewage samples meet the discharge standard indicating that rgofentfs retains a stable performance in photocatalytic disinfection of both lt and lb sewage stable performance is probably due to the structural stability of the photocatalyst therefore rgofentfs before and after the cycling reaction in lb sewage was analyzed through xrd and raman analysis as presented in fig s6 and discussed in text s11 rgofentfs exhibits good crystalline stability and stable rgo structure after 3 cycles of photocatalytic disinfection of sewage accordingly the consistent cycling performance demonstrates the potential of green magnetic rgofentfs for reuse in photocatalytic disinfection of low salinity sewage 3 5 toxicity assessment of treated sewage samples and rgofentfs in real application after treatment photocatalyst materials are separated from the treated sewage for recycle and the treated sewage is then discharged to marine water therefore assessing the impacts of treated sewage on the ecosystem is necessary to evaluate the practical potential of the technology for real sewage additionally although rgofentfs can be sufficiently separated evaluating its toxic impact on the ecosystem can better eliminate any anxiety from the public concerning the technology the impacts of photocatalyst and treated sewage on phytoplankton are determined by monitoring the phytoplankton density and further predicting their potential impacts on the ecosystem miller et al 2010 after the photocatalytic disinfection reaction 30 min for lt sewage and 60 min for lb sewage rgofentfs was magnetically separated from the treated sewage samples which met the discharge standard the impacts of the treated sewage untreated sewage and di water sample to show the impact of salinity change to the phytoplankton are shown in fig 7 a b the gradual reduction of the phytoplankton density in the control samples without addition is due to the natural decay behavior of phytoplankton in both tests of lt fig 7a and lb fig 7b sewage samples the development of phytoplankton density in the test samples with the addition of di water untreated sewage and treated sewage has the same pattern as that of the control sample without any addition a slight decrease after 24 h in lt and lb sewage samples is observed comparing the samples with the sewage treated and untreated addition and the samples with di water addition no significant difference is observed during the monitoring period indicating that the decrease after 24 h is probably due to the variation of the living environment but not toxicity induced by sewage sample after 48 h no significant difference of the phytoplankton density is observed comparing the test samples with the addition of di water untreated sewage and treated sewage with the control sample illustrating the insignificant effect of the addition to the phytoplankton in seawater it proves the nontoxicity of the sewage sample to the phytoplankton especially of the sewage after photocatalytic disinfection treatment no adverse effect is found on the phytoplankton under the dilution ratio of discharge effluent to seawater indicating the potential of the green application of photocatalytic disinfection of sewage a similar observation was obtained in the assessment of rgofentfs fig 7c after 48 h the introduction of rgofentfs at a dosage of 3 g l shows no significant change to the phytoplankton density compared to the control sample indicating the insignificant effect of rgofentfs at a dosage equal or lower than 3 g l on phytoplankton in seawater the effect of rgofentfs 3 g l exposure on the standard species e coli atcc 15597 cultured in the lab using the method described in text s9 was also studied to reinforce the toxicity assessment of rgofentfs fig s7 no significant change in the density of e coli was observed between the test sample and the control suggesting rgofentfs is safe to use the negligible effects on phytoplankton which supports the ecosystem as the base of aquatic food webs indicate the non toxicity of the treated sewage both lt and lb and rgofentfs to the ecosystem demonstrating that photocatalytic disinfection of sewage using rgofentfs 3 g l is feasible without unfavorably influencing the water body 4 conclusions the green photocatalytic disinfection of real sewage using solar light driven reusable magnetic photocatalyst rgofentfs was synthesized and evaluated and the toxicity of the photocatalyst and the treated sewage was assessed sewage characteristics have major effects on photocatalytic disinfection the potential of photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs for the four sewage samples follows the sequence lt lb hb hc being in line with their water qualities in descending order as the low salinity sewage samples lt and lb have better water quality than the high salinity sewage samples low salinity sewage has higher potential for the photocatalytic disinfection treatment around 20 min and 45 min of photocatalytic disinfection are required for lt and lb sewage samples to meet the discharge standard and no bacterial regrowth has been observed in the treated sewage after 48 h however photocatalytic disinfection of hb and hc sewage samples which are high salinity sewage with poorer water quality remains a challenge according to relatively long reaction time and low disinfection efficiency organic matter presented in toc suspended matter presented in turbidity ph and do level are found to significantly influence the photocatalytic disinfection performance multivalent ions such as ca2 mg2 so4 2 have more significant adverse effects than monovalent ions na k cl and no3 on the photocatalytic disinfection of low salinity sewage after secondary biological treatment but not on low salinity sewage after tertiary treatment considering the effects of sewage characteristics should be an imperative step when evaluating the potential of photocatalytic disinfection process for application ignoring these effects on photocatalytic disinfection of sewage may cause misleading conclusions of the technology s practicality rgofentfs shows good reusability over three cycles for photocatalytic disinfection of low salinity sewage samples both tertiary and secondary under simulated solar light irradiation in the toxicity assessment using phytoplankton in seawater as an indicator rgofentfs 3 g l and the treated low salinity sewage both after tertiary and secondary treatment demonstrate insignificant adverse effects on the ecosystem it demonstrates the potential of photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs for the green and safe application in real sewage

17258,to evaluate the green photocatalytic disinfection for practical applications disinfection of different types of real sewage using magnetic photocatalyst rgo fe n tio2 fe3o4 sio2 rgofentfs under simulated solar light was investigated low salinity sewage after tertiary treatment low salinity sewage after secondary biological treatment high salinity sewage after secondary biological treatment and high salinity sewage after chemically enhanced primary treatment the classification of the sewage as high and low salinity is based on the regions of sewage source that use seawater and freshwater for toilet flushing respectively it shows potential of solar light driven photocatalytic disinfection in low salinity sewage around 20 min for sewage after tertiary treatment and 45 min for sewage after secondary treatment of photocatalytic disinfection are required for sewage to meet the discharge standard and no bacterial regrowth is observed in the treated sewage after 48 h however due to the poorer water quality the high salinity sewage requires a relatively long reaction time more than 240 min to meet the discharge standard showing minimal practical significance further the complex characteristics of real sewage such as organic matter suspended matter multivalent ions ph and do level significantly influence photocatalytic disinfection and should be carefully reviewed in evaluating the photocatalytic disinfection of sewage besides rgofentfs shows a good reusability over three cycles for photocatalytic disinfection of low salinity sewage samples moreover the non toxicity indicated by phytoplankton in seawater of both rgofentfs 3 g l and treated low salinity sewage demonstrates the feasibility of the practical application of photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs under irradiation of solar light graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photocatalytic disinfection real sewage solar light tio2 toxicity assessment sewage characteristics 1 introduction pathogenic microbes in sewage may cause waterborne diseases to human beings and wildlife to prevent the spread of disease and to safeguard human health disinfection treatment is necessary for the sewage treatment process to reduce microbes e g e coli a representative type of bacteria in wastewater to a level in compliance with the discharge standards conventional disinfection methods such as chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet irradiation have limitations of either being chemical or energy intensive with the formation of toxic disinfection by products khadgi et al 2017 sun et al 2014 wang et al 2018 as an alternative disinfection technology photocatalysis has attracted wide attention due to its environmental sustainability good performance and capability of harnessing green energy wang et al 2017 it offers the possibility of using the abundant and renewable solar light energy in sewage disinfection treatment tio2 has been one of the most explored photocatalysts over the past few decades due to its physicochemical inertness nontoxicity and low price asahi et al 2014 coto et al 2017 levchuk et al 2019 li et al 2016 however limitations such as restricted activity to uv light and high recombination of charge carriers have restricted tio2 s practical applications asahi et al 2014 li et al 2015 li et al 2016 doping is a facile method to narrow tio2 s bandgap for the activity under an extended light spectrum after metal and non metal e g fe and n codoping the light spectrum that activates tio2 can be extended from the uv region to include visible light as well thus allowing the codoped tio2 to be activated under solar light kalantari et al 2017 kim et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 in addition the high recombination of charge carriers is another factor that limits the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 as the separated charge carriers are involved in the formation of reactive species during the photocatalytic disinfection reaction asahi et al 2014 combination of tio2 with reduced graphene oxide rgo which is a carbon based material with high conductivity allows the migration of photocatalytically generated electrons from the bulk of the tio2 to rgo sheets and subsequently the composite surface and hence hindering the recombination and improving the photocatalytic efficiency liu et al 2018 for the photocatalytic disinfection of water and sewage using tio2 based photocatalysts a slurry system with photocatalyst particles dispersed in the solution offers enhanced reactive sites for higher photocatalytic efficiency chong et al 2010a however the separation of the photocatalyst from treated solution is a challenge hence the induction of magnetic property to the tio2 composites by combining with magnetic fe3o4 sio2 core is highly beneficial for the easy and effective separation of tio2 based photocatalysts from treated sewage he et al 2019 accordingly solar light driven magnetic rgo fe n tio2 fe3o4 sio2 rgofentfs was developed for photocatalytic disinfection other than the photocatalysts in the process of photocatalytic disinfection of sewage microbes is another crucial issue schneider et al 2014 smith and rodrigues 2015 focus should be placed on both the photocatalysts and sewage characteristics for a comprehensive understanding of photocatalytic disinfection process research studies aiming at the development of photocatalyst materials have been carried out rahimi et al 2015 yang et al 2018 zeng et al 2017 moreover the practical application of the technology is a concern lado ribeiro et al 2019 moreno andrés et al 2020 ribeiro et al 2019 rincón and pulgarin 2004 sreeja and shetty k 2017 to explore the practical application of photocatalytic disinfection investigation conducted with real sewage is required as water characteristics can influence the photocatalytic disinfection performance chong et al 2010a chong et al 2010b horovitz et al 2018 levchuk et al 2019 rincón and pulgarin 2004 understanding the effects of the sewage characteristics on photocatalytic disinfection in real sewage informs and guides decisions regarding how much the technology can tolerate fluctuation in sewage characteristics after disinfection treatment the treated sewage is then discharged to marine water the toxicity assessment of the treated sewage discharged to the ecosystem is also a vital section in the evaluation of a technology seubert et al 2017 in addition photocatalyst materials may be discharged with the effluent to the environment even after the separation of the materials from the treated sewage understanding the effects of the photocatalysts on the marine system is beneficial to a comprehensive evaluation of the technology toxicity assessment of the technology other than sewage treatment is also a trend of recent study aruoja et al 2009 rueda marquez et al 2020 sendra et al 2017 phytoplankton is highly productive in coastal ecosystems and comprises the base for the coastal food webs with a wide distribution miller et al 2010 as a primary specie of the food web in the ecosystem phytoplankton has been used as pollution indicator species in toxicity assessment due to its high surface volume ratio phytoplankton can rapidly obtain equilibrium with the surroundings and quickly respond to suspended toxicants with high uptake miller et al 2010 the impacts of photocatalyst and treated sewage on phytoplankton can predict their potential effects on the ecosystem in which phytoplankton forms the basis of the food webs in this study the photocatalytic disinfection performance of rgofentfs was evaluated in four different sewage effluents collected from local stws covering typical treatment types 1 low salinity sewage after tertiary treatment lt 2 low salinity sewage after secondary biological treatment lb 3 high salinity sewage after secondary biological treatment hb and 4 high salinity sewage after chemically enhanced primary treatment hc in hong kong some regions use seawater to flush toilets while others use freshwater therefore sewage for local stws is typically classified as high salinity for regions using seawater flushing and low salinity for regions using freshwater flushing thus sewage in this study is also classified based on high low salinity the effects of the water characteristics organic matter suspended matter inorganic ions ph and dissolved oxygen level of lt and lb sewage samples on the photocatalytic disinfection performance under simulated solar light were studied to evaluate the potential application of rgofentfs in a real environment besides the reusability of rgofentfs over three cycles for photocatalytic disinfection of low salinity sewage samples was investigated last but not least the toxicity of rgofentfs and sewage before and after photocatalytic disinfection reaction on the ecosystem was assessed by a bioassay test using phytoplankton in seawater as an indicator 2 methodology 2 1 synthesis and characterization of rgofentfs all chemicals used in this study are listed in text s1 and were used as received without further purification rgofentfs was synthesized through a multi step method as described in text s2 briefly magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles were firstly synthesized through a coprecipitation method and then coated with sio2 via the modified stöber method obtaining the magnetic fe3o4 sio2 he et al 2019 secondly the magnetic core was combined with the fe n codoped tio2 by sol gel method and subsequently combined with graphene oxide finally calcination of the obtained material was performed to crystalize fe n tio2 structure and to reduce graphene oxide obtaining rgofentfs was characterized as described in text s3 2 2 collection and characterization of sewage samples different types of sewage samples were taken from four stws low salinity sewage after tertiary treatment lt low salinity sewage after secondary treatment lb high salinity sewage after secondary biological treatment hb and high salinity sewage after chemically enhanced primary treatment i e flocculation process using ferric chloride and polymer hc they cover the typical types of sewage in hong kong the sampling point in each stws was upstream of the disinfection operation unit after the effluent of tertiary secondary cept treatment process the collection procedure and preservation were conducted as described in text s4 the characteristics of sewage samples were measured following the methods described in text s5 2 3 photocatalytic disinfection test 2 3 1 experimental apparatus in the photocatalytic disinfection reaction rgofentfs particles was suspended in 50 ml of sewage by vigorous stirring in a 125 ml conical flask under the irradiation of a solar simulator 300 w xenon light pls sxe300uv perfectlight technology beijing with an air mass 1 5 global filter simulating the solar irradiation the experimental setup is demonstrated in fig s1 the sewage temperature during the reaction was maintained using a fan at about 25 c the simulated solar light has an irradiation intensity 816 w m2 and a light spectrum fig s2 similar to authentic solar light 2 3 2 photocatalytic disinfection in sewage the photocatalytic disinfection performance for different types of sewage was studied using the sewage samples within one week after collection the sewage samples were used for experiments as collected without pre treatment the dosage of rgofentfs used in the photocatalytic disinfection of the lt sample was 1 g l for lb sewage the effect of dosage 1 2 3 and 4 g l was studied 3 g l was selected for the photocatalytic disinfection of hb and hc sewage samples since this study concerns real sewage for practical applications specific discharge standards of e coli table s1 are used as criteria for evaluating the photocatalytic disinfection performance the discharge standards of e coli are 1500 cfu 100 ml for lt and lb sewage 15 000 cfu 100 ml for hb sewage and 900 000 cfu 100 ml for hc sewage hkdsd 2020a b in addition to evaluate the impact of solar light irradiation on the bacteria in the sewage samples light control tests were performed under the same experimental conditions of the photocatalytic disinfection without the addition of rgofentfs after disinfection the bacterial regrowth was also examined rgofentfs was magnetically separated from the treated sewage sample which was subsequently kept in the dark at room temperature the e coli density was measured after 24 h and 48 h to monitor the bacterial regrowth besides as described in text s6 rgofentfs was used for three cycles of reaction to study its reusability in real sewage the tests of photocatalytic disinfection in this study were conducted in triplicate 2 3 3 effects of sewage characteristics on photocatalytic disinfection compared to hb and hc sewage samples lt and lb sewage samples require short reaction times of photocatalytic disinfection to meet their specific discharge standards indicating the application potential of the technology for these two types of sewage therefore the effects of sewage characteristics on the photocatalytic disinfection were studied for only lt and lb but not hb and hc samples for tests studying the sewage characteristics effects a new batch of lt and lb sewage samples characterized as summarized in table s2 were collected the sewage samples for experiments were prepared by adjusting the characteristic value and adding cultured intrinsic e coli as described in text s7 1 only one parameter was adjusted in each test and the variation of characteristics was based on the initial value in the sewage samples as shown in table s3 and table s4 2 due to the natural decay of bacteria e coli was isolated from the sewage samples cultured then added to the source sewage to maintain consistent initial e coli densities 3 8 log and 5 1 log cfu 100 ml for the lt and lb sewage samples respectively other experimental conditions were consistent with that of photocatalytic disinfection the dosages of rgofentfs for photocatalytic disinfection of the lt and lb sewage were 1 and 3 g l respectively 2 3 4 bacteria enumeration density of e coli was measured through the membrane filtration technique using m lauryl sulfate broth as the selective medium for e coli hkepd 1991 this method is described in detailed in text s8 2 4 toxicity assessment using phytoplankton as an indicator the toxicity effects of the photocatalyst and sewage samples were determined by studying their impacts on the phytoplankton density compared to that of the control and further predicting their potential impacts on the ecosystem miller et al 2010 seawater containing phytoplankton without any addition was used as the control sample a sample with di water addition was employed to determine the impact of the salinity reduction due to the dilution of seawater phytoplankton collection and sample preparation for toxicity assessment were conducted as described in text s9 the volume ratio of the addition untreated treated sewage and di water to seawater was 1 10 as shown in table s5 the tests were conducted with three parallel measurements for each data point n 3 2 5 data analysis data of the experiments were analyzed using anova analysis statistically significant differences between the groups of data are identified by the p value no asterisk p 0 05 no statistically significant differences p 0 05 significant different p 0 01 highly significant different p 0 001 extremely significant different 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization 3 1 1 characterizations of sewage samples four typical sewage samples lt lb hb and hc have been characterized as summarized in table 1 due to the more advanced treatment process the lt sewage sample has the most satisfactory quality with the lowest organic content presented in toc tss turbidity as well as the lowest initial e coli density overall the water quality of the collected sewage samples follows the descending order of lt lb hb hc the detailed comparison was described in text s10 3 1 2 characterization of rgofentfs 3 1 2 1 uv vis the optical property of rgofentfs was determined by measuring the uv vis drs as shown in fig 1 a compared to pristine tio2 which can absorb only uv light asahi et al 2014 the absorption spectrum of rgofentfs is extended to visible light region with particularly broad absorption peak from 300 to 550 nm this suggests rgofentfs has a solar light driven property which covers both the uv and visible regions 3 1 2 2 xrd and vsm the crystalline structures of fe3o4 and rgofentfs were analyzed using xrd fig 1b the xrd pattern of fe3o4 indexes its cubic phase with the characteristic diffraction peaks of 35 5 44 6 57 3 and 62 5 matching the jcpds card 72 2303 in the rgofentfs curve major diffraction peaks at 25 4 38 4 47 8 54 6 and 65 1 matching the pattern of jcpds card 73 1764 evidence the crystalline structure of anatase tio2 in the rgofentfs composite he et al 2019 due to the shielding of the outer layer of the tio2 based structure of the composites some fe3o4 peaks of this spectrum are weakened or eliminated only the peaks corresponding to fe3o4 at 44 6 and 62 5 are detected on the other hand the magnetic property of rgofentfs provided by fe3o4 indicates its presence in the composite fig 1c rgofentfs is superparamagnetic with a saturation magnetization value of 3 64 emu g a property that gains facile magnetic separation of the photocatalyst from the treated aqueous media he et al 2019 3 1 2 3 raman the rgo component of the composite was analyzed by raman microscopy fig 1d with two representative characteristic peaks of the d band and g band at around 1350 and 1580 cm 1 for the graphene structure materials the intensities of these two bands have been employed to determine the disorder and defects in the graphene structure lópez díaz et al 2017 xu et al 2018 in the reduction of graphene oxide oxygen functional groups are removed by chemical or thermal treatment the graphene structure probably loss some carbon atoms connected to the oxygen functional groups resulting in the formation of defects and disorder a higher id ig indicates the stronger disorder and defects caused by the reduction of graphene oxide an id ig value of higher than 1 typically indicates the successful reduction of graphene oxide lópez díaz et al 2017 xu et al 2018 rgofentfs has an id ig of 1 14 suggesting the reduction of go after the thermal treatment and presence of rgo in the composites 3 2 photocatalytic disinfection of sewage 3 2 1 photocatalytic disinfection of different types of sewage the photocatalytic disinfection performance of rgofentfs was evaluated in sewage effluent samples collected from four typical stws which cover the typical local treatment types lt lb hb and hc the lt sewage samples can meet the discharge standard of 1500 cfu 100 ml of e coli after photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs 1 g l after around 20 min under simulated solar light fig 2 a this shows the potential of photocatalytic disinfection for application in lt sewage under natural solar irradiation for sewage with poorer water quality presented in higher characteristic values a higher dosage for the reaction may be needed to overcome the adverse effects of the poorer water quality on the photocatalytic performance as it provides more surface reactive sites for reaction and introduces a higher disinfection capacity however photocatalyst particles themselves induce light scattering effect which on the other hand may reduce the incident light to the photocatalyst surface to study the effect of the rgofentfs dosage on poorer quality sewage photocatalytic disinfection of lb sewage under dosages of 1 2 3 and 4 g l were compared fig s3 in lb sewage photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of rgofentfs is improved with the increase of dosage whose value is below 3 g l but is inhibited as the dosage further increased to 4 g l therefore a dosage of 3 g l was used for sewage of poorer quality i e lb hb and hc except for the poor disinfection performance for hc sewage fig 2d both lb and hb sewage samples fig 2b c could meet the discharge standard after 45 and 240 min of photocatalytic disinfection reaction respectively using rgofentfs under simulated solar light compared to the results of the light control tests fig 2 the presence of rgofentfs significantly improves the disinfection performance for lt lb and hb sewage under simulated solar light indicating the photocatalytic capacity of rgofentfs for disinfection of sewage and decrease of e coli density was not observed in hc sewage in the light control different performances in disinfection of different types of sewage samples may be due to the specific sewage characteristics the decrease of photocatalytic disinfection efficacy follows the descending order of sewage quality the characteristic parameters of sewage samples as shown in table 1 can be classified into three main groups organic matter i e toc and tn suspended matter i e tss turbidity and bacterial density and ions cations and anions among the four sewage samples hc sewage has the highest content for all parameters which may lead to the inefficient photocatalytic disinfection whereas the lt sewage sample has the best quality according to its lowest organic and suspended matter as well as the lowest e coli density these conditions allow the treated lt sewage meet the bacterial discharge standard in a very feasible reaction time of less than 30 min lb sewage sample has a higher contents of organic and suspended matter and one order of magnitude higher for e coli density than lt sewage sample resulting in a longer reaction time for meeting the discharge standard although hb and lb sewage samples are both effluent after secondary treatment the hb sewage sample exhibits higher organic and suspended matter and higher ion concentration this property is in line with the lower photocatalytic disinfection efficiency the key parameters of sewage characteristics classified in the above three main groups should be emphasized as they can interfere with the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency firstly the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency of the photocatalyst is achieved by the photocatalytic generation of the reactive species which attack and induce the disinfection of the bacteria he et al 2019 organic matter in the sewage could compete with e coli for the reactive species and hence suppressing the disinfection performance garcía fernández et al 2015 secondly suspended matter causing high turbidity can reduce the penetration of light over a wide range that activates the photocatalyst for disinfection and may also shield the bacteria and protect them from attacks by reactive species chatterjee et al 2017 garcía fernández et al 2015 thirdly ions in the solution may attach to the photocatalyst surface and occupy the reactive sites levchuk et al 2019 marugán et al 2010 and consequently impact the surface charges of both bacteria and photocatalyst liang et al 2017 therefore for the practical application of photocatalytic disinfection of sewage it is important to get a comprehensive assessment of the photocatalytic disinfection process by understanding the influence of the sewage characteristics on the disinfection performance in addition due to the relatively long reaction time and the low efficiency the technology indicates low potential for hb and hc sewage samples therefore further investigation bacterial regrowth and the effects of sewage characteristics was not conducted for hb and hc sewage 3 2 2 bacterial regrowth for the evaluation of the photocatalytic disinfection it is necessary to monitor the disinfected bacteria and to verify the irreversible bacterial cell damage caused by the disinfection reaction as shown in fig 2e f the e coli density of lt and lb sewage samples both meet the discharge standard of 1500 cfu 100 ml after 30 min and 60 min of photocatalytic disinfection reaction respectively after the photocatalytic disinfection reaction the e coli densities of these treated sewage samples lt and lb show a gradual decrease which is likely due to natural decay of the bacteria maraccini et al 2016 and maintain the values under the discharge standards after 24 h and 48 h indicating that the disinfected e coli does not regrow in the lt and lb sewage samples and the e coli density of these sewage samples can maintain a level lower than the discharge standard fig 2e f 3 3 effects of sewage characteristics on photocatalytic disinfection photocatalytic disinfection treatment is a process of interaction between the activated photocatalytic materials and the sewage other than the photocatalyst the sewage characteristics also affect the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency as discussed in the photocatalytic disinfection of different types of sewage the sewage characteristics organic matter suspended solids inorganic ions ph and do level are involved in the variation of disinfection performances using rgofentfs therefore the effects of the sewage characteristics on the photocatalytic disinfection were evaluated for the lt and lb sewage samples which can meet the discharge bacterial standard after a relatively short reaction time characterization of sewage samples for this section is shown in table s2 the experimental conditions and rgofentfs dosages 1 and 3 g l for lt and lb sewage samples respectively were the same as that in section 3 2 3 3 1 effect of organic matter disinfection performance was studied under varied toc values adjusted by adding commercial nom as they present the content of organic matter of sewage fig 3 a shows that the suppression of disinfection efficiency for lt sewage is tolerable when toc is twice the original value at 10 1 mg l as under this condition the treated lt sewage can meet the discharge standard however a further increase in toc leads to the failure in meeting the discharge standard compared to the lt sewage photocatalytic disinfection of lb sewage samples is more sensitive to toc increase fig 3b for lb sewage the disinfection efficiency falls from the e coli reduction of 1 98 log to 1 41 log and could not meet the discharge standard when the toc is twice the original value further inhibition of photocatalytic disinfection performance is also found as toc increases the photocatalytic disinfection performance of rgofentfs for lt and lb sewage samples is significantly suppressed by the increase of organic matter organic matter may affect the photocatalytic disinfection in two ways to absorb and block out incident light on the photocatalyst surface korshin et al 2009 and to compete with bacteria for photocatalytically generated reactive species garcía fernández et al 2015 to prove this hypothesis the absorption of incident light by increased toc by adding nom was analyzed by measuring the light absorption spectrum of lb sewage and the competition of nom for reactive species was investigated by analyzing the change of nom as illustrated in fig 3c the increase of toc enhances the absorption of the uv vis spectrum of the lb sewage especially for light below 500 nm this absorption light range unfortunately overlaps the absorption peak of rgofentfs at 250 500 nm fig 1a and hence blocking out the incident light for rgofentfs excitation and resulting in lower photocatalytic disinfection efficiency besides weakening the incident light the dissolved organic matter may compete with bacteria for reactive species the changes of nom during the reaction were monitored by excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence spectroscopy eem images in fig s4 shows the fluorescent intensity of humic substance a representative nom component in red circles excitation emission of 350 430 nm decreases after 60 min of reaction in both original and toc adjusted lb sewage the degradation of humic substance during the photocatalytic disinfection of lb sewage indicates the attack of reactive species to humic substance and its competition with bacteria for reactive species 3 3 2 effect of suspended matter suspended matter content of sewage is presented in turbidity and indicates the esthetic quality besides the effect on the bacteria suspended matter may influence the path of light and reduce the light penetration in the aqueous media hindering the activation of photocatalyst therefore inhibition of photocatalytic disinfection efficiency by sewage with high turbidity was investigated herein as shown in fig 3d f the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency drastically decreases with an increase of the turbidity value for the lt sewage fig 3d with an original turbidity of 0 6 ntu a reduction of 1 1 log of e coli is found after 30 min of reaction meeting the discharge standard when increasing the turbidity to five times and ten times the original value the disinfection performance significantly decreases to 0 6 and 0 3 log reduction of e coli respectively surpassing the discharge standard a similar effect is obtained in the disinfection of lb sewage after 60 min of reaction fig 3d a 1 98 log reduction of e coli is achieved in lb sewage under the original turbidity of 1 6 ntu and meets the discharge standard when the turbidity value is five and ten times the original value at 8 3 and 15 6 ntu the photocatalytic disinfection of lb sewage sample exhibits a significant inhibition and the treated lb sewage cannot meet the discharge standard it demonstrates the sensitivity of photocatalytic disinfection of sewage to the turbidity level to explain the adverse effect of high turbidity on photocatalysis the uv vis absorption spectra of lb sewage samples with different turbidity were analyzed as shown in fig 3f the increased turbidity results in the higher absorption of light in sewage at the wavelength between around 240 to 800 nm unlike organic matter which has enhanced light absorption at a narrow range suspended matter inhibits the light penetration at almost a full solar spectrum therefore suspended matter in sewage can probably inhibit the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency regardless of the optical property of photocatalysts i e the peak uv vis adsorption 3 3 3 effects of ions the adsorption of inorganic ions on the photocatalyst surface can affect the electrostatic behaviors of photocatalyst and occupy the reactive sites for photocatalysis reaction levchuk et al 2019 marugán et al 2010 the ion concentration is therefore a crucial step in photocatalytic disinfection performance the effect of ions ca2 mg 2 k no3 so4 2 and po4 3 on the photocatalytic disinfection was studied herein in each test the concentration of only one ion was adjusted by adding corresponding salts for example in the test studying the effect of ca2 only the concentration of ca2 was changed all other cations e g mg2 and k are kept unchanged as shown in fig 4 a b the increase of ions shows a slight inhibition of photocatalytic disinfection efficiency to lt sewage even when the ion concentration ca2 mg 2 k no3 so4 2 and po4 3 increases to 10 times the original value rgofentfs shows stable photocatalytic disinfection performance for lt sewage and the treated sewage can meet the discharge standard after 30 min of reaction indicating photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs is not sensitive to the increase of ion concentration under the studied range in lt sewage sample however the stronger effect of ions is found for lb sewage fig 4d e as the ion concentration increases to 5 times the original concentration the treated lb sewage samples cannot meet the discharge standard after 60 min of reaction due to the suppressed photocatalytic disinfection efficiency the insignificant effect of ions on lt sewage is likely due to the lower concentration of ions as the ionic variation is also at a low level compared to the lb sewage the ionic effect on photocatalytic disinfection of lb sewage with higher ion concentration is more significant among the studied ions the multivalent ions ca2 mg2 so4 2 indicates a more significant adverse effect than monovalent ions k and no3 on photocatalytic disinfection performances this is probably due to the stronger adsorption of multivalent ions such as ca2 mg2 and so4 2 than monovalent ions on photocatalyst surface which consequently blocks the reactive sites of photocatalysts for disinfection levchuk et al 2019 marugán et al 2010 the po4 3 concentration in lt sewage 3 9 mg p l is higher than in lb sewage 2 3 mg p l however its effect on the photocatalytic disinfection performance for lt sewage is less significant it may be due to the transformation of po4 3 to h2po4 monovalent under ph of 4 0 in lt sewage as the monovalent h2po4 shows less adsorption on photocatalyst on the contrary hpo4 2 multivalent is dominant under the ph of 7 3 in lb sewage salinity is a characteristic of dissolved inorganic salts and thus it is also considered as the effects of ions in the study to mimic the fluctuation of sewage salinity nacl was added to the sewage sample without changing other ions the effect of nacl on the photocatalytic disinfection was studied to estimate the effect of salinity photocatalytic disinfection efficiency for low salinity sewage lt and lb is stable under the fluctuation of nacl level at a low range as both treated sewage samples meet the discharge standard under the studied nacl levels fig 4c f for the lb sewage although its nacl concentration increases 10 times to a similar cl level of the high salinity hb sewage table 1 the treated lb sewage can still meet the discharge standard without significant variation in the disinfection performance in hb sewage the high salinity is also accompanied by a high concentration of other multivalent ions e g ca2 mg2 so4 2 etc they probably induced synergetic effects on photocatalytic reaction other than the only effect of monovalent ions of na and cl this result further indicates the less inhibition effect of monovalent ions e g na cl on photocatalytic disinfection 3 3 4 effect of ph as an intrinsic characteristic of sewage ph varies in different seasons and may cause fluctuation of photocatalytic disinfection efficiency to study the effect of ph on photocatalytic disinfection the disinfection performance of lt and lb sewage under different ph values was investigated the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency for lt sewage sample with ph values of 4 0 original 5 8 and 7 5 were compared fig 5 a under acidic conditions with ph of 4 and 5 8 the treated sewage sample can meet the discharge standard with a similar reduction of e coli of 1 1 log from 3 8 log cfu 100 ml to around 2 7 log cfu 100 ml when the ph increases to 7 5 although the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency is significantly decreased the discharge standard can still be satisfied with 0 67 log reduction of e coli correspondingly inhibition of disinfection efficiency under the basic condition is also observed in lb sewage as shown in fig 5b the treated lb sewage sample can meet the discharge standard with the e coli reduction of 2 29 log under ph 5 34 and 1 98 log under ph 7 29 after 60 min of simulated solar light irradiation as the condition turned out to be more basic under a ph of 8 50 the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency cannot meet the discharge standard with a decreased result of a 1 28 log reduction of e coli it demonstrates that the efficiency of photocatalytic disinfection could be inhibited by increased ph the ph effects on photocatalytic disinfection may occur by affecting the formation of reactive species and by transforming the electrostatic interaction between bacteria and photocatalyst in acidic conditions h improves the transformation of o2 to h2o2 a strong and relatively stable oxidant for disinfection benefitting the electron hole separation he et al 2019 however as the ph increases with the increase of oh deprotonation of h2o2 occurs forming ho2 to scavenge the reactive species of oh eqs 1 and 2 hence the inhibition of photocatalytic reaction buthiyappan et al 2015 chen et al 2020 in addition ph may influence the surface charges of bacteria and photocatalysts and thus it affects their interaction rincón and pulgarin 2004 1 h2o2 oh h2o ho2 2 ho2 oh h h2o o2 the zeta potential of rgofentfs 1 g l dispersed in di water was measured using a zeta potential analyzer zetaplus laborscience s a greece showing the zero point charge ph phzpc to be 7 9 bacteria are typically negatively charged under ph 3 10 harden and harris 1953 under acidic to neutral condition the rgofentfs has a positively charged surface and attracts the negatively charged bacteria favorable for disinfection its surface charge becomes less positive under basic condition and reversing to a negative charge at ph higher than 7 9 resulting in the rgofentfs being repelled to the negatively charged bacteria unfavorable for disinfection 3 3 5 effect of do level the do level of sewage is dependent on the weather of the stws in this study the do level of the sewage sample was reduced to an unsaturated condition of around 4 and 6 mg l by nitrogen stripping since the saturated do of lt and lb sewage samples was around 8 mg l under the ambient conditions in the lab as shown in fig 5c d the reduction of do level results in inhibition of photocatalytic disinfection performance however lt sewage can better tolerate the decrease of do level compared with lb sewage for the lt sewage sample fig 5c although a substantial decrease of do to 4 mg l leads to a weakened disinfection performance after 30 min of reaction the treated sewage sample could still meet the discharge standard under the do over the range of 4 0 to 8 2 mg l however as the do level decreases to 6 2 mg l the treated lb sewage sample could not meet the discharge standard after 60 min of reaction as illustrated in fig 5d the lower tolerance of photocatalytic disinfection to the decrease of do level in lb sewage is likely due to the higher disinfection efficiency required for compliance with the discharge standard the inhibition may be due to the role of dissolved oxygen in the reaction as it is the precursor of the reactive species of o2 and h2o2 eqs 3 and 4 the formation of reactive species is inhibited under low do level and hence hindering the photocatalytic disinfection efficiency chong et al 2010b 3 o2 e o2 4 2 o2 2h o2 h2o2 3 4 reusability of magnetic rgofentfs a benefit of magnetic photocatalysis is the reusability and green property of the photocatalyst materials to reuse the magnetic photocatalysts after treatment efficient separation from treated sewage is required the magnetic core fe3o4 sio2 of rgofentfs enables easy separation as shown in fig s5 80 of rgofentfs is successfully separated from the di water after 10 s in the presence of a magnet 200 mt the magnetic separation efficiency reached 99 after 5 min and stabilized with a slight increase to 99 6 after 10 min due to the excellent magnetic property when exposed to an external magnetic field rgofentfs exhibits the potential for easy and efficient separation from treated sewage after the reaction and can then be reused for subsequent disinfection treatment to evaluate the stability of the photocatalyst and its potential for cycling in the low salinity lt and lb sewage the photocatalytic disinfection performance of rgofentfs for three cycles of reaction were studied as shown in fig 6 a lt sewage sample after photocatalytic disinfection reaction using rgofentfs achieves a e coli reduction of 1 1 log 1 04 log and 1 0 log after each cycle of 30 min reaction respectively for the three cycles of reaction the treated lt sewage samples all meet the discharge standard of 1500 cfu 100 ml of e coli similarly a good cycling performance is also obtained in the disinfection of lb sewage sample fig 6b the cycling photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs is stable exhibiting e coli reduction of 1 97 log 1 92 log and 1 97 log after each cycle of the 60 min reaction under simulated solar light for each cycle the treated lb sewage samples meet the discharge standard indicating that rgofentfs retains a stable performance in photocatalytic disinfection of both lt and lb sewage stable performance is probably due to the structural stability of the photocatalyst therefore rgofentfs before and after the cycling reaction in lb sewage was analyzed through xrd and raman analysis as presented in fig s6 and discussed in text s11 rgofentfs exhibits good crystalline stability and stable rgo structure after 3 cycles of photocatalytic disinfection of sewage accordingly the consistent cycling performance demonstrates the potential of green magnetic rgofentfs for reuse in photocatalytic disinfection of low salinity sewage 3 5 toxicity assessment of treated sewage samples and rgofentfs in real application after treatment photocatalyst materials are separated from the treated sewage for recycle and the treated sewage is then discharged to marine water therefore assessing the impacts of treated sewage on the ecosystem is necessary to evaluate the practical potential of the technology for real sewage additionally although rgofentfs can be sufficiently separated evaluating its toxic impact on the ecosystem can better eliminate any anxiety from the public concerning the technology the impacts of photocatalyst and treated sewage on phytoplankton are determined by monitoring the phytoplankton density and further predicting their potential impacts on the ecosystem miller et al 2010 after the photocatalytic disinfection reaction 30 min for lt sewage and 60 min for lb sewage rgofentfs was magnetically separated from the treated sewage samples which met the discharge standard the impacts of the treated sewage untreated sewage and di water sample to show the impact of salinity change to the phytoplankton are shown in fig 7 a b the gradual reduction of the phytoplankton density in the control samples without addition is due to the natural decay behavior of phytoplankton in both tests of lt fig 7a and lb fig 7b sewage samples the development of phytoplankton density in the test samples with the addition of di water untreated sewage and treated sewage has the same pattern as that of the control sample without any addition a slight decrease after 24 h in lt and lb sewage samples is observed comparing the samples with the sewage treated and untreated addition and the samples with di water addition no significant difference is observed during the monitoring period indicating that the decrease after 24 h is probably due to the variation of the living environment but not toxicity induced by sewage sample after 48 h no significant difference of the phytoplankton density is observed comparing the test samples with the addition of di water untreated sewage and treated sewage with the control sample illustrating the insignificant effect of the addition to the phytoplankton in seawater it proves the nontoxicity of the sewage sample to the phytoplankton especially of the sewage after photocatalytic disinfection treatment no adverse effect is found on the phytoplankton under the dilution ratio of discharge effluent to seawater indicating the potential of the green application of photocatalytic disinfection of sewage a similar observation was obtained in the assessment of rgofentfs fig 7c after 48 h the introduction of rgofentfs at a dosage of 3 g l shows no significant change to the phytoplankton density compared to the control sample indicating the insignificant effect of rgofentfs at a dosage equal or lower than 3 g l on phytoplankton in seawater the effect of rgofentfs 3 g l exposure on the standard species e coli atcc 15597 cultured in the lab using the method described in text s9 was also studied to reinforce the toxicity assessment of rgofentfs fig s7 no significant change in the density of e coli was observed between the test sample and the control suggesting rgofentfs is safe to use the negligible effects on phytoplankton which supports the ecosystem as the base of aquatic food webs indicate the non toxicity of the treated sewage both lt and lb and rgofentfs to the ecosystem demonstrating that photocatalytic disinfection of sewage using rgofentfs 3 g l is feasible without unfavorably influencing the water body 4 conclusions the green photocatalytic disinfection of real sewage using solar light driven reusable magnetic photocatalyst rgofentfs was synthesized and evaluated and the toxicity of the photocatalyst and the treated sewage was assessed sewage characteristics have major effects on photocatalytic disinfection the potential of photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs for the four sewage samples follows the sequence lt lb hb hc being in line with their water qualities in descending order as the low salinity sewage samples lt and lb have better water quality than the high salinity sewage samples low salinity sewage has higher potential for the photocatalytic disinfection treatment around 20 min and 45 min of photocatalytic disinfection are required for lt and lb sewage samples to meet the discharge standard and no bacterial regrowth has been observed in the treated sewage after 48 h however photocatalytic disinfection of hb and hc sewage samples which are high salinity sewage with poorer water quality remains a challenge according to relatively long reaction time and low disinfection efficiency organic matter presented in toc suspended matter presented in turbidity ph and do level are found to significantly influence the photocatalytic disinfection performance multivalent ions such as ca2 mg2 so4 2 have more significant adverse effects than monovalent ions na k cl and no3 on the photocatalytic disinfection of low salinity sewage after secondary biological treatment but not on low salinity sewage after tertiary treatment considering the effects of sewage characteristics should be an imperative step when evaluating the potential of photocatalytic disinfection process for application ignoring these effects on photocatalytic disinfection of sewage may cause misleading conclusions of the technology s practicality rgofentfs shows good reusability over three cycles for photocatalytic disinfection of low salinity sewage samples both tertiary and secondary under simulated solar light irradiation in the toxicity assessment using phytoplankton in seawater as an indicator rgofentfs 3 g l and the treated low salinity sewage both after tertiary and secondary treatment demonstrate insignificant adverse effects on the ecosystem it demonstrates the potential of photocatalytic disinfection using rgofentfs for the green and safe application in real sewage

17259,it is well known that using chlorine dioxide clo2 as a disinfectant inevitably produces a common disinfection byproducts chlorite clo2 in this study we found that uv photolysis after clo2 disinfection can effectively eliminate both clo2 and contaminants of emerging concern cecs however the kinetic mechanisms of uv clo2 process destructing cecs as well as transformation of clo2 in uv clo2 system are not clear yet therefore we systematically investigated the uv clo2 system to assist us appropriately design this process under optimal operational conditions in this work we first investigated the impact of water matrix conditions i e ph bicarbonate and natural organic matter nom and clo2 dosage on the uv clo2 process we found that bicarbonate and nom have inhibition effects while lower ph and higher clo2 dosage have enhancement effects besides hydroxyl radical ho and reactive chlorine species rcs are generated from uv clo2 system and rcs are main contributors to cbz degradation then we proposed a possible degradation pathway of cbz based on the determined products from experiments additionally we found that photolysis of clo2 resulted in the generation of chloride cl and chlorate clo3 as the clo2 dosage increases the yield of clo3 increased while that of cl decreased finally we elucidated the second order rate constant of the target organic compound with ho has a strong correlation with the formation of clo3 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection byproducts hydroxyl radicals reactive chlorine species rate constants chlorate 1 introduction disinfection is typically the final stage in drinking water treatment process in order to reduce the spread of various diseases in water and ensure the safety of water quality akin et al 1982 cheung 2017 xu et al 2019 chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant in drinking water disinfection richardson et al 2007 richardson and postigo 2015 because chlorine is very effective to inactivate most microorganisms and oxidizing contaminants in aqueous phase mian et al 2018 however using chlorine as the disinfectant result in the formation of toxic chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps e g trihalomethane halonitromethane bu et al 2020 chen et al 2019 wu et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 therefore researchers have been seeking some other disinfectants as the alternatives of chlorine in recent decades among the various alternatives disinfectant chloramines and chlorine dioxide clo2 are commonly used to inhibit the production of regulated dbps i e trichloromethanes and haloacetic acids shen and andrews 2011 yan et al 2018 however using chloramines as disinfectant inevitably generates nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps and n dbps are typically more harmful to human health than the regulated dbps li et al 2019 richardson et al 2007 wu et al 2021 therefore some european countries such as germany and italy have banned the use of chloramine in drinking water disinfection mian et al 2018 compared with chlorine and chloramines clo2 is a better choice as a disinfectant because of the stronger oxidation ability and less formation of organic chlorinated dbps hua and reckhow 2007 longley et al 1980 disinfection using clo2 has been successfully applied in many small scale drinking water treatment plants gan et al 2019 pereira et al 2008 yang et al 2013 however korn et al reported inorganic dbps namely clo2 and clo3 are generated during clo2 disinfection process korn et al 2002 and these inorganic dpbs can destroy red blood cells and subsequently cause methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia sorlini et al 2014 the regulated concentration of clo2 in us and china are 1000 and 700 µg l 1 and clo3 is regulated as 700 µg l 1 in china al otoum et al 2016 chu et al 2011 linder et al 2006 it has been reported that 30 70 of clo2 converts to clo2 and no more than 10 of clo2 converts to clo3 gan et al 2019 hence the removal or utilization of clo2 in drinking water is critical during the clo2 disinfection process recently some studies reported that uv clo2 can be used to remove nitrogen oxides in gaseous system hao et al 2019a hao et al 2019b the major elementary reactions of uv clo2 process are summarized in eqs 1 11 hao et al 2019b yang et al 2017a in this study we applied the uv clo2 process to the aqueous system in addition uv clo2 belongs to the uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops and uv based aops are one of the most promising and effective technology to destruct the contaminants of emerging concern cecs in aqueous phase bu et al 2016 lai et al 2017 sun et al 2018 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2017b yao et al 2018 as shown in eqs 1 11 the photolysis of clo2 generates reactive radicals including ho clo and cl these reactive radicals can destroy cecs at room temperature and atmosphere pressure overall uv photolysis of clo2 can not only inhibit the generation of clo2 from clo2 but also can effectively remove cecs so far the research on cecs degradation by uv clo2 process was still blank and the degradation mechanism contribution of reactive species and the transformation clo2

system 4 we investigated the transformation mechanism of clo2 in this work carbamazepine cbz is chosen as the target cec because cbz is difficult to be removed by conventional water treatment and hence cbz can be detected in various water environments and even in drinking water ali et al 2018 jemutai kimosop et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals materials used in this study were purchased from chemical companies and text s1 provided detailed information all solutions were prepared with ultra pure water 18 2 mω cm produced by a milli q water purification system 2 2 experimental procedures all experiments were performed in a specially designed cylindrical reactor a low pressure mercury lamp 10 w 2 6 10 5 e s 1 l 1 gph212t5l4 heraeus noblelight with 254 nm wavelength was fixed in the center of the reactor and four quartz tubes were equidistantly surrounded by the mercury lamp in the reaction solution the reactor was equipped with magnetic stirrer and heat abstractor the experimental temperatures were controlled at 25 1 all uv lamps required experiments were preheated for 20 min in advance to guarantee the stable uv output to ensure the prepared solution was evenly dispersed a magnetic stirrer was added to the quartz tube and the magnetic stirrer of the reactor was turned on in advance in the experiment a 4 0 mm phosphate buffer solution was used to adjust the ph and the ph of the solution was fixed at 6 0 7 0 or 8 0 a certain amount of naclo2 solution 8 80 μm was added to a 5 μm cbz water sample to investigate the effects of hco3 and nom on cbz degradation in the uv clo2 process hco3 1 8 mm and nom 1 4 mg c l 1 were added to the water samples we used a pipette to suck 100 μl of water sample in a quartz tube at regular intervals during the reaction and immediately quench the sucked solution with excess na2s2o3 all trials were performed twice and error bars represent standard deviation of the average values 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of clo2 were measured using a residual chlorine analyzer dr3900 hach usa the concentrations of cl clo2 and clo3 were measured using a dionex aquion ion chromatograph dionex usa equipped with an ionpac as22 anionic column the concentrations of cbz were measured by a hplc agilent 1260 usa coupled with a symmetry c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm and a uv detector set at 286 nm the degradation byproducts of cbz during the uv clo2 process were identified via an hplc 1260 tandem triple quadrupole qqq mass spectrometry 6420 agilent using esi positive mode the detailed information was described in the si text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of cbz by uv clo2 system to confirm the possibility of the co existence of cbz and clo2 cbz was oxidized by clo2 in the dark condition for 120 min orange triangles in fig 1 a as shown cbz 3 23 was rarely removed by clo2 reconfirming the recalcitrance of cbz to clo2 hey et al 2012 huber et al 2005 then solutions were reconfigured using the generated clo2 and the remaining cbz concentration after dark reaction to avoid the influence of residual clo2 and uv was used to photolyze the solution blue triangles in fig 1 a we investigated the degradation of cbz by clo2 only uv only and uv clo2 respectively as shown in fig 1 b the removal of cbz by uv irradiation clo2 oxidation and uv clo2 were 4 31 0 65 and 78 55 respectively cbz is rarely oxidized by clo2 because clo2 has poor oxidation ability cbz is hardly degraded by uv photolysis because cbz has very low quantum yield as 0 00167 m einstein 1 stefan and bolton 2005 cbz is effectively degraded by the uv clo2 process because the quantum yield of clo2 at 254 nm is as high as1 53 m einstein 1 hao et al 2019a and hence results in the formation of reactive species i e ho clo and cl to destruct cbz 3 2 effects of clo2 dosages and ph fig 2 a shows the effect of clo2 dosage on the degradation of cbz in the uv clo2 process as the initial concentration of clo2 increases from 8 to 24 40 56 and 80 µm the corresponding degradations of cbz in the uv clo2 process achieve as 49 12 66 32 72 16 76 91 and 78 55 respectively therefore higher clo2 dosage enhanced cbz degradation in the uv clo2 process this phenomenon can attribute to the fact that higher clo2 dosage can promote the generation of reactive radicals i e ho clo and cl to destroy cbz however the degradation rate of cbz increases slower as the clo2 dosages is above than 40 µm which may because the reactive radicals are scavenged by residual clo2 eqs 12 and 13 eriksen et al 1981 klaning et al 1985 12 h o cl o 2 o h cl o 2 k 7 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 13 h o cl o 2 cl o 3 h k 4 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 fig 2 b shows the effect of ph on the degradation of cbz in the uv clo2 process as the ph increases from 6 to 8 the degradation of cbz in the uv clo2 process decreases from 83 75 to 69 64 the results indicates that cbz degradation is more easily to be degraded in acidic conditions than neutral and alkaline conditions this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that clo2 has higher quantum yield under acidic conditions than neutral and alkaline conditions karpelvelleitner et al 1992 it has been reported that the quantum yields of clo2 are 1 53 1 18 and 0 92 m einstein 1 at 254 nm at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively cosson and ernst 1994 3 3 contribution of reactive species to cbz degradation ho and rcs including cl and clo are considered as the main reactive species in the uv clo2 system hao et al 2019a to determine the relative contribution of ho rcs and uv degrading cbz nitrobenzene nb is introduced into the uv clo2 process to indirectly obtain the ho concentration eqs 14 and 15 wu et al 2016 it is generally known that nb is often used as the ho probe because it only reacted with ho k h o nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 and its reaction with other reactive species can be negligible fang et al 2014 since cbz cannot be degraded by clo2 shown in si fig s1 the oxidation of cbz by uv clo2 system can be expressed in eq 16 eq 16 can be time integrated in eq 17 bu et al 2018 14 d n b d t k h o n b h o n b 15 0 t h o d t l n n b 0 n b t k h o n b 16 d c b z d t k u v c b z c b z k h o c b z h o c b z

irradiation and rcs oxidation respectively k h o cbz and k rcs cbz represent the second order rate constants of cbz by ho 2 05 109 m 1 s 1 vogna et al 2004 and h o represent the steady state concentration of ho which can be calculated by the ho probe according to the above equation the contributions of ho rcs and uv to cbz degradation were calculated as shown in si table s1 fig 3 shows the contributions of ho rcs and uv degrading cbz in the uv clo2 process at different solution ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 the results show that under different ph neither ho nor uv are the main contributors to degrade cbz as the ph increases from 6 0 to 7 0 and 8 0 the contribution of rcs oxidizing cbz decreases from 64 11 to 60 46 and 52 93 of their initial concentrations accordingly the ph value had the greatest influence on rcs in uv clo2 system 3 4 effects of bicarbonate and natural organic matter bicarbonate carbonate hco3 co3 2 is a common anion in aqueous phase and hco3 co3 2 is ubiquitous in real water system xiang et al 2018 the concentration of hco3 co3 2 in natural water was as high as 200 mg ml 1 ma and graham 2000 fig 4 a shows the effect of hco3 co3 2 i e hco3 co3 2 concentration is 1 3 4 and 8 mm on the degradation of cbz by uv clo2 it is obvious that the degradation of cbz gradually decreases as the hco3 dosages increases from 1 to 8 mm this phenomena because hco3 co3 2 has higher reaction rate with cl and ho 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 respectively and the generated co3 can react with clo2 with a rate constant of 3 4 107 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 huie et al 1991 therefore the presence of hco3 co3 2 inhibits the degradation of cbz in uv clo2 system similarity the presence of natural organic matter nom in uv clo2 system also inhibited the degradation of cbz and the results are presented in fig 4 b the degradation of cbz by uv clo2 decreases from 78 55 to 47 15 as nom concentration increases from 0 to 4 mg c l 1 nom inhibits the degradation of cbz because 1 nom can react with cl and ho 1 3 10 4 mg l 1 s 1 and 2 5 10 4 mg l 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 lee et al 2007 and 2 nom can absorb uv light which affects the absorption of uv by clo2 and further reduces the quantum yield bu et al 2018 3 5 degradation pathways and ecotoxicity of cbz lc ms ms detected eight predominant products of cbz in the uv clo2 system in positive mode and the isomers were distinguished according to retention time the relevant experimental data and proposed structure of the predominant products are listed in si table s2 fig 5 shows the general trend of the peak area of oxidation products with time among the above products only the abundance of compound with m z of 271 0633 p4 increased with time while another eight products showed a tendency to increase and then decrease in addition the abundance of compound with m z of 251 0815 p8 is the highest among all products it is notable that the products detected in this study are only a small part of cbz products in uv clo2 system and there are more unknown byproducts based on the above mentioned nine predominant products the preliminary degradation pathway of cbz in uv clo2 system is proposed in fig 6 accordingly the reaction sites during the degradation of cbz by uv clo2 process are located on the central heterocyclic ring and aromatic ring of cbz first the benzene ring on cbz is replaced by rcs attack to form cl substituted product p4 bu et al 2018 another reaction pathway of cbz is attacked by ho to form p7 and p1 martínez et al 2011 p8 may be generated by intramolecular cyclization of p7 and the aldehyde on p8 is oxidized to the corresponding carboxyl to form p9 keen et al 2012 pan et al 2017 in addition p1 underwent hydroxylation to form p2 wang et al 2016 p2 can form p6 in different ways 1 p2 may be transformed into p3 and p6 during contraction process zhu et al 2019 2 p2 may undergo carboxylation to produce p5 and then decarboxylate to form p6 golan rozen et al 2015 eventually the above products may be further oxidized into products of small molecules by using the ecosar program the toxicity of cbz and its degradation products was calculated as summarized in si fig s2 the toxicity of the compound can be classified as harmless harmful toxic and highly toxic based upon 100 mg l 1 lc50 ec50 chv 100 lc50 ec50 chv 10 mg l 1 10 lc50 ec50 chv 1 0 mg l 1 1 0 mg l 1 lc50 ec50 chv tay and madehi 2015 except for products p3 p4 and p6 the toxicity of cbz degradation products showed a downward trend although products p3 p4 and p6 are more toxic than cbz they may continue to degrade into less toxic products therefore in our future research the toxicity of cbz and its products will be further studied 3 6 the formation of cl and clo3 in by uv clo2 system fig 7 a shows the time dependent evolution of clo2 cl and clo3 during the degradation of cbz in uv clo2 process it is obvious that the clo2 concentration gradually decreases while cl and clo3 concentrations gradually increase after reaction of 5 min the initial concentration of clo2 achieves 80 µm and the concentrations of clo2 cl and clo3 are 5 43 47 53 and 19 91 µm respectively the difference between total amount of added clo2 with the detected chloride ion forms clo2 cl and clo3 is considered as organic chlorine 7 13 µm that formed during uv clo2 treatment of cbz fig 7 b shows the impact of clo2 dosage on the generation of cl and clo3 during the degradation of cbz in the uv clo2 process as the initial clo2 concentration increases from 8 to 24 40 56 and 80 µm the corresponding cl percentage yields percentage yields formed product µm consumed clo2 µm 100 are 72 26 72 25 68 48 67 02 and 63 78 while the clo3 percentage yields are 8 50 14 34 21 05 23 40 and 26 72 respectively the results indicate that the yield of clo3 increases as clo2 dosage increases of interest the yield of clo3 increases slowly as clo2 dosages is above than 40 µm which is similar to the degradation of cbz shown in fig 2 a this phenomenon can be ascribed to that ho can be scavenged by excess clo2 eqs 12 and 13 3 7 investigation on the formation mechanism of clo3 clo2 can be removed by uv irradiation however clo3 would be generated via the photolysis of clo2 which is also harmful to human therefore it is important to investigate the formation mechanism of clo3 in uv clo2 system and avoid the yield of clo3 as we discussed before the ho generated from uv clo2 system can not only react with cbz but also can react with clo2 to generate clo2 then the generated clo2 further reacts with ho to produce clo3 it is interesting to note that ho can react with clo2 clo2 and cbz with similar rate constants of 109 m 1 s 1 and hence these reactions have a competitive relationship therefore we assumed that formation of clo3 may be associated with the second order rate constants of ho with selected compounds in order to verify our assumption 14 compounds oxcarbazepine oxc bisphenol a bpa phenol ph sulfadiazine sd sulfamethazine smt ibuprofen ibp atenolol atl nalidixic acid nax metronidazole met benzoic acid bza nitrobenzene nb ornidazole orn atrazine atz and carbamazepine cbz were selected as the model compounds to assess the formation of cl and clo3 during uv clo2 process concentration of each compounds were set at 5 μm the ph of the solution was controlled at 7 0 with 4 0 mm phosphate buffer and 40 μm naclo2 was added to the solution analysis of cl clo2 and clo3 were conducted at reaction of 0 and 5 min respectively fig 8 a shows the percentage yield of cl and clo3 in uv clo2 system in the presence of these 14 compounds to further explore the relationship between the second order rate constant of ho with target compounds k h o r and the yield of clo3 the common logarithm log k h o r was used zhou et al 2019 the values of k h o r and log k h o r were shown in si table s3 fig 8 b shows the relationship between log k h o r and clo3 percentage yield the results show that there is a high correlation between log k h o r and the yield of clo3 r 2 0 7031 therefore compounds of higher second order rate constant with ho generally leads to lower formation of clo3 in uv clo2 system 4 conclusion in this work photolysis of clo2 by uv are confirmed found to simultaneously remove cbz and clo2 the following conclusions can be obtained 1 increasing clo2 dosage can promote the degradation of cbz but the reactive radicals were scavenged by excess clo2 the presence of hco3 and nom inhibit cbz degradation 2 decreasing ph can enhance cbz degradation in uv clo2 system because the quantum yield of uv clo2 system under acidic conditions is higher than that of neutral and alkaline meanwhile rcs have always been the main contributor to cbz degradation under all investigated ph values 3 nine cbz transformation products were identified and a possible degradation pathway of cbz was proposed 4 increasing clo2 dosage can enhance the yield of clo3 but inhibit the yield of cl

17259,it is well known that using chlorine dioxide clo2 as a disinfectant inevitably produces a common disinfection byproducts chlorite clo2 in this study we found that uv photolysis after clo2 disinfection can effectively eliminate both clo2 and contaminants of emerging concern cecs however the kinetic mechanisms of uv clo2 process destructing cecs as well as transformation of clo2 in uv clo2 system are not clear yet therefore we systematically investigated the uv clo2 system to assist us appropriately design this process under optimal operational conditions in this work we first investigated the impact of water matrix conditions i e ph bicarbonate and natural organic matter nom and clo2 dosage on the uv clo2 process we found that bicarbonate and nom have inhibition effects while lower ph and higher clo2 dosage have enhancement effects besides hydroxyl radical ho and reactive chlorine species rcs are generated from uv clo2 system and rcs are main contributors to cbz degradation then we proposed a possible degradation pathway of cbz based on the determined products from experiments additionally we found that photolysis of clo2 resulted in the generation of chloride cl and chlorate clo3 as the clo2 dosage increases the yield of clo3 increased while that of cl decreased finally we elucidated the second order rate constant of the target organic compound with ho has a strong correlation with the formation of clo3 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection byproducts hydroxyl radicals reactive chlorine species rate constants chlorate 1 introduction disinfection is typically the final stage in drinking water treatment process in order to reduce the spread of various diseases in water and ensure the safety of water quality akin et al 1982 cheung 2017 xu et al 2019 chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant in drinking water disinfection richardson et al 2007 richardson and postigo 2015 because chlorine is very effective to inactivate most microorganisms and oxidizing contaminants in aqueous phase mian et al 2018 however using chlorine as the disinfectant result in the formation of toxic chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps e g trihalomethane halonitromethane bu et al 2020 chen et al 2019 wu et al 2020 yang et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 therefore researchers have been seeking some other disinfectants as the alternatives of chlorine in recent decades among the various alternatives disinfectant chloramines and chlorine dioxide clo2 are commonly used to inhibit the production of regulated dbps i e trichloromethanes and haloacetic acids shen and andrews 2011 yan et al 2018 however using chloramines as disinfectant inevitably generates nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps and n dbps are typically more harmful to human health than the regulated dbps li et al 2019 richardson et al 2007 wu et al 2021 therefore some european countries such as germany and italy have banned the use of chloramine in drinking water disinfection mian et al 2018 compared with chlorine and chloramines clo2 is a better choice as a disinfectant because of the stronger oxidation ability and less formation of organic chlorinated dbps hua and reckhow 2007 longley et al 1980 disinfection using clo2 has been successfully applied in many small scale drinking water treatment plants gan et al 2019 pereira et al 2008 yang et al 2013 however korn et al reported inorganic dbps namely clo2 and clo3 are generated during clo2 disinfection process korn et al 2002 and these inorganic dpbs can destroy red blood cells and subsequently cause methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia sorlini et al 2014 the regulated concentration of clo2 in us and china are 1000 and 700 µg l 1 and clo3 is regulated as 700 µg l 1 in china al otoum et al 2016 chu et al 2011 linder et al 2006 it has been reported that 30 70 of clo2 converts to clo2 and no more than 10 of clo2 converts to clo3 gan et al 2019 hence the removal or utilization of clo2 in drinking water is critical during the clo2 disinfection process recently some studies reported that uv clo2 can be used to remove nitrogen oxides in gaseous system hao et al 2019a hao et al 2019b the major elementary reactions of uv clo2 process are summarized in eqs 1 11 hao et al 2019b yang et al 2017a in this study we applied the uv clo2 process to the aqueous system in addition uv clo2 belongs to the uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops and uv based aops are one of the most promising and effective technology to destruct the contaminants of emerging concern cecs in aqueous phase bu et al 2016 lai et al 2017 sun et al 2018 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2017b yao et al 2018 as shown in eqs 1 11 the photolysis of clo2 generates reactive radicals including ho clo and cl these reactive radicals can destroy cecs at room temperature and atmosphere pressure overall uv photolysis of clo2 can not only inhibit the generation of clo2 from clo2 but also can effectively remove cecs so far the research on cecs degradation by uv clo2 process was still blank and the degradation mechanism contribution of reactive species and the transformation clo2

cbz by the uv clo2 process 2 we calculated the contribution of different reactive species to the degradation of cbz in the uv clo2 process 3 we proposed a degradation pathway of cbz in the uv clo2 system 4 we investigated the transformation mechanism of clo2 in this work carbamazepine cbz is chosen as the target cec because cbz is difficult to be removed by conventional water treatment and hence cbz can be detected in various water environments and even in drinking water ali et al 2018 jemutai kimosop et al 2020 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals materials used in this study were purchased from chemical companies and text s1 provided detailed information all solutions were prepared with ultra pure water 18 2 mω cm produced by a milli q water purification system 2 2 experimental procedures all experiments were performed in a specially designed cylindrical reactor a low pressure mercury lamp 10 w 2 6 10 5 e s 1 l 1 gph212t5l4 heraeus noblelight with 254 nm wavelength was fixed in the center of the reactor and four quartz tubes were equidistantly surrounded by the mercury lamp in the reaction solution the reactor was equipped with magnetic stirrer and heat abstractor the experimental temperatures were controlled at 25 1 all uv lamps required experiments were preheated for 20 min in advance to guarantee the stable uv output to ensure the prepared solution was evenly dispersed a magnetic stirrer was added to the quartz tube and the magnetic stirrer of the reactor was turned on in advance in the experiment a 4 0 mm phosphate buffer solution was used to adjust the ph and the ph of the solution was fixed at 6 0 7 0 or 8 0 a certain amount of naclo2 solution 8 80 μm was added to a 5 μm cbz water sample to investigate the effects of hco3 and nom on cbz degradation in the uv clo2 process hco3 1 8 mm and nom 1 4 mg c l 1 were added to the water samples we used a pipette to suck 100 μl of water sample in a quartz tube at regular intervals during the reaction and immediately quench the sucked solution with excess na2s2o3 all trials were performed twice and error bars represent standard deviation of the average values 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of clo2 were measured using a residual chlorine analyzer dr3900 hach usa the concentrations of cl clo2 and clo3 were measured using a dionex aquion ion chromatograph dionex usa equipped with an ionpac as22 anionic column the concentrations of cbz were measured by a hplc agilent 1260 usa coupled with a symmetry c18 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 5 μm and a uv detector set at 286 nm the degradation byproducts of cbz during the uv clo2 process were identified via an hplc 1260 tandem triple quadrupole qqq mass spectrometry 6420 agilent using esi positive mode the detailed information was described in the si text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of cbz by uv clo2 system to confirm the possibility of the co existence of cbz and clo2 cbz was oxidized by clo2 in the dark condition for 120 min orange triangles in fig 1 a as shown cbz 3 23 was rarely removed by clo2 reconfirming the recalcitrance of cbz to clo2 hey et al 2012 huber et al 2005 then solutions were reconfigured using the generated clo2 and the remaining cbz concentration after dark reaction to avoid the influence of residual clo2 and uv was used to photolyze the solution blue triangles in fig 1 a we investigated the degradation of cbz by clo2 only uv only and uv clo2 respectively as shown in fig 1 b the removal of cbz by uv irradiation clo2 oxidation and uv clo2 were 4 31 0 65 and 78 55 respectively cbz is rarely oxidized by clo2 because clo2 has poor oxidation ability cbz is hardly degraded by uv photolysis because cbz has very low quantum yield as 0 00167 m einstein 1 stefan and bolton 2005 cbz is effectively degraded by the uv clo2 process because the quantum yield of clo2 at 254 nm is as high as1 53 m einstein 1 hao et al 2019a and hence results in the formation of reactive species i e ho clo and cl to destruct cbz 3 2 effects of clo2 dosages and ph fig 2 a shows the effect of clo2 dosage on the degradation of cbz in the uv clo2 process as the initial concentration of clo2 increases from 8 to 24 40 56 and 80 µm the corresponding degradations of cbz in the uv clo2 process achieve as 49 12 66 32 72 16 76 91 and 78 55 respectively therefore higher clo2 dosage enhanced cbz degradation in the uv clo2 process this phenomenon can attribute to the fact that higher clo2 dosage can promote the generation of reactive radicals i e ho clo and cl to destroy cbz however the degradation rate of cbz increases slower as the clo2 dosages is above than 40 µm which may because the reactive radicals are scavenged by residual clo2 eqs 12 and 13 eriksen et al 1981 klaning et al 1985 12 h o cl o 2 o h cl o 2 k 7 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 13 h o cl o 2 cl o 3 h k 4 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 fig 2 b shows the effect of ph on the degradation of cbz in the uv clo2 process as the ph increases from 6 to 8 the degradation of cbz in the uv clo2 process decreases from 83 75 to 69 64 the results indicates that cbz degradation is more easily to be degraded in acidic conditions than neutral and alkaline conditions this phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that clo2 has higher quantum yield under acidic conditions than neutral and alkaline conditions karpelvelleitner et al 1992 it has been reported that the quantum yields of clo2 are 1 53 1 18 and 0 92 m einstein 1 at 254 nm at ph 6 7 and 8 respectively cosson and ernst 1994 3 3 contribution of reactive species to cbz degradation ho and rcs including cl and clo are considered as the main reactive species in the uv clo2 system hao et al 2019a to determine the relative contribution of ho rcs and uv degrading cbz nitrobenzene nb is introduced into the uv clo2 process to indirectly obtain the ho concentration eqs 14 and 15 wu et al 2016 it is generally known that nb is often used as the ho probe because it only reacted with ho k h o nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 and its reaction with other reactive species can be negligible fang et al 2014 since cbz cannot be degraded by clo2 shown in si fig s1 the oxidation of cbz by uv clo2 system can be expressed in eq 16 eq 16 can be time integrated in eq 17 bu et al 2018 14 d n b d t k h o n b h o n b 15 0 t h o d t l n n b 0 n b t k h o n b 16 d c b z d t k u v c b z c b z k h o c b z h o c b z

irradiation and rcs oxidation respectively k h o cbz and k rcs cbz represent the second order rate constants of cbz by ho 2 05 109 m 1 s 1 vogna et al 2004 and h o represent the steady state concentration of ho which can be calculated by the ho probe according to the above equation the contributions of ho rcs and uv to cbz degradation were calculated as shown in si table s1 fig 3 shows the contributions of ho rcs and uv degrading cbz in the uv clo2 process at different solution ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 the results show that under different ph neither ho nor uv are the main contributors to degrade cbz as the ph increases from 6 0 to 7 0 and 8 0 the contribution of rcs oxidizing cbz decreases from 64 11 to 60 46 and 52 93 of their initial concentrations accordingly the ph value had the greatest influence on rcs in uv clo2 system 3 4 effects of bicarbonate and natural organic matter bicarbonate carbonate hco3 co3 2 is a common anion in aqueous phase and hco3 co3 2 is ubiquitous in real water system xiang et al 2018 the concentration of hco3 co3 2 in natural water was as high as 200 mg ml 1 ma and graham 2000 fig 4 a shows the effect of hco3 co3 2 i e hco3 co3 2 concentration is 1 3 4 and 8 mm on the degradation of cbz by uv clo2 it is obvious that the degradation of cbz gradually decreases as the hco3 dosages increases from 1 to 8 mm this phenomena because hco3 co3 2 has higher reaction rate with cl and ho 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 and 8 5 106 m 1 s 1 respectively and the generated co3 can react with clo2 with a rate constant of 3 4 107 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 huie et al 1991 therefore the presence of hco3 co3 2 inhibits the degradation of cbz in uv clo2 system similarity the presence of natural organic matter nom in uv clo2 system also inhibited the degradation of cbz and the results are presented in fig 4 b the degradation of cbz by uv clo2 decreases from 78 55 to 47 15 as nom concentration increases from 0 to 4 mg c l 1 nom inhibits the degradation of cbz because 1 nom can react with cl and ho 1 3 10 4 mg l 1 s 1 and 2 5 10 4 mg l 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 lee et al 2007 and 2 nom can absorb uv light which affects the absorption of uv by clo2 and further reduces the quantum yield bu et al 2018 3 5 degradation pathways and ecotoxicity of cbz lc ms ms detected eight predominant products of cbz in the uv clo2 system in positive mode and the isomers were distinguished according to retention time the relevant experimental data and proposed structure of the predominant products are listed in si table s2 fig 5 shows the general trend of the peak area of oxidation products with time among the above products only the abundance of compound with m z of 271 0633 p4 increased with time while another eight products showed a tendency to increase and then decrease in addition the abundance of compound with m z of 251 0815 p8 is the highest among all products it is notable that the products detected in this study are only a small part of cbz products in uv clo2 system and there are more unknown byproducts based on the above mentioned nine predominant products the preliminary degradation pathway of cbz in uv clo2 system is proposed in fig 6 accordingly the reaction sites during the degradation of cbz by uv clo2 process are located on the central heterocyclic ring and aromatic ring of cbz first the benzene ring on cbz is replaced by rcs attack to form cl substituted product p4 bu et al 2018 another reaction pathway of cbz is attacked by ho to form p7 and p1 martínez et al 2011 p8 may be generated by intramolecular cyclization of p7 and the aldehyde on p8 is oxidized to the corresponding carboxyl to form p9 keen et al 2012 pan et al 2017 in addition p1 underwent hydroxylation to form p2 wang et al 2016 p2 can form p6 in different ways 1 p2 may be transformed into p3 and p6 during contraction process zhu et al 2019 2 p2 may undergo carboxylation to produce p5 and then decarboxylate to form p6 golan rozen et al 2015 eventually the above products may be further oxidized into products of small molecules by using the ecosar program the toxicity of cbz and its degradation products was calculated as summarized in si fig s2 the toxicity of the compound can be classified as harmless harmful toxic and highly toxic based upon 100 mg l 1 lc50 ec50 chv 100 lc50 ec50 chv 10 mg l 1 10 lc50 ec50 chv 1 0 mg l 1 1 0 mg l 1 lc50 ec50 chv tay and madehi 2015 except for products p3 p4 and p6 the toxicity of cbz degradation products showed a downward trend although products p3 p4 and p6 are more toxic than cbz they may continue to degrade into less toxic products therefore in our future research the toxicity of cbz and its products will be further studied 3 6 the formation of cl and clo3 in by uv clo2 system fig 7 a shows the time dependent evolution of clo2 cl and clo3 during the degradation of cbz in uv clo2 process it is obvious that the clo2 concentration gradually decreases while cl and clo3 concentrations gradually increase after reaction of 5 min the initial concentration of clo2 achieves 80 µm and the concentrations of clo2 cl and clo3 are 5 43 47 53 and 19 91 µm respectively the difference between total amount of added clo2 with the detected chloride ion forms clo2 cl and clo3 is considered as organic chlorine 7 13 µm that formed during uv clo2 treatment of cbz fig 7 b shows the impact of clo2 dosage on the generation of cl and clo3 during the degradation of cbz in the uv clo2 process as the initial clo2 concentration increases from 8 to 24 40 56 and 80 µm the corresponding cl percentage yields percentage yields formed product µm consumed clo2 µm 100 are 72 26 72 25 68 48 67 02 and 63 78 while the clo3 percentage yields are 8 50 14 34 21 05 23 40 and 26 72 respectively the results indicate that the yield of clo3 increases as clo2 dosage increases of interest the yield of clo3 increases slowly as clo2 dosages is above than 40 µm which is similar to the degradation of cbz shown in fig 2 a this phenomenon can be ascribed to that ho can be scavenged by excess clo2 eqs 12 and 13 3 7 investigation on the formation mechanism of clo3 clo2 can be removed by uv irradiation however clo3 would be generated via the photolysis of clo2 which is also harmful to human therefore it is important to investigate the formation mechanism of clo3 in uv clo2 system and avoid the yield of clo3 as we discussed before the ho generated from uv clo2 system can not only react with cbz but also can react with clo2 to generate clo2 then the generated clo2 further reacts with ho to produce clo3 it is interesting to note that ho can react with clo2 clo2 and cbz with similar rate constants of 109 m 1 s 1 and hence these reactions have a competitive relationship therefore we assumed that formation of clo3 may be associated with the second order rate constants of ho with selected compounds in order to verify our assumption 14 compounds oxcarbazepine oxc bisphenol a bpa phenol ph sulfadiazine sd sulfamethazine smt ibuprofen ibp atenolol atl nalidixic acid nax metronidazole met benzoic acid bza nitrobenzene nb ornidazole orn atrazine atz and carbamazepine cbz were selected as the model

40 μm naclo2 was added to the solution analysis of cl clo2 and clo3 were conducted at reaction of 0 and 5 min respectively fig 8 a shows the percentage yield of cl and clo3 in uv clo2 system in the presence of these 14 compounds to further explore the relationship between the second order rate constant of ho with target compounds k h o r and the yield of clo3 the common logarithm log k h o r was used zhou et al 2019 the values of k h o r and log k h o r were shown in si table s3 fig 8 b shows the relationship between log k h o r and clo3 percentage yield the results show that there is a high correlation between log k h o r and the yield of clo3 r 2 0 7031 therefore compounds of higher second order rate constant with ho generally leads to lower formation of clo3 in uv clo2 system 4 conclusion in this work photolysis of clo2 by uv are confirmed found to simultaneously remove cbz and clo2 the following conclusions can be obtained 1 increasing clo2 dosage can promote the degradation of cbz but the reactive radicals were scavenged by excess clo2 the presence of hco3 and nom inhibit cbz degradation 2 decreasing ph can enhance cbz degradation in uv clo2 system because
