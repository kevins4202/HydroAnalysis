11880,major challenges facing groundwater management arise mostly from approaches aiming at ensuring water resources sustainability water quality protection and aquifer restoration in many old polluted sites the most challenging practice is the management of decanting contaminated water from flooded shaft that decants into the natural environment pump and treat pat is one of the commonly used techniques in management of groundwater pollution problem simulation optimization s o models have proven to be very useful in appropriate design of an effective pat groundwater remediation system in this study simulation models modflow and mt3dms for groundwater flow and transport respectively and a solving constraint integer program scip optimization algorithm were employed in designing of an effective system for cleaning and controlling pollution coming from hypothetical decanting site simulation models were used to predict the spatial and temporal variation of contaminant plumes and aquifer response to remediation measures scip optimization algorithm on the other hand was applied to determine the optimal solution of the formulated objective function while attaining a set of water quality and head constraints as well as operation bounds results from this study indicated that the optimal pumping rates for the proposed pumping wells met water quality and water head requirements further the obtained results demonstrate the application of scip in conjunction with simulation models as a capable tool in designing an effective groundwater management system and control decanting problem the performance of scip is also compared with genetic algorithm ga and the scip is found to have a better convergence rate than the ga graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater pollution decanting site management s o scip 1 introduction management of groundwater pollution has become a continuing problem for the developed and industrialized world in most worked sites such as mining area and waste disposal sites groundwater quality has declined with low levels of ph high total dissolved solids increased levels of toxic elements concentration and traces of heavy metals mccarthy 2011 naicker et al 2003 bell et al 2001 the effect caused can persist for many years even after polluting activities has stopped both of which can severely compromise the health and safety of nearby communities as well as the environment further the damage caused to environment and eco system are extremely difficult to rectify oelofse 2008 in the recent past incidences of uncontrolled discharge of contaminated water from defunct sites have increasingly been reported to have caused serious environmental problems hobbs 2014 oelofse 2008 mccarthy 2011 the decanting of contaminated water from polluted aquifers is not only associated with water sources pollution but also degradation of soil quality aquatic habitats and for allowing heavy metals to seep into the environment adler and rascher 2007 polluted water not only limits its utilization value but also places an added economic burden on society through both primary treatment costs and secondary impacts on the economy it is in this context that design of cost effective management strategy to manage decanting of contaminated water from polluted aquifer sites becomes vital management of groundwater pollution problem is often aimed at limiting the migration of plume off sites isolate and contain a source area from further leaking or treat polluted aquifer to bring it up to acceptable standards mategaonkar and eldho 2012 meenal and eldho 2012 matott et al 2006 in areas facing decanting of contaminated water management of groundwater involves also lowering of groundwater head to avoid over flowing of contaminated water into pristine environment pump and treat pat is one of the commonly used techniques for remediation of polluted aquifer and lowering of groundwater hydraulic head sreekanth et al 2016 luo et al 2016 mategaonkar and eldho 2012 kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015a meenal and eldho 2012 the process is usually tedious time consuming and expensive therefore optimal design of such system is realized by minimizing the remediation cost total volume pumped and cleanup time to reach the maximum contaminant mass removal while meeting water quality requirements maximum contaminant concentration allowed and water head limits simulation optimization models are increasingly being used to design reliable optimal groundwater management system with an advantage of revealing a lot of details regarding the interaction between social and economic forces and water resource bhattacharjya and datta 2005 ndambuki 2001 coupled s o methods have been successfully applied to identify optimal groundwater management solutions for various pollution problems sreekanth et al 2016 kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015a mategaonkar and eldho 2012 meenal and eldho 2012 sreekanth and datta 2010 2011 in the s o approach simulation models account for physical behavior of groundwater systems whereas optimization models account for optimal management aspects of systems a number of mathematical programming techniques have been used in such optimization problems including but not limited to simulated annealing prakash and datta 2014 genetic algorithms sreekanth et al 2016 luo et al 2016 gad and khalaf 2013 karamouz et al 2005 artificial neural networks karamouz et al 2005 particle swarm optimization mategaonkar and eldho 2012 meenal and eldho 2012 harmony search algorithm luo et al 2014 ayvaz 2010 and firefly algorithm kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015a 2015b all these programs have their strength and weaknesses based on their applicability efficiency and accessibility however in this study solving constraint integer programs scip is applied in designing of an optimal solution to the pollution problem scip has more advantage than most of the conventional solvers previously used in groundwater pollution management problem scip is free and has better convergence capacity attaining global optimal solution in few iterations vigerske and gleixner 2016 berthold et al 2012 girbau llistuella et al 2015 scip was built under the notion of speed resulting into a better convergence attaining global optimal solution in few iterations gamrath et al 2016 vigerske and gleixner 2016 achterberg 2009 its ability to provide optimal solutions has been illustrated in management problems of most complex systems such as gas transport optimization the gas wheel circuit board production energy optimization and supply chain management gamrath et al 2016 vigerske and gleixner 2016 berthold et al 2012 girbau llistuella et al 2015 we present in this study therefore design of optimal groundwater pollution management system for hypothetical decanting site via a simulation optimization approach coupled with scip algorithm the study applies the developed methodology on a modified hypothetical contaminated groundwater system previously found in the literature alexander et al 2018 kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015a chang et al 2012 the study aimed at identification of cost effective and global optimal management strategy that would satisfy imposed water quality and hydraulic head constraints at all monitored points the performance of solving constrain integer program scip optimization algorithm was also compared with genetic algorithm ga 2 methodology in this study simulation models were applied with an optimization technique to determine the optimal solution for groundwater pollution problem under imposed constraints simulation models modflow and mt3dms were employed to simulate the flow and solute transport respectively while the optimization was achieved by the solving constraint integer problem scip algorithm the s o approach determines optimal management strategy from a set of feasible alternative strategies by linking simulation models which predict the system response based on the change of groundwater state variables ayvaz and karahan 2008 das and datta 2001 change in state variables hydraulic head and concentrations were determined as the results of applied stimuli pumping rates at a specific location for a given management period and used in the optimization model as controlling variables these variables were updated based on their corresponding objective function values by the algorithm the updated variables were used in the simulation model as subsequent input values this procedure runs iteratively until the specified convergence criterion was satisfied in the present study an attempt was made to solve groundwater pollution problem by considering two cases with different objectives and number of remediation wells sections 4 2 4 3 the described method was applied on hypothetical contaminated groundwater aquifer modified to represent a realistic aquifer in case 1 cost of remediation was minimized by considering the effect of pumping rate and remediation time case 2 was set with an objective of minimizing total pumping rate by optimizing pumping rate on each of the proposed remediation wells with respect to time in all cases 1 2 groundwater head remaining contaminant concentration and total pumping rate are observed as a set of constraints in total five constraints including concentration head minimum maximum lower and upper boundary of pumping rate and total pumping rates were considered in the mathematical formulation the performance of the scip optimization algorithm in all cases was compared with that of ga results obtained from these cases were presented and discussed based on the effect of remediation time pumped volume decrease in contaminant concentration and groundwater head with relation to cost of remediation case 1 and pumping rate of groundwater case 2 2 1 numerical model formulation 2 1 1 flow equation formulations a two dimensional numerical model modflow harbaugh et al 2000 was used to

solving constraint integer program scip under the opti tool box optimization interface in matlab scip is the combination of the mixed integer program mip and constraint program cp solver to form a constraint mixed integer solver a mixed integer program is defined as mip a b c i given a matrix a r m n vectors b r m and c r n and a set i n 1 n therefore the mip can be represented with the

description of the hypothetical example in this work the s o approach coupled with scip algorithm was applied to a modified hypothetical aquifer system previous used by kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015a to illustrate a groundwater pollution management problem a rectangular 150 by 300 m hypothetical aquifer consisted of a single chemical constituent pollution point and known number of pumping wells was used in this set of experiments the finite difference method was used to discretize the area into 800 uniform grids a schematic description of the hypothetical contaminated aquifer considered for the case study is given in fig 1 the model does not represent any real basin but was formulated to represent a realistic hydrogeology of an aquifer system using general physical features the aquifer system is homogeneous characterized by relatively low hydraulic conductivity the ground surface from the bottom of the aquifer was assumed to be 70 m the direction of flow is towards the right boundary which was maintained with a general hydraulic head of 60 0 m on the left hand boundary and 57 0 m on the right hand boundary fig 2 a plume was developed by assuming a contaminant of known discharge concentration dispersing from a disposal pond for a known simulation period and then removed the plume emanates from a continuous source dispersed by principal of groundwater flow imposed by constant head boundary conditions on the left and right boundaries of the aquifer parallel to the flow direction initially the entire aquifer domain was assumed to be uncontaminated c 0 the details of the aquifer parameters are given in table 1 figs 1 and 2 shows the flow direction dimensions and orientation of the considered domain 4 results 4 1 numerical setup the performance of the proposed simulation optimization approach was tested on two hypothetical cases in the first case the method was used to minimize cost of pumping and treating from three wells in the polluted hypothetical aquifer for this problem it was assumed that the number and location of the pumping wells were known and the main goal was to minimize the cost of remediation pumping and treating by obtaining the optimal pumping rate from the wells for different management period in case 2 the optimal pumping rate was considered as a design variable therefore the objective was to minimize the total pumping rates from wells at different remediation time in this case the decanting problem was captured by including the maximum water head constraint the effect of groundwater table rise during wet season was also introduced by varying the east right hand boundary condition monthly table 3 for both cases the pollution source releases a typical conservative pollutant during the active release periods it was also assumed that the flow system had no uncertainty and all initial and boundary conditions as well as the length of release periods were known table 1 4 2 case 1 minimization of remediation cost in this case an unconfined aquifer was considered with hydraulic head boundaries assigned on the left hl 60 m and right hr 57 m resulting into left to right groundwater flow fig 2 the left and right constant head boundaries provided initial heads for the transient simulation no groundwater flow and zero concentration gradient were considered on the northern and southern boundaries of the aquifer fig 1 simulation began with development of a plume assuming a source that was a disposal pond discharging 100 mg l for a 10 years period initially the entire aquifer domain was assumed to be uncontaminated c 0 the plume emanates from a continuous source and was principally dispersed by groundwater flow imposed by general head boundary conditions on the left and right boundaries of the aquifer parallel to the flow direction fig 2 the concentration distribution after 10 years is shown in fig 3 at the end of 10 years period pumping for remediation mobilized from assigned pumping wells the peak concentration was 100 mg l and allowable concentration c max was 0 5 mg l in all cells the minimum head anywhere in the aquifer was to be greater than 20 m to sustain eco flow the lower and upper bounds on the pumping rates were chosen as 0 and 500 m 3 day three remediation pumps determined based on groundwater direction dispersion time and contaminant source location on the centreline of the field were adopted location of remediation wells were assumed in cells pw1 10 7 pw2 10 10 and pw3 10 13 while concentration and head were monitored in cells 8 7 12 12 10 10 10 13 and 10 16 as shown in fig 3 the aim in this case was to minimize cost of remediation pumping and treating by optimize the total pumping rates from the proposed remediation wells while meeting water quality and hydraulic head requirements in the monitored wells the remediation time number and locations of wells were presumed fixed and only pumping rates were optimized the considered objective function and constraints were formulated as follows 12 m i n i m i z e f a 1 t i 1 m q i γ δ t η h i g l h i 86 4 1 0 5 a 2 t i 1 m q i where f is the objective function for the minimization of remediation system

management period 13 c j t c m a x f o r j 1 n the concentration state of the groundwater system is represented in the optimization model using generated ics from the following eq 14 generated from eq 8 as 14 c j t c j t n o n k τ t i 1 m δ j i t k τ ψ q q i k u t q i k τ t m e α j i k head constraint minimum head constraints drawdown were introduced to protect the ecosystem by avoiding excessive over pumping also maximum head constraint was included to control decanting due to rising of water head therefore the head constraints was formulated as follows 15 h m i n h j t h m a x f o r j 1 n where 16 h j t h j t n o n k τ t i 1 m δ j i t k τ ψ q q i k u t q i k τ t m e β j i k this constraint meant to assure that pumping will not lower water head below the minimum allowable groundwater head h min neither allow the water table to rise above the maximum allowable water head h max eq 15 pumping constraint pumping rates at each proposed remediation well was constrained between some minimum and maximum rates eq 17 the maximum rate was assigned based on the capacity of treatment plant this constraint was formulated as follows 17 q m i n q i q m a x f o r i 1 m further sum of pumping rates from all the wells should also not exceed the capacity of the treatment plant eq 18 was formulated to insure that this limitation was met in all feasible solution 18 i 1 m q q t o t here c j t and h j t are contaminant concentration and head at monitoring location j respectively c max h max and h min are the maximum allowable contaminant concentration maximum hydraulic head and minimum allowable head in the monitoring wells respectively α jik and β jik are the ics at monitoring location j for concentration and head respectively due to pumping from well i for management era k m is the number of pumping wells considered for remediation while n is the number of observation points q min and q max represent lower and upper bound of pumping rate for each pump respectively table 2 illustrates the optimization and constraint parameters used for this case 4 2 2 optimization problem the optimization problem solved here aims of minimizing total pumping while achieving concentration and head constrains and embedded bounds such as capacity of the treatment plant the optimization problem solved therefore was as follows 19 m i n i m i z e f a 1 t i 1 m q i γ δ t η h i g l h i 86 4 1 0 5 a 2 t i 1 m q i subject to 20 k τ t i 1 m α j i k q i b α j f o r j 1 n 21 k τ t i 1 m β j i k q i b β 1 j f o r j 1 n 22 k τ t i 1 m β j i k q i b β 2 j f o r j 1 n 23 q m i n q i

from potential pumping wells located at i b α j is allowable mass removal at point j and is given as c m a x c j n o n b β 1 j is allowable maximum drawdown at point j and is given as h j n o n h m i n b β 2 j is allowable minimum drawdown at point j and is given as h m a x h j n o n c j n o n and h j n o n are background contaminant concentration and hydraulic head at point j without optimal pumping and m is total number of monitoring points other parameter are as described above the optimization problem formulated from eq 19 through 24 was solved by the scip algorithm to evaluate the performance of the scip the problem was solved using two optimization algorithms scip and ga for comparison the same number of iterations was selected for scip and ga respectively the scip is executed for 100 solutions while the same generation number was used in ga other parameters of ga are selected were 0 8 for the crossover rate and 0 01 for the mutation several run was performed in selection of best parameters value leading to optimal performance ga parameters consisted with those reported by kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015a a similar procedure is followed for the scip as the applied parameters are chosen from the best choice of parameters the convergence graphs for two remediation times 3 and 6 years are plotted in fig 4 as can be seen the scip method converges more rapidly to the optimal solution as compared to the ga this is because scip has convergence speed powered by incorporated supplementary algorithms like constraint specific presolving domain propagation separation methods and its additional plugins such as branching rules propagators and primal heuristics that work to speed up the process and attain global optimal solution in few iterations similar behavior was observed for other remediation times after determining pumping rates wells with negligible pumping rates were eliminated and the solution updated to dominant wells scip pumped in two wells only for all remediation times while ga pumped in 3 wells in most of the remediation periods optimized pumping rates and corresponding objective functions obtained by scip and ga are summarized in figs 5 and 6 respectively as can be observation the total pumping rate decreases gradually with increasing time in addition the cost of remediation is observed to increase gradually with time fig 6 this is because the volume of water pumped out to remove concentration mass increase with time it can also be seen that costs obtained by scip were slightly less than that of ga it must be noted that the remediation time cannot be less than 1 years in this problem otherwise the imposed constraints would no longer be satisfied the proposed pumping rate obtained by both algorithms fig 5 satisfied both water quality and head lift requirements fig 7 a present the minimum water head variations at different remediation times it can be observed from fig 7a that minimum water head increases rapidly for the first two remediation period and there after gradually from remediation time t 3 years and above a similar trend as the one observed in fig 5 for optimal pumping rate in contrast fig 7b shows that the maximum contaminant concentration decreases with time for the period considered in this case 4 3 case 2 minimization of total pumping rate in this case an aquifer with same properties and dimension as the one in case 1 was used contaminant was assumed to be dispersed for 20 years with the initial peak concentration of 120 mg l injected five boreholes were considered for remediation fig 8 the number and location of pumping wells are fixed and only pumping rates from each well for different remediation time were determined the maximum concentration c max of 0 5 mg l was expected to be attained at all points for the optimal solution in every feasible remediation time the effect of water table rise due to wet season was incorporated by varying the right head boundary condition on monthly basis as seen in table 3 other constraints remain the same as in table 2 the main objective was formulated to minimize total pumping rate from proposed five remediation wells required to clean the aquifer to the required standard per remediation time the objective function for this case was formulated as shown below eq 25 and subjected to the same constraints formulated in eq 20 through 24 25 m i n i m i z e z i 1 n q i fig 9 shows the effect of remediation time by illustrating the total pumping rates versus remediation time fig 9 also demonstrates how the model abides to the imposed constraints while solving the objective function it can be seen that the total pumping rates decreases noticeably with time under contaminant concentration constraint and give a constant trend for water head constraint however considering all the constraints concentration and head pumping rate decrease until the total pumping rate was equal to the total pumping rate required to keep the groundwater head below the decanting point there after becomes constant on average 340 m3 day as obtained by scip algorithm 361 m3 day by ga is required to be pumped daily to avoid decanting problem table 4 considering the with same quantity 340 m3 day it would take 7 5 years to clean the aquifer to acceptable quality however more water must pumped in wet months of january february march november and december than in dry to control decanting caused by rising of water head during wet season fig 10 illustrate monthly total pumping rates required to keep the water head below the decanting point a maximum capacity of about 417 m3 day was observed on a wet month of december and minimum of 312 m3 day on dry months of april through october fig 11 a presents maximum water head after remediation for different remediation times it can be observed from fig 11a that there was steep rise in water head from remediation time t 1 2 years before remaining fairly steady from 3 years to 5 5 years of remediation and started rising again at remediation time of 6 years in contrast fig 11b shows the minimum water head with time for the remediation periods considered in this case the minimum head is above the environment requirement h min assuring enough flow for aquatic life step increasing trend was observed for the minimum water head fig 11b 5 conclusion and recommendation in this paper the use of s o models in conjunction with scip in the design of optimal management solution for groundwater pollution and decanting problem through pump and treat systems has been demonstrated two cases of groundwater pollution management problem were adopted in studying the performance of the proposed approach optimization was successfully performed using two algorithms to minimize objective functions of cost and total pumping rate under subjected contaminant concentration water head and total pumping rate constraints obtained optimal pumping rates satisfy both contaminant concentration water head and total pumping capacity requirements which implies that the approach was able to restore polluted aquifer and contain the pollutant from further leaking under limited treatment capacity results indicated that solving constraint integer program scip algorithm performed more effectively and exhibited high convergence speed than ga total optimal pumping rates obtained by scip were less than those by ga suggesting that scip had more cost effective design than ga this study illustrate the application of the scip algorithm to groundwater pollution management problem through pat technique and its superior performance suggests that it should be evaluated for more complex groundwater management problems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

integer programs scip is applied in designing of an optimal solution to the pollution problem scip has more advantage than most of the conventional solvers previously used in groundwater pollution management problem scip is free and has better convergence capacity attaining global optimal solution in few iterations vigerske and gleixner 2016 berthold et al 2012 girbau llistuella et al 2015 scip was built under the notion of speed resulting into a better convergence attaining global optimal solution in few iterations gamrath et al 2016 vigerske and gleixner 2016 achterberg 2009 its ability to provide optimal solutions has been illustrated in management problems of most complex systems such as gas transport optimization the gas wheel circuit board production energy optimization and supply chain management gamrath et al 2016 vigerske and gleixner 2016 berthold et al 2012 girbau llistuella et al 2015 we present in this study therefore design of optimal groundwater pollution management system for hypothetical decanting site via a simulation optimization approach coupled with scip algorithm the study applies the developed methodology on a modified hypothetical contaminated groundwater system previously found in the literature alexander et al 2018 kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015a chang et al 2012 the study aimed at identification of cost effective and global optimal management strategy that would satisfy imposed water quality and hydraulic head constraints at all monitored points the performance of solving constrain integer program scip optimization algorithm was also compared with genetic algorithm ga 2 methodology in this study simulation models were applied with an optimization technique to determine the optimal solution for groundwater pollution problem under imposed constraints simulation models modflow and mt3dms were employed to simulate the flow and solute transport respectively while the optimization was achieved by the solving constraint integer problem scip algorithm the s o approach determines optimal management strategy from a set of feasible alternative strategies by linking simulation models which predict the system response based on the change of groundwater state variables ayvaz and karahan 2008 das and datta 2001 change in state variables hydraulic head and concentrations were determined as the results of applied stimuli pumping rates at a specific location for a given management period and used in the optimization model as controlling variables these variables were updated based on their corresponding objective function values by the algorithm the updated variables were used in the simulation model as subsequent input values this procedure runs iteratively until the specified convergence criterion was satisfied in the present study an attempt was made to solve groundwater pollution problem by considering two cases with different objectives and number of remediation wells sections 4 2 4 3 the described method was applied on hypothetical contaminated groundwater aquifer modified to represent a realistic aquifer in case 1 cost of remediation was minimized by considering the effect of pumping rate and remediation time case 2 was set with an objective of minimizing total pumping rate by optimizing pumping rate on each of the proposed remediation wells with respect to time in all cases 1 2 groundwater head remaining contaminant concentration and total pumping rate are observed as a set of constraints in total five constraints including concentration head minimum maximum lower and upper boundary of pumping rate and total pumping rates were considered in the mathematical formulation the performance of the scip optimization algorithm in all cases was compared with that of ga results obtained from these cases were presented and discussed based on the effect of remediation time pumped volume decrease in contaminant concentration and groundwater head with relation to cost of remediation case 1 and pumping rate of groundwater case 2 2 1 numerical model formulation 2 1 1 flow equation formulations a two dimensional numerical model modflow harbaugh et al 2000 was used to

solving constraint integer program scip under the opti tool box optimization interface in matlab scip is the combination of the mixed integer program mip and constraint program cp solver to form a constraint mixed integer solver a mixed integer program is defined as mip a b c i given a matrix a r m n vectors b r m and c r n and a set i n 1 n therefore the mip can be represented with the

description of the hypothetical example in this work the s o approach coupled with scip algorithm was applied to a modified hypothetical aquifer system previous used by kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015a to illustrate a groundwater pollution management problem a rectangular 150 by 300 m hypothetical aquifer consisted of a single chemical constituent pollution point and known number of pumping wells was used in this set of experiments the finite difference method was used to discretize the area into 800 uniform grids a schematic description of the hypothetical contaminated aquifer considered for the case study is given in fig 1 the model does not represent any real basin but was formulated to represent a realistic hydrogeology of an aquifer system using general physical features the aquifer system is homogeneous characterized by relatively low hydraulic conductivity the ground surface from the bottom of the aquifer was assumed to be 70 m the direction of flow is towards the right boundary which was maintained with a general hydraulic head of 60 0 m on the left hand boundary and 57 0 m on the right hand boundary fig 2 a plume was developed by assuming a contaminant of known discharge concentration dispersing from a disposal pond for a known simulation period and then removed the plume emanates from a continuous source dispersed by principal of groundwater flow imposed by constant head boundary conditions on the left and right boundaries of the aquifer parallel to the flow direction initially the entire aquifer domain was assumed to be uncontaminated c 0 the details of the aquifer parameters are given in table 1 figs 1 and 2 shows the flow direction dimensions and orientation of the considered domain 4 results 4 1 numerical setup the performance of the proposed simulation optimization approach was tested on two hypothetical cases in the first case the method was used to minimize cost of pumping and treating from three wells in the polluted hypothetical aquifer for this problem it was assumed that the number and location of the pumping wells were known and the main goal was to minimize the cost of remediation pumping and treating by obtaining the optimal pumping rate from the wells for different management period in case 2 the optimal pumping rate was considered as a design variable therefore the objective was to minimize the total pumping rates from wells at different remediation time in this case the decanting problem was captured by including the maximum water head constraint the effect of groundwater table rise during wet season was also introduced by varying the east right hand boundary condition monthly table 3 for both cases the pollution source releases a typical conservative pollutant during the active release periods it was also assumed that the flow system had no uncertainty and all initial and boundary conditions as well as the length of release periods were known table 1 4 2 case 1 minimization of remediation cost in this case an unconfined aquifer was considered with hydraulic head boundaries assigned on the left hl 60 m and right hr 57 m resulting into left to right groundwater flow fig 2 the left and right constant head boundaries provided initial heads for the transient simulation no groundwater flow and zero concentration gradient were considered on the northern and southern boundaries of the aquifer fig 1 simulation began with development of a plume assuming a source that was a disposal pond discharging 100 mg l for a 10 years period initially the entire aquifer domain was assumed to be uncontaminated c 0 the plume emanates from a continuous source and was principally dispersed by groundwater flow imposed by general head boundary conditions on the left and right boundaries of the aquifer parallel to the flow direction fig 2 the concentration distribution after 10 years is shown in fig 3 at the end of 10 years period pumping for remediation mobilized from assigned pumping wells the peak concentration was 100 mg l and allowable concentration c max was 0 5 mg l in all cells the minimum head anywhere in the aquifer was to be greater than 20 m to sustain eco flow the lower and upper bounds on the pumping rates were chosen as 0 and 500 m 3 day three remediation pumps determined based on groundwater direction dispersion time and contaminant source location on the centreline of the field were adopted location of remediation wells were assumed in cells pw1 10 7 pw2 10 10 and pw3 10 13 while concentration and head were monitored in cells 8 7 12 12 10 10 10 13 and 10 16 as shown in fig 3 the aim in this case was to minimize cost of remediation pumping and treating by optimize the total pumping rates from the proposed remediation wells while meeting water quality and hydraulic head requirements in the monitored wells the remediation time number and locations of wells were presumed fixed and only pumping rates were optimized the considered objective function and constraints were formulated as follows 12 m i n i m i z e f a 1 t i 1 m q i γ δ t η h i g l h i 86 4 1 0 5 a 2 t i 1 m q i where f is the objective function for the minimization of remediation system

management period 13 c j t c m a x f o r j 1 n the concentration state of the groundwater system is represented in the optimization model using generated ics from the following eq 14 generated from eq 8 as 14 c j t c j t n o n k τ t i 1 m δ j i t k τ ψ q q i k u t q i k τ t m e α j i k head constraint minimum head constraints drawdown were introduced to protect the ecosystem by avoiding excessive over pumping also maximum head constraint was included to control decanting due to rising of water head therefore the head constraints was formulated as follows 15 h m i n h j t h m a x f o r j 1 n where 16 h j t h j t n o n k τ t i 1 m δ j i t k τ ψ q q i k u t q i k τ t m e β j i k this constraint meant to assure that pumping will not lower water head below the minimum allowable groundwater head h min neither allow the water table to rise above the maximum allowable water head h max eq 15 pumping constraint pumping rates at each proposed remediation well was constrained between some minimum and maximum rates eq 17 the maximum rate was assigned based on the capacity of treatment plant this constraint was formulated as follows 17 q m i n q i q m a x f o r i 1 m further sum of pumping rates from all the wells should also not exceed the capacity of the treatment plant eq 18 was formulated to insure that this limitation was met in all feasible solution 18 i 1 m q q t o t here c j t and h j t are contaminant concentration and head at monitoring location j respectively c max h max and h min are the maximum allowable contaminant concentration maximum hydraulic head and minimum allowable head in the monitoring wells respectively α jik and β jik are the ics at monitoring location j for concentration and head respectively due to pumping from well i for management era k m is the number of pumping wells considered for remediation while n is the number of observation points q min and q max represent lower and upper bound of pumping rate for each pump respectively table 2 illustrates the optimization and constraint parameters used for this case 4 2 2 optimization problem the optimization problem solved here aims of minimizing total pumping while achieving concentration and head constrains and embedded bounds such as capacity of the treatment plant the optimization problem solved therefore was as follows 19 m i n i m i z e f a 1 t i 1 m q i γ δ t η h i g l h i 86 4 1 0 5 a 2 t i 1 m q i subject to 20 k τ t i 1 m α j i k q i b α j f o r j 1 n 21 k τ t i 1 m β j i k q i b β 1 j f o r j 1 n 22 k τ t i 1 m β j i k q i b β 2 j f o r j 1 n 23 q m i n q i

from potential pumping wells located at i b α j is allowable mass removal at point j and is given as c m a x c j n o n b β 1 j is allowable maximum drawdown at point j and is given as h j n o n h m i n b β 2 j is allowable minimum drawdown at point j and is given as h m a x h j n o n c j n o n and h j n o n are background contaminant concentration and hydraulic head at point j without optimal pumping and m is total number of monitoring points other parameter are as described above the optimization problem formulated from eq 19 through 24 was solved by the scip algorithm to evaluate the performance of the scip the problem was solved using two optimization algorithms scip and ga for comparison the same number of iterations was selected for scip and ga respectively the scip is executed for 100 solutions while the same generation number was used in ga other parameters of ga are selected were 0 8 for the crossover rate and 0 01 for the mutation several run was performed in selection of best parameters value leading to optimal performance ga parameters consisted with those reported by kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015a a similar procedure is followed for the scip as the applied parameters are chosen from the best choice of parameters the convergence graphs for two remediation times 3 and 6 years are plotted in fig 4 as can be seen the scip method converges more rapidly to the optimal solution as compared to the ga this is because scip has convergence speed powered by incorporated supplementary algorithms like constraint specific presolving domain propagation separation methods and its additional plugins such as branching rules propagators and primal heuristics that work to speed up the process and attain global optimal solution in few iterations similar behavior was observed for other remediation times after determining pumping rates wells with negligible pumping rates were eliminated and the solution updated to dominant wells scip pumped in two wells only for all remediation times while ga pumped in 3 wells in most of the remediation periods optimized pumping rates and corresponding objective functions obtained by scip and ga are summarized in figs 5 and 6 respectively as can be observation the total pumping rate decreases gradually with increasing time in addition the cost of remediation is observed to increase gradually with time fig 6 this is because the volume of water pumped out to remove concentration mass increase with time it can also be seen that costs obtained by scip were slightly less than that of ga it must be noted that the remediation time cannot be less than 1 years in this problem otherwise the imposed constraints would no longer be satisfied the proposed pumping rate obtained by both algorithms fig 5 satisfied both water quality and head lift requirements fig 7 a present the minimum water head variations at different remediation times it can be observed from fig 7a that minimum water head increases rapidly for the first two remediation period and there after gradually from remediation time t 3 years and above a similar trend as the one observed in fig 5 for optimal pumping rate in contrast fig 7b shows that the maximum contaminant concentration decreases with time for the period considered in this case 4 3 case 2 minimization of total pumping rate in this case an aquifer with same properties and dimension as the one in case 1 was used contaminant was assumed to be dispersed for 20 years with the initial peak concentration of 120 mg l injected five boreholes were considered for remediation fig 8 the number and location of pumping wells are fixed and only pumping rates from each well for different remediation time were determined the maximum concentration c max of 0 5 mg l was expected to be attained at all points for the optimal solution in every feasible remediation time the effect of water table rise due to wet season was incorporated by varying the right head boundary condition on monthly basis as seen in table 3 other constraints remain the same as in table 2 the main objective was formulated to minimize total pumping rate from proposed five remediation wells required to clean the aquifer to the required standard per remediation time the objective function for this case was formulated as shown below eq 25 and subjected to the same constraints formulated in eq 20 through 24 25 m i n i m i z e z i 1 n q i fig 9 shows the effect of remediation time by illustrating the total pumping rates versus remediation time fig 9 also demonstrates how the model abides to the imposed constraints while solving the objective function it can be seen that the total pumping rates decreases noticeably with time under contaminant concentration constraint and give a constant trend for water head constraint however considering all the constraints concentration and head pumping rate decrease until the total pumping rate was equal to the total pumping rate required to keep the groundwater head below the decanting point there after becomes constant on average 340 m3 day as obtained by scip algorithm 361 m3 day by ga is required to be pumped daily to avoid decanting problem table 4 considering the with same quantity 340 m3 day it would take 7 5 years to clean the aquifer to acceptable quality however more water must pumped in wet months of january february march november and december than in dry to control decanting caused by rising of water head during wet season fig 10 illustrate monthly total pumping rates required to keep the water head below the decanting point a maximum capacity of about 417 m3 day was observed on a wet month of december and minimum of 312 m3 day on dry months of april through october fig 11 a presents maximum water head after remediation for different remediation times it can be observed from fig 11a that there was steep rise in water head from remediation time t 1 2 years before remaining fairly steady from 3 years to 5 5 years of remediation and started rising again at remediation time of 6 years in contrast fig 11b shows the minimum water head with time for the remediation periods considered in this case the minimum head is above the environment requirement h min assuring enough flow for aquatic life step increasing trend was observed for the minimum water head fig 11b 5 conclusion and recommendation in this paper the use of s o models in conjunction with scip in the design of optimal management solution for groundwater pollution and decanting problem through pump and treat systems has been demonstrated two cases of groundwater pollution management problem were adopted in studying the performance of the proposed approach optimization was successfully performed using two algorithms to minimize objective functions of cost and total pumping rate under subjected contaminant concentration water head and total pumping rate constraints obtained optimal pumping rates satisfy both contaminant concentration water head and total pumping capacity requirements which implies that the approach was able to restore polluted aquifer and contain the pollutant from further leaking under limited treatment capacity results indicated that solving constraint integer program scip algorithm performed more effectively and exhibited high convergence speed than ga total optimal pumping rates obtained by scip were less than those by ga suggesting that scip had more cost effective design than ga this study illustrate the application of the scip algorithm to groundwater pollution management problem through pat technique and its superior performance suggests that it should be evaluated for more complex groundwater management problems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11881,access to safe drinking water and clean fuels remains a setback for low and middle income countries it has substantially impacted people s health and wellbeing worldwide and its improvement would enhance the economic development of any country in this study we constructed four versions of the district health index dhi each with a different set of indicators by adopting the urban health index uhi framework and geographic information system gis tools to i determine the effect of safe drinking water and clean fuels on districts wellbeing ii measure the impact of safe drinking water and clean fuels on disparities inequalities disparity ratios and disparity slopes concerning dhi scores and iii examine the role of safe drinking water and clean fuels in the spatial relationship among contiguous districts in terms of dhi scores results of the study indicated that on average only 17 72 and 18 29 percent of people in each district had access to safe water and clean fuel respectively less accessibility towards these indicators reduced the mean score of the pakistan district s health from 0 37 to 0 25 the inclusion of safe water widened the disparity ratio and diminished the disparity slope spatial analysis revealed that pakistan s district health status was spatially correlated with contiguous districts global moran s i scores confirmed the declined spatial dependence when safe drinking water indicator was included in composite index most of the districts were concentrated in high high hh and low low ll quadrants a spatial cluster of low low deprived unhealthy districts in baluchistan confirmed that comparatively baluchistan is the most deprived province which needs government attention and policy maker s prioritizations graphical abstract image 1 keywords district health health indicators water and fuel indicators district health index spatial correlation analysis 1 introduction the growing population and rapid urbanization impose pressure on access to safe drinking water and clean fuel used for domestic cooking purposes these have become a global challenge especially in low and middle income countries aliyu and amadu 2017 gates and yin 2018 sambu 2016 vörösmarty et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 there is a growing evidence that access to safe drinking water as well as clean cooking fuels play a pivotal role in people s health and wellbeing everard 2019 fukuda et al 2019 recently world health organization who reported that 785 million people have no access to safe and clean water about one million people die each year due to lack of access to safe water and sanitation and every 2 min a child dies from water born diseases water 2016 moreover about 3 billion people use biomass such as wood charcoal crop waste and dung for cooking practices most of them are living in low and middle income countries similarly each year about 4 million people die prematurely from air pollution generated by indoor pollution who 2018 access to both safe drinking water and clean fuel are two important sustainable development goals goal 3 and goal 7 projected by the united nations development programme undp that may influence the health wellbeing of the people undp 2018 an extensive literature has shown that drinking water and cooking fuel are important as they affect human health directly or indirectly azizullah et al 2011 chafe et al 2014 edwards and langpap 2012 epstein et al 2013 s khan et al 2013 liu et al 2020 q wang and yang 2016 polluted and contaminated water causing various diseases such as cholera dysentery colic hepatitis a and hepatitis e parasitic infection etc influenced human health adversely lastwell 2019 households with the use of solid fuel have a lower level of self assessed health status and higher prevalence of respiratory disease liao et al 2016 l wang et al 2017 cooking with solid fuels is a major cause of households air pollution chafe et al 2014 ifegbesan et al 2016 liu et al 2020 its development will enhance at least five of the sdgs of good health and wellbeing gender equality clean energy climate action and life on land rosenthal et al 2018 based on these central facts access to safe drinking water and clean cooking fuel is of great importance the health wellbeing of the cities is a multidimensional phenomenon and cannot be measured with a single dimension who 2014 defined health of the cities by interconnected health and health related indicators such as socioeconomic demographic education housing environment health behavior and all other indicators that shape the cities for instance bortz et al 2015 coles et al 2017 dai et al 2017 s u khan and hussain 2020 rothenberg et al 2014 used a set of different indicators and constructed composite index to measure the health wellbeing of the cities the multifaceted index does not have the quality to sort out the impact of a single dimension though advantageous in assessing the geographical disparities population growth and rapid urbanization led pakistan to face many severe challenges including access to safe drinking water and clean fuel for cooking practices pakistan ranks 9th in the list of countries having lowest access to safe drinking water where 21 million people have no access to safe drinking water aid 2019 in addition only 22 percent of the population has access to natural gas as a clean cooking fuel pakistan 2019 this study aims to examine the role of safe drinking water and clean cooking fuels in multidimensional health wellbeing status of the districts of pakistan by construction a district health wellbeing index dhi for this purpose the study has applied the recently developed approach of the urban health index uhi rothenberg et al 2014 who 2014 uhi is a flexible tool as it permits users to choose the scale unit of analysis national or local as well as freedom of indicators mainly depending upon data availability one important advantage of the uhi tool is that it applies in various settings and enables manipulators to achieve their specified objectives for instance coles et al 2017 applied the tool to measure the disparities in dental health among urban areas dai et al 2017 used the same approach to examine the progress in the health of the cities between two time periods of 2000 and 2010 in light of the above facts it is evident that the impact of safe drinking water and clean cooking fuels on health wellbeing is rarely studied therefore in the present study the uhi approach is applied to fulfil study objectives our specific objectives are to i determine the effect of safe drinking water and clean fuels used for domestic cooking practices on districts health wellbeing ii measure the impact of safe drinking water and clean fuels on disparities inequalities disparity ratios and disparity slopes concerning dhi scores and iii examine the role of safe drinking water and clean fuels in the spatial relationship among contiguous adjacent districts in terms of dhi scores 2 methodology 2 1 data this study used the data of the pakistan social and living standard measurement pslm survey round vi 2014 15 conducted by the pakistan bureau of statistics pakistan bureau of statistics 2015 although the survey was not conducted to measure the health wellbeing of the districts it does contain very useful and rich information regarding our study objectives the survey covered multiple domains such as socioeconomic demographic housing health water and sanitation environment and geography and data were collected from all districts at the household level 2 2 sample size and unit of analysis the pslm survey applied two stages stratified sampling technique as the survey is conducted at the district level according to the framework of pslm all districts were further administered into enumeration blocks each enumeration block covered about 200 250 households a total of 5438 enumeration blocks were found from which 95 638 households were surveyed in this study the unit of analysis is a district therefore households from enumeration blocks in each district have been aggregated at the district level in this way 113 districts out of 149 have been considered as our sample size the rest of the districts were dropped either they had less information needed for analysis purposes or due to the law and order situations at survey time 2 3 variables of the study eight indicators were chosen from five different dimensions 1 economic yearly mean income of households 2 education percent of the household head with high school degree or above percent of a spouse with middle school degree or above 3 environment percent of households using gas as a clean fuel for cooking purposes 4 safe drinking water percent of households with piped water as a source of safe drinking water and 5 health percent of households where lady health worker lhw visited in last 30 days percent of children under 5 who have completed the full recommended vaccination course percent of women receiving post natal care after delivery these indicators were chosen based on three important grounds first these indicators were significantly correlated with one another see table 1 in the result section second rich data were available on these indicators at the district level third almost all indicators have a strong connection with undp s sustainable development goals especially safe water and clean fuel used for cooking purposes 2 4 construction of the district health index dhi to construct the dhi a recently applied approach of urban health index uhi developed with the teamwork of the world health organization who was adopted who 2014 according to the framework of the uhi first the study indicators were normalized on a scale of 0 1 the indicators were normalized by taking the difference of the indicator s actual value from its lowest value divided by the difference between the highest values to the lowest value mathematically 1 i s i min i max i min i where i max i and min i are the actual value of indicator maximum value of indictor i and minimum value of indicator i minus a small value or a chosen value respectively i s is the calculated standardized value of indicator i satisfying the 0 i s 1 condition second the normalized indicators were combined into a single metric weighted geometric mean formula was applied as all dimensions were assumed to capture equal weights mathematically we have the following equation 2 d h i i 1 j s i i w i 1 i 1 j w i where w i is the weight of the ith indicator and i 1 2 3 8 the weights were assigned so that their sum equals the total number of indicators 2 5 disparity ratio the disparity ratio was computed by taking the ratio of the mean of the upper 10 first decile of the distribution to the mean of the lower 10 last decile of the distribution mathematically we have the below equation 3 d i s p a r i t y r a t i o m e a n o f t h e u p p e r 10 o f d i s t r i b u t i o n m e a n o f t h e l o w e r 10 o f d i s t r i b u t i o n 2 6 disparity slope the disparity slope for the middle 80 middle 8 deciles of the distribution was computed through simple linear regression by applying the ordinary least square ols technique these districts were ranked in ascending order in terms of dhi scores and regressed on the rank variable mathematically 4 d h i i f r a n k i where dhii is the index score of ith district and ranki is the rank of that particular district f shows the functional relationship between dependent and independent variables equation 4 can econometrically be written as under 5 d h i i α β r a n k i ε i β is the disparity slope that shows the average dhi change difference between each adjacent district and is influenced by the ranking of districts 2 7 analytical approach four different versions of the dhi were constructed each with a different set of indicators 1 dhi a was constructed without safe water and clean fuel indicators 2 dhi b included only safe water indicator 3 dhi c comprised only clean fuel indicator and 4 dhi d contained both safe water and clean fuel indicators mean disparity ratio and disparity slope were calculated for all versions of indices districts were ranked in terms of dhi scores for all versions and examined the role of safe drinking water and clean fuel in the health wellbeing of the districts 2 8 spatial autocorrelation moran s i and the local indicators of spatial autocorrelation lisa analysis spatial autocorrelation examines whether there exists an association between the dhi score of a specific district in space and the score of its neighboring districts the consistent test statistics are used to represent the extent of relationship and accumulation mode of geographic variables anselin 1995 getis 2010 li et al 2012 yang et al 2019 the two most widely used spatial autocorrelation functions are the global moran s i and the local moran s i ijumulana et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2021 lima et al 2020 the formula of the global moran s i statistic is shown in equation 6 as under 6 i n i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x x j x i 1 n j 1 n w i j i 1 n x i x 2 i j where n is the number of districts x i and x j represents the dhi scores of districts i and j respectively x shows the mean dhi score for all districts w ij expresses the weighted spatial matrix when the region i and j share a common boundary w ij 1 otherwise w ij 0 i is the value of moran s statistic which ranges between 1 and 1 when moran s i 0 it means that the district s dhi scores are spatially agglomerated when moran s i 0 it means that the dhi scores of neighboring districts are inversely associated when i 0 it means that the district s wellbeing quality is randomly and or irregularly distributed for the significance test of the global moran s i a null hypothesis ho of spatial randomness is tested against the alternative hypothesis h1 of spatial clusters or no spatial randomness to spot the spatial relationship of different spatial locations the local spatial autocorrelation also known as local indicators of spatial association by local moran s i was used in this study the test score measures the extent of spatial association between any specific location district and its surrounding districts the local moran s ii is shown in equation 7 as under 7 i i n x i x i 1 n w i j x j x i 1 n x i x 2 i j here n is the number of districts x i x j are the dhi scores of districts i and j respectively x shows the mean dhi score of all districts w ij are the weighted spatial matrix i i is the degree of spatial cluster between ith districts and their surrounding ones the local indicators of spatial association lisa results can be divided into four different types high high hh low low ll high low hl and low high lh anselin 1995 ijumulana et al 2020 2021 lima et al 2020 martori and hoberg 2008 the first two types hh and ll denote that district wellbeing quality and the quality of its contiguous districts are spatially consistent and the latter two types hl and lh represent that the high low districts are bounded by the low high areas 2 9 analytical tools for analysis purposes excel spreadsheet microsoft excel microsoft corporation statistical package for social sciences spss geographic information system gis and geoda applications were used throughout the study anselin et al 2010 fischer and getis 2009 3 results before interpreting the results it was presumed that the study indicators should be positively correlated with one another pearson s correlation matrix table 1 showed a significant positive association among variables except lhw visit and mean income safe drinking water was negatively correlated with all health related variables lhw visit vaccination and post natal care except vaccination the negative correlations were ignored as slightly inverse relations are typically acceptable who 2014 3 1 descriptive statistics table 2 shows that households from all districts earn on average rs 275 496 21 annually about 23 percent of household s responsible persons have a high school or higher education while only 22 percent of the spouse have middle school or higher than middle education the table also shows that on average about 17 percent and 18 percent of households have access to safe drinking water and clean fuel respectively in addition about 41 percent 69 percent and 28 percent of households from all districts have access to lhw services children vaccination courses and post natal facilities respectively the mean disparity ratio and disparity slopes of all dhi versions are shown in table 3 the highest mean score 0 37 was recorded for dhi a district health index without safe drinking water and clean cooking fuel with a disparity ratio of 10 11 the ratio of upper and lower decile districts in terms of index score and a disparity slope of 0 45 the slope of middle 8 deciles of distribution after adding safe drinking water in district health index dhi b the mean score 0 29 disparity ratio 8 3 and disparity slope 0 35 were decreased whereas by including only clean cooking fuel to dhi dhi c the mean score was declined from 0 37 to 0 28 but disparity ratio 25 29 and disparity slope 0 47 was increased furthermore when both indicators are encompassed in the health index dhi d the mean 0 25 and disparity slope 0 35 were decreased but the disparity ratio was increased from 10 11 to 16 59 the detail of disparity ratios and slopes of all dhi versions are given in additional file 1 table a and b respectively fig 1 displays the distributions of all versions of dhi scores all panels a to d of the figure showed patterns similar to previously measured distributions bortz et al 2015 dai et al 2017 rothenberg et al 2014 however the rankings of the districts were effectively changed for all dhi versions for instance district chitral ranked at 22nd position fig 1a for dhi a district health index without safe water and clean fuel distribution but ranked at 5th position fig 1b for distribution of dhi b when safe drinking water indicator is added to health index it may be due to the reason that a large portion of households in the chitral district has access to safe drinking water which substantially boosted the wellbeing of the district but district chitral ranked at 81st position fig 1c when clean fuel indicator was added to district health index dhi c finally when the health index was measured for dhi d district chitral was ranked at 61st position fig 1d throughout 113 districts similar results were found in the rest of the districts except lahore peshawar karachi quetta and rawalpindi as these districts are the capital cities of all provinces 3 2 characteristics of spatial distributions of dhis the spatial distribution of dhi a scores showed significant spatial differences among provinces of pakistan fig 2 a a cluster of unhealthy districts concerning dhi a scores was found in baluchistan as compared to other provinces in contrast districts of punjab and khyber pakhtunkhwa kp provinces made a pattern of relatively healthy districts in terms of index scores the capital cities of all provinces peshawar karachi quetta and lahore were highly developed as they have darker hues fig 2b displayed the spatial patterns of pakistan s wellbeing status after incorporating the indicator of safe drinking water the overall map showed a pattern similar to fig 2a though some disparities were noted relative to dhi a the patterns of dhi b are slightly randomly distributed which indicated that by adding a clean water indicator the clusters of healthy or unhealthy districts are minimized in other words with the addition of clean drinking water the health status of several districts was reduced by having no or less access to safe drinking water moreover concerning dhi b scores districts from punjab and khyber pakhtunkhwa kp provinces were relatively better than sindh and baluchistan the addition of the clean fuel indicator dhi c changed the overall pattern of distribution which means that access to clean fuel has a considerable impact on pakistan s district health fig 2c the pattern is slightly brighter as compared to dhi a which indicated that less access of districts to clean fuel facilities has inversely influenced the composite index scores districts from baluchistan province made a cluster of unhealthy districts as compared to other provinces finally fig 2d exhibited the spatial results of dhi d including both safe drinking water and clean fuel the overall distribution indicated a pattern different from dhi a where no safe water and clean fuel were entered to the composite index the overall pattern is slightly brighter than dhi a which shows that after adding both safe water and clean fuel indicators the district s health indices were reduced in other words the district s less accessibility towards safe water and clean fuel has lowered the dhi d scores like previous versions of fig 2a c clusters of unhealthy and healthy districts in terms of district health index dhi d scores were found in baluchistan and punjab provinces respectively in contrast a random pattern of developed and deprived districts was found in sindh and kp provinces 3 3 spatial autocorrelation moran s i and the lisa analysis of dhis table 4 shows the results of global moran s i test statistic for four different versions of dhis the value for health wellbeing quality dhi a was calculated as 0 49 which shows significant spatial dependence of districts to their corresponding neighbors with z value of 8 43 and pseudo p value of 0 001 the inclusion of safe drinking water indicator declined the moran s i score from 0 49 to 0 42 whereas clean fuel indicator increased the moran s i score to 0 53 moreover when both indicators were included dhi d the value is declined slightly from 0 49 to 0 48 all these global moran s i scores are highly significant which indicates that there exist obvious positive association of pakistan s district wellbeing status to their surrounding districts local indicators of spatial autocorrelation lisa analysis are carried out through the moran scatter plots as indicated from fig 3 in all panels of fig 3 pakistan s health wellbeing quality of majority of the districts concentrated in the h h and l l quadrants which indicated that most of the districts are spatially clustered while rest of the districts in l h and h l quadrants are considered as spatially heterogeneous however the number of districts differs when safe drinking water fig 3b clean fuels fig 3c or both indicators fig 3d are included in composite index fig 4 illustrates the results of local spatial autocorrelation local moran s i for dhi a d the first two quadrants of hh and ll clustered regions represents high low health quality of districts surrounded by high low neighboring districts whereas the latter two quadrants of lh and hl agglomerated areas indicates low high health status of the districts encircled by high low contiguous districts from fig 4a d the high high hh aggregated districts are mainly distributed in the north eastern districts of pakistan while the low low ll clustered regions are spatially concentrated in south western part of pakistan in addition there are few districts in the low high lh and high low h l accumulated regions mainly concentrated in south and south western fig 4a northern fig 4b western and east northern fig 4c and northern and central fig 4d parts of pakistan 4 discussion access to safe drinking water and clean fuel has substantially affected the well being health and economic development everard 2019 fukuda et al 2019 our study indicators showed very low accessibility of pakistan s households towards both safe drinking water and clean fuel facilities table 2 this lower accessibility has substantially affected pakistan s health wellbeing status from different perspectives the addition of these indicators into the composite index has substantially altered the mean dhi scores disparity ratios disparity slopes ranking of the districts in terms of dhi s scores and spatial relationship among various provinces dai et al 2017 rothenberg et al 2014 stauber et al 2018 without the addition of safe water and clean fuel dhi a pakistan s mean index score was 0 37 with a disparity ratio of 10 11 and a disparity slope of 0 45 table 3 the accumulation of safe drinking water indicator dhi b significantly reduced the mean index score from 0 37 to 0 29 which means that the district s wellbeing health quality has deteriorated nadeem et al 2020 it also minimized the disparity ratio difference between lower and upper decile districts from 10 11 to 8 30 because some of the previously top districts in terms of health quality scores have low access to safe drinking water which ultimately resulted in declined disparity ratio also the reduced slope coefficient 0 35 confirmed that as compared to dhi a the middle 80 percent of districts are now less heterogeneous table 3 similarly the inclusion of clean fuel into the multidimensional index dhi c reduced the overall index score from 0 37 to 0 28 less accessibility of districts to clean fuel facility resultantly degraded the composite scores of most of the districts m k khan khan and rehan 2020 unlike safe water the inclusion of clean fuel has increased both the disparity ratio and disparity slope table 3 the higher disparity ratio 25 29 relative to the disparity ratio of dhi a indicated that healthy districts have complete access to clean fuel facilities compared with their unhealthy counterparts additional file 1 table a finally when both safe water and clean fuel indicators are included dhi d the mean index value is reduced further to 0 25 with a disparity ratio of 16 59 and slope of 0 35 table 3 these results clearly showed that due to lack of access to safe water and clean fuel facilities pakistan district s health quality is declined and inequalities concerning disparity ratio are increased s u khan and hussain 2020 considering the ranking of the districts concerning their dhi scores without safe water and clean fuel district chitral for instance was at 22nd position in terms of dhi scores fig 1a but the addition of water indicator boosted the health status of district chitral and ranked at 5th position fig 1b these results indicated that a high percentage of households in the chitral district have access to safe drinking water which resultantly improved the overall score of health wellbeing in contrast after adding fuel indicator into a composite index its ranking is declined and reached 81st position fig 1c this outcome showed that district chitral has very low access to clean fuel facilities finally by adding both indicators district chitral changed its ranking and stand at 61st position fig 1d these results are consistent with the study of stauber et al 2018 and indicated that access to safe drinking water and fuel matters significantly spatially the pakistan s district s health status is significantly altered when safe water and clean fuel are examined the spatial results moran s i scores clearly showed a positive spatial dependency among districts and their corresponding neighbors however these results varied for all versions of dhis wellbeing quality of pakistan s districts with their adjacent neighbors are highly correlated for clean fuel in contrast when safe drinking water indicator is examined the spatial dependence of contiguous districts is declined table 4 the less accessibility of households to safe drinking water ultimately resulted in lower districts health wellbeing status most of the dhi samples of pakistan and their neighbors are clustered in developed hh quadrant and deprived ll quadrant regions which indicated that districts concerning dhi scores are spatially bunched with similar neighbors the remaining districts are spatially heterogenous concentrated in lh and lh quadrants fig 3a d from lisa results the high high hh aggregated districts are mainly distributed in the north eastern districts punjab province of pakistan while the low low ll clustered regions are spatially concentrated in south western part baluchistan province of pakistan which means that these areas are spatially dependent fig 4a d however the number of districts concentrated in hh and ll varies for clean fuel or and safe drinking water which means that these attributes have significant impact on spatial clusters fig 4b d moreover districts from high low hl and low high lh accumulated regions of pakistan are mainly distributed in south and south western northern western and east northern and north and central part of the country as shown in fig 4a b c and d respectively these districts are either healthier surrounded by deprived neighbors or worse off surrounded by developed neighboring districts this study is limited based on several important grounds first there was a large number of indicators that could be used to measure the district health index dhi but we have limited the number of indicators up to eight as the utilized dataset has insufficient information on other indicators second the analysis was run for 113 districts of pakistan and the rest of the districts were ignored because the respondents were too few to provide a real picture of the districts third instead of having rich information on study indicators we have ignored district islamabad it is the capital of pakistan and its high dhi score made our whole analysis biased finally because few respondents at the council or tehsil level were found to have sufficient information needed to construct the index the unit of analysis was enlarged up to the district level keeping in view these limitations this study is not capturing the exact impact of safe drinking water and clean fuel indicators on pakistan s wellbeing status though contributing to the recent existing literature it becomes a future research interest and with the collaboration of government authorities research experts in their studies can fulfil this gap by incorporating all these deficiencies 5 conclusion and recommendations based on instant results it is concluded that safe drinking water and clean fuel used for domestic cooking practices have substantially altered the rankings and wellbeing disparities of the districts due to the district s lack of accessibility towards the safe drinking water and clean fuel indicators their additions lowered pakistan s district health wellbeing quality concerning dhi scores government and policy planners are recommended to improve people s accessibility to safe water and clean fuel in deprived districts furthermore the spatial analysis concluded that most of districts are spatially clustered in high high or low low quadrants and few spatially heterogenous districts are distributed in low high or high low quadrants these spatially h h healthy developed and l l unhealthy deprived clustered districts are distributed mainly in punjab and baluchistan provinces respectively therefore based on our study findings to improve pakistan s district wellbeing health status the government and policy planners are recommended to give top priority to baluchistan province declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

11881,access to safe drinking water and clean fuels remains a setback for low and middle income countries it has substantially impacted people s health and wellbeing worldwide and its improvement would enhance the economic development of any country in this study we constructed four versions of the district health index dhi each with a different set of indicators by adopting the urban health index uhi framework and geographic information system gis tools to i determine the effect of safe drinking water and clean fuels on districts wellbeing ii measure the impact of safe drinking water and clean fuels on disparities inequalities disparity ratios and disparity slopes concerning dhi scores and iii examine the role of safe drinking water and clean fuels in the spatial relationship among contiguous districts in terms of dhi scores results of the study indicated that on average only 17 72 and 18 29 percent of people in each district had access to safe water and clean fuel respectively less accessibility towards these indicators reduced the mean score of the pakistan district s health from 0 37 to 0 25 the inclusion of safe water widened the disparity ratio and diminished the disparity slope spatial analysis revealed that pakistan s district health status was spatially correlated with contiguous districts global moran s i scores confirmed the declined spatial dependence when safe drinking water indicator was included in composite index most of the districts were concentrated in high high hh and low low ll quadrants a spatial cluster of low low deprived unhealthy districts in baluchistan confirmed that comparatively baluchistan is the most deprived province which needs government attention and policy maker s prioritizations graphical abstract image 1 keywords district health health indicators water and fuel indicators district health index spatial correlation analysis 1 introduction the growing population and rapid urbanization impose pressure on access to safe drinking water and clean fuel used for domestic cooking purposes these have become a global challenge especially in low and middle income countries aliyu and amadu 2017 gates and yin 2018 sambu 2016 vörösmarty et al 2000 zhang et al 2017 there is a growing evidence that access to safe drinking water as well as clean cooking fuels play a pivotal role in people s health and wellbeing everard 2019 fukuda et al 2019 recently world health organization who reported that 785 million people have no access to safe and clean water about one million people die each year due to lack of access to safe water and sanitation and every 2 min a child dies from water born diseases water 2016 moreover about 3 billion people use biomass such as wood charcoal crop waste and dung for cooking practices most of them are living in low and middle income countries similarly each year about 4 million people die prematurely from air pollution generated by indoor pollution who 2018 access to both safe drinking water and clean fuel are two important sustainable development goals goal 3 and goal 7 projected by the united nations development programme undp that may influence the health wellbeing of the people undp 2018 an extensive literature has shown that drinking water and cooking fuel are important as they affect human health directly or indirectly azizullah et al 2011 chafe et al 2014 edwards and langpap 2012 epstein et al 2013 s khan et al 2013 liu et al 2020 q wang and yang 2016 polluted and contaminated water causing various diseases such as cholera dysentery colic hepatitis a and hepatitis e parasitic infection etc influenced human health adversely lastwell 2019 households with the use of solid fuel have a lower level of self assessed health status and higher prevalence of respiratory disease liao et al 2016 l wang et al 2017 cooking with solid fuels is a major cause of households air pollution chafe et al 2014 ifegbesan et al 2016 liu et al 2020 its development will enhance at least five of the sdgs of good health and wellbeing gender equality clean energy climate action and life on land rosenthal et al 2018 based on these central facts access to safe drinking water and clean cooking fuel is of great importance the health wellbeing of the cities is a multidimensional phenomenon and cannot be measured with a single dimension who 2014 defined health of the cities by interconnected health and health related indicators such as socioeconomic demographic education housing environment health behavior and all other indicators that shape the cities for instance bortz et al 2015 coles et al 2017 dai et al 2017 s u khan and hussain 2020 rothenberg et al 2014 used a set of different indicators and constructed composite index to measure the health wellbeing of the cities the multifaceted index does not have the quality to sort out the impact of a single dimension though advantageous in assessing the geographical disparities population growth and rapid urbanization led pakistan to face many severe challenges including access to safe drinking water and clean fuel for cooking practices pakistan ranks 9th in the list of countries having lowest access to safe drinking water where 21 million people have no access to safe drinking water aid 2019 in addition only 22 percent of the population has access to natural gas as a clean cooking fuel pakistan 2019 this study aims to examine the role of safe drinking water and clean cooking fuels in multidimensional health wellbeing status of the districts of pakistan by construction a district health wellbeing index dhi for this purpose the study has applied the recently developed approach of the urban health index uhi rothenberg et al 2014 who 2014 uhi is a flexible tool as it permits users to choose the scale unit of analysis national or local as well as freedom of indicators mainly depending upon data availability one important advantage of the uhi tool is that it applies in various settings and enables manipulators to achieve their specified objectives for instance coles et al 2017 applied the tool to measure the disparities in dental health among urban areas dai et al 2017 used the same approach to examine the progress in the health of the cities between two time periods of 2000 and 2010 in light of the above facts it is evident that the impact of safe drinking water and clean cooking fuels on health wellbeing is rarely studied therefore in the present study the uhi approach is applied to fulfil study objectives our specific objectives are to i determine the effect of safe drinking water and clean fuels used for domestic cooking practices on districts health wellbeing ii measure the impact of safe drinking water and clean fuels on disparities inequalities disparity ratios and disparity slopes concerning dhi scores and iii examine the role of safe drinking water and clean fuels in the spatial relationship among contiguous adjacent districts in terms of dhi scores 2 methodology 2 1 data this study used the data of the pakistan social and living standard measurement pslm survey round vi 2014 15 conducted by the pakistan bureau of statistics pakistan bureau of statistics 2015 although the survey was not conducted to measure the health wellbeing of the districts it does contain very useful and rich information regarding our study objectives the survey covered multiple domains such as socioeconomic demographic housing health water and sanitation environment and geography and data were collected from all districts at the household level 2 2 sample size and unit of analysis the pslm survey applied two stages stratified sampling technique as the survey is conducted at the district level according to the framework of pslm all districts were further administered into enumeration blocks each enumeration block covered about 200 250 households a total of 5438 enumeration blocks were found from which 95 638 households were surveyed in this study the unit of analysis is a district therefore households from enumeration blocks in each district have been aggregated at the district level in this way 113 districts out of 149 have been considered as our sample size the rest of the districts were dropped either they had less information needed for analysis purposes or due to the law and order situations at survey time 2 3 variables of the study eight indicators were chosen from five different dimensions 1 economic yearly mean income of households 2 education percent of the household head with high school degree or above percent of a spouse with middle school degree or above 3 environment percent of households using gas as a clean fuel for cooking purposes 4 safe drinking water percent of households with piped water as a source of safe drinking water and 5 health percent of households where lady health worker lhw visited in last 30 days percent of children under 5 who have completed the full recommended vaccination course percent of women receiving post natal care after delivery these indicators were chosen based on three important grounds first these indicators were significantly correlated with one another see table 1 in the result section second rich data were available on these indicators at the district level third almost all indicators have a strong connection with undp s sustainable development goals especially safe water and clean fuel used for cooking purposes 2 4 construction of the district health index dhi to construct the dhi a recently applied approach of urban health index uhi developed with the teamwork of the world health organization who was adopted who 2014 according to the framework of the uhi first the study indicators were normalized on a scale of 0 1 the indicators were normalized by taking the difference of the indicator s actual value from its lowest value divided by the difference between the highest values to the lowest value mathematically 1 i s i min i max i min i where i max i and min i are the actual value of indicator maximum value of indictor i and minimum value of indicator i minus a small value or a chosen value respectively i s is the calculated standardized value of indicator i satisfying the 0 i s 1 condition second the normalized indicators were combined into a single metric weighted geometric mean formula was applied as all dimensions were assumed to capture equal weights mathematically we have the following equation 2 d h i i 1 j s i i w i 1 i 1 j w i where w i is the weight of the ith indicator and i 1 2 3 8 the weights were assigned so that their sum equals the total number of indicators 2 5 disparity ratio the disparity ratio was computed by taking the ratio of the mean of the upper 10 first decile of the distribution to the mean of the lower 10 last decile of the distribution mathematically we have the below equation 3 d i s p a r i t y r a t i o m e a n o f t h e u p p e r 10 o f d i s t r i b u t i o n m e a n o f t h e l o w e r 10 o f d i s t r i b u t i o n 2 6 disparity slope the disparity slope for the middle 80 middle 8 deciles of the distribution was computed through simple linear regression by applying the ordinary least square ols technique these districts were ranked in ascending order in terms of dhi scores and regressed on the rank variable mathematically 4 d h i i f r a n k i where dhii is the index score of ith district and ranki is the rank of that particular district f shows the functional relationship between dependent and independent variables equation 4 can econometrically be written as under 5 d h i i α β r a n k i ε i β is the disparity slope that shows the average dhi change difference between each adjacent district and is influenced by the ranking of districts 2 7 analytical approach four different versions of the dhi were constructed each with a different set of indicators 1 dhi a was constructed without safe water and clean fuel indicators 2 dhi b included only safe water indicator 3 dhi c comprised only clean fuel indicator and 4 dhi d contained both safe water and clean fuel indicators mean disparity ratio and disparity slope were calculated for all versions of indices districts were ranked in terms of dhi scores for all versions and examined the role of safe drinking water and clean fuel in the health wellbeing of the districts 2 8 spatial autocorrelation moran s i and the local indicators of spatial autocorrelation lisa analysis spatial autocorrelation examines whether there exists an association between the dhi score of a specific district in space and the score of its neighboring districts the consistent test statistics are used to represent the extent of relationship and accumulation mode of geographic variables anselin 1995 getis 2010 li et al 2012 yang et al 2019 the two most widely used spatial autocorrelation functions are the global moran s i and the local moran s i ijumulana et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2021 lima et al 2020 the formula of the global moran s i statistic is shown in equation 6 as under 6 i n i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x x j x i 1 n j 1 n w i j i 1 n x i x 2 i j where n is the number of districts x i and x j represents the dhi scores of districts i and j respectively x shows the mean dhi score for all districts w ij expresses the weighted spatial matrix when the region i and j share a common boundary w ij 1 otherwise w ij 0 i is the value of moran s statistic which ranges between 1 and 1 when moran s i 0 it means that the district s dhi scores are spatially agglomerated when moran s i 0 it means that the dhi scores of neighboring districts are inversely associated when i 0 it means that the district s wellbeing quality is randomly and or irregularly distributed for the significance test of the global moran s i a null hypothesis ho of spatial randomness is tested against the alternative hypothesis h1 of spatial clusters or no spatial randomness to spot the spatial relationship of different spatial locations the local spatial autocorrelation also known as local indicators of spatial association by local moran s i was used in this study the test score measures the extent of spatial association between any specific location district and its surrounding districts the local moran s ii is shown in equation 7 as under 7 i i n x i x i 1 n w i j x j x i 1 n x i x 2 i j here n is the number of districts x i x j are the dhi scores of districts i and j respectively x shows the mean dhi score of all districts w ij are the weighted spatial matrix i i is the degree of spatial cluster between ith districts and their surrounding ones the local indicators of spatial association lisa results can be divided into four different types high high hh low low ll high low hl and low high lh anselin 1995 ijumulana et al 2020 2021 lima et al 2020 martori and hoberg 2008 the first two types hh and ll denote that district wellbeing quality and the quality of its contiguous districts are spatially consistent and the latter two types hl and lh represent that the high low districts are bounded by the low high areas 2 9 analytical tools for analysis purposes excel spreadsheet microsoft excel microsoft corporation statistical package for social sciences spss geographic information system gis and geoda applications were used throughout the study anselin et al 2010 fischer and getis 2009 3 results before interpreting the results it was presumed that the study indicators should be positively correlated with one another pearson s correlation matrix table 1 showed a significant positive association among variables except lhw visit and mean income safe drinking water was negatively correlated with all health related variables lhw visit vaccination and post natal care except vaccination the negative correlations were ignored as slightly inverse relations are typically acceptable who 2014 3 1 descriptive statistics table 2 shows that households from all districts earn on average rs 275 496 21 annually about 23 percent of household s responsible persons have a high school or higher education while only 22 percent of the spouse have middle school or higher than middle education the table also shows that on average about 17 percent and 18 percent of households have access to safe drinking water and clean fuel respectively in addition about 41 percent 69 percent and 28 percent of households from all districts have access to lhw services children vaccination courses and post natal facilities respectively the mean disparity ratio and disparity slopes of all dhi versions are shown in table 3 the highest mean score 0 37 was recorded for dhi a district health index without safe drinking water and clean cooking fuel with a disparity ratio of 10 11 the ratio of upper and lower decile districts in terms of index score and a disparity slope of 0 45 the slope of middle 8 deciles of distribution after adding safe drinking water in district health index dhi b the mean score 0 29 disparity ratio 8 3 and disparity slope 0 35 were decreased whereas by including only clean cooking fuel to dhi dhi c the mean score was declined from 0 37 to 0 28 but disparity ratio 25 29 and disparity slope 0 47 was increased furthermore when both indicators are encompassed in the health index dhi d the mean 0 25 and disparity slope 0 35 were decreased but the disparity ratio was increased from 10 11 to 16 59 the detail of disparity ratios and slopes of all dhi versions are given in additional file 1 table a and b respectively fig 1 displays the distributions of all versions of dhi scores all panels a to d of the figure showed patterns similar to previously measured distributions bortz et al 2015 dai et al 2017 rothenberg et al 2014 however the rankings of the districts were effectively changed for all dhi versions for instance district chitral ranked at 22nd position fig 1a for dhi a district health index without safe water and clean fuel distribution but ranked at 5th position fig 1b for distribution of dhi b when safe drinking water indicator is added to health index it may be due to the reason that a large portion of households in the chitral district has access to safe drinking water which substantially boosted the wellbeing of the district but district chitral ranked at 81st position fig 1c when clean fuel indicator was added to district health index dhi c finally when the health index was measured for dhi d district chitral was ranked at 61st position fig 1d throughout 113 districts similar results were found in the rest of the districts except lahore peshawar karachi quetta and rawalpindi as these districts are the capital cities of all provinces 3 2 characteristics of spatial distributions of dhis the spatial distribution of dhi a scores showed significant spatial differences among provinces of pakistan fig 2 a a cluster of unhealthy districts concerning dhi a scores was found in baluchistan as compared to other provinces in contrast districts of punjab and khyber pakhtunkhwa kp provinces made a pattern of relatively healthy districts in terms of index scores the capital cities of all provinces peshawar karachi quetta and lahore were highly developed as they have darker hues fig 2b displayed the spatial patterns of pakistan s wellbeing status after incorporating the indicator of safe drinking water the overall map showed a pattern similar to fig 2a though some disparities were noted relative to dhi a the patterns of dhi b are slightly randomly distributed which indicated that by adding a clean water indicator the clusters of healthy or unhealthy districts are minimized in other words with the addition of clean drinking water the health status of several districts was reduced by having no or less access to safe drinking water moreover concerning dhi b scores districts from punjab and khyber pakhtunkhwa kp provinces were relatively better than sindh and baluchistan the addition of the clean fuel indicator dhi c changed the overall pattern of distribution which means that access to clean fuel has a considerable impact on pakistan s district health fig 2c the pattern is slightly brighter as compared to dhi a which indicated that less access of districts to clean fuel facilities has inversely influenced the composite index scores districts from baluchistan province made a cluster of unhealthy districts as compared to other provinces finally fig 2d exhibited the spatial results of dhi d including both safe drinking water and clean fuel the overall distribution indicated a pattern different from dhi a where no safe water and clean fuel were entered to the composite index the overall pattern is slightly brighter than dhi a which shows that after adding both safe water and clean fuel indicators the district s health indices were reduced in other words the district s less accessibility towards safe water and clean fuel has lowered the dhi d scores like previous versions of fig 2a c clusters of unhealthy and healthy districts in terms of district health index dhi d scores were found in baluchistan and punjab provinces respectively in contrast a random pattern of developed and deprived districts was found in sindh and kp provinces 3 3 spatial autocorrelation moran s i and the lisa analysis of dhis table 4 shows the results of global moran s i test statistic for four different versions of dhis the value for health wellbeing quality dhi a was calculated as 0 49 which shows significant spatial dependence of districts to their corresponding neighbors with z value of 8 43 and pseudo p value of 0 001 the inclusion of safe drinking water indicator declined the moran s i score from 0 49 to 0 42 whereas clean fuel indicator increased the moran s i score to 0 53 moreover when both indicators were included dhi d the value is declined slightly from 0 49 to 0 48 all these global moran s i scores are highly significant which indicates that there exist obvious positive association of pakistan s district wellbeing status to their surrounding districts local indicators of spatial autocorrelation lisa analysis are carried out through the moran scatter plots as indicated from fig 3 in all panels of fig 3 pakistan s health wellbeing quality of majority of the districts concentrated in the h h and l l quadrants which indicated that most of the districts are spatially clustered while rest of the districts in l h and h l quadrants are considered as spatially heterogeneous however the number of districts differs when safe drinking water fig 3b clean fuels fig 3c or both indicators fig 3d are included in composite index fig 4 illustrates the results of local spatial autocorrelation local moran s i for dhi a d the first two quadrants of hh and ll clustered regions represents high low health quality of districts surrounded by high low neighboring districts whereas the latter two quadrants of lh and hl agglomerated areas indicates low high health status of the districts encircled by high low contiguous districts from fig 4a d the high high hh aggregated districts are mainly distributed in the north eastern districts of pakistan while the low low ll clustered regions are spatially concentrated in south western part of pakistan in addition there are few districts in the low high lh and high low h l accumulated regions mainly concentrated in south and south western fig 4a northern fig 4b western and east northern fig 4c and northern and central fig 4d parts of pakistan 4 discussion access to safe drinking water and clean fuel has substantially affected the well being health and economic development everard 2019 fukuda et al 2019 our study indicators showed very low accessibility of pakistan s households towards both safe drinking water and clean fuel facilities table 2 this lower accessibility has substantially affected pakistan s health wellbeing status from different perspectives the addition of these indicators into the composite index has substantially altered the mean dhi scores disparity ratios disparity slopes ranking of the districts in terms of dhi s scores and spatial relationship among various provinces dai et al 2017 rothenberg et al 2014 stauber et al 2018 without the addition of safe water and clean fuel dhi a pakistan s mean index score was 0 37 with a disparity ratio of 10 11 and a disparity slope of 0 45 table 3 the accumulation of safe drinking water indicator dhi b significantly reduced the mean index score from 0 37 to 0 29 which means that the district s wellbeing health quality has deteriorated nadeem et al 2020 it also minimized the disparity ratio difference between lower and upper decile districts from 10 11 to 8 30 because some of the previously top districts in terms of health quality scores have low access to safe drinking water which ultimately resulted in declined disparity ratio also the reduced slope coefficient 0 35 confirmed that as compared to dhi a the middle 80 percent of districts are now less heterogeneous table 3 similarly the inclusion of clean fuel into the multidimensional index dhi c reduced the overall index score from 0 37 to 0 28 less accessibility of districts to clean fuel facility resultantly degraded the composite scores of most of the districts m k khan khan and rehan 2020 unlike safe water the inclusion of clean fuel has increased both the disparity ratio and disparity slope table 3 the higher disparity ratio 25 29 relative to the disparity ratio of dhi a indicated that healthy districts have complete access to clean fuel facilities compared with their unhealthy counterparts additional file 1 table a finally when both safe water and clean fuel indicators are included dhi d the mean index value is reduced further to 0 25 with a disparity ratio of 16 59 and slope of 0 35 table 3 these results clearly showed that due to lack of access to safe water and clean fuel facilities pakistan district s health quality is declined and inequalities concerning disparity ratio are increased s u khan and hussain 2020 considering the ranking of the districts concerning their dhi scores without safe water and clean fuel district chitral for instance was at 22nd position in terms of dhi scores fig 1a but the addition of water indicator boosted the health status of district chitral and ranked at 5th position fig 1b these results indicated that a high percentage of households in the chitral district have access to safe drinking water which resultantly improved the overall score of health wellbeing in contrast after adding fuel indicator into a composite index its ranking is declined and reached 81st position fig 1c this outcome showed that district chitral has very low access to clean fuel facilities finally by adding both indicators district chitral changed its ranking and stand at 61st position fig 1d these results are consistent with the study of stauber et al 2018 and indicated that access to safe drinking water and fuel matters significantly spatially the pakistan s district s health status is significantly altered when safe water and clean fuel are examined the spatial results moran s i scores clearly showed a positive spatial dependency among districts and their corresponding neighbors however these results varied for all versions of dhis wellbeing quality of pakistan s districts with their adjacent neighbors are highly correlated for clean fuel in contrast when safe drinking water indicator is examined the spatial dependence of contiguous districts is declined table 4 the less accessibility of households to safe drinking water ultimately resulted in lower districts health wellbeing status most of the dhi samples of pakistan and their neighbors are clustered in developed hh quadrant and deprived ll quadrant regions which indicated that districts concerning dhi scores are spatially bunched with similar neighbors the remaining districts are spatially heterogenous concentrated in lh and lh quadrants fig 3a d from lisa results the high high hh aggregated districts are mainly distributed in the north eastern districts punjab province of pakistan while the low low ll clustered regions are spatially concentrated in south western part baluchistan province of pakistan which means that these areas are spatially dependent fig 4a d however the number of districts concentrated in hh and ll varies for clean fuel or and safe drinking water which means that these attributes have significant impact on spatial clusters fig 4b d moreover districts from high low hl and low high lh accumulated regions of pakistan are mainly distributed in south and south western northern western and east northern and north and central part of the country as shown in fig 4a b c and d respectively these districts are either healthier surrounded by deprived neighbors or worse off surrounded by developed neighboring districts this study is limited based on several important grounds first there was a large number of indicators that could be used to measure the district health index dhi but we have limited the number of indicators up to eight as the utilized dataset has insufficient information on other indicators second the analysis was run for 113 districts of pakistan and the rest of the districts were ignored because the respondents were too few to provide a real picture of the districts third instead of having rich information on study indicators we have ignored district islamabad it is the capital of pakistan and its high dhi score made our whole analysis biased finally because few respondents at the council or tehsil level were found to have sufficient information needed to construct the index the unit of analysis was enlarged up to the district level keeping in view these limitations this study is not capturing the exact impact of safe drinking water and clean fuel indicators on pakistan s wellbeing status though contributing to the recent existing literature it becomes a future research interest and with the collaboration of government authorities research experts in their studies can fulfil this gap by incorporating all these deficiencies 5 conclusion and recommendations based on instant results it is concluded that safe drinking water and clean fuel used for domestic cooking practices have substantially altered the rankings and wellbeing disparities of the districts due to the district s lack of accessibility towards the safe drinking water and clean fuel indicators their additions lowered pakistan s district health wellbeing quality concerning dhi scores government and policy planners are recommended to improve people s accessibility to safe water and clean fuel in deprived districts furthermore the spatial analysis concluded that most of districts are spatially clustered in high high or low low quadrants and few spatially heterogenous districts are distributed in low high or high low quadrants these spatially h h healthy developed and l l unhealthy deprived clustered districts are distributed mainly in punjab and baluchistan provinces respectively therefore based on our study findings to improve pakistan s district wellbeing health status the government and policy planners are recommended to give top priority to baluchistan province declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

11882,this study investigates the sustainable yield of a shared regional aquifer that covers a hydrogeological basin dibdibba delta aquifer basin ddab the aquifer extends over an area of 60 000 km2 in three countries iraq kuwait and saudi arabia the groundwater resources of ddab are used by these countries for agricultural and industrial purposes the study aims at assessing the sustainable yield of ddab accounting its recharge discharge rates including submarine groundwater discharge sgd rates and trans boundary fluxes the methodology adopted in this study is based on hydrogeological investigations modified chloride mass balance cmb for brackish aquifers to approximate recharge rates from rainfall hec geohms scs cn model with suitable gis tools to determine runoff rates from rainfall numerical flow and salinity modeling these calibrated numerical models were used to simulate the effect of utilization plan of brackish groundwater from the ddab from 1975 until 2030 the results of the study show that aquifer recharge from rainfall is on average 9 6 and runoff rate from rainfall is about 10 the simulation results show that sgd rates from kuwait and iraq to the arabian gulf were 184 and 43 mm3 yr respectively the current pumping activities in the ddab can be increased from the existing utilization level at 425 mm3 yr to the sustainable yield level at 515 mm3 yr with a consequence of increasing the drawdown to 12 m and salinity deterioration of 205 in some areas keywords hydrogeology recharge components submarine groundwater discharge numerical modeling 1 introduction brackish water demand in kuwait saudi arabia and iraq on groundwater resources is increasing constantly due to the expansion of irrigated agriculture and industrial activities in these countries al rashed et al 2018 aliewi et al 2017a turbak 2014 isotopes were used to investigate hydrological processes across regional spatial scales including hydro climatic processes and origin of aquifer recharge stable isotope tracers of water such as oxygen and hydrogen isotopes δ18o and δd are amongst the most frequently used to trace the sources and or genesis of water aquifer basins sabarathinam et al 2020 the local meteoric water line kuwait meteoric water line kmwl developed from the precipitation data between δ18o and δd isotopes ratios in natural meteoric waters is a convenient reference for understanding and tracing the origin hadi et al 2016 the total annual volume of water that enters the aquifer is the annual recharge but the sustainable yield of the aquifer is the proportion of the annual recharge that can be utilized without adverse effect on the water resource and its ecosystems in general the shared aquifers can be mismanaged and could lead to depletion of groundwater supplies if the sharing countries lack essential information about the sustainable yield of the regional aquifer studies on the regional aquifer shared by brazil argentina paraguay and uruguay wada et al 2010 was strongly affected by the heavy pumping by each country it is also important to note that the sustainable yield is a subjective assessment of the resources development that can be achieved without significant deterioration of the resource the sustainable yield represents a balance between exploitation and impacts on water levels and salinity deterioration un escwa and bgr 2013 steiakakis 2018 the concept of sustainable yield is often confusing as researchers mix between production facility optimal yield and the aquifer s sustainable yield in addition the sustainable yield concept in arid regions has different governing factors from those in the semiarid or wet regions this study addresses the hydrogeology of the aquifer basin shared by the three countries fig 1 referred as dibdibba delta aquifer basin ddab in securing strategic water resources for these countries shared brackish groundwater should be considered as the vital resource for agricultural and industrial water uses the lack of information on the location extent and the total dissolved solids tds content of these brackish groundwater resources prevents the preparation of sustainable utilization plans for these resources the estimation of the sustainable yield of the ddab includes a few uncertainties due to the lack of data availability with regard to abstraction volumes from each country in addition to weak understanding of the possible cross boundary fluxes among its international borders moreover there is an inter aquifer flow between ddab and other aquifer units the new knowledge about the sustainable yield of this regional ddab will help develop efficient utilization plans and management practices of brackish groundwater resources within the boundaries of each sharing country therefore reasonable utilization of this resource ddab is of vital importance to kuwait saudi arabia and iraq a thorough understanding of the hydrological regime of this regional aquifer basin is essential for providing successful exploitation plans the shared ddab between kuwait saudi arabia and iraq fig 1 was investigated intially by mukhopadhyay et al 1996 a few local studies on ddab were carried out within the countries of kuwait or iraq or saudi arabia turbak 2014 aliewi et al 2017b aliewi and burezq 2018 parsons 1964 al senafy 2001 atiaa and aboodi 2005 atiaa 2000 khwedim et al 2017 abadi 2002 the sustainable yield of the regional aquifer cannot be oversimplified by arithmetically adding the individual estimates of sustainable yields in respective countries when the aquifer were to be studied on the regional level a more accurate sustainable yield of the aquifer would be obtained the sustainable yield will be influenced by the regional changes in the hydrogeolgical properties of the aquifer geometry and water levels to represent more accurately the aquifer dynamics in saudi arabia kuwait and iraq thus the outcome of the study would prevent the extensive lowering of groundwater levels and or considerably increase in groundwater salinity of the aquifer the development of groundwater flow and salinity models are based on the data collected to increase the technical capacity and practice by allowing a calibrated model the developed model is applicable for predicting the changes in hydraulic heads and salinity of groundwater in the aquifer this outcome of the study will help ensure that kuwait saudi arabia and iraq to maintain and develop the sustainable management of ddab the literature reveals that there is no comprehensive study to estimate the sustainable yield of ddab as a regional shared aquifer this is the first baseline study to assess the sustainable yield of the ddab transboundary aquifer by assessing the hydrogeology aquifer recharge discharge in the shared countires 2 study area and methodology the study area of this shared aquifer covers dibdibba delta aquifer basin ddab with a total surface area of 60 000 km2 however the regional aquifer of dibdibba extends over a huge area turbak 2014 in saudi arabia the interest of the study was to assess the subsurface extent 60 000 km2 of ddab with 10 000 km2 in kuwait 16 of the total area 27 000 km2 in saudi arabia 45 and an area of 23 000 km2 in iraq 39 2 1 geology and lithology ddab is of pliocene miocene epoch and is overlain by alluvial quaternary deposits the name dibdibba aquifer is used in kuwait and iraq with the upper hydraulic unit of ddab referred as hofuf aquifer in saudi arabia the ddab formation and general lithology in the respective countries are presented in table 1 the lithology of the upper unit dibdibba aquifer is described by the united nations escwa and bgr un escwa and bgr 2013 and by few other studies al sulaimi and el rabaa 1994 al bakri et al 1988a 1988b al sulaimi et al 1988 1997 stating that the aquifer mainly consisit of gravelly sand often calcretized with subordinate clays the dibdibba aquifer is underlain by an aquitard referred as lower fars in kuwait and iraq and as dam in saudi arabia the aquitard lower fars dam is intercalated with limestone clay marl sandstone and shale which substantites that it could be a weak vertical extension of the dibdibba aquifer the ghar formation lies beneath the aquitard in kuwait and iraq which is referred as hadrukh formation in saudi arabia ghar hadrukh is composed of sand and gravel with rare content of clay which signifies a relatively good aquifer the pliocene and miocene formations in few places act as one hydraulic unit named as kuwait group aquifer according to unescwa un escwa and bgr 2013 and referred as ddab in all the three countries in this study the ddab is considered as one hydraulic unit to represent its regional function the average rainfall over the shared ddab is about 100 200 mm y un escwa and bgr 2013 the annual groundwater abstraction of ddab is around 370 470 mm3 y un escwa and bgr 2013 in kuwait majority of the northern part of the country the southern part of iraq and in saudi arabia the current utilization of ddab is around hafr al batin city 2 1 methodology the methodology adopted in this study include a structured approach in four steps 1 hydrogeological investigations 2 a dopting an approach developed by aliewi et al 2020 that comprises a modification of the classic chloride mass balance cmb to suit brackish aquifers to approximate recharge rates from rainfall events also this methodology includes isotopic analysis to investigate the origin of recharge in ddab 3 a hec geohms scs cn model with suitable gis tools to determine runoff rates from rainfall the approach about geohms scs cn is developed with close scientific cooperation with al jaidi al juaidi 2020 4 numerical flow and salinity modeling the steady state and transient flow models were developed for ddab using visual modflow flex version 6 that includes the engine mt3ds which was used in this study to simulate groundwater flow and salinity changes over a horizon for future planning the modeling efforts in this study for ddab addressed the following conceptual and steady state flow models transient flow model and salinity model the models were used to develop reasonable utilization plans of the brackish groundwater resources from ddab the models were calibrated and utilized to simulate the effect of utilization plans of brackish groundwater in ddab for a period from 1975 until 2030 considering the water level decline and salinity deterioration the hydrogeological investigations include the analysis of the secondary data on isotopes clark and fritz 1997 well inventory and geology of ddab in the shared countries aliewi et al 2020 discussed that the classic chloride mass balance cmb method estimates and adopted aquifer recharge as a percentage of rainfall that equals the ratio of chloride concentration in rainfall to chloride concentration in the groundwater of the underlying aquifer however this method neglects the long term concentration of cl that come from other sources background concentration such as adjacent brackish aquifers the unsaturated zone runoff in wadis and surface catchments evaporates and pollution sources e g dissolution of minerals use of road salts and infiltration of raw wastewater irrigation returns industrial and urban wastes in areas where the background cl concentration is high such as brackish aquifers the percentage of aquifer recharge will be underestimated by the classic cmb the background chloride concentration in the underlying aquifer is assumed here to be the minimum value of chloride in the consecutive dry seasons aliewi et al 2020 also discussed that the classic cmb has another important shortcoming of ignoring the vertical extent of the cyclic effect of recharging cl concentration within the underlying aquifer they suggested using salinity vertical profiles after rainfall events to identify the vertical extent of the cyclic effect of recharging rainfall with known cl concentration in the modified approach the effect of recharging water in brackish aquifers is considered effective in the upper zone of brackish saline water body realizing that this water body has a greater salinity in the deeper zones the modified cmb was developed by aliewi et al 2020 and the data collected from rainfall stations and monitoring wells all for kuwait were used 3 results and analysis 3 1 aquifer recharge and submarine groundwater discharge sgd recharge to the aquifer is generally dependent on amount of rainfall its intensity topography soil type soil moisture geology and depth to groundwater level under steady state conditions groundwater recharge is balanced by natural discharge of ddab to euphrates rivers and sgd to arabian gulf sea to maintain a balance within the aquifer extraction of groundwater is compensated through an increase in lateral recharge domenico 1972 domenico and schwartz 1990 a decrease in sgd leakage to from the euphrates river and from aquifer storage a reasonable estimation of recharge to aquifers is important in the management of the scarce water resources in arid regions kalbus et al 2011a recharge is a very important component in evaluating the water balance of ddab as a regional source of water however this component is very difficult to quantify for heterogeneous geological formations rainfall and wadis runoff are also to be considered as source of recharge subyani 2004 estimated aquifer recharge in alluvial aquifers in saudi arabia using cmb methodology at 11 of rainfall the present study is based on a new cmb aliewi et al 2020 method modified to be suitable for brackish groundwater aquifers this study only reports the results of aquifer recharge aliewi et al 2020 as aquifer recharge from rainfall at 9 6 of annual rainfall 116 mm aliewi et al 2020 11 mm yr aquifer recharge from runoff al juaidi 2020 9 6 x10 x116 1 mm yr total aquifer recharge from rainfall and runoff 11 1 12 mm yr sgd and transboundary influxes were simulated as outputs from the ddab numerical models isotope analysis of secondary data clark and fritz 1997 bhandary and chidambaram 2020 shows that the origin of recharge sources to ddab is due to the mixing between brackish and saline ground waters stable isotope results of rain water from iraq saudi arabia and kuwait showed a good relationship between the δ 18o and δd isotopes and there was an enrichment noted in rainwater samples collected during the period from february to may and the depletion in samples collected from november december hadi et al 2016 intially attemped to derive the kmwl against the observation made by michelsen et al 2015 on the isotope signature of various rain events from 2009 to 2013 the study revealed that δ 18o ranges from 6 5 to 9 5 and that of δd from 30 to 50 there is a greater variation of isotope value in riyadh saudi arabia than kuwait the stable isotopic signatures of the ddab in this iraqi region reported that δ 18o ranged between 1 34 and 0 18 and that of δ d ranging between 19 31 and 2 88 the results indicate that the recharge occurred slowly after the significant evaporation by the surface water body the isotopic values support the fact that the recharge to ddab at hafr al batin area in saudi arabia aquifer is mainly due to the cyclones from the arabian gulf al suhail 1996 the isotopic analysis indicates that there is a slight variation in the precipitation pattern governed by the land use pattern changes the isotope values of groundwater in kuwait indicated the initial composition of recharge water and that the recharge takes place in the saudi highlands hadi et al 2016 however the evidence produced from the isotopic analysis of the groundwater showed that recharge is indeed taking place at the watershed scale a wide range of ratios was observed indicating different water sources and different proportion of mixing between these sources these sources are essentially the regional brackish saline groundwater which is originating from saudi arabia and the local recharge from rainfall 3 2 conceptual and steady state flow models the available data suggested that the groundwater flow dips from the south and southwest to north and northeast owing to the lower topographic elevations in the northeastern part of ddabthe conceptual model considers ddab as one layer 200 300 m thick with an impermeable base to reflect its regional and shared characteristics kalbus et al 2011b the steady state model of ddab deals with recharge from rainfall and runoff only urban recharge was considered negligible on the regional level the grid of the numerical model of the study area covers a surface area of around 60 000 km2 fig 2 the study area was initially divided into 100 rows and 100 columns to generate a grid with equal cells the area of each cell was 10 5 km2 3250 m 3250 m during the transient simulations this grid was further refined into smaller cells near the pumping wells fig 2 also illustrates the boundary conditions used in the model as follows 1 general head boundaries ghb to represent trans boundary fluxes 2 constant head boundaries at the contact of the arabian gulf with kuwaiti and iraqi parts of ddab 3 river boundary at euphrates river 4 no flow boundaries elsewhere fig 2 also shows the location of observations wells in the study area the general head and constant head boundary conditions were used to allow fluxes to leave the aquifer through the political borders or as submarine groundwater discharge to the arabian gulf from kuwait and iraq in particular the southern and the eastern boundaries were set as constant head boundary to represent an infinite source of water entering the aquifer system from irrigated areas and the surrounding geological formations further to the south of the modelled area boundary values were based on the regional piezometry contours pre 1960 according to mukhopadhyay et al 1996 indicating that the groundwater flow direction from south southwest to north northeast the head boundary conditions were used to reflect the initial potentiometric heads in the shared ddab prior to development of heavy pumping schemes 3 3 results of steady state simulations for the flow model of ddab 3 3 1 calibration of steady state flow model because of errors and uncertainty in defining model parameters models should be calibrated to obtain the best estimate of the hydraulic properties of the aquifer about 36 observation wells were considered from official governmental bodies in the three sharing countries fig 2 for calibration the measured potential heads in the observation wells were considered from the initial point of simulation on 1 1 1975 steady state calibration under natural conditions was undertaken using the static water levels measured pre 1960 with no pumping from production wells and with full rainfall recharge the purpose of this calibration was to match natural conditions and to illustrate the relevancy of this steady state calibration the kuwaiti production wells yielded 15 mm3 yr and 94 mm3 yr on average for the periods of 1965 1975 and 1976 2019 respectively the steady state calibration results using pest engine of vmf flex are shown in fig 3 reflecting the match between calculated heads and observed heads had a good correlation with a coefficient of 0 99 the calibrated hydraulic conductivity values versus the hydraulic conductivity values from pumping tests are presented in table 2 and it had a reasonable match the resulting spatial distribution of the calibrated hydraulic conductivity m d of the steady state model for ddab fig 4 indicates that kx is not the same as ky for each zone of calibration signifying that the hydraulic conductivity is anisotropic when kx ky for anisotropic hydrogeological conditions the direction of groundwater flow is neither horizontal nor vertical this anisotropy property is illustrated in the direction of groundwater flow for ddab from southwest to northeast fig 5 3 3 2 direction of groundwater flow and water heads the groundwater flow directions are from south and southwest to north and northeast and dominated in y direction fig 5a the movement starts slow at the southern boundary in saudi arabia the rate of flow increases towards kuwait as groundwater movement finds an easy path through kuwait due to higher hydraulic conductivity values the groundwater flow leaves saudi arabia to relatively a low permeability zone in southern iraq the groundwater velocity in this zone is low as the groundwater moves to northern iraq the velocity of this groundwater increases the head distribution of the calibrated steady state groundwater system of ddab fig 5b reveals that it starts at a high value of 350 m above sea level m asl in the southern part of the ddab in saudi arabia the heads reduce gradually toward the north and northeast along the kuwait saudi arabia border the head varies between 100 and 130 m asl and along saudi arabia iraq border it is observed around 150 m asl subsequently they approach the sea level near the arabian gulf in kuwait and iraq the heads in the northern boundary in iraq range between 10 and 50 m asl 3 3 3 steady state sustainable yield of ddab the sustainable yield is of any target aquifer under steady state conditions is defined as the capacity of the aquifer to yield groundwater volumes before development through drilling pumping wells ندوة جودة وتوفيق هجول 2012 alley and leake 2004 kazmann 1956 maimone 2004 seward et al 2006 subsequently the pumping wells operation will be considered to simulate the impact on the sustainable yield in terms of maximum water level drawdown and deterioration of the aquifer salinity the sustainable yield simulated through a calibrated steady state model for ddab before development table 3 and fig 6 clearly illustrate that the sustainable yield of ddab 515 mm3 y the table shows that 88 mm3 y enters the aquifer from the southern boundary in saudi arabia the model also shows that the aquifer receives a total recharge of about 427 mm3 y the total inflows are balanced by sgd rates of 184 and 43 mm3 y in kuwait and iraq respectively the results of the calibrated model also show that around 49 mm3 y and 168 mm3 y leave the aquifer to the river and through northern boundary in iraq respectively table 3 also illustrates that 151 mm3 y flows as trans boundary lateral flow between saudi arabia and kuwait the trans boundary flow between saudi arabia and iraq is 69 mm3 y while the trans boundary between kuwait and iraq is 38 mm3 y the sgd rate of 184 mm3 y is over 115 km length of contact between ddab and kuwaiti coast and it yields sgd 1 6 mm3 y km in a study carried out by bhandary bhandary and chidambaram 2020 the sgd rate was estimated to be 16 270 mm3 y km the difference in the results is due to the fact that bhandary bhandary and chidambaram 2020 calculated sgd for both kuwait group and dammam aquifers for the entire kuwait coast while this study estimates only for kuwait group aquifers terminating in arabian gulf 3 4 development and calibration of the transient state flow model of ddab after the determination of the steady state sustainable yield of ddab all existing pumping wells were incorporated in the steady state flow model to transform it to transient flow model this transient flow model was then calibrated successfully with pest engine of flex software the purpose was to use the calibrated transient flow model to investigate the ability of the ddab to allow extraction of the required additional amounts of brackish water for the intended use without excessive drawdown the transient flow model was calibrated against temporal observed data of water levels to determine storage coefficients figs 7 and 8 the k zones used in the steady state calibration were used initially for the calibration of sy values in the transient model calibration the results of the transient calibration using pest engine of flex software indicated the different zones fig 8 due to limited data availability only three wells were used in this calibration process but only m6 u well is highlighted the difference between simulated heads and observed heads was about 6 m then the effect of storage started to influence the distribution of water levels in space and time which resulted in a small difference between simulated heads and observed heads to be 0 5 m the calibrated storage coefficient sy of m6 u was 10 11 and the values matched with the results of a several of pumping tests conducted in kuwait the calibrated model was used to simulate the maximum drawdown in the regional aquifer of ddab this simulated drawdown was used to assess the viability of future development and abstraction scenarios on water levels in the dedicated management zones of ddab the results of the current study indicate the change in direction of groundwater flow due to excessive pumping from sw to ne and from w to e al madhlom et al 2020 the transient flow model was calibrated with specific yield values to range between 3 6 and 20 figs 7 and 8 al kubaisi et al 2018 has attempted a similar approach for dibdibba aquifer in iraq and used a value for sy of 7 3 similarly aliewi aliewi et al 2021 calibrated the model using the sy value of 12 for dibdibba aquifer in kuwait the calibration of dibdibba aquifer model representing iraq region was done with a sy value ranging from 14 to 40 depending upon spatial variation in aquifer properties of the region attia and aboodi atiaa and aboodi 2005 the unconfined nature of this aquifer in saudi arabia has led to the usage of 20 as sy value for calibration of the model al turbak et al 1993 3 5 development and results from the baseline salinity model for ddab the spatial distribution of salinity in ddab was reported by several studies in iraq kuwait and saudi arabia parsons 1964 al senafy 2001 atiaa and aboodi 2005 atiaa 2000 khwedim et al 2017 abadi 2002 fadlelmawla et al 2009 al kubaisi 1996 aboodi et al 2008 al basrawi 2006 ipc 1964 manhi 2012 al manssory 2000 davraz and oezdemir 2014 raju 2007 tememi 2015 makkawi 2010 aly et al 2014 the range of salinity varies widely from 2800 to 16 800 mg l and a few locations were observed to have values beyond this range fig 9 the development of a robust salinity model for ddab requires reasonable values for dispersion coefficients the travel distance of the solute from the sw boundary in saudi arabia to ne boundary of ddab in iraq is about 400 km given a maximum length of a cell parallel to flow direction of 3700 m fig 2 a value of αl 50 925 m is appropriate according to meheta et al mehta et al 2000 a discretization rule of thumb mehta et al 2000 that guarantees spatial stability for the solute transport simulation is δl 4 αl i e αl should be less than 3700 4 925 m in the ddab model a value of longitudinal dispersivity of 500 m was used table 4 in salinity modelling it is worth noting that the longitudinal dispersion simply αl times velocity and the transverse dispersion αt times velocity are the most important paramaters that control the dispersion of salinity in ddab the salinity gradients in the flow direction are lesser fig 9 and therefore the simulation results are not sensitive to longitudinal dispersivity values over the travel distance of 400 km in addition it is important to note that the developed salinity model is for one layer which does not consider the effect of vertical velocity gradient to assess the effect of saline water upconing in the approach developed here the areas of obvious saline water upconing were determined first subsequently the measured salinity was assigned as known salinity value which was fixed in the model for dispersive and advective flux movements to approximate saline water upconing process the simulated distribution data of salinity after 1 day for the baseline saline model show that the results were affected with initial salinity data with minor spatial extent in iraq where salinity values were higher than 15 000 mg l fig 10 in saudi arabia and most of kuwait the results show a moderate range of salinity varying from 2400 to 6000 mg l the simulations show that salinity of the groundwater in northwest and northeast of kuwait varies between 10 000 and 12 500 mg l fig 10 the results of this study agree with the study of mukhopadhyay et al 1994 al ali 2008 and aliewi et al 2021 mukhopadhyay et al 1994 reported that the deterioration in water quality of the utilized aquifers is strongly affected with the severe decline in the water levels of the aquifers similar observations on the decline in water level due to the excessive groundwater pumping for irrigation purpose has also enhanced the groundwater salinity al ali 2008 the study by al ali et al al ali 2008 inferred that the over pumping of kuwait aquifers facilitates lateral flow of saline water also the quality of groundwater is further deteriorated by return flow of irrigation water with a higher tds content the spatial variation of salinity in groundwater of kuwait has been addressed along the coast line in the shallow and deeper aquifers bhandary et al 2018 sabarathinam et al 2020 the studies reflected that there is a significant anthropogenic stress in the coastal groundwaters especially the shallow aquifers aliewi et al 2021 reported that during the well operational scenario transient salinity model pumping would result in the vertical migration of the deeper saline water upwards to deteriorate the quality of the existing brackish groundwater in the shallow aquifer 3 6 water utilization plans in ddab the abstracted water from ddab was mainly used for agricultural purposes these extracted brackish waters feed the kuwait farms abdali and wafra farms the small agricultural communities around wadi al batin wadi in saudi arabia and the farms at basra and zubair cities in iraq groundwater has usually been abstracted mainly from the upper part of ddab in the three sharing countries the plan of water utilization from ddab table 5 and fig 11 was to enhance the utilization capacity in the region two utilization plans were simulated in this study and they are described in table 5 for scenario 1 table 5 presents that the existing abstractions from the ddab and are observed to be less than its sustainable yield at 425 mm3 y then a hypothesis scenario 2 to match the abstraction rates with the sustainable yield was adopted this scenario considered the incorporation of new operating well fields the spatial distribution of the new wellfields fig 11 and the amount of new abstracted quantity in each sharing country is presented in table 5 the flow and salinity engines of vmf flex were used to test if the hypothesis could be accepted or rejected in terms of maximum drawdown and maximum deterioration in salinities the simulation results under scenario 1 show that the maximum drawdown at the end of the simulation period under existing abstracting of 425 mm3 y was around 4 32 m in ne part iraq similar drawdown values were observed around hafr al batin city in saudi arabia the salinity results of this simulation run for the above scenario are presented in table 6 the maximum salinity deterioration according to table 6 is in northern part of ddab in iraq near northern well fields of kuwait and along the southwestern part of saudi arabia under scenario 2 table 5 for total abstraction from ddab wellfield 515 mm3 yr the sustainable yield of ddab the drawdown results fig 12 and the spatial distribution of tds mg l in the aquifer after operating all existing and new well fields for 55 y 2030 since simulation started are shown in fig 13 a comparison of drawdowns and salinities between the two scenarios is presented in tables 7 and 8 respectively a maximum drawdown under scenario 2 is observed to be 12 m is in the ne of the model where thousands of wells operate in kuwait and iraq for agricultural purposes table 7 the next large drawdown was 11 m near hafr al batin because a new well field is located in that area the effect of operating the existing wells together with the new well fields scenario 2 on the simulated salinity distribution in ddab using the salinity engine mt3ds of vmf reflected significant increase in the northern portion of the study area fig 13 and table 8 the model also infers that the salinity deterioration is doubled at the new southern well field in saudi arabia table 8 and fig 13 in addition in kuwait 29 of salinity deterioration in the new well field in the western region of the country is observed the increase in salinity of all the existing and new wells are driven by two mechanisms namely 1 lateral flux from boundaries with more brackish water bodies with limited rainfall al qallaf et al 2020 and 2 more brackish water up coning because of depeltion of water table due to drawdown and subjected the well field to additional pumping rates 3 7 impact of the utilization plans on the sustainable yield of ddab as stated before the sustainable yield is a subjective assessment of ddab development without causing significant deterioration in aquifer water levels and salinity in this study it was assumed that maximum drawdown should be less than 25 of the water column in the wells and the maximum deterioration of aquifer salinity occurs only in limited spatial extent to be less than 200 the impact of the utilization plans 1975 2019 of 425 mm3 y from ddab resulted in a maximum simulated drawdown of 4 23 m and about 200 deterioration of salinity in certain locations with minor spatial extent of the aquifer since 1975 the future utilization plan 2020 2030 including new well fields with abstraction rates increased from 425 to 515 mm3 y were tested the simulated water level drawdowns were as follows o iraq from 5 m at 2019 to 12 m at 2030 o kuwait from 4 m at 2019 to 9 m at 2030 o saudi arabia from 4 m at 2019 to 11 m at 2030 at hafr al batin city all these drawdown values were less than 25 of the water column of the wells the deterioration in the ddab salinity was also simulated and the results were as follows o southwest of iraq increase in salinity about 7 o east of hafr el batin increase in salinity about 13 o middle west of kuwait increase in salinity about 29 o some of the southern well field in saudi arabia increase in salinity about 200 o remaining areas increase in salinity about less than 5 the subjective assessment of ddab sustainable yield was achived by considering pumping wells in operation at a rate similar to the steady state when the maximum drawdown and salinity deterioration in only small spatial areas of ddab were simulated to be less than 25 and 200 respectively therefore the sustainable yield during the pumping conditions also equals 515 mm3 y 4 conclusions this study addresses a management strategy for the important transboundary aquifer utilized for agricultural water purposes by saudi arabia kuwait and iraq this study developed reasonable future utilization plans in ddab within the political boundaries of the three sharing countries the developed numerical models were used to simulate the effect of implementing the utilization plans for brackish groundwater from ddab considering the drop in the aquifers water levels and the deterioration in the aquifer salinity because the aquifer dynamics were studied regionally over 60 000 km2 in this study a more accurate steady state sustainable yield of the aquifer was simulated the subjective assessment ddab sustainable yield considering the pumping wells operation at a rate equals the steady state sustainable yield was achieved when the maximum drawdown and salinity deterioration of ddab were simulated to be less than 25 and 200 respectively therefore the sustainable yield under pumping conditions also equals 515 mm3 y any utilization of the aquifer with volumes greater than its sustainable yield will require careful management of operating the production wells on intermittent basis the robust salinity model developed in this study shows that the initial distribution of salinity values in the ddab system play a significant role in the results of the final salinity distribution under dynamic conditions in ddab the groundwater flow directions were ne mainly to e and in cones of depression around the wells were observed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11882,this study investigates the sustainable yield of a shared regional aquifer that covers a hydrogeological basin dibdibba delta aquifer basin ddab the aquifer extends over an area of 60 000 km2 in three countries iraq kuwait and saudi arabia the groundwater resources of ddab are used by these countries for agricultural and industrial purposes the study aims at assessing the sustainable yield of ddab accounting its recharge discharge rates including submarine groundwater discharge sgd rates and trans boundary fluxes the methodology adopted in this study is based on hydrogeological investigations modified chloride mass balance cmb for brackish aquifers to approximate recharge rates from rainfall hec geohms scs cn model with suitable gis tools to determine runoff rates from rainfall numerical flow and salinity modeling these calibrated numerical models were used to simulate the effect of utilization plan of brackish groundwater from the ddab from 1975 until 2030 the results of the study show that aquifer recharge from rainfall is on average 9 6 and runoff rate from rainfall is about 10 the simulation results show that sgd rates from kuwait and iraq to the arabian gulf were 184 and 43 mm3 yr respectively the current pumping activities in the ddab can be increased from the existing utilization level at 425 mm3 yr to the sustainable yield level at 515 mm3 yr with a consequence of increasing the drawdown to 12 m and salinity deterioration of 205 in some areas keywords hydrogeology recharge components submarine groundwater discharge numerical modeling 1 introduction brackish water demand in kuwait saudi arabia and iraq on groundwater resources is increasing constantly due to the expansion of irrigated agriculture and industrial activities in these countries al rashed et al 2018 aliewi et al 2017a turbak 2014 isotopes were used to investigate hydrological processes across regional spatial scales including hydro climatic processes and origin of aquifer recharge stable isotope tracers of water such as oxygen and hydrogen isotopes δ18o and δd are amongst the most frequently used to trace the sources and or genesis of water aquifer basins sabarathinam et al 2020 the local meteoric water line kuwait meteoric water line kmwl developed from the precipitation data between δ18o and δd isotopes ratios in natural meteoric waters is a convenient reference for understanding and tracing the origin hadi et al 2016 the total annual volume of water that enters the aquifer is the annual recharge but the sustainable yield of the aquifer is the proportion of the annual recharge that can be utilized without adverse effect on the water resource and its ecosystems in general the shared aquifers can be mismanaged and could lead to depletion of groundwater supplies if the sharing countries lack essential information about the sustainable yield of the regional aquifer studies on the regional aquifer shared by brazil argentina paraguay and uruguay wada et al 2010 was strongly affected by the heavy pumping by each country it is also important to note that the sustainable yield is a subjective assessment of the resources development that can be achieved without significant deterioration of the resource the sustainable yield represents a balance between exploitation and impacts on water levels and salinity deterioration un escwa and bgr 2013 steiakakis 2018 the concept of sustainable yield is often confusing as researchers mix between production facility optimal yield and the aquifer s sustainable yield in addition the sustainable yield concept in arid regions has different governing factors from those in the semiarid or wet regions this study addresses the hydrogeology of the aquifer basin shared by the three countries fig 1 referred as dibdibba delta aquifer basin ddab in securing strategic water resources for these countries shared brackish groundwater should be considered as the vital resource for agricultural and industrial water uses the lack of information on the location extent and the total dissolved solids tds content of these brackish groundwater resources prevents the preparation of sustainable utilization plans for these resources the estimation of the sustainable yield of the ddab includes a few uncertainties due to the lack of data availability with regard to abstraction volumes from each country in addition to weak understanding of the possible cross boundary fluxes among its international borders moreover there is an inter aquifer flow between ddab and other aquifer units the new knowledge about the sustainable yield of this regional ddab will help develop efficient utilization plans and management practices of brackish groundwater resources within the boundaries of each sharing country therefore reasonable utilization of this resource ddab is of vital importance to kuwait saudi arabia and iraq a thorough understanding of the hydrological regime of this regional aquifer basin is essential for providing successful exploitation plans the shared ddab between kuwait saudi arabia and iraq fig 1 was investigated intially by mukhopadhyay et al 1996 a few local studies on ddab were carried out within the countries of kuwait or iraq or saudi arabia turbak 2014 aliewi et al 2017b aliewi and burezq 2018 parsons 1964 al senafy 2001 atiaa and aboodi 2005 atiaa 2000 khwedim et al 2017 abadi 2002 the sustainable yield of the regional aquifer cannot be oversimplified by arithmetically adding the individual estimates of sustainable yields in respective countries when the aquifer were to be studied on the regional level a more accurate sustainable yield of the aquifer would be obtained the sustainable yield will be influenced by the regional changes in the hydrogeolgical properties of the aquifer geometry and water levels to represent more accurately the aquifer dynamics in saudi arabia kuwait and iraq thus the outcome of the study would prevent the extensive lowering of groundwater levels and or considerably increase in groundwater salinity of the aquifer the development of groundwater flow and salinity models are based on the data collected to increase the technical capacity and practice by allowing a calibrated model the developed model is applicable for predicting the changes in hydraulic heads and salinity of groundwater in the aquifer this outcome of the study will help ensure that kuwait saudi arabia and iraq to maintain and develop the sustainable management of ddab the literature reveals that there is no comprehensive study to estimate the sustainable yield of ddab as a regional shared aquifer this is the first baseline study to assess the sustainable yield of the ddab transboundary aquifer by assessing the hydrogeology aquifer recharge discharge in the shared countires 2 study area and methodology the study area of this shared aquifer covers dibdibba delta aquifer basin ddab with a total surface area of 60 000 km2 however the regional aquifer of dibdibba extends over a huge area turbak 2014 in saudi arabia the interest of the study was to assess the subsurface extent 60 000 km2 of ddab with 10 000 km2 in kuwait 16 of the total area 27 000 km2 in saudi arabia 45 and an area of 23 000 km2 in iraq 39 2 1 geology and lithology ddab is of pliocene miocene epoch and is overlain by alluvial quaternary deposits the name dibdibba aquifer is used in kuwait and iraq with the upper hydraulic unit of ddab referred as hofuf aquifer in saudi arabia the ddab formation and general lithology in the respective countries are presented in table 1 the lithology of the upper unit dibdibba aquifer is described by the united nations escwa and bgr un escwa and bgr 2013 and by few other studies al sulaimi and el rabaa 1994 al bakri et al 1988a 1988b al sulaimi et al 1988 1997 stating that the aquifer mainly consisit of gravelly sand often calcretized with subordinate clays the dibdibba aquifer is underlain by an aquitard referred as lower fars in kuwait and iraq and as dam in saudi arabia the aquitard lower fars dam is intercalated with limestone clay marl sandstone and shale which substantites that it could be a weak vertical extension of the dibdibba aquifer the ghar formation lies beneath the aquitard in kuwait and iraq which is referred as hadrukh formation in saudi arabia ghar hadrukh is composed of sand and gravel with rare content of clay which signifies a relatively good aquifer the pliocene and miocene formations in few places act as one hydraulic unit named as kuwait group aquifer according to unescwa un escwa and bgr 2013 and referred as ddab in all the three countries in this study the ddab is considered as one hydraulic unit to represent its regional function the average rainfall over the shared ddab is about 100 200 mm y un escwa and bgr 2013 the annual groundwater abstraction of ddab is around 370 470 mm3 y un escwa and bgr 2013 in kuwait majority of the northern part of the country the southern part of iraq and in saudi arabia the current utilization of ddab is around hafr al batin city 2 1 methodology the methodology adopted in this study include a structured approach in four steps 1 hydrogeological investigations 2 a dopting an approach developed by aliewi et al 2020 that comprises a modification of the classic chloride mass balance cmb to suit brackish aquifers to approximate recharge rates from rainfall events also this methodology includes isotopic analysis to investigate the origin of recharge in ddab 3 a hec geohms scs cn model with suitable gis tools to determine runoff rates from rainfall the approach about geohms scs cn is developed with close scientific cooperation with al jaidi al juaidi 2020 4 numerical flow and salinity modeling the steady state and transient flow models were developed for ddab using visual modflow flex version 6 that includes the engine mt3ds which was used in this study to simulate groundwater flow and salinity changes over a horizon for future planning the modeling efforts in this study for ddab addressed the following conceptual and steady state flow models transient flow model and salinity model the models were used to develop reasonable utilization plans of the brackish groundwater resources from ddab the models were calibrated and utilized to simulate the effect of utilization plans of brackish groundwater in ddab for a period from 1975 until 2030 considering the water level decline and salinity deterioration the hydrogeological investigations include the analysis of the secondary data on isotopes clark and fritz 1997 well inventory and geology of ddab in the shared countries aliewi et al 2020 discussed that the classic chloride mass balance cmb method estimates and adopted aquifer recharge as a percentage of rainfall that equals the ratio of chloride concentration in rainfall to chloride concentration in the groundwater of the underlying aquifer however this method neglects the long term concentration of cl that come from other sources background concentration such as adjacent brackish aquifers the unsaturated zone runoff in wadis and surface catchments evaporates and pollution sources e g dissolution of minerals use of road salts and infiltration of raw wastewater irrigation returns industrial and urban wastes in areas where the background cl concentration is high such as brackish aquifers the percentage of aquifer recharge will be underestimated by the classic cmb the background chloride concentration in the underlying aquifer is assumed here to be the minimum value of chloride in the consecutive dry seasons aliewi et al 2020 also discussed that the classic cmb has another important shortcoming of ignoring the vertical extent of the cyclic effect of recharging cl concentration within the underlying aquifer they suggested using salinity vertical profiles after rainfall events to identify the vertical extent of the cyclic effect of recharging rainfall with known cl concentration in the modified approach the effect of recharging water in brackish aquifers is considered effective in the upper zone of brackish saline water body realizing that this water body has a greater salinity in the deeper zones the modified cmb was developed by aliewi et al 2020 and the data collected from rainfall stations and monitoring wells all for kuwait were used 3 results and analysis 3 1 aquifer recharge and submarine groundwater discharge sgd recharge to the aquifer is generally dependent on amount of rainfall its intensity topography soil type soil moisture geology and depth to groundwater level under steady state conditions groundwater recharge is balanced by natural discharge of ddab to euphrates rivers and sgd to arabian gulf sea to maintain a balance within the aquifer extraction of groundwater is compensated through an increase in lateral recharge domenico 1972 domenico and schwartz 1990 a decrease in sgd leakage to from the euphrates river and from aquifer storage a reasonable estimation of recharge to aquifers is important in the management of the scarce water resources in arid regions kalbus et al 2011a recharge is a very important component in evaluating the water balance of ddab as a regional source of water however this component is very difficult to quantify for heterogeneous geological formations rainfall and wadis runoff are also to be considered as source of recharge subyani 2004 estimated aquifer recharge in alluvial aquifers in saudi arabia using cmb methodology at 11 of rainfall the present study is based on a new cmb aliewi et al 2020 method modified to be suitable for brackish groundwater aquifers this study only reports the results of aquifer recharge aliewi et al 2020 as aquifer recharge from rainfall at 9 6 of annual rainfall 116 mm aliewi et al 2020 11 mm yr aquifer recharge from runoff al juaidi 2020 9 6 x10 x116 1 mm yr total aquifer recharge from rainfall and runoff 11 1 12 mm yr sgd and transboundary influxes were simulated as outputs from the ddab numerical models isotope analysis of secondary data clark and fritz 1997 bhandary and chidambaram 2020 shows that the origin of recharge sources to ddab is due to the mixing between brackish and saline ground waters stable isotope results of rain water from iraq saudi arabia and kuwait showed a good relationship between the δ 18o and δd isotopes and there was an enrichment noted in rainwater samples collected during the period from february to may and the depletion in samples collected from november december hadi et al 2016 intially attemped to derive the kmwl against the observation made by michelsen et al 2015 on the isotope signature of various rain events from 2009 to 2013 the study revealed that δ 18o ranges from 6 5 to 9 5 and that of δd from 30 to 50 there is a greater variation of isotope value in riyadh saudi arabia than kuwait the stable isotopic signatures of the ddab in this iraqi region reported that δ 18o ranged between 1 34 and 0 18 and that of δ d ranging between 19 31 and 2 88 the results indicate that the recharge occurred slowly after the significant evaporation by the surface water body the isotopic values support the fact that the recharge to ddab at hafr al batin area in saudi arabia aquifer is mainly due to the cyclones from the arabian gulf al suhail 1996 the isotopic analysis indicates that there is a slight variation in the precipitation pattern governed by the land use pattern changes the isotope values of groundwater in kuwait indicated the initial composition of recharge water and that the recharge takes place in the saudi highlands hadi et al 2016 however the evidence produced from the isotopic analysis of the groundwater showed that recharge is indeed taking place at the watershed scale a wide range of ratios was observed indicating different water sources and different proportion of mixing between these sources these sources are essentially the regional brackish saline groundwater which is originating from saudi arabia and the local recharge from rainfall 3 2 conceptual and steady state flow models the available data suggested that the groundwater flow dips from the south and southwest to north and northeast owing to the lower topographic elevations in the northeastern part of ddabthe conceptual model considers ddab as one layer 200 300 m thick with an impermeable base to reflect its regional and shared characteristics kalbus et al 2011b the steady state model of ddab deals with recharge from rainfall and runoff only urban recharge was considered negligible on the regional level the grid of the numerical model of the study area covers a surface area of around 60 000 km2 fig 2 the study area was initially divided into 100 rows and 100 columns to generate a grid with equal cells the area of each cell was 10 5 km2 3250 m 3250 m during the transient simulations this grid was further refined into smaller cells near the pumping wells fig 2 also illustrates the boundary conditions used in the model as follows 1 general head boundaries ghb to represent trans boundary fluxes 2 constant head boundaries at the contact of the arabian gulf with kuwaiti and iraqi parts of ddab 3 river boundary at euphrates river 4 no flow boundaries elsewhere fig 2 also shows the location of observations wells in the study area the general head and constant head boundary conditions were used to allow fluxes to leave the aquifer through the political borders or as submarine groundwater discharge to the arabian gulf from kuwait and iraq in particular the southern and the eastern boundaries were set as constant head boundary to represent an infinite source of water entering the aquifer system from irrigated areas and the surrounding geological formations further to the south of the modelled area boundary values were based on the regional piezometry contours pre 1960 according to mukhopadhyay et al 1996 indicating that the groundwater flow direction from south southwest to north northeast the head boundary conditions were used to reflect the initial potentiometric heads in the shared ddab prior to development of heavy pumping schemes 3 3 results of steady state simulations for the flow model of ddab 3 3 1 calibration of steady state flow model because of errors and uncertainty in defining model parameters models should be calibrated to obtain the best estimate of the hydraulic properties of the aquifer about 36 observation wells were considered from official governmental bodies in the three sharing countries fig 2 for calibration the measured potential heads in the observation wells were considered from the initial point of simulation on 1 1 1975 steady state calibration under natural conditions was undertaken using the static water levels measured pre 1960 with no pumping from production wells and with full rainfall recharge the purpose of this calibration was to match natural conditions and to illustrate the relevancy of this steady state calibration the kuwaiti production wells yielded 15 mm3 yr and 94 mm3 yr on average for the periods of 1965 1975 and 1976 2019 respectively the steady state calibration results using pest engine of vmf flex are shown in fig 3 reflecting the match between calculated heads and observed heads had a good correlation with a coefficient of 0 99 the calibrated hydraulic conductivity values versus the hydraulic conductivity values from pumping tests are presented in table 2 and it had a reasonable match the resulting spatial distribution of the calibrated hydraulic conductivity m d of the steady state model for ddab fig 4 indicates that kx is not the same as ky for each zone of calibration signifying that the hydraulic conductivity is anisotropic when kx ky for anisotropic hydrogeological conditions the direction of groundwater flow is neither horizontal nor vertical this anisotropy property is illustrated in the direction of groundwater flow for ddab from southwest to northeast fig 5 3 3 2 direction of groundwater flow and water heads the groundwater flow directions are from south and southwest to north and northeast and dominated in y direction fig 5a the movement starts slow at the southern boundary in saudi arabia the rate of flow increases towards kuwait as groundwater movement finds an easy path through kuwait due to higher hydraulic conductivity values the groundwater flow leaves saudi arabia to relatively a low permeability zone in southern iraq the groundwater velocity in this zone is low as the groundwater moves to northern iraq the velocity of this groundwater increases the head distribution of the calibrated steady state groundwater system of ddab fig 5b reveals that it starts at a high value of 350 m above sea level m asl in the southern part of the ddab in saudi arabia the heads reduce gradually toward the north and northeast along the kuwait saudi arabia border the head varies between 100 and 130 m asl and along saudi arabia iraq border it is observed around 150 m asl subsequently they approach the sea level near the arabian gulf in kuwait and iraq the heads in the northern boundary in iraq range between 10 and 50 m asl 3 3 3 steady state sustainable yield of ddab the sustainable yield is of any target aquifer under steady state conditions is defined as the capacity of the aquifer to yield groundwater volumes before development through drilling pumping wells ندوة جودة وتوفيق هجول 2012 alley and leake 2004 kazmann 1956 maimone 2004 seward et al 2006 subsequently the pumping wells operation will be considered to simulate the impact on the sustainable yield in terms of maximum water level drawdown and deterioration of the aquifer salinity the sustainable yield simulated through a calibrated steady state model for ddab before development table 3 and fig 6 clearly illustrate that the sustainable yield of ddab 515 mm3 y the table shows that 88 mm3 y enters the aquifer from the southern boundary in saudi arabia the model also shows that the aquifer receives a total recharge of about 427 mm3 y the total inflows are balanced by sgd rates of 184 and 43 mm3 y in kuwait and iraq respectively the results of the calibrated model also show that around 49 mm3 y and 168 mm3 y leave the aquifer to the river and through northern boundary in iraq respectively table 3 also illustrates that 151 mm3 y flows as trans boundary lateral flow between saudi arabia and kuwait the trans boundary flow between saudi arabia and iraq is 69 mm3 y while the trans boundary between kuwait and iraq is 38 mm3 y the sgd rate of 184 mm3 y is over 115 km length of contact between ddab and kuwaiti coast and it yields sgd 1 6 mm3 y km in a study carried out by bhandary bhandary and chidambaram 2020 the sgd rate was estimated to be 16 270 mm3 y km the difference in the results is due to the fact that bhandary bhandary and chidambaram 2020 calculated sgd for both kuwait group and dammam aquifers for the entire kuwait coast while this study estimates only for kuwait group aquifers terminating in arabian gulf 3 4 development and calibration of the transient state flow model of ddab after the determination of the steady state sustainable yield of ddab all existing pumping wells were incorporated in the steady state flow model to transform it to transient flow model this transient flow model was then calibrated successfully with pest engine of flex software the purpose was to use the calibrated transient flow model to investigate the ability of the ddab to allow extraction of the required additional amounts of brackish water for the intended use without excessive drawdown the transient flow model was calibrated against temporal observed data of water levels to determine storage coefficients figs 7 and 8 the k zones used in the steady state calibration were used initially for the calibration of sy values in the transient model calibration the results of the transient calibration using pest engine of flex software indicated the different zones fig 8 due to limited data availability only three wells were used in this calibration process but only m6 u well is highlighted the difference between simulated heads and observed heads was about 6 m then the effect of storage started to influence the distribution of water levels in space and time which resulted in a small difference between simulated heads and observed heads to be 0 5 m the calibrated storage coefficient sy of m6 u was 10 11 and the values matched with the results of a several of pumping tests conducted in kuwait the calibrated model was used to simulate the maximum drawdown in the regional aquifer of ddab this simulated drawdown was used to assess the viability of future development and abstraction scenarios on water levels in the dedicated management zones of ddab the results of the current study indicate the change in direction of groundwater flow due to excessive pumping from sw to ne and from w to e al madhlom et al 2020 the transient flow model was calibrated with specific yield values to range between 3 6 and 20 figs 7 and 8 al kubaisi et al 2018 has attempted a similar approach for dibdibba aquifer in iraq and used a value for sy of 7 3 similarly aliewi aliewi et al 2021 calibrated the model using the sy value of 12 for dibdibba aquifer in kuwait the calibration of dibdibba aquifer model representing iraq region was done with a sy value ranging from 14 to 40 depending upon spatial variation in aquifer properties of the region attia and aboodi atiaa and aboodi 2005 the unconfined nature of this aquifer in saudi arabia has led to the usage of 20 as sy value for calibration of the model al turbak et al 1993 3 5 development and results from the baseline salinity model for ddab the spatial distribution of salinity in ddab was reported by several studies in iraq kuwait and saudi arabia parsons 1964 al senafy 2001 atiaa and aboodi 2005 atiaa 2000 khwedim et al 2017 abadi 2002 fadlelmawla et al 2009 al kubaisi 1996 aboodi et al 2008 al basrawi 2006 ipc 1964 manhi 2012 al manssory 2000 davraz and oezdemir 2014 raju 2007 tememi 2015 makkawi 2010 aly et al 2014 the range of salinity varies widely from 2800 to 16 800 mg l and a few locations were observed to have values beyond this range fig 9 the development of a robust salinity model for ddab requires reasonable values for dispersion coefficients the travel distance of the solute from the sw boundary in saudi arabia to ne boundary of ddab in iraq is about 400 km given a maximum length of a cell parallel to flow direction of 3700 m fig 2 a value of αl 50 925 m is appropriate according to meheta et al mehta et al 2000 a discretization rule of thumb mehta et al 2000 that guarantees spatial stability for the solute transport simulation is δl 4 αl i e αl should be less than 3700 4 925 m in the ddab model a value of longitudinal dispersivity of 500 m was used table 4 in salinity modelling it is worth noting that the longitudinal dispersion simply αl times velocity and the transverse dispersion αt times velocity are the most important paramaters that control the dispersion of salinity in ddab the salinity gradients in the flow direction are lesser fig 9 and therefore the simulation results are not sensitive to longitudinal dispersivity values over the travel distance of 400 km in addition it is important to note that the developed salinity model is for one layer which does not consider the effect of vertical velocity gradient to assess the effect of saline water upconing in the approach developed here the areas of obvious saline water upconing were determined first subsequently the measured salinity was assigned as known salinity value which was fixed in the model for dispersive and advective flux movements to approximate saline water upconing process the simulated distribution data of salinity after 1 day for the baseline saline model show that the results were affected with initial salinity data with minor spatial extent in iraq where salinity values were higher than 15 000 mg l fig 10 in saudi arabia and most of kuwait the results show a moderate range of salinity varying from 2400 to 6000 mg l the simulations show that salinity of the groundwater in northwest and northeast of kuwait varies between 10 000 and 12 500 mg l fig 10 the results of this study agree with the study of mukhopadhyay et al 1994 al ali 2008 and aliewi et al 2021 mukhopadhyay et al 1994 reported that the deterioration in water quality of the utilized aquifers is strongly affected with the severe decline in the water levels of the aquifers similar observations on the decline in water level due to the excessive groundwater pumping for irrigation purpose has also enhanced the groundwater salinity al ali 2008 the study by al ali et al al ali 2008 inferred that the over pumping of kuwait aquifers facilitates lateral flow of saline water also the quality of groundwater is further deteriorated by return flow of irrigation water with a higher tds content the spatial variation of salinity in groundwater of kuwait has been addressed along the coast line in the shallow and deeper aquifers bhandary et al 2018 sabarathinam et al 2020 the studies reflected that there is a significant anthropogenic stress in the coastal groundwaters especially the shallow aquifers aliewi et al 2021 reported that during the well operational scenario transient salinity model pumping would result in the vertical migration of the deeper saline water upwards to deteriorate the quality of the existing brackish groundwater in the shallow aquifer 3 6 water utilization plans in ddab the abstracted water from ddab was mainly used for agricultural purposes these extracted brackish waters feed the kuwait farms abdali and wafra farms the small agricultural communities around wadi al batin wadi in saudi arabia and the farms at basra and zubair cities in iraq groundwater has usually been abstracted mainly from the upper part of ddab in the three sharing countries the plan of water utilization from ddab table 5 and fig 11 was to enhance the utilization capacity in the region two utilization plans were simulated in this study and they are described in table 5 for scenario 1 table 5 presents that the existing abstractions from the ddab and are observed to be less than its sustainable yield at 425 mm3 y then a hypothesis scenario 2 to match the abstraction rates with the sustainable yield was adopted this scenario considered the incorporation of new operating well fields the spatial distribution of the new wellfields fig 11 and the amount of new abstracted quantity in each sharing country is presented in table 5 the flow and salinity engines of vmf flex were used to test if the hypothesis could be accepted or rejected in terms of maximum drawdown and maximum deterioration in salinities the simulation results under scenario 1 show that the maximum drawdown at the end of the simulation period under existing abstracting of 425 mm3 y was around 4 32 m in ne part iraq similar drawdown values were observed around hafr al batin city in saudi arabia the salinity results of this simulation run for the above scenario are presented in table 6 the maximum salinity deterioration according to table 6 is in northern part of ddab in iraq near northern well fields of kuwait and along the southwestern part of saudi arabia under scenario 2 table 5 for total abstraction from ddab wellfield 515 mm3 yr the sustainable yield of ddab the drawdown results fig 12 and the spatial distribution of tds mg l in the aquifer after operating all existing and new well fields for 55 y 2030 since simulation started are shown in fig 13 a comparison of drawdowns and salinities between the two scenarios is presented in tables 7 and 8 respectively a maximum drawdown under scenario 2 is observed to be 12 m is in the ne of the model where thousands of wells operate in kuwait and iraq for agricultural purposes table 7 the next large drawdown was 11 m near hafr al batin because a new well field is located in that area the effect of operating the existing wells together with the new well fields scenario 2 on the simulated salinity distribution in ddab using the salinity engine mt3ds of vmf reflected significant increase in the northern portion of the study area fig 13 and table 8 the model also infers that the salinity deterioration is doubled at the new southern well field in saudi arabia table 8 and fig 13 in addition in kuwait 29 of salinity deterioration in the new well field in the western region of the country is observed the increase in salinity of all the existing and new wells are driven by two mechanisms namely 1 lateral flux from boundaries with more brackish water bodies with limited rainfall al qallaf et al 2020 and 2 more brackish water up coning because of depeltion of water table due to drawdown and subjected the well field to additional pumping rates 3 7 impact of the utilization plans on the sustainable yield of ddab as stated before the sustainable yield is a subjective assessment of ddab development without causing significant deterioration in aquifer water levels and salinity in this study it was assumed that maximum drawdown should be less than 25 of the water column in the wells and the maximum deterioration of aquifer salinity occurs only in limited spatial extent to be less than 200 the impact of the utilization plans 1975 2019 of 425 mm3 y from ddab resulted in a maximum simulated drawdown of 4 23 m and about 200 deterioration of salinity in certain locations with minor spatial extent of the aquifer since 1975 the future utilization plan 2020 2030 including new well fields with abstraction rates increased from 425 to 515 mm3 y were tested the simulated water level drawdowns were as follows o iraq from 5 m at 2019 to 12 m at 2030 o kuwait from 4 m at 2019 to 9 m at 2030 o saudi arabia from 4 m at 2019 to 11 m at 2030 at hafr al batin city all these drawdown values were less than 25 of the water column of the wells the deterioration in the ddab salinity was also simulated and the results were as follows o southwest of iraq increase in salinity about 7 o east of hafr el batin increase in salinity about 13 o middle west of kuwait increase in salinity about 29 o some of the southern well field in saudi arabia increase in salinity about 200 o remaining areas increase in salinity about less than 5 the subjective assessment of ddab sustainable yield was achived by considering pumping wells in operation at a rate similar to the steady state when the maximum drawdown and salinity deterioration in only small spatial areas of ddab were simulated to be less than 25 and 200 respectively therefore the sustainable yield during the pumping conditions also equals 515 mm3 y 4 conclusions this study addresses a management strategy for the important transboundary aquifer utilized for agricultural water purposes by saudi arabia kuwait and iraq this study developed reasonable future utilization plans in ddab within the political boundaries of the three sharing countries the developed numerical models were used to simulate the effect of implementing the utilization plans for brackish groundwater from ddab considering the drop in the aquifers water levels and the deterioration in the aquifer salinity because the aquifer dynamics were studied regionally over 60 000 km2 in this study a more accurate steady state sustainable yield of the aquifer was simulated the subjective assessment ddab sustainable yield considering the pumping wells operation at a rate equals the steady state sustainable yield was achieved when the maximum drawdown and salinity deterioration of ddab were simulated to be less than 25 and 200 respectively therefore the sustainable yield under pumping conditions also equals 515 mm3 y any utilization of the aquifer with volumes greater than its sustainable yield will require careful management of operating the production wells on intermittent basis the robust salinity model developed in this study shows that the initial distribution of salinity values in the ddab system play a significant role in the results of the final salinity distribution under dynamic conditions in ddab the

11883,coastal cities worldwide are witnessing large scale salinity both inland as well as coastal salinity especially in semi arid regions the economic aspiration and changes in land use associated with the excavation of unsustainable groundwater withdrawal is leading to saline up coning as well as seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifers the present study has been conducted in anand district of gujarat india to evaluate the genesis of salinity in the coastal aquifers in the current study both conservative elements and stable isotopes are used to explain the controlling factors of groundwater salinization and its hydrogeochemical processes liss iv linear imaging self scanning was used to map land use land cover to understand the impact of land use practices on groundwater conditions and salinity mapping from 2006 to 2018 the surveying and mapping of saline soil showed an increasing trend which indicates high salinity in groundwater regime and soil characteristic the chemical constituents coming from reverse ion exchange mineral dissolution as well as anthropogenic sources of saline water are demarcated using saturation index and ionic ratio the origin of water

issues related to hydrology marfia et al 2004 zhao et al 2018 lu lcc in semi arid alluvial plains is more significant due to productive land thus inland and coastal salinity both have a substantial

natural resource from shallow aquifers reduces the freshwater outflow towards the sea and create water table depression causing seawater to migrate inland and rising towards well van camp et al 2014 the other responsible factors are lithology coastal topography groundwater recharge and hydraulic gradient freeze and cherry 1979 rina et al 2013 kazakis et al 2016 taken the view on account of groundwater abstraction through human activities the groundwater is vulnerable to salinity in unconfined coastal aquifers werner et al 2013 in the past few decades due to sporadic rainfall and high evapotranspiration extensive research has been conducted on the salinity of arid and semi arid coastal areas the developmental activities are entirely dependent on groundwater in these regions

motevalli et al 2018 among the available methods the application of geochemistry and isotopes is an effective and simple way to quantify the origin of salinity in groundwater in the present study lulc change detection intends to fill the gap between ongoing land use effects on natural resources for both inland and coastal salinity using various hydro chemical data in anand district gujarat india several problems of water quality had been identified like sea level rise declining water table and salinization makes it important to study rina et al 2013 cgwb 2014 lulc analysis shows that from 2006 to 2018 the population density doubled thus the impacts are significantly important for the present study this study also uses cl br ratio and stable water isotope to trace the origin of salinity of different water masses and various agriculture indices to see the impact of groundwater on soil salinity 2 study area the present analysis is done in anand district which is a part of the sabarmati basin catchment area being a part of the outlet of the flow towards the coast this area is having shallow aquifers near the coast and covers an area of 3092 sq km between north latitudes 22 06 22 43 and east longitude 72 20 73 12 the lowest boundary is covered by the gulf of khambhat where river mahi and sabarmati are draining the district in east and west respectively the region is known for its fertile soil and has contributed to the state s economy due to industrialization and the highest yields of cash crops annual rainfall for ahmedabad imd station is 799 mm most of the seasonal rainfall is received from the south west monsoon from june to september cgwb 2014 physiographically it has been divided into three micro regions which are khambhat silting mahi plain and nadiad plain based on

may 13 2018 and monsoon season on september 24 2017 fig 1a in the vicinity of agriculture coastal and built up areas since there are only a limited number of wells near the coast tube wells and stable canal drainage are used to provide water for operational activities the samples are collected in a clean polypropylene bottle treated with 5 concentrated hno3 and then rinsed with distilled water before sampling to reduce external impurities water samples were collected from an open well dug well and borewells at variable depths the samples are kept in three separate polythene bottles for

water regime based on altered energy and hydrological balance quesada et al 2017 the lulc change impact was assessed on the quality of groundwater in the present study eight lulc classes were demarcated during the year 2006 2018 as given in table 1 in supplementary data and the map is given in fig 2 the accuracy statistics and kappa coefficient were computed which demonstrated a good correlation between the referenced and classified data agricultural land accounts for the largest part of the area the total area of the agricultural sector in 2006 was 2412 sq km which has now been decreased to 2176sq km with a reduction of 9 8 from 2006 to 2018 the agricultural sector is the most vulnerable area because continuous irrigation makes the land less fertile so it is easy to convert to other classes like wasteland and built up these converted areas are prone to runoff and high evaporation with low recharge conditions bewket and sterk 2005 gebresamuel et al 2010 pan et al 2011 urbanization has resulted in reduced infiltration due to impermeable ground increased storm runoff and decreased water quality due to the discharge of sanitary waste into local streams and rivers eshleman 2004 this increase in built up also increases land surface temperature and other hydrometeorological variables such as evapotranspiration which affect the water balance of the study area li et al 2017 deng et al 2018 the maximum area comes from agriculture and wasteland as the area is a semi arid zone it faces urban industrial and agricultural water demand shalev et al 2015 so it is especially difficult in areas where coastal aquifer is under pressure of seawater ingress and population expansion gorelick and zheng 2015 scrubland is very common near dry riverbeds in 2006 the total land area was 85 sq km increasing to 213 sq km the area near built up is open fields which also contribute to wasteland thereby increasing the land coverage common lu lc changes are seen from agriculture and wasteland to built up which leads to increased runoff depending on the urban sprawl hamadi et al 2012 the changes from wasteland to agriculture contribute to the downward movement of nutrients which is otherwise found negligible in the wasteland as studied by scanlon et al 2005 another category of lulc has a significant contribution to groundwater waterbody covered rivers tanks ponds and artificial ponds occupied 129 sq km which is the third most significant area under study this area has decreased to 125 sq km in 2018 which has not changed much due to addition of canals in the area since the small waterbodies shrink in due course of time but addition of running canals has affected the groundwater status in the district the total land affected by salt encrustation in 2006 was 39sq km which is 1 26 of the total land of the district while in 2018 it increased to 109sq km which is 3 52 of the total land area it can be seen from the spatial map and ion ratio that the salinity of groundwater in the affected land is higher continuous application of fertilizers and tidal water through creeks will increase the ability of surface soil to easily scale up the salt encrustation after monsoon rains surface salt will penetrate shallow aquifers deteriorating groundwater quality the coastal natural wetland is the area close to the coast which remains inundated during the high tide and flourishes some coastal plant species a coastal wetland is the most versatile ecosystem which is converted to manmade activities like salt pans construction at coast and industries for refining the salt 4 2 groundwater quality status the statistical summary of all physicochemical parameters is given in table 1 the range of ph during both seasons shows the alkaline groundwater the spatial variation of ph was found to be very high at the central portion of the district during monsoon while the plume moves on to the western part during pre monsoon due to enriched alkaline water flowing through the creeks the electrical conductivity indicated that the dissolved concentration of solids is due to the ionic strength of groundwater soil type and agricultural activities the range of ec varied from 446 to 3248 μs cm during monsoon while in pre monsoon it ranges between 1247 and 15740 μs cm fig 3 a g confirms very high ec near the western creek due to seawater intrusion in the pre monsoon period while high ec is recorded near mahi estuary during monsoon season the dominant cations and anions are na mg2 ca2 and cl hco3 so4 2 respectively the high concentration of sodium 37 5 554 mg l during monsoon 55 2403 mg l in pre monsoon is due to the geological origin of silicate weathering halite dissolution and coastal seawater intrusion rina et al 2013 during the monsoon the lower reaches of the area show the highest concentration and in pre monsoon the concentration plume has moved to the west fig 3f l the enrichment of mg2 ranged between 4 and 73 5 mg l in monsoon 7 208 3 mg l in pre monsoon is controlled by the dolomite olivine and magnetite minerals rina et al 2011 ca2 showed the range of 1 6 40 7 mg l in monsoon and 4 1 172 7 mg l in pre monsoon which is contributed from the calcium bearing minerals like calcite dolomite and gypsum the concentration of potassium ranged from 0 57 to 13 56 mg l in monsoon and 0 33 38 89 mg l in pre monsoon the least concentration can be explained due to the adsorption on clay minerals and resistance from weathering in the following study chloride is being the most dominant anion which ranged from 28 1 to 494 4 mg l in monsoon and 49 1 4200 mg l during pre monsoon the main source of chloride is caused by the intrusion of seawater several kilometers offshore through creeks while the central part is affected by household and agricultural leakage which is also called inland salinity bicarbonate is representative of natural freshwater the concentration has ranged between 109 8 and 481 9 mg l in monsoon and 216 927 mg l in pre monsoon the high concentration was found due to carbonate weathering in the study area the concentration of so4 2 was found well within the acceptable limit 200 mg l during monsoon 10 4 126 3 mg l while it has increased during pre monsoon 19 4 1103 8 mg l which may be due to the addition of new sampling wells at the coastal area from spatial variation maps it has been identified that during monsoon season central and southern part is more affected while in pre monsoon maximum concentration was found at northwest fig 3c i which suggests impact of agricultural activity oxidation dissolution of so4 2 from sulfate rich mineral clay and silt deposits rina et al 2011 high nitrate load was observed from sampling wells of concentration 235 2 mg l while the permissible limit for drinking purposes is 45 mg l bis 2012 high yielding crops requires more fertilizers hence increased the application of dap which has been reported in the state agriculture development plan https rkvy nic in static saidp gj for 20this 20period 201718 20to 20201920 sap saidp gujarat pdf point and non point sources of nitrate concentration suggests the impact of irrigation water vertical mixing of animal waste septic tanks and industrial food processing waste the nitrate concentration in the unconfined aquifer is recharged from an unsaturated zone of surrounding high nitrate groundwater fluoride concentration was found to vary between 0 15 and 2 69 mg l in monsoon and 0 46 10 13 mg l in pre monsoon the acceptable limit of 1 mg l was exceeded by 38 and 52 samples during monsoon and pre monsoon respectively the highest concentration was at sampling points an3 4 9 having high hco3 na and ph which favors the release of f from aquifer matrix in groundwater in pre monsoon the sampling points pran5 10 18 located at the same taluka show a similar trend while pran18 is a new point source in pre monsoon season which falls near the creek in the western part of the district generally it is believed that the high concentration of br above 6 mg l in groundwater is caused by seawater hitchon et al 1999 the natural sources of br in groundwater are seawater intrusion 66 68 mg l and leaching from the earth s crust 6 mg kg bowen 1979 but there are also anthropogenic sources such as pesticides methyl bromide flury and papritz 1993 and urban runoff sollars et al 1982 the concentration range in pre monsoon is 0 10 7 mg l and during monsoon it is 0 1 4 mg l with average of 1 9 and 0 44 mg l in monsoon and pre monsoon respectively in few places relatively high br concentration may be attributed to point sources such as agriculture while the highest concentration of 10 9 mg l at pran14 attributed to seawater intrusion through creeks due to leaching of tidal seawater at shallow wells fig 1c i supplementary data 4 3 hydro geochemical processes mineral saturation indices were calculated using phreeqc 2 12 software for water rock interaction parkhurst and appelo 1999 it predicts the subsurface mineralogy from groundwater analysis without sampling in the solid phase deutsch 1997 si 0 predicts the potential to precipitate the mineral phase out of the solution while si 0 for undersaturation and further dissolution may take place the supersaturation of silica minerals was found at all places during both seasons calcite is oversaturated at an 1 6 8 12 13 and pran 6 17 18 19 20 fluorite and gypsum were found undersaturated and have a short residence time in the aquifer with a further scope of dissolution rina et al 2011 sheikh et al 2017 anhydrite and aragonite were found supersaturated at all places while dolomite was found to be oversaturated in 23 samples during both seasons fig 4 a and b a piper plot is used to show the relative abundance of minerals present in groundwater the dominance of na hco3 and na cl types of water was seen during the monsoon season as six samples belonged to na hco3 type six as na cl and one as ca hco3 fig 4c during pre monsoon ten samples are na hco3 seven na cl types two mg cl and one in mg hco3 fig 4d the contributing factors of na hco3 type of water are schists quartzite granite rock interaction with water freeze and cherry 1979 the monovalent cations na and k and anions cl and hco3 are dominant as explained by the piper diagram fig 4c and d the presence of na and cl type of water also confirms the salinity the na and cl shows a positive correlation of 0 88 table 2 suggest both the element have the same origin either the halite dissolution or seawater freshwater mixing fig 5 a in scatter plot of na vs cl maximum points are present near the 1 1 equiline suggests the halite dissolution which is confirmed by the saturation indices presented in fig 4a and b the relationship trend between so4 2 hco3 vs ca2 mg2 shows the points close to the trendline that defines the dissolution of silicate carbonate and sulfate minerals in the groundwater as indicated by the figure a deficiency of ca2 mg2 shows that the excessive negative charge should be balanced by na ions three factors may govern such variation in the groundwater as a cation exchange process seawater intrusion and characteristics of freshwater while the ca2 vs hco3 plot shows the carbonate weathering during monsoon since maximum points fall below the equiline which is influenced by the availability of co2 during the pre monsoon season maximum samples fall above the equiline thus bicarbonate influences the ca2 chemistry at lower mineralization and indicate the carbonate rocks dissolution cl vs br scatter plot is given in fig 5d which is potentially used for anthropogenic and natural contamination in the coastal aquifers cl br mass ratio is further used to identify salinity sources as halite dissolution sewage effluent landfill leachate brine and seawater intrusion liu et al 2017 groundwater samples are found close to the equiline confirming the common origin while the ratio of cl br also confirmed nonmarine sources in the study area 4 3 1 correlation analysis the correlation matrix for both seasons is given in table 2a b this relationship shows that the tds is strongly correlated with na mg2 cl br and no3 which indicates mineralization and salinity intrusion the low correlation of ph with tds signifies that the dissolution of salt does not relate to an acidic condition of groundwater but is more related to the degree of solubility the correlation of tds with na and mg2 confirms mineralization and climatic factors while a strong correlation with no3 and cl confirms the anthropogenic source through infiltration of agricultural fertilizers and halite dissolution the correlation coefficient of na and cl of 0 88 and presence of sampling points at halite line in scatter plot shows the halite dissolution since the presented study falls in the semi arid coastal region so the possibility of high na and cl are due to excessive evaporation dissolution of halite rocks and anthropogenic activities with coastal seawater intrusion at lower reaches sujatha and reddy 2003 the positive correlation among f hco3 and ph suggests the dissolution of f in groundwater as oh replaces exchangeable f under an alkaline environment rafique et al 2009 4 3 2 freshwater saline water mixing and ionic ratio generally the freshwater sources show high ca2 concentration while mg2 na and cl are characteristics of salinity however the mixing of seawater with fresh water and various other anthropogenic activities show a distinguished chemical signature the characteristic molar ratio for seawater and deep saline up coning is given in the supplementary table 2 ghabayen et al 2006 metcalf 2000 the sampling point near the creek towards the western side of the district an10 an13 pran4 pran13 pran15 fall under 0 86 1 m ratio of na cl shows seawater intrusion but pran4 can be ruled out which is very far from the coast sampling point an7 shows mg ca ratio 5 which falls at the southeastern part of the study area where mahi river drains to the gulf hence the possibility of the seawater intrusion occurs deep saline up coning was also one significant source of salinity in the groundwater due to over extraction in the coastal region na cl ratio of 0 8 at sampling points pran2 pran3 pran14 pran20 present at urbanized part of the district shows deep saline up coning likewise maximum samples showed mg ca 1 which also confirmed deep saline up coning due to the continuous extraction of groundwater for industrial and domestic purpose the coastal wells are abandoned due to the up coning of seawater several km off the coast in the district at khambhat taluka agriculture being the dominant class arises the problem of agriculture return flow in the district the ratio of so4 cl 0 05 confirmed all the samples are also affected by agriculture return flow wastewater infiltration is another dominant source of salinity in industrial and residential areas k cl ratio 0 02 explains the wastewater infiltration at sampling points an6 8 12 13 and pran2 4 6 7 8 9 which fall in urban land vengosh et al 1999 metcalf 2000 rina et al 2013 4 3 3 mixing fraction percentage the seawater fraction in the groundwater is often estimated using chloride concentration custodio et al 1987 chloride ion has been considered as a conservative tracer not affected by ion exchange the calculated values are given in table 3 using theoretical concentration of chloride in freshwater 4 48meq l and seawater 461 11meq l appello and postma 2005 during monsoon season the mixing fraction falls between 0 06 and 2 07 while in pre monsoon it is 0 02 to 24 9 the recorded mixing fraction shows the highest percentage 24 9 at pran14 mahiyari tarapur taluka which is in the western part resulted from the tidal water in the creek during monsoon season the highest fraction was found to be 2 07 and maximum samples showed negative value 4 4 origin of groundwater salinity using stable isotopes salinity mapping is a complex process especially in coastal areas where seawater intrusion occurs the area is affected by various other factors that affect the vulnerability of the aquifer by mixing freshwater saltwater in the transition zone the isotopic signature in water plays a significant role to study the source of salinity when mixed with water ionic content it helps us to identify in intermixing of different water bodies as well as in the assessment of hydro chemical evolution of groundwater fritz and fontes 1980 rina et al 2013 the spatial map of water isotopes is given in fig 6 and seasonal variations in the isotopic values show a significant variation due to changes in the location at some places the monsoon range of δ18o is 1 22 to 3 31 with an avg of 2 44 and δd ranges between 12 98 and 24 04 avg of 18 23 the stable isotopic values in pre monsoon show δ18o 0 61 to 3 0 with an average of 2 2 and δd from 7 13 to 20 8 with an average of 15 66 the relationship trend between δ18o and δd for monsoon and pre monsoon is given in fig 7 a and b which was compared with the local meteoric water line lmwl of north gujarat gupta and deshpande 2005 δ d 7 6 0 6 δ 18 o 2 9 2 2 r 2 0 89 the comparison shows that during monsoon and pre monsoon all the sample lie below the lmwl which suggest the local precipitation and evaporation effect on groundwater recharge the regression line below the lmwl and gwml gave the following significant formula as in monsoon δd 5 0 1 05 δ18o 5 91 2 61 r 2 0 67 and pre monsoon δd 4 48 0 5 δ18o 5 69 1 28 r 2 0 79 which is compared with lmwl of north gujarat the d excess can be calculated from d δ d 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 craig 1961 which ranged from 4 08 to 1 99 in monsoon and pre monsoon 3 32 to 6 17 which is a proxy to identify secondary processes taking place in the atmosphere a depth variation map was prepared from 2017 to 18 data collected from the field the northeastern part of the study area which is also a part of mahi river catchment having an isotopic signature in monsoon as 2 12 to 2 76 while in pre monsoon it varies between 2 12 and 2 73 except the two locations which are having higher depth with depleted isotopic value due to the freshwater lens in those locations when we moved from the northeast of the area to the south people have stopped using deeper wells due to the high salinity level even the replaced shallow wells showed higher ec and chloride concentrations in recent years as the δ18o values between 1 7 and 2 68 also confirmed the same area nearby creeks where the ionic ratio shows saline water intrusion highly enriched isotopic signature has been observed compared with the research done by rina et al in 2013 the amount of water pumped in the area increased and the intrusion from creek can be seen causing the δ18o value and ion ratio to be similar to that of seawater from the prepared lulc maps from 2006 to 2018 it can also be observed that saline soil has increased in the past twelve years leading to an increase in groundwater salinization which in turn makes the soil prone to salinity due to agricultural return flow the relationship between δ18o vs cl scatter plot suggests that the samples containing enriched δ18o values also has more chloride content at the locations near the creek an12 pran14 fig 7e the accumulated tidal seawater resulted in salt encrustation due to evaporation and hence increased the salinity in the groundwater as can be seen from lulc changes of 2006 2018 the ionic ratios of na cl 0 86 1 at sampling points an10 13 in monsoon and pran4 13 15 in pre monsoon having enriched δ18o also suggests the intrusion one mixing line in the scatter plot of δ18o vs cl was observed among neighboring sampling locations pran17 18 19 due to possible groundwater mixing 4 5 suitability of groundwater for agriculture purposes to examine the suitability of groundwater for agriculture purposes different indices were used the suitability depends on the effect on plants from mineral constituents of water the soil has similar harmful effects due to salt encrustation which leads to changes in soil structure aeration and permeability tyagi et al 2009 4 5 1 residual sodium carbonate rsc residual sodium carbonate ratio is computed with the formula raghunath 1987 table 3 supplementary data in monsoon season the rsc varies between 0 53 and 7 89 likewise in pre monsoon 10 26 to 11 76 the high values of rsc describe the high adsorption of sodium on the soil compared to the monsoon more area is affected in pre monsoon the negative values show the excess sodium ion offsetting calcium and magnesium through precipitation in the form of co2 by leaving behind na being the dominant cation while the positive value of rsc indicates the surpassed concentration of ca and mg with the hco3 reaction forming calcium and magnesium bicarbonate chitsazan et al 2017 since the study area is semi arid which is characterized by high rsc values resulting in salinization and sodification of agricultural soil prasad and bose 2001 the results also confirmed that the area is safe for agriculture towards the eastern side of the district at mahi river 4 5 2 sodium percentage sodium percentage is most crucial for water management in irrigation purposes as high concentration leads to a decrease in soil permeability hence retard plant growth the formula and the affected number of samples are given in table 3 in supplementary data ghalib 2017 the probability of high concentration comes from two sources one from the lithological sources causing the dissolution of sodium minerals and secondly unprecedented usage of agrochemicals the effect is highly devastating in terms of soil structure aeration and infiltration as well decline in the crop yield due to hindrance in the uptake of minerals from soil medium singaraja et al 2014 naseem et al 2012 4 5 3 magnesium hazard the current study resulted in the mg hazard ranged from 32 9 to 92 3 in monsoon and 58 9 82 2 in pre monsoon given in table 3 of supplementary data such concentration of mg in groundwater increases alkalinity and hence distresses the crop yield since the size of mg2 particles are 50 larger than that of calcium a large amount of water is adsorbed between mg2 and clay particles which results in loss of soil permeability hussain et al 2017 the fact is also supported because the study area is having na cl type of water reflecting the low concentration of ca2 and high mg2 5 conclusion inland and seawater salinity has led to the deterioration of groundwater quality in coastal cities which affects the availability of useable groundwater and has forced the closure of water supply at coastal areas hydrogeochemical and isotopic analyses along with the changes in lulc were applied to provide insights into regional hydrogeological processes and the degree of groundwater salinity in the coastal aquifers of the sabarmati river basin the concentration of nitrate was found to cross the permissible limit for drinking purposes at an2 5 7 10 in monsoon and pran1 3 8 19 during pre monsoon season influenced by agriculture runoff fluoride was also high at sampling points an4 5 9 in monsoon and pran5 10 12 15 17 18 19 during pre monsoon which may have resulted from fluorite dissolution and other possible input from agriculture land use landcover from liss iv for the year 2006 2018 was prepared which suggests that agricultural land has reduced while built up 50 and saline soil 179 has increased in the study area hydrochemistry and ionic ratio such as na cl suggests that sampling points an10 an13 pran13 pran15 in both seasons confirms the seawater intrusion which is near creeks in the western part while in other locations the inland salinity was due to leaching of evaporite infiltration of wastewater and agricultural return flow other ionic ratios like mg ca 1 confirmed deep saline up coning and so4 cl confirms the agricultural runoff in the whole study area evaporated water is getting recharged in the east water influx due to mahi canal command was observed with little depleted isotopic signature whereas in the western side over pumping as compared to influx is giving evaporated signature likewise the ionic ratio also suggests the up coning of seawater due to over pumping the relationship between δ18o vs cl scatter plot suggests that enriched δ18o values with high chloride content near the creek an12 pran14 were observed resulted from accumulated tidal seawater groundwater suitability for agricultural usage was calculated using different indices which confirmed the groundwater to be unsuitable for irrigation purposes near the coastal region in the semi arid coastal zone change in landuse landcover activity led to less recharge structure due to increased built up and over extraction of groundwater that eventually alters the seawater freshwater interface at the transition zone along with the limitation in built up activity an increase in the recharge structures and drip irrigation should be part of agriculture management practices to reduce the

11883,coastal cities worldwide are witnessing large scale salinity both inland as well as coastal salinity especially in semi arid regions the economic aspiration and changes in land use associated with the excavation of unsustainable groundwater withdrawal is leading to saline up coning as well as seawater intrusion in the coastal aquifers the present study has been conducted in anand district of gujarat india to evaluate the genesis of salinity in the coastal aquifers in the current study both conservative elements and stable isotopes are used to explain the controlling factors of groundwater salinization and its hydrogeochemical processes liss iv linear imaging self scanning was used to map land use land cover to understand the impact of land use practices on groundwater conditions and salinity mapping from 2006 to 2018 the surveying and mapping of saline soil showed an increasing trend which indicates high salinity in groundwater regime and soil characteristic the chemical constituents coming from reverse ion exchange mineral dissolution as well as anthropogenic sources of saline water are demarcated using saturation index and ionic ratio the origin of water salinity is described using δ18o and δd the relationship regression line below lmwl suggests significant evaporation of recharging water before infiltration graphical abstract image 1 keywords seawater intrusion water isotopes sabarmati basin hydrogeology 1 introduction global land use land cover change lulc has different natural hydrological imbalances land cover in any area affects evaporation as well as infiltration since the atmospheric precipitation passes through the soil media ford and william 2013 zhao et al 2018 various authors have reported the effect of lulc changes in hydrometeorological factors such as land surface temperature tan et al 2017 li et al 2017 precipitation robertson and sharp 2015 zhao et al 2018 evapotranspiration bronstert et al 2002 raymond et al 2008 recharge and runoff fletcher et al 2013 valle et al 2014 this process is more intense in the semi arid zone where evapotranspiration is more as compared to the humid zone which leads to negative water balance throughout the year gomez et al 2017 therefore studying the water cycle pattern in these regions under different land uses is of great significance to address regional environmental issues related to hydrology marfia et al 2004 zhao et al 2018 lu lcc in semi arid alluvial plains is more significant due to productive land thus inland and coastal salinity both have a substantial effect on the aquifer several studies conducted in the coastal areas of india confirmed the salinity intrusion by using different geochemical isotopic and numerical models like maharashtra keesari et

salinity on community health like increased cases of cardiovascular diseases diarrhea autoimmunity and abdominal pain are observed in coastal cities muller et al 2019 shammi et al 2019 the study area

density dependent aquifers natural discharge or abstraction wells may lead to up coning of the saline water interface under low pressure anomaly herzberg 1901 the vertical up coning and mixing of freshwater saltwater by about 2 3 make it unsuitable for drinking and agriculture use bear et al 1999 gaaloul et al 2012 the scenario of global groundwater overdraft indicates that exploitation of natural resource from shallow aquifers reduces the freshwater outflow towards the sea and create water table depression causing seawater to migrate inland and rising towards well van camp et al 2014 the other responsible factors are lithology coastal topography groundwater recharge and hydraulic gradient freeze and cherry 1979 rina et al 2013 kazakis et al 2016 taken the view on account of groundwater abstraction through human activities the groundwater is vulnerable to salinity in unconfined coastal aquifers werner et al 2013 in the past few decades due to sporadic rainfall and high evapotranspiration extensive research has been conducted on the salinity of arid and semi arid coastal areas the developmental activities are entirely dependent on groundwater in these regions therefore the coastal water seems to be a complicated environment requiring multiple survey methods the major chemical elements are the useful tracer at inland as well as coastal salinity vinson et al 2013 isawi et al 2016 li et al 2016 kumar 2016 najib et al 2017 one such anion indicator is br which is widely used to distinguish the causes of salinity alcala and custodio 2008 mollema et al 2013 li

kanagraj et al 2018 maurya et al 2019 bagheri et al 2019 multiple vulnerability assessment methods also provide encouraging results for the migration of pollutants in various types of aquifers motevalli et al 2018 among the available methods the application of geochemistry and isotopes is an effective and simple way to quantify the origin of salinity in groundwater in the present study lulc change detection intends to fill the gap between ongoing land use effects on natural resources for both inland and coastal salinity using various hydro chemical data in anand district gujarat india several problems of water quality had been identified like sea level rise declining water table and salinization makes it important to study rina et al 2013 cgwb 2014 lulc analysis shows that from 2006 to 2018 the population density doubled thus the impacts are significantly important for the present study this study also uses cl br ratio and stable water isotope to trace the origin of salinity of different water masses and various agriculture indices to see the impact of groundwater on soil salinity 2 study area the present analysis is done in anand district which is a part of the sabarmati basin catchment area being a part of the outlet of the flow towards the coast this area is having shallow aquifers near the coast and covers an area of 3092 sq km between north latitudes 22 06 22 43 and east longitude 72 20 73 12 the lowest boundary is covered by the gulf of khambhat where river mahi and sabarmati are draining the district in east and west respectively the region is known for its fertile soil and has contributed to the state s economy due to industrialization and the highest yields of cash crops annual rainfall for ahmedabad imd station is 799 mm most of the seasonal rainfall is received from the south west monsoon from june to september cgwb 2014 physiographically it has been divided into three micro regions which are khambhat silting mahi plain and nadiad plain based on topography climate geology soil and natural vegetation sampling locations and geological map is given in fig 1 a the area falls under the cambay basin formation of tarapur cambay block which is known as the tarapur depression the thickness of cambay shale is 500 1500m having grey to massive black silty sideratic and pyritic carbonaceous shales with thin coal and silt bands ongc the block has run into different eras like neogene paleogene deccan trap with overlaying mesozoic era the geology comprises multilayered gravel formations sand clay and kankars intermixed at some places sand and clay are found as alternate layers with different thickness from north to south gsi the quaternary age is prominent together with post miocene and tertiary sediment deposited by mahi sabarmati and watrak rivers the hydrogeology of the district has water in both confined and unconfined aquifers at a variable thickness gupta and sharma 1984 the geomorphic units are subdivided into three types piedmont plain covering an area of 15 20 km towards the northeast with shallow alluvium and gravel boulder beds at few places it has a gentle slope low drainage density and channel or flood deposits along the river with the richest agriculture belt and the southwestern part having saline soil and devoid of agriculture is termed as coastal plain cgwb 2014 the district falls under the cambay basin comprised of both marine and non marine formations cwc 2007 from the geomorphological point of view it has most of the alluvial plains made of fine to coarse grained sand gravel silt clay and kankar formed by tertiary sediments tandon et al 1997 srivastava et al 2000 the multilayered aquifer system was found where both confined and phreatic aquifers form the groundwater the intergranular pore spaces allow the movement of groundwater with thick alluvium at the center having a depth of 250 300m gupta and sharma 1984 the lithological explored wells identified two major aquifers the upper unconfined aquifers which at some places converted to semi confined confined and lower confined with alternated sand clay units at a few hundred depths fig 1b the depth of groundwater is deepest at mahi alluvial plain and shallow at the southwestern part cgwb 2014 3 material and methods groundwater samples n 33 were collected in anand district for quality analysis from 33 operating wells in pre monsoon dated may 13 2018 and monsoon season on september 24 2017 fig 1a in the vicinity of agriculture coastal and built up areas since there are only a limited number of wells near the coast tube wells and stable canal drainage are used to provide water for operational activities the samples are collected in a clean polypropylene bottle treated with 5 concentrated hno3 and then rinsed with distilled water before sampling to reduce external impurities water samples were collected from an open well dug well and borewells at variable depths the samples are kept in three separate polythene bottles for cations anions and isotopes analysis the cation samples were acidified to make the ph 2 to stabilize the cations from further reaction the preliminary analysis of ph ec tds and temperature were analyzed to avoid changes in the parameter using orion star a329 ph ise conductivity rdo do meters with relative accuracy of 0 002 for ph 0 5 for conductivity and tds 0 1 for temperature the acidified

phreeqc code version 2 12 for various hydrogeochemical calculations parkhurst and appelo 1999 in this study calculations of ionic strength aqueous solution type and mineral phase saturation index were performed isotope analysis is performed using a standard method of equilibrium with co2 and h2 in an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms in prl ahmedabad under the iwin program the spatial interpretation of ions depth of water table and isotopes were done using idw tool in arcgis 10 3 the agriculture indices were calculated using percentage sodium rsc and mg hazard the fraction of seawater was calculated from cl concentration in the collected samples compared with conservative mixing the positive and negative values of ions indicate the enrichment and depletion of specific ions

water regime based on altered energy and hydrological balance quesada et al 2017 the lulc change impact was assessed on the quality of groundwater in the present study eight lulc classes were demarcated during the year 2006 2018 as given in table 1 in supplementary data and the map is given in fig 2 the accuracy statistics and kappa coefficient were computed which demonstrated a good correlation between the referenced and classified data agricultural land accounts for the largest part of the area the total area of the agricultural sector in 2006 was 2412 sq km which has now been decreased to 2176sq km with a reduction of 9 8 from 2006 to 2018 the agricultural sector is the most vulnerable area because continuous irrigation makes the land less fertile so it is easy to convert to other classes like wasteland and built up these converted areas are prone to runoff and high evaporation with low recharge conditions bewket and sterk 2005 gebresamuel et al 2010 pan et al 2011 urbanization has resulted in reduced infiltration due to impermeable ground increased storm runoff and decreased water quality due to the discharge of sanitary waste into local streams and rivers eshleman 2004 this increase in built up also increases land surface temperature and other hydrometeorological variables such as evapotranspiration which affect the water balance of the study area li et al 2017 deng et al 2018 the maximum area comes from agriculture and wasteland as the area is a semi arid zone it faces urban industrial and agricultural water demand shalev et al 2015 so it is especially difficult in areas where coastal aquifer is under pressure of seawater ingress and population expansion gorelick and zheng 2015 scrubland is very common near dry riverbeds in 2006 the total land area was 85 sq km increasing to 213 sq km the area near built up is open fields which also contribute to wasteland thereby increasing the land coverage common lu lc changes are seen from agriculture and wasteland to built up which leads to increased runoff depending on the urban sprawl hamadi et al 2012 the changes from wasteland to agriculture contribute to the downward movement of nutrients which is otherwise found negligible in the wasteland as studied by scanlon et al 2005 another category of lulc has a significant contribution to groundwater waterbody covered rivers tanks ponds and artificial ponds occupied 129 sq km which is the third most significant area under study this area has decreased to 125 sq km in 2018 which has not changed much due to addition of canals in the area since the small waterbodies shrink in due course of time but addition of running canals has affected the groundwater status in the district the total land affected by salt encrustation in 2006 was 39sq km which is 1 26 of the total land of the district while in 2018 it increased to 109sq km which is 3 52 of the total land area it can be seen from the spatial map and ion ratio that the salinity of groundwater in the affected land is higher continuous application of fertilizers and tidal water through creeks will increase the ability of surface soil to easily scale up the salt encrustation after monsoon rains surface salt will penetrate shallow aquifers deteriorating groundwater quality the coastal natural wetland is the area close to the coast which remains inundated during the high tide and flourishes some coastal plant species a coastal wetland is the most versatile ecosystem which is converted to manmade activities like salt pans construction at coast and industries for refining the salt 4 2 groundwater quality status the statistical summary of all physicochemical parameters is given in table 1 the range of ph during both seasons shows the alkaline groundwater the spatial variation of ph was found to be very high at the central portion of the district during monsoon while the plume moves on to the western part during pre monsoon due to enriched alkaline water flowing through the creeks the electrical conductivity indicated that the dissolved concentration of solids is due to the ionic strength of groundwater soil type and agricultural activities the range of ec varied from 446 to 3248 μs cm during monsoon while in pre monsoon it ranges between 1247 and 15740 μs cm fig 3 a g confirms very high ec near the western creek due to seawater intrusion in the pre monsoon period while high ec is recorded near mahi estuary during monsoon season the dominant cations and anions are na mg2 ca2 and cl hco3 so4 2 respectively the high concentration of sodium 37 5 554 mg l during monsoon 55 2403 mg l in pre monsoon is due to the geological origin of silicate weathering halite dissolution and coastal seawater intrusion rina et al 2013 during the monsoon the lower reaches of the area show the highest concentration and in pre monsoon the concentration plume has moved to the west fig 3f l the enrichment of mg2 ranged between 4 and 73 5 mg l in monsoon 7 208 3 mg l in pre monsoon is controlled by the dolomite olivine and magnetite minerals rina et al 2011 ca2 showed the range of 1 6 40 7 mg l in monsoon and 4 1 172 7 mg l in pre monsoon which is contributed from the calcium bearing minerals like calcite dolomite and gypsum the concentration of potassium ranged from 0 57 to 13 56 mg l in monsoon and 0 33 38 89 mg l in pre monsoon the least concentration can be explained due to the adsorption on clay minerals and resistance from weathering in the following study chloride is being the most dominant anion which ranged from 28 1 to 494 4 mg l in monsoon and 49 1 4200 mg l during pre monsoon the main source of chloride is caused by the intrusion of seawater several kilometers offshore through creeks while the central part is affected by household and agricultural leakage which is also called inland salinity bicarbonate is representative of natural freshwater the concentration has ranged between 109 8 and 481 9 mg l in monsoon and 216 927 mg l in pre monsoon the high concentration was found due to carbonate weathering in the study area the concentration of so4 2 was found well within the acceptable limit 200 mg l during monsoon 10 4 126 3 mg l while it has increased during pre monsoon 19 4 1103 8 mg l which may be due to the addition of new sampling wells at the coastal area from spatial variation maps it has been identified that during monsoon season central and southern part is more affected while in pre monsoon maximum concentration was found at northwest fig 3c i which suggests impact of agricultural activity oxidation dissolution of so4 2 from sulfate rich mineral clay and silt deposits rina et al 2011 high nitrate load was observed from sampling wells of concentration 235 2 mg l while the permissible limit for drinking purposes is 45 mg l bis 2012 high yielding crops requires more fertilizers hence increased the application of dap which has been reported in the state agriculture development plan https rkvy nic in static saidp gj for 20this 20period 201718 20to 20201920 sap saidp gujarat pdf point and non point sources of nitrate concentration suggests the impact of irrigation water vertical mixing of animal waste septic tanks and industrial food processing waste the nitrate concentration in the unconfined aquifer is recharged from an unsaturated zone of surrounding high nitrate groundwater fluoride concentration was found to vary between 0 15 and 2 69 mg l in monsoon and 0 46 10 13 mg l in pre monsoon the acceptable limit of 1 mg l was exceeded by 38 and 52 samples during monsoon and pre monsoon respectively the highest concentration was at sampling points an3 4 9 having high hco3 na and ph which favors the release of f from aquifer matrix in groundwater in pre monsoon the sampling points pran5 10 18 located at the same taluka show a similar trend while pran18 is a new point source in pre monsoon season which falls near the creek in the western part of the district generally it is believed that the high concentration of br above 6 mg l in groundwater is caused by seawater hitchon et al 1999 the natural sources of br in groundwater are seawater intrusion 66 68 mg l and leaching from the earth s crust 6 mg kg bowen 1979 but there are also anthropogenic sources such as pesticides methyl bromide flury and papritz 1993 and urban runoff sollars et al 1982 the concentration range in pre monsoon is 0 10 7 mg l and during monsoon it is 0 1 4 mg l with average of 1 9 and 0 44 mg l in monsoon and pre monsoon respectively in few places relatively high br concentration may be attributed to point sources such as agriculture while the highest concentration of 10 9 mg l at pran14 attributed to seawater intrusion through creeks due to leaching of tidal seawater at shallow wells fig 1c i supplementary data 4 3 hydro geochemical processes mineral saturation indices were calculated using phreeqc 2 12 software for water rock interaction parkhurst and appelo 1999 it predicts the subsurface mineralogy from groundwater analysis without sampling in the solid phase deutsch 1997 si 0 predicts the potential to precipitate the mineral phase out of the solution while si 0 for undersaturation and further dissolution may take place the supersaturation of silica minerals was found at all places during both seasons calcite is oversaturated at an 1 6 8 12 13 and pran 6 17 18 19 20 fluorite and gypsum were found undersaturated and have a short residence time in the aquifer with a further scope of dissolution rina et al 2011 sheikh et al 2017 anhydrite and aragonite were found supersaturated at all places while dolomite was found to be oversaturated in 23 samples during both seasons fig 4 a and b a piper plot is used to show the relative abundance of minerals present in groundwater the dominance of na hco3 and na cl types of water was seen during the monsoon season as six samples belonged to na hco3 type six as na cl and one as ca hco3 fig 4c during pre monsoon ten samples are na hco3 seven na cl types two mg cl and one in mg hco3 fig 4d the contributing factors of na hco3 type of water are schists quartzite granite rock interaction with water freeze and cherry 1979 the monovalent cations na and k and anions cl and hco3 are dominant as explained by the piper diagram fig 4c and d the presence of na and cl type of water also confirms the salinity the na and cl shows a positive correlation of 0 88 table 2 suggest both the element have the same origin either the halite dissolution or seawater freshwater mixing fig 5 a in scatter plot of na vs cl maximum points are present near the 1 1 equiline suggests the halite dissolution which is confirmed by the saturation indices presented in fig 4a and b the relationship trend between so4 2 hco3 vs ca2 mg2 shows the points close to the trendline that defines the dissolution of silicate carbonate and sulfate minerals in the groundwater as indicated by the figure a deficiency of ca2 mg2 shows that the excessive negative charge should be balanced by na ions three factors may govern such variation in the groundwater as a cation exchange process seawater intrusion and characteristics of freshwater while the ca2 vs hco3 plot shows the carbonate weathering during monsoon since maximum points fall below the equiline which is influenced by the availability of co2 during the pre monsoon season maximum samples fall above the equiline thus bicarbonate influences the ca2 chemistry at lower mineralization and indicate the carbonate rocks dissolution cl vs br scatter plot is given in fig 5d which is potentially used for anthropogenic and natural contamination in the coastal aquifers cl br mass ratio is further used to identify salinity sources as halite dissolution sewage effluent landfill leachate brine and seawater intrusion liu et al 2017 groundwater samples are found close to the equiline confirming the common origin while the ratio of cl br also confirmed nonmarine sources in the study area 4 3 1 correlation analysis the correlation matrix for both seasons is given in table 2a b this relationship shows that the tds is strongly correlated with na mg2 cl br and no3 which indicates mineralization and salinity intrusion the low correlation of ph with tds signifies that the dissolution of salt does not relate to an acidic condition of groundwater but is more related to the degree of solubility the correlation of tds with na and mg2 confirms mineralization and climatic factors while a strong correlation with no3 and cl confirms the anthropogenic source through infiltration of agricultural fertilizers and halite dissolution the correlation coefficient of na and cl of 0 88 and presence of sampling points at halite line in scatter plot shows the halite dissolution since the presented study falls in the semi arid coastal region so the possibility of high na and cl are due to excessive evaporation dissolution of halite rocks and anthropogenic activities with coastal seawater intrusion at lower reaches sujatha and reddy 2003 the positive correlation among f hco3 and ph suggests the dissolution of f in groundwater as oh replaces exchangeable f under an alkaline environment rafique et al 2009 4 3 2 freshwater saline water mixing and ionic ratio generally the freshwater sources show high ca2 concentration while mg2 na and cl are characteristics of salinity however the mixing of seawater with fresh water and various other anthropogenic activities show a distinguished chemical signature the characteristic molar ratio for seawater and deep saline up coning is given in the supplementary table 2 ghabayen et al 2006 metcalf 2000 the sampling point near the creek towards the western side of the district an10 an13 pran4 pran13 pran15 fall under 0 86 1 m ratio of na cl shows seawater intrusion but pran4 can be ruled out which is very far from the coast sampling point an7 shows mg ca ratio 5 which falls at the southeastern part of the study area where mahi river drains to the gulf hence the possibility of the seawater intrusion occurs deep saline up coning was also one significant source of salinity in the groundwater due to over extraction in the coastal region na cl ratio of 0 8 at sampling points pran2 pran3 pran14 pran20 present at urbanized part of the district shows deep saline up coning likewise maximum samples showed mg ca 1 which also confirmed deep saline up coning due to the continuous extraction of groundwater for industrial and domestic purpose the coastal wells are abandoned due to the up coning of seawater several km off the coast in the district at khambhat taluka agriculture being the dominant class arises the problem of agriculture return flow in the district the ratio of so4 cl 0 05 confirmed all the samples are also affected by agriculture return flow wastewater infiltration is another dominant source of salinity in industrial and residential areas k cl ratio 0 02 explains the wastewater infiltration at sampling points an6 8 12 13 and pran2 4 6 7 8 9 which fall in urban land vengosh et al 1999 metcalf 2000 rina et al 2013 4 3 3 mixing fraction percentage the seawater fraction in the groundwater is often estimated using chloride concentration custodio et al 1987 chloride ion has been considered as a conservative tracer not affected by ion exchange the calculated values are given in table 3 using theoretical concentration of chloride in freshwater 4 48meq l and seawater 461 11meq l appello and postma 2005 during monsoon season the mixing fraction falls between 0 06 and 2 07 while in pre monsoon it is 0 02 to 24 9 the recorded mixing fraction shows the highest percentage 24 9 at pran14 mahiyari tarapur taluka which is in the western part resulted from the tidal water in the creek during monsoon season the highest fraction was found to be 2 07 and maximum samples showed negative value 4 4 origin of groundwater salinity using stable isotopes salinity mapping is a complex process especially in coastal areas where seawater intrusion occurs the area is affected by various other factors that affect the vulnerability of the aquifer by mixing freshwater saltwater in the transition zone the isotopic signature in water plays a significant role to study the source of salinity when mixed with water ionic content it helps us to identify in intermixing of different water bodies as well as in the assessment of hydro chemical evolution of groundwater fritz and fontes 1980 rina et al 2013 the spatial map of water isotopes is given in fig 6 and seasonal variations in the isotopic values show a significant variation due to changes in the location at some places the monsoon range of δ18o is 1 22 to 3 31 with an avg of 2 44 and δd ranges between 12 98 and 24 04 avg of 18 23 the stable isotopic values in pre monsoon show δ18o 0 61 to 3 0 with an average of 2 2 and δd from 7 13 to 20 8 with an average of 15 66 the relationship trend between δ18o and δd for monsoon and pre monsoon is given in fig 7 a and b which was compared with the local meteoric water line lmwl of north gujarat gupta and deshpande 2005 δ d 7 6 0 6 δ 18 o 2 9 2 2 r 2 0 89 the comparison shows that during monsoon and pre monsoon all the sample lie below the lmwl which suggest the local precipitation and evaporation effect on groundwater recharge the regression line below the lmwl and gwml gave the following significant formula as in monsoon δd 5 0 1 05 δ18o 5 91 2 61 r 2 0 67 and pre monsoon δd 4 48 0 5 δ18o 5 69 1 28 r 2 0 79 which is compared with lmwl of north gujarat the d excess can be calculated from d δ d 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 craig 1961 which ranged from 4 08 to 1 99 in monsoon and pre monsoon 3 32 to 6 17 which is a proxy to identify secondary processes taking place in the atmosphere a depth variation map was prepared from 2017 to 18 data collected from the field the northeastern part of the study area which is also a part of mahi river catchment having an isotopic signature in monsoon as 2 12 to 2 76 while in pre monsoon it varies between 2 12 and 2 73 except the two locations which are having higher depth with depleted isotopic value due to the freshwater lens in those locations when we moved from the northeast of the area to the south people have stopped using deeper wells due to the high salinity level even the replaced shallow wells showed higher ec and chloride concentrations in recent years as the δ18o values between 1 7 and 2 68 also confirmed the same area nearby creeks where the ionic ratio shows saline water intrusion highly enriched isotopic signature has been observed compared with the research done by rina et al in 2013 the amount of water pumped in the area increased and the intrusion from creek can be seen causing the δ18o value and ion ratio to be similar to that of seawater from the prepared lulc maps from 2006 to 2018 it can also be observed that saline soil has increased in the past twelve years leading to an increase in groundwater salinization which in turn makes the soil prone to salinity due to agricultural return flow the relationship between δ18o vs cl scatter plot suggests that the samples containing enriched δ18o values also has more chloride content at the locations near the creek an12 pran14 fig 7e the accumulated tidal seawater resulted in salt encrustation due to evaporation and hence increased the salinity in the groundwater as can be seen from lulc changes of 2006 2018 the ionic ratios of na cl 0 86 1 at sampling points an10 13 in monsoon and pran4 13 15 in pre monsoon having enriched δ18o also suggests the intrusion one mixing line in the scatter plot of δ18o vs cl was observed among neighboring sampling locations pran17 18 19 due to possible groundwater mixing 4 5 suitability of groundwater for agriculture purposes to examine the suitability of groundwater for agriculture purposes different indices were used the suitability depends on the effect on plants from mineral constituents of water the soil has similar harmful effects due to salt encrustation which leads to changes in soil structure aeration and permeability tyagi et al 2009 4 5 1 residual sodium carbonate rsc residual sodium carbonate ratio is computed with the formula raghunath 1987 table 3 supplementary data in monsoon season the rsc varies between 0 53 and 7 89 likewise in pre monsoon 10 26 to 11 76 the high values of rsc describe the high adsorption of sodium on the soil compared to the monsoon more area is affected in pre monsoon the negative values show the excess sodium ion offsetting calcium and magnesium through precipitation in the form of co2 by leaving behind na being the dominant cation while the positive value of rsc indicates the surpassed concentration of ca and mg with the hco3 reaction forming calcium and magnesium bicarbonate chitsazan et al 2017 since the study area is semi arid which is characterized by high rsc values resulting in salinization and sodification of agricultural soil prasad and bose 2001 the results also confirmed that the area is safe for agriculture towards the eastern side of the district at mahi river 4 5 2 sodium percentage sodium percentage is most crucial for water management in irrigation purposes as high concentration leads to a decrease in soil permeability hence retard plant growth the formula and the affected number of samples are given in table 3 in supplementary data ghalib 2017 the probability of high concentration comes from two sources one from the lithological sources causing the dissolution of sodium minerals and secondly unprecedented usage of agrochemicals the effect is highly devastating in terms of soil structure aeration and infiltration as well decline in the crop yield due to hindrance in the uptake of minerals from soil medium singaraja et al 2014 naseem et al 2012 4 5 3 magnesium hazard the current study resulted in the mg hazard ranged from 32 9 to 92 3 in monsoon and 58 9 82 2 in pre monsoon given in table 3 of supplementary data such concentration of mg in groundwater increases alkalinity and hence distresses the crop yield since the size of mg2 particles are 50 larger than that of calcium a large amount of water is adsorbed between mg2 and clay particles which results in loss of soil permeability hussain et al 2017 the fact is also supported because the study area is having na cl type of water reflecting the low concentration of ca2 and high mg2 5 conclusion inland and seawater salinity has led to the deterioration of groundwater quality in coastal cities which affects the availability of useable groundwater and has forced the closure of water supply at coastal areas hydrogeochemical and isotopic analyses along with the changes in lulc were applied to provide insights into regional hydrogeological processes and the degree of groundwater salinity in the coastal aquifers of the sabarmati river basin the concentration of nitrate was found to cross the permissible limit for drinking purposes at an2 5 7 10 in monsoon and pran1 3 8 19 during pre monsoon season influenced by agriculture runoff fluoride was also high at sampling points an4 5 9 in monsoon and pran5 10 12 15 17 18 19 during pre monsoon which may have resulted from fluorite dissolution and other possible input from agriculture land use landcover from liss iv for the year 2006 2018 was prepared which suggests that agricultural land has reduced while built up 50 and saline soil 179 has increased in the study area hydrochemistry and ionic ratio such as na cl suggests that sampling points an10 an13 pran13 pran15 in both seasons confirms the seawater intrusion which is near creeks in the western part while in other locations the inland salinity was due to leaching of evaporite infiltration of wastewater and agricultural return flow other ionic ratios like mg ca 1 confirmed deep saline up coning and so4 cl confirms the agricultural runoff in the whole study area evaporated water is getting recharged in the east water influx due to mahi canal command was observed with little depleted isotopic signature whereas in the western side over pumping as compared to influx is giving evaporated signature likewise the ionic ratio also suggests the up coning of seawater due to over pumping the relationship between δ18o vs cl scatter plot suggests that enriched δ18o values with high chloride content near the creek an12 pran14 were observed resulted from accumulated tidal seawater groundwater suitability for agricultural usage was calculated using different indices which confirmed the groundwater to be unsuitable for irrigation purposes near the coastal region in the semi arid coastal zone change in landuse landcover activity led to less recharge structure due to increased built up and over extraction of groundwater that eventually alters the seawater freshwater interface at the transition zone along with the limitation in built up activity an increase in the recharge structures and drip irrigation should be part of agriculture management practices to reduce the

11884,to protect aquifers it is necessary to assess their sustainability in the face of current and future events and stresses in this study technical environmental social economic and groundwater sustainability policy indexes were integrated and used to assess the sustainability of aquifers in the salt lake catchment this 92 884 2 km2 catchment one of the most important second grade watersheds in iran in terms of the importance of water resources is located in tehran markazi qazvin zanjan hamedan isfahan qom and alborz provinces and comprises 36 aquifers in the basin seven quantitative hydrogeological indicators three qualitative hydrogeology indicators six environmental indicators three social indicators two economic indicators and one policy indicator were considered final sustainability in each dimension hydrogeological environmental social economic and policy and overall sustainability were evaluated with the analytical hierarchy process and shannon information entropy weighting approach to integrate expert opinion the final results of sustainability analysis show that in the salt lake catchment eastern aquifers are completely unstable and western aquifers show poor stability management scenarios with a 40 and 80 reduction in groundwater abstraction in the framework of the driving force pressure status impact response model show that a 40 reduction plays no a significant role in improving the quantitative sustainability of aquifers whereas an 80 reduction in abstraction leads to an improvement of about 25 in quantitative sustainability graphical abstract image 1 keywords sustainability indices ahp weighting approach shannon information entropy dpsir model 1 introduction current reductions in the quantity and quality of water resources have led many countries to reconsider their policies on water resource management because of the impact of water on political cultural social economic and environmental dimensions water resource management has become an important tool to achieve sustainable development the best way to assess groundwater sustainability is by using sustainability indicators such assessments are best done in an organized framework comprising several components 1 problem identification 2 the dpsir conceptual model driving force pressure status impact response 3 definition of groundwater stability indicators 4 analysis of the relationships among the results and 5 determination of the impacts and roles of the stakeholders gordon 2011 although there is no single model for developing and selecting indicators oecd countries have introduced the psr pressure status response model for this purpose the psr model is based on the concept of causality human activities cause environmental pressures and affect the status of the system quality and quantity of natural resources and society responds to these effects through changes in awareness and behavior oecd 2003 to assess the relationship between human activities and the environment the european environment agency eea introduced the dpsir model eea 2003 which is based on the concept that the evolution of social and economic development puts pressure on the environment and leads to changes in its status these changes subsequently affect health access to resources natural ecosystems and other phenomena the response to these changes by the community and government officials is to improve economic and social management efforts to eliminate or reduce these pressures and to work to restore the environment this model allows systems under consideration to be integrated so that through this model environmental issues are examined with a view to all the relationships between the source of the problem and its consequences royuela 2002 to identify and develop indicators in the field of groundwater resource assessment after the introduction of the dpsir framework in 2007 a group of experts and specialists from unesco the international hydrological program ihp the international atomic energy agency iaea and the international hydrogeological association iah developed a set of groundwater indicators using a knowledge based approach unesco 2007 later in 2010 the water management committee hired gordon geological consulting to develop a pilot approach and provide a framework for assessing groundwater sustainability gordon 2011 these efforts shared the purpose of measuring sustainability in ways that can be used to help decision makers and other stakeholders achieve sustainability in addition it was foreseen that the indicators could also be used to assess the extent of progress toward sustainability for example the results of water sustainability indicators in a given basin for different years could be used to document the degree of progress martinez et al 2015 assessed groundwater sustainability in mexico city with a dpsir framework comprising 83 indicators 15 socioeconomic 48 environmental and 16 institutional anbazhagan and jothbasu 2016 introduced seven indexes to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources rainfall change groundwater quality pollution sensitivity groundwater use level groundwater overdraft problems and dependence on groundwater resources the results of their study showed that sustainability assessment with their set of indicators could lead to sustainable development management and protection of the environment and maintenance of the quality of groundwater resources a comprehensive assessment of indicators related to the water sector was conducted by pires et al 2017 in their study 170 indicators related to water resources and their management were evaluated by a panel of 14 experts based on a scoring system in four dimensions of social economic environmental and institutional sustainability the highest score was given to environmental criteria followed by economic institutional and social criteria in this evaluation process 24 key indicators that met the majority of sustainability criteria were identified most of which were related to the quality and quantity of water resources kourgialas et al 2018 developed integrated groundwater footprint indicators and evaluated sustainable consumption of groundwater resources and evidence of contamination in 11 aquifers in the island of crete greece hosseini et al 2019 introduced 13 indicators of aquifer sustainability for use especially in arid regions according to the amount of data available and the relevance of the indicators in the present study indices were calculated for 30 important aquifers in iran and the results document the unstable situation of all 30 aquifers thus our study shows that these indicators are a suitable tool for determining the quantitative and qualitative status of aquifers and that these indicators are a potential aid in managing the sustainability of groundwater resources given that they examine the impact of management measures and policies samani et al 2021 presented seven indicators in 5 dimensions of groundwater sustainability to evaluate the effect of the sustainability plan on aquifers in iran the results of this study show that during the study period aquifers in salt lake catchment continued to change toward an unstable situation and that implementation of the 2014 sustainability project samani 2021 has not had any effect in controlling this tendency toward sustainability in general groundwater resource assessment indicators focus on the quantity of groundwater resources water balance groundwater level reduction exploitation volume groundwater recharge and the relationship between groundwater and surface water other indicators center on factors related to groundwater quality pollution and temperature inherent vulnerability network status monitoring observation well density population dependence on groundwater resources biodiversity and biological activities land use changes land subsidence and groundwater footprint godfrey et al 2002 cameron and white 2004 wang and wu 2006 glasser et al 2007 lavapuro et al 2008 bocanegra et al 2008 korbel and hose 2011 gleeson et al 2012 preda et al 2013 wesa 2013 mattas et al 2014 yet despite the availability of a variety of groundwater sustainability indicators little work has aimed to define an integrated index based on internationally accepted standard indicators to fill this gap the present study offers an in depth review of existing indicators and indexes used to evaluate groundwater sustainability in aquifers one of the key aims of this work is to contribute to the development of a set of quantifiable indicators to evaluate groundwater sustainability that can be replicated in other regions around the world in this study 22 indicators related to groundwater resources and their management in six dimensions of sustainability hydrogeological environmental social economic and policy were used to investigate the sustainability of aquifers located in the salt lake catchment final sustainability in each dimension and overall sustainability were evaluated with the analytical hierarchy process ahp and shannon information entropy weighting approach to integrate expert opinion in addition two scenarios were used to evaluate quantitative sustainability in the framework of dpsir model 1 1 salt lake catchment to calculate the groundwater sustainability index in the salt lake catchment available statistics and information on groundwater resources in this catchment area were reviewed in this watershed due to the lack of surface currents groundwater abstraction has long been common in the form of ghanats or wells in recent decades due to the growth in population industry and agriculture groundwater abstraction in this watershed has increased and led to a decrease in water level in all alluvial aquifers and to ground subsidence in some aquifers because of the water crisis in this watershed assessing the sustainability of aquifers is of particular importance the salt lake catchment with an area of 92 884 2 km2 is one of the most important second grade watersheds in iran in terms of the importance of water resources it is located in tehran markazi qazvin zanjan hamedan isfahan qom and alborz provinces and comprises a total of 36 aquifers in this basin daryache namak zarand saveh saveh 4 eshtehard hashtgerd qazvin abhar

basin the area of the heights around the basin is 52 106 5 km2 in most study areas the alluvial aquifer covers a large area of the plain groundwater levels in all plains of the salt lake catchment are declining and therefore in all aquifers of the basin regulations were established in 2011 to prohibit the development or exploitation of groundwater resources the location of the study area is shown in fig 1 2 materials and methods implementing a project to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources is among the tasks carried out by expert teams who can identify existing indicators developed by recognized organizations and review their application in a given study area in addition to modifying existing indicators some study areas create the need for new indicators in order to monitor aquifer sustainability an ideal approach is to define sustainability indicators within the framework of the dpsir conceptual model un 2017 2 1 dpsir model developing a framework to organize information and implement groundwater sustainability assessment projects is essential the dpsir model framework is a useful approach to develop a rational model to evaluate and monitor the sustainability of water resources over time particularly because it provides a structured approach to identifying aquifer sustainability issues thus the dpsir model can improve the performance of water sustainability assessments fig 2 shows the general structure of this framework kristensen 2003 the dpsir approach consists of five major components the driving index d describes social demographic and economic developments in societies and their effects on lifestyle and overall levels of consumption and production patterns new management options applied to improve these outcomes are part of this indicator and are repeated in subsequent evaluation cycles the pressure index p describes developments related to human activities that use groundwater resources and lead to their pollution the status index s describes groundwater in terms of physical biological and chemical phenomena in a particular area the impact index i explains the impact of changes in the status of groundwater systems the response index r refers to the reaction of groups and individuals in society as well as government efforts to prevent compensate improve or adapt to changes in the status of groundwater systems fig 2 2 2 developing indicators to evaluate groundwater sustainability an index is a statistical measure that shows changes in a variable and indexes are used to express the relative changes in a given parameter appropriate indicators can be used to characterize a situation and identify the factors the may improve the system to aid in decision making and prioritization of decisions and to characterize the system to the community juwana et al 2010 the evaluation of groundwater sustainability includes a process of selecting the index developing the formula for the index and the actual use of the indicators to measure different dimensions in other words groundwater sustainability indicators are defined as measurable variables that provide comprehensible information about the groundwater system and are therefore useful tools to measure capture and evaluate the sustainability of natural resources steinman 2007 gordon 2011 it should be noted that indexes are used to characterize the problem over time period of operation but are not used to solve problems each indicator describes a specific aspect of groundwater systems the groundwater indicators proposed here are based on measurable and observable data and provide information on the quantity and quality of groundwater resources current situation and trends in addition they focus on social groundwater access operation and use economic groundwater abstraction and conservation requirements environmental groundwater vulnerability discharge and pollution and political aspects of groundwater management liverman et al 1988 defined the following characteristics for selecting indicators sensitive to time changes a reliable indicator should be observable over a specified time series of data otherwise the index will not be able to provide information on how the factors related to the index change over time sensitive to spatial changes an index must reflect spatial changes otherwise it will not be useful to measure specific conditions predictability due to changes in sustainability over time reliable indicators should be able to predict adverse conditions have reference values or thresholds no personal bias bias in choosing sustainability indicators may occur for a variety of reasons such as the knowledge of the developer or political interests ability to convert information in most indicators raw data cannot be used therefore data conversion or calculations are required to obtain a numerical value for the index it is thus important to use the right method to convert the data into a meaningful indicator ability to integrate it is important to integrate or combine indicators in order to detect signs of instability indicators can only be merged if they have the same unit and several methods are available to unify units depending on the nature of the data and the purpose of index development nardo et al 2005 in choosing the method particular attention and careful analysis are required because different methods may produce different results ebert and welsch 2004 in the present study we used a classification scale method to integrate the indicators the scale was defined with quantitative values from 1 to 5 and qualitative categories such as very good good or poor this method can be used to assign scores for indicators that do not generate quantitative data to calculate the score for each quantitative indicator the classification scale method used a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 100 and qualitative indicators were scored with five categories other criteria used to select an index are scientific validity along with knowledge of the system under study ability to meet system requirements reliability and relevance sensitivity to environmental changes and human activities comparability and understandability geographical coverage and cost effectiveness mimam 2000 2 3 quantitative hydrogeological indicators defining quantitative indicators to evaluate groundwater sustainability and provide detailed information about the present state and trends in groundwater characteristics can be helpful to 1 analyze human impacts on groundwater systems in space and time 2 improve and or enhance the groundwater management capability of policymakers and managers 3 compare local management policies adopted for groundwater resources across different areas and aquifers and 4 facilitate public participation in groundwater resource planning and policy the seven indicators calculated in the category of quantitative hydrogeological indicators are presented in table 1 these indicators include renewable groundwater volume per capita igwr groundwater abstraction and recharge index iab r index of total abstraction ratio to total exploitable groundwater resources iab e groundwater share index in water supply for all uses igws index of change in groundwater storage i δ h i index of change in groundwater storage between two periods iδh1 2 and the water level trend index in observation wells isv for all indicators a score of 100 indicates maximum sustainability while a score of 0 indicates unstable status 2 4 qualitative hydrogeological indicators groundwater quality indicators characterize the current status and trends in groundwater quality and can be used to identify challenges in groundwater quality in time and space different indicators may be based on drinking water standards irrigation needs industrial use and other factors a quality index can also be developed for specific conditions of natural pollution these indicators also make it possible to identify processes that lead to groundwater pollution the indicators used here for qualitative hydrogeological factors are presented in table 2 and these three indicators include index of change in groundwater quality in a study period iq index of change in groundwater quality compared to short term and long term periods i δ q and electrical conductivity ec index 2 5 environmental indicators because of the effect of water on environmental factors the study of these factors plays an important role in achieving sustainable development of water resources given the importance of environmental sustainability this concept is quantified by indicators of water resource sustainability pressure on the environment has been evaluated based on variations in the area of the basin used for agriculture and variations in the resident population throughout the study period since according to hunsaker and levine 1995 the proportions of urban and agricultural areas correlate with the quality of the resources population growth is one crucial element affecting the long term sustainability of water resources the indicators used here for the environmental dimension are presented in table 3 these six environmental indicators include groundwater drought index gri groundwater resource vulnerability index iv stress index is index of average changes in the level of agricultural areas and urban population ivap percent of basin area under natural vegetation iav and index of non conventional water resource supply in the study area inc relative to conventional water resources in the study period 2 6 social indicators groundwater plays a key role in providing public water resources around the world so attention to social dimensions and examining the impact of water on social factors are key issues in sustainable groundwater management and play an important role in achieving sustainable development given the importance of sustainable development quantification of this concept with indicators of sustainable water resource management should take social considerations into account bui et al 2018 indicators of social sustainability depend on the status of the study area and may differ according to the nature and requirements of the local community mckenzie 2004 so these indicators should be selected in light of current social problems related to groundwater in the local community the indicators used in the present study for the social dimension are presented in table 4 and include index of population dependence on groundwater idp index of change in human development index hdi during the study period i δ hdi and index of change in hdi education during the study period i h d i e 2 7 economic indicators the concept of acting locally but thinking globally has been critically emphasized for any economic sector to ensure sustainable development in communities cities and countries water resource development is currently receiving more attention from both researchers and practitioners worldwide because ensuring safe and affordable drinking water for all is one of the universal targets among the 17 united nations sustainable development goals united united nations 2017 the present study used two indicators to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources from an economic perspective change in hdi income during the study period ihdi income and management expenditure index ii table 5 2 8 policy indicators this section classifies policies from poor 0 to excellent 100 if appropriate water management policies have been developed but not yet implemented or adapted an average score of 50 was assigned senent aparicio et al 2015 the indicator calculated in this category is presented in table 6 2 9 integration of different indicators there are several tools to integate results in the assessment of water resource sustainability one of which is the combination and integration of different dimensions of sustainability indicators into a single index to provide aggregated and targeted information for groundwater planning policy making and management the resulting index is dimensionless and various weighting and ranking systems can be used to construct it this approach facilitates the presentation and communication of research results in a concise manner one way to integrate indicators is to consider variable weights for each indicator in this method the final value in the stability assessment is obtained with the following formulas cwsi 2007 bui et al 2016 1 i i wsubi ij subi ij 2 i f wi i i i 3 0 wsubi ij wi i 1 wsubiij is the weight of index j in subset i these subsets refer to indicators in each set of hydrogeological environmental social economic and political indexes subiij is the value of index j in subset i ii is the stability index in the whole subset of i and if is the final sustainability assessment index among the methods to calculate the weight of indexes in the above formulas are the shannon entropy model shannon 1948 and the ahp approach bui et al 2016 bui et al 2017 2018 both of which are described below 2 9 1 shannon entropy weighting method this weighting method is derived from information theory and was first proposed by shannon in 1984 shannon 1948 as one of the most important quantitative decision making techniques that can be used in group and non group decision making the shannon entropy weighting technique is straightforward precise and practical and allows analysts to obtain accurate clear results because project analysts make relevant decisions based on field related experience and knowledge this technique offers them a useful platform this method is based on the presence of information in the decision table so to solve a problem with the entropy method a decision table must first be constructed the steps in the entropy method are as follows shannon 1948 step 1 build a decision matrix for the input as shown as equation 4 in the present study the matrix was built with indicators and weights identified by experts 4 x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x m n step 2 normalize or scale the decision table with a simple normalization method or the arithmetic mean method equation 5 shows the simple normalization method 5 p i j x i j i 1 m x i j step 3 calculate the entropy of each index with equation 6 below in this formula the value of k causes the entropy value of each index to remain between 0 and 1 6 e j k i 1 m p i j l n p i j k 1 l n m step 4 calculate the distance of each index from its entropy value calculated in the previous step this is accomplished with equation 7 below 7 d j 1 e j step 5 calculate the weight of each index with equation 8 8 w j d j d j 2 9 2 analytical hierarchy process approach another way to calculate the weight of an index is the ahp method proposed by saaty 1980 this method allows the problem to be formulated in a multilevel hierarchical structure and makes it possible for managers to examine different scenarios according to the scope of the study in addition it is a powerful flexible method for multicriteria decision making used to solve complex problems at different levels the ahp method combines objective and subjective evaluations into an integrated structure based on scale by pair comparisons and facilitates the organization of key aspects of a problem into a hierarchical framework the advantages of this method are 1 it measures the consistency of decision makers judgments 2 it allows pairwise comparisons in choosing the optimal solution and option and 3 it considers criteria and sub criteria in evaluating different options thus making it possible to identify the best option through pairwise comparisons bui et al 2016 2017 2018 this method is implemented in the following five main steps step 1 modeling the problem and purpose of decision making are determined hierarchically from decision elements that are related to each other the decision elements in the present study include the indicators and the weights assigned to the indicators on the basis of expert opinion step 2 preferential judgment different decision options based on each indicator are compared in this step the decision maker compares the index or options in each level with the element at a higher level in a pairwise approach and calculates their weight the scale in table 7 is usually used to compare options step 3 relative weight calculations the weight and importance of the elements relative to each other are determined through a set of numerical calculations that can be summarized as follows calculate the sum of the numbers in each column of the pairwise comparison matrix and then divide each column by the sum of the numbers in that column the new matrix obtained in this way is called the normalized comparison matrix find the average of the numbers in each row of the normalized comparison matrix this average represents the relative weight of the decision elements corresponding to the rows in the matrix finally to determine the best option multiply the priority weight matrix of the indicators by the weight of the indicators in other words to compare the options the weights of each index are multiplied by the weights of the criteria and the resulting values are added together then the best option is selected according to the terms of different criteria buchanan et al 1999 step 4 integrate relative weights this step produces the final weighting of the indicators step 5 calculate consistency of the judgments almost all ahp calculations are based on the initial judgment of the decision maker in the form of a matrix any errors and inconsistencies in comparing and determining the relative importance of options and indicators will lead to errors in the final results of the calculations the compatibility ratio is used to determine consistency of the judgments and this ratio should be less than 0 1 for the pairwise comparison matrix otherwise the preferential judgments are inconsistent and should be removed 3 results and discussion the methodology described above was applied to data for the salt lake catchment in iran during the period between 2010 and 2020 when data were available because calculations of overall sustainability were based on the results for six different dimensions each of them is presented separately below and the overall sustainability index is then reported and discussed to obtain the data we used to calculate the six dimensions of sustainability and overall sustainability questionnaires were prepared with the shannon entropy and ahp weighting methods for all indicators and were distributed to experts involved in the sustainability project in iran at the water resources management company and to hydrogeological researchers then the results were collected and weighted in all maps presented in this article numbers between 0 and 25 represent unsustainable or low sustainability status red numbers between 25 and 50 show moderate sustainability orange numbers between 50 and 75 represent relatively sustainability yellow and numbers between 75 and 100 indicate high sustainability blue 3 1 quantitative hydrogeological sustainability indicators each of the quantitative indicators was calculated separately and then all indicators were integrated with the shannon entropy and ahp methods to obtain the final value used to estimate environmental sustainability of the aquifers according to both methods the highest weighting was assigned to the renewable groundwater volume per capita index igwr at 28 and the lowest was for the index of water level trend in observation wells isv at 4 the weights obtained for the other indexes were groundwater abstraction and recharge index iab r 17 index of total abstraction ratio to total exploitable groundwater resources iab e 19 groundwater share index in water supply for all uses igws 12 index of change in groundwater storage i δ h i 11 and index of change in groundwater storage in two periods i δ h 1 2 8 the sustainability maps of the study area based on the weighted averages of all quantitative hydrogeological indicators are presented in fig 3 according to both methods most aquifers in the catchment showed low sustainability stability between 0 and 25 in the shannon entropy weighting method damavand daryache namk masileh sharifabad moteh qeydar arak komijan shara block and shazand aquifers showed a stability index between 25 and 50 moderately sustainable status the ahp weighting method produced results that differed little from those with the shannon method and yielded indexes between 25 and 50 moderately sustainable for the nobaran razan qahvand damavand daryache namk masileh sharifabad moteh qeydar arak komijan shara block and shazand aquifers 3 2 qualitative hydrogeological sustainability indicators each of the quality indicators was calculated separately and then all indicators were integrated with the shannon entropy and ahp methods to obtain the final value used to estimate environmental sustainability of the aquifers based on both methods the highest weight was assigned to the ec index iec at 47 followed by the index of change in groundwater quality in short term vs long term periods i δ q at 30 and the index of change in groundwater quality in the study period iq at 23 the qualitative hydrogeological sustainability maps of the aquifers are presented in fig 4 based on the two weighting methods most of the aquifers in the western part of the salt lake catchment showed moderate sustainability with values in the range of 25 50 whereas aquifers in the southeastern part of the basin were in the unstable range values between 0 and 25 there was little difference between the results with the two weighting methods although the ahp method yielded a relatively stable status values between 50 and 75 for the hashtgerd shara shazand and golpayegan aquifers 3 3 environmental sustainability indicators each of the environmental indicators was calculated separately and then all indicators were integrated with the shannon entropy and ahp methods to obtain the final value used to estimate environmental sustainability of the aquifers based on both methods the highest weight was obtained for the groundwater resources vulnerability index iv at 26 and the lowest weight was obtained for the index of non conventional water resources supply in the study area inc at 8 for the rest of indicators the weights were groundwater drought index gri 20 stress index is 17 index of average changes in the level of agricultural areas and urban population ivap 20 and percent of basin area under natural vegetation iav 9 the sustainability maps of the aquifers based on the average weights of all environmental indicators are presented in fig 5 according to both weighting methods most of the aquifers in the salt lake basin were in the unstable or low stability range between 0 and 25 damavand lavasan tehran karaj hashtgerd abharrood qeydar kaboudar ahang and hamedan bahar aquifers showed moderate sustainability with values between 25 and 50 the only difference between the two maps is that the entropy weighting method for the lavasanat aquifer yielded higher sustainability compared to the ahp method 3 4 social sustainability indicators each of the social indicators was calculated separately and then all indicators were integrated with the shannon entropy and ahp methods to obtain the final value used in our assessment of social sustainability of the aquifers according to both methods mean weighting was the highest for the index of population dependence on groundwater idp at 55 followed by the index of change in hdi during the study period ihdi at 24 and by the index of change in hdi education during the study period ihdi e at 22 the aquifer sustainability maps based on the average weights of all sustainability indicators are presented in fig 6 based on both weighting methods most study areas in the salt lake catchment were classified as unstable or poorly sustainable with stability index values ranging from 0 to 25 however qom kahak mahallat delijan tafresh qeydar hamedan bahar and tehran karaj aquifers had a stability index between 25 and 50 indicative of moderate sustainability status 3 5 economic sustainability indicators each of the economic indicators was calculated separately and then all indicators were integrated with the shannon entropy and ahp methods to obtain the final value used to evaluate economic sustainability of the aquifers according to both methods the weight of the index of change in hdi income during the study period ihdi income was 64 and the weight of the management expenditure index ii was 36 according to both methods all aquifers were in the range of moderate sustainability with integrated index values between 25 and 50 3 6 political sustainability indicators this dimension of sustainability of the basin considered the organizational capacity index calculated to yield values ranging from weak 0 to excellent 100 in iran water resource management laws have been passed especially in the field of aquifer balance but they have not yet been implemented or adjusted accordingly an average score of 50 was assigned to all aquifers 3 7 overall sustainability considering six dimensions this section reports and discuses the integration of quantitative and qualitative hydrogeological environmental economic and social indicators with the shannon entropy weight averaging and ahp methods to obtain an overall sustainability index for aquifers located in the salt lake catchment according to these two methods the following weights were given to each indicator quantitative index 36 qualitative index 20 environmental index 17 social index 12 economic index 9 and political index 6 the overall sustainability maps of the study area based on the weighted average of all sustainability dimensions obtained with each method are presented in fig 7 the two weighting methods yielded almost the same results the only difference between the two maps is that the ahp method for nobaran aquifer shows higher sustainability than the entropy method according to the maps most study areas in the salt lake catchment are in the low stability range 0 25 in general the eastern part of the basin is less stable than the western part the sustainability maps of this catchment area show the need for rapid management measures to protect groundwater resources overall the present results are consistent with findings reported by hosseini et al 2019 in the hosseini et al 2019 study 13 environmentally related quantitative indicators were used to assess groundwater sustainability in an arid region with appropriate adaptation depending upon data availability and the relevance of each indicator they developed an integrated environmentally sustainable groundwater management index esgmi based on the weighted aggregation of these 13 indicators through a multicriteria decision making method the values of esgmi ranged between 0 and 100 with a value of 0 denoting the least favorable status i e unsustainable groundwater management and a value of 100 indicating the ideal status i e fully sustainable groundwater management thirty important aquifers across iran were chosen to test the esgmi on a national scale in the country known to be the fifth largest global user of groundwater the esgmi for the 30 aquifers ranged from 15 40 to 68 50 mean 49 96 and thus indicate the unsustainable status of groundwater management in iran hosseini et al 2019 3 8 application of the dpsir conceptual model in a salt lake catchment because of the unstable condition of aquifers located in the salt lake catchment a revised management plan should be implemented in the basin to optimize the management plan we used a dpsir conceptual model in which the new management plan is considered an indicator of the driving force once the proposed scenarios are applied in the model the success rate of the project in terms of sustainability can be determined by recalculating the sustainability indicators under the new scenarios pressure indicators reflect the number of changes applied in the aquifer under the influence of the new scenario while status indicators reflect the physical and chemical status of the study area and impact indicators measure the impact of changes on progress toward achieving aquifer sustainability in a new scenario if the status indicates stability the management options applied can then be considered a suitable option and can be implemented in the study area of course once the new plan is implemented in the study area sustainability should be monitored continuously to ensure that the desired outcomes are maintained if monitoring indicates that the new plan fails to succeed over time the cycle of sustainability assessment followed by development and implementation of a new management plan should be restarted to apply this approach mathematical models should be developed for each of the aquifers located in the salt lake catchment although detailed descriptions of these models were not within the scope of this article two water balance scenarios are described below as examples of how the dpsir approach might be used in future management efforts 3 8 1 impact of a 40 reduction in groundwater abstraction on quantitative hydrogeological indicators the indicators we recalculated in this scenario were groundwater abstraction and recharge index iab r index of total abstraction ratio to total exploitable groundwater resources iab e groundwater share index in water supply for all uses igws index of change in groundwater storage i δ h i and index of change in groundwater storage over two periods iδh1 2 it should be noted that all available indicators in this dimension were used to calculate overall sustainability after this scenario was applied to recalculate iab r and iab e the abstraction rate of all aquifers in the salt lake catchment area was reduced by 40 within the dpsir framework these two indicators reflect the status of the aquifer therefore recalculating these indicators illustrates the effect of implementation of the management scenario on aquifer status to recalculate igws an index based on the amount of groundwater abstraction a 40 reduction in abstraction rate was again assumed in this scenario within the dpsir framework this indicator serves as an index of impact accordingly calculation of this index reflects the effect on the aquifers of implementing the management scenario to recalculate i δ h i the groundwater level in the desired month considering a 40 reduction in abstraction rate was compared to the minimum and maximum water level during the study period 2010 2020 to calculate groundwater level in the 40 reduction scenario the total volume of the aquifer was calculated based on the aquifer area and storage coefficient and then a 40 reduction in groundwater abstraction was used as the volume stored in the aquifer based on the volume formula the increase in water surface after this reduction was calculated then the water level was added to the data for september 2020 and a 40 reduction in water level was considered this index is a reflection of pressure in the dpsir framework in other words calculating this index for this scenario indicates the amount of pressure on the aquifer to recalculate iδh1 2 water level in the short term period from october 2017 to 2020 and the long term period from october 2010 to 2020 was reduced by 40 in the dpsir framework this index is another reflection of pressure on the aquifers calculating this index for this scenario would be predicted to show a decrease in the amount of pressure on the aquifer after recalculating the indexes quantitative hydrogeological indicators in the 40 reduction scenario were merged with the shannon entropy and ahp methods to obtain overall quantitative hydrogeological indicators for the aquifers the sustainability maps of the catchment area based on the weighted average of quantitative hydrogeological indicators are presented in fig 8 according to this index the status of some aquifers changed slightly from unstable to poor stability thus the overall responses of the aquifers to a 40 reduction in groundwater abstraction was not positive 3 8 2 impact of an 80 reduction in groundwater abstraction on quantitative hydrogeological indicators given that application of a management scenario of a 40 reduction in groundwater abstraction had little effect on the quantitative sustainability of the aquifers the dpsir management cycle was repeated in a second management scenario based on an 80 reduction in withdrawals quantitative indicators were calculated again to test the impact of this management strategy on aquifer status and to determine whether it resulted in a reduction in pressure on the aquifers the indexes were recalculated as in the 40 reduction scenario and the results were visualized in fig 9 as overall quantitative sustainability maps according to the two weighting methods the ahp and shannon entropy weighting methods yielded the same results in the scenario of an 80 reduction in groundwater abstraction no aquifer displayed a fully unstable status in terms of quantitative sustainability and aquifers located in the catchment area attained sustainability indexes between 25 and 75 in other words aquifer sustainability improved by about 25 4 conclusion in this study indicators in six dimensions i e quantitative and qualitative hydrogeology environmental social economic and political factors were used to evaluate overall sustainability of aquifers located in the salt lake catchment in iran two methods were used to weight the indicators in each dimension shannon information entropy weighting and the ahp approach to calculate overall stability questionnaires were prepared and distributed to experts involved in the sustainability plan of the water resources management company in iran and to hydrogeological researchers then the results were compiled and weighed the shannon entropy weighting and ahp methods yielded very similar results in our calculations of an overall aquifer sustainability index therefore in future studies the use of one of these methods will suffice integration of all dimensions of sustainability for the aquifers in the salt lake catchment showed low sustainability with overall sustainability values ranging between 0 and 25 sustainability was lower in the eastern part of the basin than the western part the sustainability maps of this catchment area illustrate the need for rapid management measures to protect groundwater resources a potentially important application of the integrated sustainability indicator described here is in evaluating management scenarios and examining their impact on aquifer sustainability within the framework of the dpsir model in the present study the performance of the method in capturing changes in the quantitative sustainability of aquifers was compared in two management scenarios a 40 and 80 reduction in groundwater abstraction the results show that the 40 reduction scenario had little effect on aquifer sustainability whereas the 80 reduction scenario led to an increase of about 25 in aquifer sustainability overall the results of this study demonstrate that the integrated sustainable groundwater management index is a promising tool to determine the current status of groundwater quantity and quality the index is able to demonstrate the effect of policy actions and plans and can contribute to the development and implementation of effective sustainable management policies for groundwater resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

11884,to protect aquifers it is necessary to assess their sustainability in the face of current and future events and stresses in this study technical environmental social economic and groundwater sustainability policy indexes were integrated and used to assess the sustainability of aquifers in the salt lake catchment this 92 884 2 km2 catchment one of the most important second grade watersheds in iran in terms of the importance of water resources is located in tehran markazi qazvin zanjan hamedan isfahan qom and alborz provinces and comprises 36 aquifers in the basin seven quantitative hydrogeological indicators three qualitative hydrogeology indicators six environmental indicators three social indicators two economic indicators and one policy indicator were considered final sustainability in each dimension hydrogeological environmental social economic and policy and overall sustainability were evaluated with the analytical hierarchy process and shannon information entropy weighting approach to integrate expert opinion the final results of sustainability analysis show that in the salt lake catchment eastern aquifers are completely unstable and western aquifers show poor stability management scenarios with a 40 and 80 reduction in groundwater abstraction in the framework of the driving force pressure status impact response model show that a 40 reduction plays no a significant role in improving the quantitative sustainability of aquifers whereas an 80 reduction in abstraction leads to an improvement of about 25 in quantitative sustainability graphical abstract image 1 keywords sustainability indices ahp weighting approach shannon information entropy dpsir model 1 introduction current reductions in the quantity and quality of water resources have led many countries to reconsider their policies on water resource management because of the impact of water on political cultural social economic and environmental dimensions water resource management has become an important tool to achieve sustainable development the best way to assess groundwater sustainability is by using sustainability indicators such assessments are best done in an organized framework comprising several components 1 problem identification 2 the dpsir conceptual model driving force pressure status impact response 3 definition of groundwater stability indicators 4 analysis of the relationships among the results and 5 determination of the impacts and roles of the stakeholders gordon 2011 although there is no single model for developing and selecting indicators oecd countries have introduced the psr pressure status response model for this purpose the psr model is based on the concept of causality human activities cause environmental pressures and affect the status of the system quality and quantity of natural resources and society responds to these effects through changes in awareness and behavior oecd 2003 to assess the relationship between human activities and the environment the european environment agency eea introduced the dpsir model eea 2003 which is based on the concept that the evolution of social and economic development puts pressure on the environment and leads to changes in its status these changes subsequently affect health access to resources natural ecosystems and other phenomena the response to these changes by the community and government officials is to improve economic and social management efforts to eliminate or reduce these pressures and to work to restore the environment this model allows systems under consideration to be integrated so that through this model environmental issues are examined with a view to all the relationships between the source of the problem and its consequences royuela 2002 to identify and develop indicators in the field of groundwater resource assessment after the introduction of the dpsir framework in 2007 a group of experts and specialists from unesco the international hydrological program ihp the international atomic energy agency iaea and the international hydrogeological association iah developed a set of groundwater indicators using a knowledge based approach unesco 2007 later in 2010 the water management committee hired gordon geological consulting to develop a pilot approach and provide a framework for assessing groundwater sustainability gordon 2011 these efforts shared the purpose of measuring sustainability in ways that can be used to help decision makers and other stakeholders achieve sustainability in addition it was foreseen that the indicators could also be used to assess the extent of progress toward sustainability for example the results of water sustainability indicators in a given basin for different years could be used to document the degree of progress martinez et al 2015 assessed groundwater sustainability in mexico city with a dpsir framework comprising 83 indicators 15 socioeconomic 48 environmental and 16 institutional anbazhagan and jothbasu 2016 introduced seven indexes to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources rainfall change groundwater quality pollution sensitivity groundwater use level groundwater overdraft problems and dependence on groundwater resources the results of their study showed that sustainability assessment with their set of indicators could lead to sustainable development management and protection of the environment and maintenance of the quality of groundwater resources a comprehensive assessment of indicators related to the water sector was conducted by pires et al 2017 in their study 170 indicators related to water resources and their management were evaluated by a panel of 14 experts based on a scoring system in four dimensions of social economic environmental and institutional sustainability the highest score was given to environmental criteria followed by economic institutional and social criteria in this evaluation process 24 key indicators that met the majority of sustainability criteria were identified most of which were related to the quality and quantity of water resources kourgialas et al 2018 developed integrated groundwater footprint indicators and evaluated sustainable consumption of groundwater resources and evidence of contamination in 11 aquifers in the island of crete greece hosseini et al 2019 introduced 13 indicators of aquifer sustainability for use especially in arid regions according to the amount of data available and the relevance of the indicators in the present study indices were calculated for 30 important aquifers in iran and the results document the unstable situation of all 30 aquifers thus our study shows that these indicators are a suitable tool for determining the quantitative and qualitative status of aquifers and that these indicators are a potential aid in managing the sustainability of groundwater resources given that they examine the impact of management measures and policies samani et al 2021 presented seven indicators in 5 dimensions of groundwater sustainability to evaluate the effect of the sustainability plan on aquifers in iran the results of this study show that during the study period aquifers in salt lake catchment continued to change toward an unstable situation and that implementation of the 2014 sustainability project samani 2021 has not had any effect in controlling this tendency toward sustainability in general groundwater resource assessment indicators focus on the quantity of groundwater resources water balance groundwater level reduction exploitation volume groundwater recharge and the relationship between groundwater and surface water other indicators center on factors related to groundwater quality pollution and temperature inherent vulnerability network status monitoring observation well density population dependence on groundwater resources biodiversity and biological activities land use changes land subsidence and groundwater footprint godfrey et al 2002 cameron and white 2004 wang and wu 2006 glasser et al 2007 lavapuro et al 2008 bocanegra et al 2008 korbel and hose 2011 gleeson et al 2012 preda et al 2013 wesa 2013 mattas et al 2014 yet despite the availability of a variety of groundwater sustainability indicators little work has aimed to define an integrated index based on internationally accepted standard indicators to fill this gap the present study offers an in depth review of existing indicators and indexes used to evaluate groundwater sustainability in aquifers one of the key aims of this work is to contribute to the development of a set of quantifiable indicators to evaluate groundwater sustainability that can be replicated in other regions around the world in this study 22 indicators related to groundwater resources and their management in six dimensions of sustainability hydrogeological environmental social economic and policy were used to investigate the sustainability of aquifers located in the salt lake catchment final sustainability in each dimension and overall sustainability were evaluated with the analytical hierarchy process ahp and shannon information entropy weighting approach to integrate expert opinion in addition two scenarios were used to evaluate quantitative sustainability in the framework of dpsir model 1 1 salt lake catchment to calculate the groundwater sustainability index in the salt lake catchment available statistics and information on groundwater resources in this catchment area were reviewed in this watershed due to the lack of surface currents groundwater abstraction has long been common in the form of ghanats or wells in recent decades due to the growth in population industry and agriculture groundwater abstraction in this watershed has increased and led to a decrease in water level in all alluvial aquifers and to ground subsidence in some aquifers because of the water crisis in this watershed assessing the sustainability of aquifers is of particular importance the salt lake catchment with an area of 92 884 2 km2 is one of the most important second grade watersheds in iran in terms of the importance of water resources it is located in tehran markazi qazvin zanjan hamedan isfahan qom and alborz provinces and comprises a total of 36 aquifers in this basin daryache namak zarand saveh saveh 4 eshtehard hashtgerd qazvin abhar

neyzar delijan mahallat moteh golpayegan khomein kashan tehran karaj varamin damavand and lavasanat the plains area of the salt lake catchment measures 40 777 7 km2 about 44 of the total area of the basin the area of the heights around the basin is 52 106 5 km2 in most study areas the alluvial aquifer covers a large area of the plain groundwater levels in all plains of the salt lake catchment are declining and therefore in all aquifers of the basin regulations were established in 2011 to prohibit the development or exploitation of groundwater resources the location of the study area is shown in fig 1 2 materials and methods implementing a project to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources is among the tasks carried out by expert teams who can identify existing indicators developed by recognized organizations and review their application in a given study area in addition to modifying existing indicators some study areas create the need for new indicators in order to monitor aquifer sustainability an ideal approach is to define sustainability indicators within the framework of the dpsir conceptual model un 2017 2 1 dpsir model developing a framework to organize information and implement groundwater sustainability assessment projects is essential the dpsir model framework is a useful approach to develop a rational model to evaluate and monitor the sustainability of water resources over time particularly because it provides a structured approach to identifying aquifer sustainability issues thus the dpsir model can improve the performance of water sustainability assessments fig 2 shows the general structure of this framework kristensen 2003 the dpsir approach consists of five major components the driving index d describes social demographic and economic developments in societies and their effects on lifestyle and overall levels of consumption and production patterns new management options applied to improve these outcomes are part of this indicator and are repeated in subsequent evaluation cycles the pressure index p describes developments related to human activities that use groundwater resources and lead to their pollution the status index s describes groundwater in terms of physical biological and chemical phenomena in a particular area the impact index i explains the impact of changes in the status of groundwater systems the response index r refers to the reaction of groups and individuals in society as well as government efforts to prevent compensate improve or adapt to changes in the status of groundwater systems fig 2 2 2 developing indicators to evaluate groundwater sustainability an index is a statistical measure that shows changes in a variable and indexes are used to express the relative changes in a given parameter appropriate indicators can be used to characterize a situation and identify the factors the may improve the system to aid in decision making and prioritization of decisions and to characterize the system to the community juwana et al 2010 the evaluation of groundwater sustainability includes a process of selecting the index developing the formula for the index and the actual use of the indicators to measure different dimensions in other words groundwater sustainability indicators are defined as measurable variables that provide comprehensible information about the groundwater system and are therefore useful tools to measure capture and evaluate the sustainability of natural resources steinman 2007 gordon 2011 it should be noted that indexes are used to characterize the problem over time period of operation but are not used to solve problems each indicator describes a specific aspect of groundwater systems the groundwater indicators proposed here are based on measurable and observable data and provide information on the quantity and quality of groundwater resources current situation and trends in addition they focus on social groundwater access operation and use economic groundwater abstraction and conservation requirements environmental groundwater vulnerability discharge and pollution and political aspects of groundwater management liverman et al 1988 defined the following characteristics for selecting indicators sensitive to time changes a reliable indicator should be observable over a specified time series of data otherwise the index will not be able to provide information on how the factors related to the index change over time sensitive to spatial changes an index must reflect spatial changes otherwise it will not be useful to measure specific conditions predictability due to changes in sustainability over time reliable indicators should be able to predict adverse conditions have reference values or thresholds no personal bias bias in choosing sustainability indicators may occur for a variety of reasons such as the knowledge of the developer or political interests ability to convert information in most indicators raw data cannot be used therefore data conversion or calculations are required to obtain a numerical value for the index it is thus important to use the right method to convert the data into a meaningful indicator ability to integrate it is important to integrate or combine indicators in order to detect signs of instability indicators can only be merged if they have the same unit and several methods are available to unify units depending on the nature of the data and the purpose of index development nardo et al 2005 in choosing the method particular attention and careful analysis are required because different methods may produce different results ebert and welsch 2004 in the present study we used a classification scale method to integrate the indicators the scale was defined with quantitative values from 1 to 5 and qualitative categories such as very good good or poor this method can be used to assign scores for indicators that do not generate quantitative data to calculate the score for each quantitative indicator the classification scale method used a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 100 and qualitative indicators were scored with five categories other criteria used to select an index are scientific validity along with knowledge of the system under study ability to meet system requirements reliability and relevance sensitivity to environmental changes and human activities comparability and understandability geographical coverage and cost effectiveness mimam 2000 2 3 quantitative hydrogeological indicators defining quantitative indicators to evaluate groundwater sustainability and provide detailed information about the present state and trends in groundwater characteristics can be helpful to 1 analyze human impacts on groundwater systems in space and time 2 improve and or enhance the groundwater management capability of policymakers and managers 3 compare local management policies adopted for groundwater resources across different areas and aquifers and 4 facilitate public participation in groundwater resource planning and policy the seven indicators calculated in the category of quantitative hydrogeological indicators are presented in table 1 these indicators include renewable groundwater volume per capita igwr groundwater abstraction and recharge index iab r index of total abstraction ratio to total exploitable groundwater resources iab e groundwater share index in water supply for all uses igws index of change in groundwater storage i δ h i index of change in groundwater storage between two periods iδh1 2 and the water level trend index in observation wells isv for all indicators a score of 100 indicates maximum sustainability while a score of 0 indicates unstable status 2 4 qualitative hydrogeological indicators groundwater quality indicators characterize the current status and trends in groundwater quality and can be used to identify challenges in groundwater quality in time and space different indicators may be based on drinking water standards irrigation needs industrial use and other factors a quality index can also be developed for specific conditions of natural pollution these indicators also make it possible to identify processes that lead to groundwater pollution the indicators used here for qualitative hydrogeological factors are presented in table 2 and these three indicators include index of change in groundwater quality in a study period iq index of change in groundwater quality compared to short term and long term periods i δ q and electrical conductivity ec index 2 5 environmental indicators because of the effect of water on environmental factors the study of these factors plays an important role in achieving sustainable development of water resources given the importance of environmental sustainability this concept is quantified by indicators of water resource sustainability pressure on the environment has been evaluated based on variations in the area of the basin used for agriculture and variations in the resident population throughout the study period since according to hunsaker and levine 1995 the proportions of urban and agricultural areas correlate with the quality of the resources population growth is one crucial element affecting the long term sustainability of water resources the indicators used here for the environmental dimension are presented in table 3 these six environmental indicators include groundwater drought index gri groundwater resource vulnerability index iv stress index is index of average changes in the level of agricultural areas and urban population ivap percent of basin area under natural vegetation iav and index of non conventional water resource supply in the study area inc relative to conventional water resources in the study period 2 6 social indicators groundwater plays a key role in providing public water resources around the world so attention to social dimensions and examining the impact of water on social factors are key issues in sustainable groundwater management and play an important role in achieving sustainable development given the importance of sustainable development quantification of this concept with indicators of sustainable water resource management should take social considerations into account bui et al 2018 indicators of social sustainability depend on the status of the study area and may differ according to the nature and requirements of the local community mckenzie 2004 so these indicators should be selected in light of current social problems related to groundwater in the local community the indicators used in the present study for the social dimension are presented in table 4 and include index of population dependence on groundwater idp index of change in human development index hdi during the study period i δ hdi and index of change in hdi education during the study period i h d i e 2 7 economic indicators the concept of acting locally but thinking globally has been critically emphasized for any economic sector to ensure sustainable development in communities cities and countries water resource development is currently receiving more attention from both researchers and practitioners worldwide because ensuring safe and affordable drinking water for all is one of the universal targets among the 17 united nations sustainable development goals united united nations 2017 the present study used two indicators to assess the sustainability of groundwater resources from an economic perspective change in hdi income during the study period ihdi income and management expenditure index ii table 5 2 8 policy indicators this section classifies policies from poor 0 to excellent 100 if appropriate water management policies have been developed but not yet implemented or adapted an average score of 50 was assigned senent aparicio et al 2015 the indicator calculated in this category is presented in table 6 2 9 integration of different indicators there are several tools to integate results in the assessment of water resource sustainability one of which is the combination and integration of different dimensions of sustainability indicators into a single index to provide aggregated and targeted information for groundwater planning policy making and management the resulting index is dimensionless and various weighting and ranking systems can be used to construct it this approach facilitates the presentation and communication of research results in a concise manner one way to integrate indicators is to consider variable weights for each indicator in this method the final value in the stability assessment is obtained with the following formulas cwsi 2007 bui et al 2016 1 i i wsubi ij subi ij 2 i f wi i i i 3 0 wsubi ij wi i 1 wsubiij is the weight of index j in subset i these subsets refer to indicators in each set of hydrogeological environmental social economic and political indexes subiij is the value of index j in subset i ii is the stability index in the whole subset of i and if is the final sustainability assessment index among the methods to calculate the weight of indexes in the above formulas are the shannon entropy model shannon 1948 and the ahp approach bui et al 2016 bui et al 2017 2018 both of which are described below 2 9 1 shannon entropy weighting method this weighting method is derived from information theory and was first proposed by shannon in 1984 shannon 1948 as one of the most important quantitative decision making techniques that can be used in group and non group decision making the shannon entropy weighting technique is straightforward precise and practical and allows analysts to obtain accurate clear results because project analysts make relevant decisions based on field related experience and knowledge this technique offers them a useful platform this method is based on the presence of information in the decision table so to solve a problem with the entropy method a decision table must first be constructed the steps in the entropy method are as follows shannon 1948 step 1 build a decision matrix for the input as shown as equation 4 in the present study the matrix was built with indicators and weights identified by experts 4 x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x m n step 2 normalize or scale the decision table with a simple normalization method or the arithmetic mean method equation 5 shows the simple normalization method 5 p i j x i j i 1 m x i j step 3 calculate the entropy of each index with equation 6 below in this formula the value of k causes the entropy value of each index to remain between 0 and 1 6 e j k i 1 m p i j l n p i j k 1 l n m step 4 calculate the distance of each index from its entropy value calculated in the previous step this is accomplished with equation 7 below 7 d j 1 e j step 5 calculate the weight of each index with equation 8 8 w j d j d j 2 9 2 analytical hierarchy process approach another way to calculate the weight of an index is the ahp method proposed by saaty 1980 this method allows the problem to be formulated in a multilevel hierarchical structure and makes it possible for managers to examine different scenarios according to the scope of the study in addition it is a powerful flexible method for multicriteria decision making used to solve complex problems at different levels the ahp method combines objective and subjective evaluations into an integrated structure based on scale by pair comparisons and facilitates the organization of key aspects of a problem into a hierarchical framework the advantages of this method are 1 it measures the consistency of decision makers judgments 2 it allows pairwise comparisons in choosing the optimal solution and option and 3 it considers criteria and sub criteria in evaluating different options thus making it possible to identify the best option through pairwise comparisons bui et al 2016 2017 2018 this method is implemented in the following five main steps step 1 modeling the problem and purpose of decision making are determined hierarchically from decision elements that are related to each other the decision elements in the present study include the indicators and the weights assigned to the indicators on the basis of expert opinion step 2 preferential judgment different decision options based on each indicator are compared in this step the decision maker compares the index or options in each level with the element at a higher level in a pairwise approach and calculates their weight the scale in table 7 is usually used to compare options step 3 relative weight calculations the weight and importance of the elements relative to each other are determined through a set of numerical calculations that can be summarized as follows calculate the sum of the numbers in each column of the pairwise comparison matrix and then divide each column by the sum of the numbers in that column the new matrix obtained in this way is called the normalized comparison matrix find the average of the numbers in each row of the normalized comparison matrix this average represents the relative weight of the decision elements corresponding to the rows in the matrix finally to determine the best option multiply the priority weight matrix of the indicators by the weight of the indicators in other words to compare the options the weights of each index are multiplied by the weights of the criteria and the resulting values are added together then the best option is selected according to the terms of different criteria buchanan et al 1999 step 4 integrate relative weights this step produces the final weighting of the indicators step 5 calculate consistency of the judgments almost all ahp calculations are based on the initial judgment of the decision maker in the form of a matrix any errors and inconsistencies in comparing and determining the relative importance of options and indicators will lead to errors in the final results of the calculations the compatibility ratio is used to determine consistency of the judgments and this ratio should be less than 0 1 for the pairwise comparison matrix otherwise the preferential judgments are inconsistent and should be removed 3 results and discussion the methodology described above was applied to data for the salt lake catchment in iran during the period between 2010 and 2020 when data were available because calculations of overall sustainability were based on the results for six different dimensions each of them is presented separately below and the overall sustainability index is then reported and discussed to obtain the data we used to calculate the six dimensions of sustainability and overall sustainability questionnaires were prepared with the shannon entropy and ahp weighting methods for all indicators and were distributed to experts involved in the sustainability project in iran at the water resources management company and to hydrogeological researchers then the results were collected and weighted in all maps presented in this article numbers between 0 and 25 represent unsustainable or low sustainability status red numbers between 25 and 50 show moderate sustainability orange numbers between 50 and 75 represent relatively sustainability yellow and numbers between 75 and 100 indicate high sustainability blue 3 1 quantitative hydrogeological sustainability indicators each of the quantitative indicators was calculated separately and then all indicators were integrated with the shannon entropy and ahp methods to obtain the final value used to estimate environmental sustainability of the aquifers according to both methods the highest weighting was assigned to the renewable groundwater volume per capita index igwr at 28 and the lowest was for the index of water level trend in observation wells isv at 4 the weights obtained for the other indexes were groundwater abstraction and recharge index iab r 17 index of total abstraction ratio to total exploitable groundwater resources iab e 19 groundwater share index in water supply for all uses igws 12 index of change in groundwater storage i δ h i 11 and index of change in groundwater storage in two periods i δ h 1 2 8 the sustainability maps of the study area based on the weighted averages of all quantitative hydrogeological indicators are presented in fig 3 according to both methods most aquifers in the catchment showed low sustainability stability between 0 and 25 in the shannon entropy weighting method damavand daryache namk masileh sharifabad moteh qeydar arak komijan shara block and shazand aquifers showed a stability index between 25 and 50 moderately sustainable status the ahp weighting method produced results that differed little from those with the shannon method and yielded indexes between 25 and 50 moderately sustainable for the nobaran razan qahvand damavand daryache namk masileh sharifabad moteh qeydar arak komijan shara block and shazand aquifers 3 2 qualitative hydrogeological sustainability indicators each of the quality indicators was calculated separately and then all indicators were integrated with the shannon entropy and ahp methods to obtain the final value used to estimate environmental sustainability of the aquifers based on both methods the highest weight was assigned to the ec index iec at 47 followed by the index of change in groundwater quality in short term vs long term periods i δ q at 30 and the index of change in groundwater quality in the study period iq at 23 the qualitative hydrogeological sustainability maps of the aquifers are presented in fig 4 based on the two weighting methods most of the aquifers in the western part of the salt lake catchment showed moderate sustainability with values in the range of 25 50 whereas aquifers in the southeastern part of the basin were in the unstable range values between 0 and 25 there was little difference between the results with the two weighting methods although the ahp method yielded a relatively stable status values between 50 and 75 for the hashtgerd shara shazand and golpayegan aquifers 3 3 environmental sustainability indicators each of the environmental indicators was calculated separately and then all indicators were integrated with the shannon entropy and ahp methods to obtain the final value used to estimate environmental sustainability of the aquifers based on both methods the highest weight was obtained for the groundwater resources vulnerability index iv at 26 and the lowest weight was obtained for the index of non conventional water resources supply in the study area inc at 8 for the rest of indicators the weights were groundwater drought index gri 20 stress index is 17 index of average changes in the level of agricultural areas and urban population ivap 20 and percent of basin area under natural vegetation iav 9 the sustainability maps of the aquifers based on the average weights of all environmental indicators are presented in fig 5 according to both weighting methods most of the aquifers in the salt lake basin were in the unstable or low stability range between 0 and 25 damavand lavasan tehran karaj hashtgerd abharrood qeydar kaboudar ahang and hamedan bahar aquifers showed moderate sustainability with values between 25 and 50 the only difference between the two maps is that the entropy weighting method for the lavasanat aquifer yielded higher sustainability compared to the ahp method 3 4 social sustainability indicators each of the social indicators was calculated separately and then all indicators were integrated with the shannon entropy and ahp methods to obtain the final value used in our assessment of social sustainability of the aquifers according to both methods mean weighting was the highest for the index of population dependence on groundwater idp at 55 followed by the index of change in hdi during the study period ihdi at 24 and by the index of change in hdi education during the study period ihdi e at 22 the aquifer sustainability maps based on the average weights of all sustainability indicators are presented in fig 6 based on both weighting methods most study areas in the salt lake catchment were classified as unstable or poorly sustainable with stability index values ranging from 0 to 25 however qom kahak mahallat delijan tafresh qeydar hamedan bahar and tehran karaj aquifers had a stability index between 25 and 50 indicative of moderate sustainability status 3 5 economic sustainability indicators each of the economic indicators was calculated separately and then all indicators were integrated with the shannon entropy and ahp methods to obtain the final value used to evaluate economic sustainability of the aquifers according to both methods the weight of the index of change in hdi income during the study period ihdi income was 64 and the weight of the management expenditure index ii was 36 according to both methods all aquifers were in the range of moderate sustainability with integrated index values between 25 and 50 3 6 political sustainability indicators this dimension of sustainability of the basin considered the organizational capacity index calculated to yield values ranging from weak 0 to excellent 100 in iran water resource management laws have been passed especially in the field of aquifer balance but they have not yet been implemented or adjusted accordingly an average score of 50 was assigned to all aquifers 3 7 overall sustainability considering six dimensions this section reports and discuses the integration of quantitative and qualitative hydrogeological environmental economic and social indicators with the shannon entropy weight averaging and ahp methods to obtain an overall sustainability index for aquifers located in the salt lake catchment according to these two methods the following weights were given to each indicator quantitative index 36 qualitative index 20 environmental index 17 social index 12 economic index 9 and political index 6 the overall sustainability maps of the study area based on the weighted average of all sustainability dimensions obtained with each method are presented in fig 7 the two weighting methods yielded almost the same results the only difference between the two maps is that the ahp method for nobaran aquifer shows higher sustainability than the entropy method according to the maps most study areas in the salt lake catchment are in the low stability range 0 25 in general the eastern part of the basin is less stable than the western part the sustainability maps of this catchment area show the need for rapid management measures to protect groundwater resources overall the present results are consistent with findings reported by hosseini et al 2019 in the hosseini et al 2019 study 13 environmentally related quantitative indicators were used to assess groundwater sustainability in an arid region with appropriate adaptation depending upon data availability and the relevance of each indicator they developed an integrated environmentally sustainable groundwater management index esgmi based on the weighted aggregation of these 13 indicators through a multicriteria decision making method the values of esgmi ranged between 0 and 100 with a value of 0 denoting the least favorable status i e unsustainable groundwater management and a value of 100 indicating the ideal status i e fully sustainable groundwater management thirty important aquifers across iran were chosen to test the esgmi on a national scale in the country known to be the fifth largest global user of groundwater the esgmi for the 30 aquifers ranged from 15 40 to 68 50 mean 49 96 and thus indicate the unsustainable status of groundwater management in iran hosseini et al 2019 3 8 application of the dpsir conceptual model in a salt lake catchment because of the unstable condition of aquifers located in the salt lake catchment a revised management plan should be implemented in the basin to optimize the management plan we used a dpsir conceptual model in which the new management plan is considered an indicator of the driving force once the proposed scenarios are applied in the model the success rate of the project in terms of sustainability can be determined by recalculating the sustainability indicators under the new scenarios pressure indicators reflect the number of changes applied in the aquifer under the influence of the new scenario while status indicators reflect the physical and chemical status of the study area and impact indicators measure the impact of changes on progress toward achieving aquifer sustainability in a new scenario if the status indicates stability the management options applied can then be considered a suitable option and can be implemented in the study area of course once the new plan is implemented in the study area sustainability should be monitored continuously to ensure that the desired outcomes are maintained if monitoring indicates that the new plan fails to succeed over time the cycle of sustainability assessment followed by development and implementation of a new management plan should be restarted to apply this approach mathematical models should be developed for each of the aquifers located in the salt lake catchment although detailed descriptions of these models were not within the scope of this article two water balance scenarios are described below as examples of how the dpsir approach might be used in future management efforts 3 8 1 impact of a 40 reduction in groundwater abstraction on quantitative hydrogeological indicators the indicators we recalculated in this scenario were groundwater abstraction and recharge index iab r index of total abstraction ratio to total exploitable groundwater resources iab e groundwater share index in water supply for all uses igws index of change in groundwater storage i δ h i and index of change in groundwater storage over two periods iδh1 2 it should be noted that all available indicators in this dimension were used to calculate overall sustainability after this scenario was applied to recalculate iab r and iab e the abstraction rate of all aquifers in the salt lake catchment area was reduced by 40 within the dpsir framework these two indicators reflect the status of the aquifer therefore recalculating these indicators illustrates the effect of implementation of the management scenario on aquifer status to recalculate igws an index based on the amount of groundwater abstraction a 40 reduction in abstraction rate was again assumed in this scenario within the dpsir framework this indicator serves as an index of impact accordingly calculation of this index reflects the effect on the aquifers of implementing the management scenario to recalculate i δ h i the groundwater level in the desired month considering a 40 reduction in abstraction rate was compared to the minimum and maximum water level during the study period 2010 2020 to calculate groundwater level in the 40 reduction scenario the total volume of the aquifer was calculated based on the aquifer area and storage coefficient and then a 40 reduction in groundwater abstraction was used as the volume stored in the aquifer based on the volume formula the increase in water surface after this reduction was calculated then the water level was added to the data for september 2020 and a 40 reduction in water level was considered this index is a reflection of pressure in the dpsir framework in other words calculating this index for this scenario indicates the amount of pressure on the aquifer to recalculate iδh1 2 water level in the short term period from october 2017 to 2020 and the long term period from october 2010 to 2020 was reduced by 40 in the dpsir framework this index is another reflection of pressure on the aquifers calculating this index for this scenario would be predicted to show a decrease in the amount of pressure on the aquifer after recalculating the indexes quantitative hydrogeological indicators in the 40 reduction scenario were merged with the shannon entropy and ahp methods to obtain overall quantitative hydrogeological indicators for the aquifers the sustainability maps of the catchment area based on the weighted average of quantitative hydrogeological indicators are presented in fig 8 according to this index the status of some aquifers changed slightly from unstable to poor stability thus the overall responses of the aquifers to a 40 reduction in groundwater abstraction was not positive 3 8 2 impact of an 80 reduction in groundwater abstraction on quantitative hydrogeological indicators given that application of a management scenario of a 40 reduction in groundwater abstraction had little effect on the quantitative sustainability of the aquifers the dpsir management cycle was repeated in a second management scenario based on an 80 reduction in withdrawals quantitative indicators were calculated again to test the impact of this management strategy on aquifer status and to determine whether it resulted in a reduction in pressure on the aquifers the indexes were recalculated as in the 40 reduction scenario and the results were visualized in fig 9 as overall quantitative sustainability maps according to the two weighting methods the ahp and shannon entropy weighting methods yielded the same results in the scenario of an 80 reduction in groundwater abstraction no aquifer displayed a fully unstable status in terms of quantitative sustainability and aquifers located in the catchment area attained sustainability indexes between 25 and 75 in other words aquifer sustainability improved by about 25 4 conclusion in this study indicators in six dimensions i e quantitative and qualitative hydrogeology environmental social economic and political factors were used to evaluate overall sustainability of aquifers located in the salt lake catchment in iran two methods were used to weight the indicators in each dimension shannon information entropy weighting and the ahp approach to calculate overall stability questionnaires were prepared and distributed to experts involved in the sustainability plan of the water resources management company in iran and to hydrogeological researchers then the results were compiled and weighed the shannon entropy weighting and ahp methods yielded very similar results in our calculations of an overall aquifer sustainability index therefore in future studies the use of one of these methods will suffice integration of all dimensions of sustainability for the aquifers in the salt lake catchment showed low sustainability with overall sustainability values ranging between 0 and 25 sustainability was lower in the eastern part of the basin than the western part the sustainability maps of this catchment area illustrate the need for rapid management measures to protect groundwater resources a potentially important application of the integrated sustainability indicator described here is in evaluating management scenarios and examining their impact on aquifer sustainability within the framework of the dpsir model in the present study the performance of the method in capturing changes in the quantitative sustainability of aquifers was compared in two management scenarios a 40 and 80 reduction in groundwater abstraction the results show that the 40 reduction scenario had little effect on aquifer sustainability whereas the 80 reduction scenario led to an increase of about 25 in aquifer sustainability overall the results of this study demonstrate that the integrated sustainable groundwater management index is a promising tool to determine the current status of groundwater quantity and quality the index is able to demonstrate the effect of policy actions and plans and can contribute to the development and implementation of effective sustainable management policies for groundwater resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
