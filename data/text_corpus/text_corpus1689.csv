8445,study region mediterranean river basins study focus human activities and consequent pollution have put the freshwater and marine ecosystems of the mediterranean region under pressure with high risk of eutrophication phenomena in this study an extended version of the geospatial regression equation for european nutrient losses model green originally developed for estimating nutrient loads from diffuse and point sources in europe was extended to include additional nutrient sources using a grid cell discretization the spatial resolution is 5 arc minute and the model inputs consist of the latest and best available global data new hydrological insights for the region the results of this study show that during 2003 2007 baseline 1 87 tg y of total nitrogen tn 1 22 tg y of nitrates n no3 0 11 tg y of total phosphorus tp and 0 03 tg y of orthophosphate p po4 were discharged in the mediterranean sea the source apportionment analysis showed that the main contributor to total nitrogen and nitrate loads is agriculture followed by natural background while for orthophosphate dominant sources include wastewater and scattered dwellings two scenarios were investigated to assess sustainable water and nutrient management options showing that the reduction of 50 of nitrogen surplus leads to a significant reduction of nitrogen emission in regions characterized by high intensity agriculture while the upgrading of wastewater treatment plants to tertiary level was more efficient for tp reduction keywords nutrients modelling mediterranean sea diffuse and point sources source apportionment 1 introduction the mediterranean sea is the largest and deepest enclosed earth sea and it is bounded on the north by europe on the south by africa and on the east by asia it communicates with the atlantic ocean through the strait of gibraltar and with the black sea through the dardanelles the mediterranean is an oligotrophic well oxygenated sea with naturally low nutrient concentration due to the anti estuarine circulation through the gibraltar strait driven by the excess of net evaporation over precipitation tanhua et al 2013 however human activities and consequent pollution have put the freshwater and marine ecosystems of the mediterranean region under pressure grizzetti et al 2017 liquete et al 2016 here the eutrophication phenomena due to nutrient inputs from land based pollution sources is a major environmental problem and the geographical distribution of eutrophication in the mediterranean sea occurs in densely populated areas characterized by intensive economic activities severe eutrophication has been reported for several coastal areas including the gulf of lions the adriatic northern aegean and the south levantine seas karydis and kitsiou 2012 provided an exhaustive overview of the coastal eutrophication problem in the mediterranean focusing on the connection with public policies of the mediterranean states and discussing the national and international legislation analysing chlorophyll distribution through remote sensing imagery the authors showed that the eastern mediterranean sea was ultraoligotrophic with a nitrate to phosphate ratio greater than 20 identifying this sea as the largest phosphorus limited body of water in the global ocean concrete measures for the environmental protection of the mediterranean sea were taken in 1975 with the barcelona convention and over the last 30 years large scientific efforts focused on characterizing water and contaminant including nutrients discharge in the mediterranean sea detailed nutrient discharges into the mediterranean were provided by ludwig et al 2009 who reconstructed the spatial and temporal variability of sources of freshwater and nutrients in the mediterranean sea based on a review of available data ludwig et al 2010 estimated the water and nutrient fluxes in the period 1970 2000 using the image model bouwman et al 2006 and produced future scenarios at spatial scale of 0 5 0 5 degree bouraoui et al 2010 provided an estimation of water runoff to the mediterranean and its variation from 1980 to 2000 developing a consistent geodatabase suitable for hydrological and water quality modelling using river basins of around 200 km2 grizzetti et al 2012 assessed the nitrogen pressure on surface waters by point and diffuse sources at european scale in the period 1995 2005 providing annual nutrient fluxes of the main european basins that discharge in the mediterranean in addition the global news model seitzinger et al 2010 was tested in the mediterranean region using a grid cell of 0 5 degrees unesco ioc unep 2003 providing annual loads of inorganic nitrogen and total phosphorus to the sea all these studies provide useful information on water and nutrient discharge in the mediterranean sea yet they usually consider only total nitrogen and total phosphorus the key geographic scale is a coarse grid resolution or large river basins and they refer to year 2000 as baseline in addition they are still insufficient in providing a more integrated assessment including food water and environmental synergies and trade offs in a nexus oriented approach biggs et al 2015 in this context our research presents a robust modelling framework for assessing water nutrient pollution in the mediterranean and evaluating the impact of management strategies on water quality in particular our study intends to quantify the more recent nitrogen total nitrogen and nitrate and phosphorus total phosphorus and orthophosphate fluxes to determine the relative importance of different nitrogen and phosphorus sources and to identify hotspots areas of higher pollution where priority actions should focus the main innovative aspect of the work resides in the development of a simple conceptual model green rgrid geospatial regression equation for european nutrient losses extended to global scale in r software environment r core team 2011 that uses global readily available data and that explicitly considers the linkages between crop water and nutrient management impacts on water quality the model offers a robust framework for overcoming the limited availability of water quality monitoring data in the southern part of the mediterranean sea and for evaluating alternative scenarios of nutrient reduction 2 material and method 2 1 the mediterranean area the mediterranean sea covers about 2 5 million km2 with an average water depth of 1 5 km it is commonly divided in 10 sub basins ludwig et al 2009 bouraoui et al 2010 karydis and kitsiou 2012 as shown in fig 1 the western mediterranean sea that comprises the alboran sea alb the north western basin nwe the south western basin swe and the tyrrhenian sea tyr the eastern mediterranean sea that covers the adriatic sea adr and the ionian sea ion the central mediterranean sea cen and the aegean levantine sea that covers the aegean sea aeg the north levantine nle sea and the south levantine sle the drainage area of the mediterranean sea covers more than 5 million of km2 of which 1 million in europe 3 8 million in africa and the rest in asia the largest river basins of the mediterranean sea are the nile egypt rhone france po italy drin buna albania neretva bosnia and herzegovina ebro spain tiber italy adige italy seyhan and ceyhan turkey together they account for about half of the average freshwater input by rivers into the mediterranean sea total water discharge of year 2005 was about 9 8 106 m3 s ludwig et al 2009 climatically the mediterranean is characterized by warm temperatures winter dominated rainfall dry summers and a profusion of microclimates due to local environmental conditions ludwig et al 2003 mean annual temperature follows a marked north to south gradient to which local orographic effects are superimposed the lowest average annual temperatures are found in the higher parts of the alps less than 5 c while average temperatures above 20 c are typical for libya and egypt mean annual precipitation has a general decreasing north to south gradient with orography acting as a naturally modulating factor annual precipitation values of 1500 2000 mm yr 1 and more are reported in the alpine and pyrenean headwater regions of the po the rhone and the ebro rivers ludwig et al 2009 the mediterranean region is covered by 60 of natural areas 22 forest 10 shrub and 27 bare 13 cropland 8 fodder 18 grassland and 3 urban areas and water the main crops are wheat sorghum oil crops maize barley and temperate fruits about 17 of the arable land is irrigated 107 000 km2 you et al 2014 and the average volume of irrigation was 86 109 m3 considering the available years or the nearest to 2003 2007 fao 2016 the most irrigated crops include wheat maize and vegetables 2 2 the green rgrid model the modelling approach used in this study green rgrid is a conceptual statistical regression model that links nutrient inputs to water quality measurements it is an extended version of the geospatial equation for european nutrient losses green developed by grizzetti et al 2005 2012 the original model was inspired by the spatially referenced regressions on watersheds attributes sparrow methodology smith et al 1997 where the river nutrient load is modelled by non liner equations linking nutrient sources and basins attributes grizzetti and bouraoui 2006 bouraoui and grizzetti 2014 green rgrid runs on an annual basis on a grid cell size of 5 min 0 083333 degree about 10 km at the equator and can be used to estimate total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp nitrate n no3 and orthophosphate p po4 the model was written in r r core team 2011 in order to provide a more flexible instrument increasing the reproducibility of the modelling approach and because r is open access widely used programming language green rgrid consists in a simplified conceptual model which distinguishes between two different pathways in nutrient transfer from sources to river outlet nutrients passing through land before reaching the river diffuse source and nutrients delivered directly to water bodies point sources fig 2 diffuse sources include the contributions from fertilization mineral and manure n fixation atmospheric deposition nitrogen background losses and scattered dwelling population not connected to a sewage collecting system point sources include the contributions from urban wastewater treatment plants industries and paved areas diffuse sources transit first through the soil unsaturated and saturated zones before reaching a stream and consequently undergo a preliminary reduction in the soil profile due mostly to the denitrification nitrogen and storage processes once into the streams or water bodies these nutrients are subject to a second reduction due to algae growth atmospheric losses and storage deposition point sources of nitrogen and phosphorus are only retained in streams and lakes the green rgrid considers a routing grid cell structure to establish the emitting receiving grid cell relationship where the upstream nutrient load is added as an additional point source to the receiving downstream grid cell the load at the outlet of a grid cell is expressed as 1 l i sur i s i r i ps i ul i r i 1 res i where l is the annual nutrient load ton y sur is the nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus surplus in the grid cell ton y ps are the point sources ton y ul is the upstream load ton y s r are the soil and river reduction factors in each grid cell dimensionless res is the nutrient retention in lakes reservoirs dimensionless and i represents the grid cell grizzetti et al 2005 investigating the relationship between nitrogen export and different basin characteristics annual precipitation wet season rainfall temperature slope topography river length drainage density annual flow and low flow based on a pearson correlation and principal component analysis identified precipitation as the major descriptor of nitrogen export from the catchment based on this analysis we assumed that the soil reduction factor s is a function of precipitation plus irrigation when present the parameter s is parametrized as exponential decreasing function as follows 2 s i exp α x i where x dimensionless is the inverse of the sum of precipitation and irrigation for each grid cell i normalized by the maximum inverse of the sum of precipitation and irrigation frank and todeschini 1994 over the entire mediterranean area and α dimensionless is a calibration parameter the maximum scaling method was used to avoid negative values of the calibration parameter α grizzetti et al 2005 2012 smith et al 1997 the river retention factor r is a function of the average area specific runoff qs l s km2 and of two calibration parameters a and b both dimensionless that describe the losses in the river network 3 r i 1 1 a q s i b finally the retention in lakes and reservoirs res is expressed as 4 res i 1 1 n h l i c where hl is the hydraulic load m and c dimensionless is a calibration parameter and n is a fixed coefficient retrieved from behrendt et al 2003 the specific runoff of rivers and the hydraulic load of lakes were calculated using the annual discharge retrieved from the daily time series m3 s simulated for the period 2000 2014 by the lisflood model van der knijff et al 2010 in particular the specific runoff was calculated as the ratio between the annual discharge and the upstream area of each grid cell while the hydraulic load was calculated as the ratio of the streamflow outputs of a lake and its area 2 3 the inputs of the model the application of the green rgrid model requires four basic sets of information for the model parametrization and calibration river basin spatial discretization and water routing structure including lakes location and characteristics spatial agronomic hydrologic and climatic characteristics spatial information on diffuse and point sources of nitrogen and phosphorus measurements of nutrient loads in surface water these inputs were developed from data readily available at global scale extracting the mediterranean region for the current application 2 3 1 spatial discretization and water routing structure a global river network and routing structure with 5 arc minute resolution was developed following a procedure described by olivera et al 2002 the procedure consists in extracting low resolution i e 5 min river networks using a high resolution flow accumulation i e 30 s for applying this procedure the near global hydrosheds datasets at 30 s of resolution hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales lehner et al 2008 was used the hydrosheds is based on the nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm and provides at various spatial resolution 3 15 and 30 arc seconds layers of void filled dem flow direction flow accumulation river network and drainage river basins covering up to 60 degrees north and south of the globe the flow direction with 5 arc minute resolution was subsequently defined based on the 30 s flow direction associated to the 30 s flow accumulation in areas not covered by hydrosheds we approximated the flow accumulation and flow direction at 5 min with those used by the hydrological lisflood model van der knijff et al 2010 subsequently the basins and the river network were created in arcgis using the upscaled flow direction at 5 min the river network was then checked comparing the drainage area of the basins of hydrosheds and lisflood model at global scale the global structure that resulted from this process includes 2 158 178 grid cells and 82 792 river basins with outlet to the sea for the mediterranean area the spatial discretization resulted in 64 148 grid cells and 1770 river basins of which 550 included more than 5 grid cells drainage area larger than 270 km2 this is in complete agreement with sadaoui et al 2018 who using the same original dem but a different watershed delineation approach also discretized the mediterranean drainage area into 550 watersheds the remaining basins are single grid cells or small river basins that represent coastal river basins that are very important hotspot areas characterized by high population density the global hydrolakes database messager et al 2016 was used in this study for positioning the lakes natural lakes and reservoirs on the river network one single lake was included in each grid cell and the area of the lakes provided by the hydrolake dataset was considered in the calculation of the lake retention in the mediterranean area 671 lakes were included for a total surface area of 97 500 km2 2 3 2 agronomic hydrologic and climatic characteristics the model green rgrid uses annual precipitation and irrigation as proxies for the basin retention of nitrogen and only precipitation for phosphorus the spatial information on annual precipitation from 2000 to 2014 was obtained from the global historic precipitation dataset mswep beck et al 2017 the mswep dataset consists of a global high resolution gridded dataset 0 25 degrees of precipitation obtained by merging satellite information with reanalysis data the annual irrigation mm spatialized at 5 min grid cell level was defined based on a downscaling procedure using the net irrigation volume m3 reported at country level by aquastat fao 2016 the irrigated area in each cell retrieved from spam you et al 2014 and the difference between the potential evapotranspiration pet and precipitation pcp in particular the annual potential evapotranspiration was estimated as a function of annual temperature according to langbein 1949 5 pet i 325 21 t i 0 9 t i 2 where pet is the potential evapotranspiration in mm y of year i and t is the average annual temperature c of year i retrieved from dee et al 2011 the consumptive water use of irrigation is defined as the volume of water needed to compensate for the deficit between potential evapotranspiration and effective precipitation over the crop growing period the net irrigation volume at country level was thus spatialized based on the distribution of the difference pet pcp in irrigated cells the spam model provides for 42 crops and four levels of agriculture intensification the crop specific physical area harvest area sum of areas considering multiple harvest in a year yield and production product of yield and harvest area data are available for the year 2005 average of 3 years centered on 2005 for four production systems including irrigated high inputs production rainfed high inputs production rainfed low inputs production rainfed subsistence production you et al 2014 the crops used in spam are described in table s1 the sum of the areas of all irrigated crops within each grid cell provided the irrigated area of the cell 2 3 3 nutrient inputs from diffuse and point sources information on nutrient sources at high spatial resolution is difficult to retrieve or is only partially available at large scale grizzetti et al 2011 for this reason we developed global spatially explicit layers at 5 min resolution of n and p pressures from anthropogenic and natural sources using the most recent available global spatial datasets for year 2005 these high spatial resolution nutrient inputs are described in detail and in this study we provide a synthesis 2 3 3 1 landuse a landuse dataset was created in order to spatialize the nutrient inputs from agricultural urbanized and natural areas the globcover 2009 map arino et al 2008 was used to define 10 classes of land cover cropland fodder grassland forest shrub bare urban area water sea and snow the extent of the class cropland was constrained using the information of the spatial production allocation model spam you et al 2014 at 5 min resolution the class fodder was obtained as the areal difference between the aggregated classes of globcover representative of cropland and the spam cropland cropland includes permanent and non permanent irrigated and rainfed crops and fodder forest bare and shrub are considered natural areas while urban areas water sea and snow are considered together as other areas 2 3 3 2 diffuse sources the diffuse sources of n and p considered in this study include nitrogen and phosphorus surplus on cropland and grassland areas atmospheric deposition in natural areas natural background nutrient transported via erosion nutrient in washoff phosphorus weathering and scattered dwellings people not connected to a wastewater collecting system the cropland and fodder nitrogen and phosphorus surpluses were calculated as the difference between the sum of mineral and manure fertilizers plant fixation only for nitrogen atmospheric deposition only for nitrogen and nutrient uptake by crops and fodder the nutrient surplus in grassland areas was calculated as the difference between the sum of mineral and manure fertilizers atmospheric deposition only for nitrogen and a 60 of all nutrient inputs bouwman et al 2005 the n and p mineral fertilizers on cropland at 5 min resolution were obtained by downscaling the total amount of net mineral fertilizers available at country scale from faostat faostat 2016a for the year 2005 using the spatial distribution of nutrient crop uptake estimated at grid cell level the total net amount of n fertilizer by country was calculated as the difference between the gross mineral fertilizers and the total gaseous losses the gaseous losses of nitrogen were estimated using the emission factor nh3 losses of n content reported in bouwman et al 1997 and faostat factors faostat 2016b a portion of the total fertilization was applied on grassland using the percentages provided by lassaletta et al 2014 we distributed the national net mineral fertilizers in each grid cell on non leguminous crops based on the nitrogen content of the yield and on fodder based on the deficit between nitrogen fixation and nitrogen uptake the remaining fertilizer non applied on crop or fodder was distributed uniformly on grassland areas crop uptake was estimated at grid cell as the product of dry yield fresh yield reduced using coefficients of crop moisture content from the epic model williams 1995 and the nitrogen and phosphorus contents of each crop retrieved from the swat model database neitsch et al 2010 the wet yields of fodg were retrieved from faostat at country level and then converted in dry yields using the moisture content given in table s1 the nitrogen and phosphorus uptake in grassland was calculated as a 60 of all nutrients inputs bouwman et al 2005 the nitrogen fixation for each crop was calculated as the product of the specific nitrogen fixation amount in kg n ha retrieved from literature and the total harvest area of each crop in addition we assumed a specific nitrogen fixation of 65 kg ha and 4 kg ha for fodder and grassland respectively the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus available in animal manure was computed by multiplying the number of animals by category retrieved from faostat 2016c by the excretion coefficients by animal category kg n or p head y obtained from faostat faostat 2016d this approach is similar to that proposed by bouwman et al 2013 and liu et al 2010 we have taken into account the nh3 n2o and no gaseous losses during excretion using specific volatilization rates of different livestock categories reported in bouwman et al 1997 and faostat faostat 2016e the national total amount of stables and meadows manure was distributed on different landcover classes using specific manure application limits nitrogen atmospheric deposition was retrieved from global rasters of 1 degree resolution from the world data centre for precipitation chemistry web site http wdcpc org the distribution of total nitrogen deposition between the landcover classes in each grid cell was proportional to the area of each class the phosphorus release from weathering was calculated based on the lithological map glim hartmann and moosdorf 2012 that provides 16 lithological classes for the whole globe assigning values of specific p release kg p km2 y for each of the classes as described in hartmann et al 2014 the total value of p release at 5 min grid cell was obtained summing the p release obtained for each lithological class present in each grid cell nutrient emissions from built up areas washoff were calculated at grid cell level as the product of urban population and the specific n and p emission for inhabitant proposed by de wit 2000 n and p emissions via erosion into surface waters were calculated as the product of three factors i soil erosion loss ton y ii nutrient content in the top soil and iii sediment delivery ratio in particular soil erosion loss was estimated for the period 2000 2014 using the modified rusle model renard et al 1997 2 3 3 3 point sources nutrient inputs produced by human settlements connected to sewers wastewater treatment plants industries and paved areas were considered as point sources hereafter wwtp in the model and were estimated taking into account urban and rural population emission rates per person the percentage of urban and rural population connected to wastewater treatment plants and their treatment level the methodology to define these nutrient specific emissions from points sources kg person at grid cell level consisted in determining the nutrient point sources at country level and then to downscale them using population density as spatial proxy the product of nutrient specific emission the connected population and the treatment level efficiency resulted in the gridded point sources map at 5 min we distinguish the rural and urban population inside each grid cell using the ghsl datasets dijkstra and poelmann 2014 available for year 2015 at resolution of 1 km the original data was rescaled for the year 2005 using the faostat population values faostat 2016f specific domestic emissions were estimated according to the methodology described by grizzetti et al 2012 considering human protein intake the percentage of food waste the connection rates and the urban and rural population point source emissions from industries were estimated as 15 of human emissions as suggested by morée et al 2013 while phosphorus from detergents was calculated based on a relationship between stp sodium tri phosphate detergents consumed by selected countries and the gdp gross domestic product for year 2005 people not connected to a sewage collecting system were considered as scattered dwellings and their emissions were added to the pool of diffuse nutrient inputs a summary of the major inputs used by the model for the major river basins discharging into the mediterranean sea is given in tables 1 and 2 for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively 2 3 4 monitoring network times series of annual loads of nitrate orthophosphate total nitrogen and total phosphorus are needed for the calibration of the model green rgrid we collected time series of daily and annual nutrient concentrations from different sources for the period 2000 2014 at global scale we retrieved annual data from the gems water data center meybeck and ragu 1997 at european scale the data provided by the european environmental agency waterbase 2016 and the jrc internal database were used grizzetti et al 2012 other water quality data usually average annual data were retrieved directly from literature in particular for northern african countries aissaoui 2013 guasmi et al 2012 merzoug and merazing 2012 taybi et al 2016 brahimi et al 2014 makhoukh et al 2011 the final monitoring dataset for the period 2003 2007 consists in about 500 monitoring points fig 1 with 1661 1077 1367 and 1085 data entries of annual concentration of n no3 tn p po4 and tp respectively for northern african countries and turkey we managed to collect 9 values of annual nitrate concentration and 4 values for orthophosphate albeit the efforts in collecting monitoring data these monitoring stations resulted limited in space covering mainly the rhone river basin with around 28 of all measurements the po with 15 of tp and tn observations and the ebro with around 28 of n no3 and p po4 measurements the nile river is the largest ungauged basin in the mediterranean similar problems of limited availability of water quality data were reported by ludwig et al 2009 during their assessment of nutrient discharge into the mediterranean sea however it must be stressed that the data collected in this study is significantly richer than that used by ludwig et al 2009 who limited their data collection at the outlets of the major rivers the daily time series of tn tp n no3 and p po4 were considered only if at least 8 values per year were available in addition when total nitrogen was not available it was calculated as the sum of total kjeldahl nitrogen nitrates and nitrites finally we checked that for any specific monitoring point and for any specific period the values of n no3 and p po4 were lower than tn and tp respectively the annual concentration was then converted to annual load multiplying the concentration with the flow obtained from lisflood van der knijff et al 2010 2 4 calibration method and extrapolation the model runs on an annual basis and it was calibrated using a sequential approach we first calibrated n no3 then we calibrated the difference between tn and n no3 load as estimated in the previous calibration similarly we calibrated p po4 and then the difference between tp and p po4 imposing the calibrated p po4 load this procedure was followed to ensure consistency between the estimation of the total nutrient loads and their various components the calibration of the model was performed for the period 2003 2007 using a latin hypercube algorithm only the basins with available monitoring data were selected during the calibration the calibration of the nutrient components was performed finding the optimal values of model parameters using the ideal point error ipe approach that is a dimensionless composite index that measures model performance with respect to an ideal point in a n dimensional space where n is the number of model performance evaluation metrics employed an ipe value of zero corresponds to a perfect ideal point our ipe index integrates five popular metrics and is defined as follows 6 i p e 0 2 r m s e max r m s e 2 n s e 1 min n s e 1 2 b r 2 1 min b r 2 1 2 1 r s r max r s r min r s r max r s r 2 1 a b s p b i a s max a b s p b i a s min abspbias max abspbias 2 0 5 where rmse is the root mean square error the nse is the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 br 2 is the coefficient of determination r 2 multiplied by the slope of the regression line between simulated and observed rsr is the ratio of the rmse between simulated and observed values and the standard deviation of the observations and pbias is the percent bias between simulated and observed values these statistics were also used to investigate the robustness of the model calibration in addition to graphical plots of the predicted versus measured loads showing the agreement between measurement and model estimations the coefficient of determination r 2 multiplied by the slope of the regression line between simulated and observed br 2 indicates the degree of linear relationship between simulated and observed data a br 2 value close to one indicates a better performance however it is very sensitive to high values the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is a normalized statistic that ranges from to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match nse tends to give more importance to higher values and lesser importance to lower values legates and mccabe 1999 percent bias pbias is an error index that calculates the average tendency of the simulated data to be either larger or smaller than their observed counterparts with zero indicating the optimal value gupta et al 1999 positive values indicate overestimation bias whereas negative values indicate model underestimation bias zambrano bigiarini 2017 rsr combines the feature of an error index rmse and a normalization factor so that it can be applied to various constituents moriasi et al 2007 rsr ranges from the optimal value of 0 to infinity with smaller values indicating a better fit the ipe was adjusted to give a major weight to the three river basins where more data were available po rhone and ebro we defined thus the ipew as follows 7 ipew ipe group ipe po ipe rhone ipe ebro 1 4 where ipegroup was calculated considering all the basins with data excluding the po rhone and ebro the calibration was performed considering all the available data due to the limited number of measurements in north africa the procedure was organized according to the following steps a calibration of n no3 and tn estimate the load of nitrate originating from atmospheric deposition in natural areas in basins with fraction of natural areas forest bare shrub greater than 50 this fraction is identified with the parameter η 1000 runs were performed the optimal value was found calculating the ipe based on the comparison between the annual observed and simulated n no3 loads using the calibrated η for n no3 estimate the optimal α eq 2 a eq 3 b eq 3 and c eq 4 for n no3 in all basins with available observed loads 1000 runs were performed the optimal values were found calculating the ipew based on the comparison between the annual observed and simulated n no3 loads using the previous calibrated dataset for n no3 η α a b and c estimate the optimal η for tn in the basins with fraction of natural areas forest bare shrub greater than 50 1000 runs were performed the optimal value was found calculating the ipe based on the comparison between the annual observed and simulated tn loads using the calibrated η for tn estimate the optimal a b and c for tn minus n no3 previously calibrated in all basins with data available 1000 runs were performed the optimal values were found calculating the ipew based on the comparison between the annual observed and simulated tn loads b calibration of p po4 and tp estimate the optimal α a b and c for p po4 in all basins with data available 1000 runs were performed the optimal values were found calculating the ipew based on the comparison between the annual observed and simulated p po4 loads using the previous calibrated dataset for p po4 estimate the optimal α a b and c for tp minus p po4 in all basins with data available 1000 runs were performed the optimal values were found calculating the ipew based on the comparison between the annual observed and simulated tp loads finally the parameter values obtained during the calibration were used to extrapolate the model estimation in all the grid cells of the mediterranean region due to the limited data availability all monitoring data was used during the calibration process so the model could not be validated it must be stressed that the modelled results obtained in the southern basins should be interpreted with care because of the scarcity of monitoring data these results could be significantly improved with the development of effective monitoring programmes to track improvement of water quality metcalfe et al 2017 finally it must be pointed out that the calibrated parameter set is unique for the whole mediterranean but the retention factors are specific to a grid cell since we use in equations 2 to 5 the precipitation and irrigation amount as well as the discharge specific to each cell 2 5 sensitivity analysis of model parameters the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters was assessed using dotty plots these are plots of parameter values of relative changes versus the objective function ipew the main purpose of these graphs is to show the distribution of the sampling points as well as to give an idea of the parameter sensitivity they have the advantage to help identifying the most appropriate range to achieve the highest performance and thus reducing the uncertainty in model prediction in addition the sensitivity of each parameter with respect to the others was assessed relating the randomly generated parameters latin hypercube against the objective function value as follows 8 g μ i 1 m β i b i where g is the objective function b is the parameter μ and β are the coefficients of regression and m is the number of simulations the t value and the significance level of each parameter were used to identify the relative significance of each parameter b i 2 6 management strategies and scenarios of nutrient reduction quantifying the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus discharged to the coastal waters and the identification of their sources in the river basin is crucial to plan management strategies for the protection of coastal ecosystems and their services the modelling framework presented in this study allows quantifying nutrient fluxes to the sea considering the contribution of natural processes and different sources such as agriculture domestic and industries in particular nitrogen and phosphorus losses in soil rivers and lakes are estimated capturing all natural processes responsible for nutrient retention in the river basin in addition the contribution of different sectoral sources is investigated to identify efficient and targeted nutrient reduction strategies two scenarios of nutrient control were investigated nutrient surplus reduction by 50 s1 and improvement of wwtp treatment efficiency assuming that all wastewater is treated to the tertiary level s2 s1 consists in the reduction of the nutrient surplus in each grid cell in the mediterranean region and thus it is assumed that crop yield is not affected as all crops still receive fertilizers in excess of their requirements s2 increases where possible the treatment efficiency at the tertiary level this is expected to have high impact in the southern part of the mediterranean sea where a large portion of the collected wastewater is discharged directly into the sea without any treatment powley et al 2016 3 results 3 1 results of the model calibration the final results were obtained after the application of the sensitivity analysis the analysis of the dotty plots for each parameter of the calibrated variables has allowed reducing the ranges of sampling thus reducing the uncertainty in the estimation of the optimal parameter values table 3 shows the reduced ranges with respect to their initial values and the optimal parameters obtained after calibration the relative sensitivity analysis of the parameters for each variable table 4 showed that the most sensitive parameters for nitrates total phosphorus are a and b which are related to river retention while orthophosphate and total nitrogen are mostly controlled by α and c which are related to soil and lake retention the model calibration yielded results in good agreement with the measured data for each of the calibrated variables fig 3 and table 5 the calibration of nitrate resulted better than the calibration of phosphorus due to the higher mobility of n in water compared to p and the complex chemical properties of p in natural waters jarvie et al 2002 the nash sutcliffe efficiency is good for all determinands the analysis of the pbias indicates that the model tends to overestimate tn and tp and slightly underestimate n no3 and p po4 this was observed also in grizzetti et al 2008 a similar trend is found in the african and asian basins 3 2 the nutrient fluxes in the mediterranean sea for the period 2003 2007 we estimated that on average 1 87 tg y of tn 1 22 tg y of n no3 0 11 tg y of tp and 0 03 tg y of p po4 are discharged into the mediterranean sea the nile po rhone and ebro were the main river basins that contribute to the nutrient discharge in the mediterranean sea figs 4 and 5 tables 1 and 2 we estimated that n no3 tn and p po4 tp ratios were respectively around 0 65 and 0 27 these ratios are in good agreement with the studies of ludwig et al 2009 and turner et al 2003 hotspots of high biological productivity and eutrophication originating from anthropogenic nutrient inputs are present in coastal areas in the south levantine sle adriatic sea adr north west mediterranean new and aegean sea aeg they correspond to the influence of large rivers including the nile the po the rhone and the ebro and the northern greece s rivers respectively map 2017 macias et al 2018a these hotspots are clearly detected by our model simulation of tn and tp loads and in particular of n no3 and p po4 fluxes fig 6 which represent the major anthropogenic components of nutrient export to coastal waters in particular the south levantine sle and the adriatic adr received about 0 83 tg y of n no3 and 0 016 tg of p po4 nitrate is the dominant component of tn in all parts of the mediterranean sea while orthophosphate ranged from 7 to 39 of tp in all the mediterranean sea areas except for the south levantine 67 3 3 nutrient retention fig 7 shows the percentages of nutrient retention and discharged loads into the mediterranean sea these percentages were calculated comparing the sum of retained loads and discharged loads of all basins in the mediterranean area with the total inputs it is noteworthy that more than 80 of total inputs are retained for tn 84 and n no3 81 these percentages increase to more than 95 for p po4 and tp the major part of retention of total nutrient inputs occurs in soils more than 50 of diffuse sources of n no3 tn and p po4 were captured before reaching the river network while around 38 of tp diffuse sources were retained in rivers the retention was estimated around 18 for n no3 25 for tn and 6 for p po4 while the reduction of tp was the highest around 34 lake retention was approximately similar to that obtained for rivers albeit slightly lower for n no3 and tn lake retention was estimated around 13 and 9 respectively the lowest values were obtained for p po4 around 6 while the highest value was for tp 27 these percentages are in the range of those reported in literature for instance romero et al 2016 estimates that n retained in the mediterranean basins of the iberian peninsula is around 87 3 4 source apportionment nitrogen surplus in cropland and fodder constitutes the dominant source of nitrate 48 and total nitrogen 37 discharged into the sea followed by natural background with 32 and 22 respectively phosphate loads are mainly composed by discharge from wastewater treatment plants 48 and by scattered dwellings 19 fig 8 for total phosphorus agriculture and discharge from wastewater treatment plants have the highest contributions 24 and 20 respectively however the influence of erosion of arable soils increases the contribution of the agricultural sector to 38 the source apportionment for the whole mediterranean region is mostly controlled by the situation of its main river basins including the nile po ebro and rhone river basins in these areas the actions to reduce nitrogen should focus on cropland and grassland and phosphorus needs also to be kept under control as it might be rapidly recycled from water sediments garnier et al 2010 therefore the control of both nitrogen and phosphorus is necessary to reduce eutrophication in coastal waters also for the complexity of the interactions of the two elements howarth and marino 2006 3 5 potential reduction of nutrient loads in the mediterranean fig 9 shows the comparison between the nutrient reduction for scenarios s1 and s2 with respect to the baseline simulation of total discharged nutrient loads into the mediterranean area in the period 2003 2007 scenario s1 which simulates the reduction of nitrogen surplus on cropland land and grassland and scenario s2 which foresees the improvement of wastewater treatments are examples of actions to address nitrogen and phosphorus reduction in the river basins for the mediterranean basins s1 option could reduce tn by about 22 n no3 by 29 tp by 13 and p po4 of 7 fig 9 scenario s2 leads to a reduction of phosphates by 25 tp by 10 and by less than 5 for n no3 and tn s1 scenario is coherent with a similar scenario detailed in thieu et al 2012 and bouraoui et al 2014 in particular our scenario s1 shows that a 50 decrease of nitrogen surplus on cropland and grassland would entail more than 20 reduction of nitrogen input to coastal waters fig 9 this might appear quite a drastic scenario but it provides a benchmark for the evaluation of impacts for example passy et al 2016 simulated a scenario of 50 reduction of nitrogen input to coastal water in the seine bay in order to observe a drastic reduction of noxious algal blooms in addition even though the nitrogen surplus in european mediterranean countries has already decreased by about 8 from 53 kg n ha in 2005 to 48 kg n ha in 2015 weighted average by country area eurostat 2018 and a strong reduction of nitrogen surplus is still desirable in some regions such as malta cyprus and egypt that have high nitrogen surplus lassaletta et al 2014 4 discussion in the mediterranean sea intensive fishing and changes in primary productivity driven by anthropogenic nutrient pollution have altered the ecosystem and species biodiversity with a reduction in abundance of important fish species and top predators compared to the 50ys piroddi et al 2017 analyses of satellite images of the mediterranean sea over the last 20 years show that chlorophyll concentration which is used as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass to detect eutrophication has been increasing in the south east spanish coast in the ligurian provençal basin and in the rhodes gyre region while it has been decreasing in the north adriatic sea off the rhone river mouth and in the aegean sea the evidence also indicates that eutrophication problems persist in the area of influence of the nile delta colella et al 2016 these trends result from the expansion of urban areas and intensification of fertilizers use in agriculture for example in turkey and egypt faostat 2018 as well as from the implementation of policies to reduce agricultural nutrient pollution or wastewater discharges such as in the rhone and po river basins following the enforcement of the eu nitrates directive 91 676 eec and urban waste water directive 91 271 eec it is clear that socio economic activities in a river basin can affect the amount and forms of nitrogen and phosphorus exported to the coastal waters and can also alter the n p ratio which strongly influences the eutrophication process according to our modelling estimates in the period 2003 2007 the ratio tn tp was 41 19 23 15 in sle adr nwe and aeg respectively while the ratio n no3 p po4 was 55 39 32 38 fig 10 the highest values of n no3 p po4 were observed in ion and sle as these values are higher than the redfield n p ratio of 16 they indicate that phosphorus can act as limiting nutrient for eutrophication which is in line with evidence found in the literature for the mediterranean sea considered generally p limited tanhua et al 2013 in addition for the period 2001 2005 romero et al 2013 reported values of the icep index billen and garnier 2007 at the outlets of the rhone ebro and po rivers indicating a potential risk of eutrophication related to an excess of nitrogen over silica the persistent and widespread eutrophication processes that impact especially enclosed coastal bays in the mediterranean sea resulted in a huge effort in the last half century to control the phenomena understanding the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus discharged to the sea their sources by a given sector and the losses retention in the river basin is crucial to plan management strategies for the protection of coastal ecosystems and their services the modelling framework presented in this study allows quantifying nutrient fluxes to the sea considering the contribution of natural processes and different sources including agriculture and domestic activities the estimations of soils rivers and lakes contribution to the retention of nitrogen and phosphorus forms like those provided in this study fig 7 can help understanding the role of reservoirs soils and river systems in the total removal of nutrients the control of nitrogen and phosphorus losses to waters involves the understanding of the natural processes responsible for nutrient retention in the river basin these processes depend on the mobility of the different nitrogen and phosphorus forms in water they are mediated by the water residence time the climate the action of bacteria denitrification the plants and algae growth and the processes of sedimentation especially in standing waters and in lakes grizzetti et al 2015 maintaining and enhancing natural riparian filters supports nutrient retention processes in the river network viaroli et al 2015 soana et al 2017 while intensification of dams in the mediterranean region can increase retention but at the same time expand nitrogen pollution in aquifers and soils romero et al 2016 in reference to the major challenges that the mediterranean area will face in future years i e intensification of economic activities population increase urban sprawling and climate changes the scenarios s1 and s2 of this study provided significant management options in particular they provide the potential effectiveness of mitigation measures on the various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus it is noteworthy that due to the structure of green rgrid we can assess trade offs scenarios in particular those linked to change of land use and change of irrigated areas and associated impacts on crop production and fertilizer requirements despite the current conflict in syria and the related political instability of some countries of the area economic activities and population are expected to increase in north africa and middle east the expansion of the economic sectors and agriculture may increase water demand by 18 by 2025 mainly in the southern and eastern countries plan bleu 2008 the coastal urban population in the mediterranean is projected to increase by 30 from 2005 to 2025 the increase will take place mainly in urban areas in the eastern and southern coasts of the mediterranean plan bleu 2008 all these aspects could exacerbate the current pressure on the rich and fragile ecosystem that sustains the people and economic activities of the region eea 2015 concurrently in the mediterranean area the climate is expected to be warmer and drier by the end of the century ipcc 2013 this will reduce water availability and affect nutrient cycling in coastal regions the increase of temperature and the change in precipitation patterns could foster the growth of phytoplankton biomass macias et al 2018b as a consequence of the population increase higher direct discharges of nutrient through sewage systems can be expected in the mediterranean coasts under a growing population upgrading wastewater treatment to tertiary level especially for direct discharges into the sea is a necessary measure to protect the marine and coastal environment powley et al 2016 estimated nitrogen and phosphorus wastewater directly discharged by coastal cities into the mediterranean sea their scenario indicates that treating these discharges to tertiary level would be needed to keep pollution in 2050 at the same level of 2003 despite the population increase but it would involve additional costs over 2 billion y our scenario s2 which considers the contribution of wastewater from coastal cities and also from the whole drainage basin shows that a 10 reduction of tp input could be achieved by upgrading the existing wastewater treatment facilities fig 9 this reduction could be up to 30 in the coastal areas of northern african and asian basins such as in the nile and turkish basins where chlorophyll increasing concentrations have been observed colella et al 2016 reducing nitrogen surplus on agricultural soils together with collecting wastewaters and upgrading treatment levels as exemplified by scenarios s1 and s2 in this study are necessary measures to protect the water resources and coastal and marine ecosystems in the mediterranean basin and to ensure the long term sustainability of the economic activities and ecosystem services in the region these measures are also relevant in view of the future climatic and demographic challenges the region will face regarding nutrients in the agriculture water nexus in conclusion the assessment and modelling tool presented in this study have shown how the interlinkage between water and agriculture can be explored considering the basin coastal relationship and nutrient sources and sinks from different sectors in an integrated way making it a valuable tool not only for the mediterranean area but also for all the other seas appendix a

8445,study region mediterranean river basins study focus human activities and consequent pollution have put the freshwater and marine ecosystems of the mediterranean region under pressure with high risk of eutrophication phenomena in this study an extended version of the geospatial regression equation for european nutrient losses model green originally developed for estimating nutrient loads from diffuse and point sources in europe was extended to include additional nutrient sources using a grid cell discretization the spatial resolution is 5 arc minute and the model inputs consist of the latest and best available global data new hydrological insights for the region the results of this study show that during 2003 2007 baseline 1 87 tg y of total nitrogen tn 1 22 tg y of nitrates n no3 0 11 tg y of total phosphorus tp and 0 03 tg y of orthophosphate p po4 were discharged in the mediterranean sea the source apportionment analysis showed that the main contributor to total nitrogen and nitrate loads is agriculture followed by natural background while for orthophosphate dominant sources include wastewater and scattered dwellings two scenarios were investigated to assess sustainable water and nutrient management options showing that the reduction of 50 of nitrogen surplus leads to a significant reduction of nitrogen emission in regions characterized by high intensity agriculture while the upgrading of wastewater treatment plants to tertiary level was more efficient for tp reduction keywords nutrients modelling mediterranean sea diffuse and point sources source apportionment 1 introduction the mediterranean sea is the largest and deepest enclosed earth sea and it is bounded on the north by europe on the south by africa and on the east by asia it communicates with the atlantic ocean through the strait of gibraltar and with the black sea through the dardanelles the mediterranean is an oligotrophic well oxygenated sea with naturally low nutrient concentration due to the anti estuarine circulation through the gibraltar strait driven by the excess of net evaporation over precipitation tanhua et al 2013 however human activities and consequent pollution have put the freshwater and marine ecosystems of the mediterranean region under pressure grizzetti et al 2017 liquete et al 2016 here the eutrophication phenomena due to nutrient inputs from land based pollution sources is a major environmental problem and the geographical distribution of eutrophication in the mediterranean sea occurs in densely populated areas characterized by intensive economic activities severe eutrophication has been reported for several coastal areas including the gulf of lions the adriatic northern aegean and the south levantine seas karydis and kitsiou 2012 provided an exhaustive overview of the coastal eutrophication problem in the mediterranean focusing on the connection with public policies of the mediterranean states and discussing the national and international legislation analysing chlorophyll distribution through remote sensing imagery the authors showed that the eastern mediterranean sea was ultraoligotrophic with a nitrate to phosphate ratio greater than 20 identifying this sea as the largest phosphorus limited body of water in the global ocean concrete measures for the environmental protection of the mediterranean sea were taken in 1975 with the barcelona convention and over the last 30 years large scientific efforts focused on characterizing water and contaminant including nutrients discharge in the mediterranean sea detailed nutrient discharges into the mediterranean were provided by ludwig et al 2009 who reconstructed the spatial and temporal variability of sources of freshwater and nutrients in the mediterranean sea based on a review of available data ludwig et al 2010 estimated the water and nutrient fluxes in the period 1970 2000 using the image model bouwman et al 2006 and produced future scenarios at spatial scale of 0 5 0 5 degree bouraoui et al 2010 provided an estimation of water runoff to the mediterranean and its variation from 1980 to 2000 developing a consistent geodatabase suitable for hydrological and water quality modelling using river basins of around 200 km2 grizzetti et al 2012 assessed the nitrogen pressure on surface waters by point and diffuse sources at european scale in the period 1995 2005 providing annual nutrient fluxes of the main european basins that discharge in the mediterranean in addition the global news model seitzinger et al 2010 was tested in the mediterranean region using a grid cell of 0 5 degrees unesco ioc unep 2003 providing annual loads of inorganic nitrogen and total phosphorus to the sea all these studies provide useful information on water and nutrient discharge in the mediterranean sea yet they usually consider only total nitrogen and total phosphorus the key geographic scale is a coarse grid resolution or large river basins and they refer to year 2000 as baseline in addition they are still insufficient in providing a more integrated assessment including food water and environmental synergies and trade offs in a nexus oriented approach biggs et al 2015 in this context our research presents a robust modelling framework for assessing water nutrient pollution in the mediterranean and evaluating the impact of management strategies on water quality in particular our study intends to quantify the more recent nitrogen total nitrogen and nitrate and phosphorus total phosphorus and orthophosphate fluxes to determine the relative importance of different nitrogen and phosphorus sources and to identify hotspots areas of higher pollution where priority actions should focus the main innovative aspect of the work resides in the development of a simple conceptual model green rgrid geospatial regression equation for european nutrient losses extended to global scale in r software environment r core team 2011 that uses global readily available data and that explicitly considers the linkages between crop water and nutrient management impacts on water quality the model offers a robust framework for overcoming the limited availability of water quality monitoring data in the southern part of the mediterranean sea and for evaluating alternative scenarios of nutrient reduction 2 material and method 2 1 the mediterranean area the mediterranean sea covers about 2 5 million km2 with an average water depth of 1 5 km it is commonly divided in 10 sub basins ludwig et al 2009 bouraoui et al 2010 karydis and kitsiou 2012 as shown in fig 1 the western mediterranean sea that comprises the alboran sea alb the north western basin nwe the south western basin swe and the tyrrhenian sea tyr the eastern mediterranean sea that covers the adriatic sea adr and the ionian sea ion the central mediterranean sea cen and the aegean levantine sea that covers the aegean sea aeg the north levantine nle sea and the south levantine sle the drainage area of the mediterranean sea covers more than 5 million of km2 of which 1 million in europe 3 8 million in africa and the rest in asia the largest river basins of the mediterranean sea are the nile egypt rhone france po italy drin buna albania neretva bosnia and herzegovina ebro spain tiber italy adige italy seyhan and ceyhan turkey together they account for about half of the average freshwater input by rivers into the mediterranean sea total water discharge of year 2005 was about 9 8 106 m3 s ludwig et al 2009 climatically the mediterranean is characterized by warm temperatures winter dominated rainfall dry summers and a profusion of microclimates due to local environmental conditions ludwig et al 2003 mean annual temperature follows a marked north to south gradient to which local orographic effects are superimposed the lowest average annual temperatures are found in the higher parts of the alps less than 5 c while average temperatures above 20 c are typical for libya and egypt mean annual precipitation has a general decreasing north to south gradient with orography acting as a naturally modulating factor annual precipitation values of 1500 2000 mm yr 1 and more are reported in the alpine and pyrenean headwater regions of the po the rhone and the ebro rivers ludwig et al 2009 the mediterranean region is covered by 60 of natural areas 22 forest 10 shrub and 27 bare 13 cropland 8 fodder 18 grassland and 3 urban areas and water the main crops are wheat sorghum oil crops maize barley and temperate fruits about 17 of the arable land is irrigated 107 000 km2 you et al 2014 and the average volume of irrigation was 86 109 m3 considering the available years or the nearest to 2003 2007 fao 2016 the most irrigated crops include wheat maize and vegetables 2 2 the green rgrid model the modelling approach used in this study green rgrid is a conceptual statistical regression model that links nutrient inputs to water quality measurements it is an extended version of the geospatial equation for european nutrient losses green developed by grizzetti et al 2005 2012 the original model was inspired by the spatially referenced regressions on watersheds attributes sparrow methodology smith et al 1997 where the river nutrient load is modelled by non liner equations linking nutrient sources and basins attributes grizzetti and bouraoui 2006 bouraoui and grizzetti 2014 green rgrid runs on an annual basis on a grid cell size of 5 min 0 083333 degree about 10 km at the equator and can be used to estimate total nitrogen tn and phosphorus tp nitrate n no3 and orthophosphate p po4 the model was written in r r core team 2011 in order to provide a more flexible instrument increasing the reproducibility of the modelling approach and because r is open access widely used programming language green rgrid consists in a simplified conceptual model which distinguishes between two different pathways in nutrient transfer from sources to river outlet nutrients passing through land before reaching the river diffuse source and nutrients delivered directly to water bodies point sources fig 2 diffuse sources include the contributions from fertilization mineral and manure n fixation atmospheric deposition nitrogen background losses and scattered dwelling population not connected to a sewage collecting system point sources include the contributions from urban wastewater treatment plants industries and paved areas diffuse sources transit first through the soil unsaturated and saturated zones before reaching a stream and consequently undergo a preliminary reduction in the soil profile due mostly to the denitrification nitrogen and storage processes once into the streams or water bodies these nutrients are subject to a second reduction due to algae growth atmospheric losses and storage deposition point sources of nitrogen and phosphorus are only retained in streams and lakes the green rgrid considers a routing grid cell structure to establish the emitting receiving grid cell relationship where the upstream nutrient load is added as an additional point source to the receiving downstream grid cell the load at the outlet of a grid cell is expressed as 1 l i sur i s i r i ps i ul i r i 1 res i where l is the annual nutrient load ton y sur is the nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus surplus in the grid cell ton y ps are the point sources ton y ul is the upstream load ton y s r are the soil and river reduction factors in each grid cell dimensionless res is the nutrient retention in lakes reservoirs dimensionless and i represents the grid cell grizzetti et al 2005 investigating the relationship between nitrogen export and different basin characteristics annual precipitation wet season rainfall temperature slope topography river length drainage density annual flow and low flow based on a pearson correlation and principal component analysis identified precipitation as the major descriptor of nitrogen export from the catchment based on this analysis we assumed that the soil reduction factor s is a function of precipitation plus irrigation when present the parameter s is parametrized as exponential decreasing function as follows 2 s i exp α x i where x dimensionless is the inverse of the sum of precipitation and irrigation for each grid cell i normalized by the maximum inverse of the sum of precipitation and irrigation frank and todeschini 1994 over the entire mediterranean area and α dimensionless is a calibration parameter the maximum scaling method was used to avoid negative values of the calibration parameter α grizzetti et al 2005 2012 smith et al 1997 the river retention factor r is a function of the average area specific runoff qs l s km2 and of two calibration parameters a and b both dimensionless that describe the losses in the river network 3 r i 1 1 a q s i b finally the retention in lakes and reservoirs res is expressed as 4 res i 1 1 n h l i c where hl is the hydraulic load m and c dimensionless is a calibration parameter and n is a fixed coefficient retrieved from behrendt et al 2003 the specific runoff of rivers and the hydraulic load of lakes were calculated using the annual discharge retrieved from the daily time series m3 s simulated for the period 2000 2014 by the lisflood model van der knijff et al 2010 in particular the specific runoff was calculated as the ratio between the annual discharge and the upstream area of each grid cell while the hydraulic load was calculated as the ratio of the streamflow outputs of a lake and its area 2 3 the inputs of the model the application of the green rgrid model requires four basic sets of information for the model parametrization and calibration river basin spatial discretization and water routing structure including lakes location and characteristics spatial agronomic hydrologic and climatic characteristics spatial information on diffuse and point sources of nitrogen and phosphorus measurements of nutrient loads in surface water these inputs were developed from data readily available at global scale extracting the mediterranean region for the current application 2 3 1 spatial discretization and water routing structure a global river network and routing structure with 5 arc minute resolution was developed following a procedure described by olivera et al 2002 the procedure consists in extracting low resolution i e 5 min river networks using a high resolution flow accumulation i e 30 s for applying this procedure the near global hydrosheds datasets at 30 s of resolution hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales lehner et al 2008 was used the hydrosheds is based on the nasa s shuttle radar topography mission srtm and provides at various spatial resolution 3 15 and 30 arc seconds layers of void filled dem flow direction flow accumulation river network and drainage river basins covering up to 60 degrees north and south of the globe the flow direction with 5 arc minute resolution was subsequently defined based on the 30 s flow direction associated to the 30 s flow accumulation in areas not covered by hydrosheds we approximated the flow accumulation and flow direction at 5 min with those used by the hydrological lisflood model van der knijff et al 2010 subsequently the basins and the river network were created in arcgis using the upscaled flow direction at 5 min the river network was then checked comparing the drainage area of the basins of hydrosheds and lisflood model at global scale the global structure that resulted from this process includes 2 158 178 grid cells and 82 792 river basins with outlet to the sea for the mediterranean area the spatial discretization resulted in 64 148 grid cells and 1770 river basins of which 550 included more than 5 grid cells drainage area larger than 270 km2 this is in complete agreement with sadaoui et al 2018 who using the same original dem but a different watershed delineation approach also discretized the mediterranean drainage area into 550 watersheds the remaining basins are single grid cells or small river basins that represent coastal river basins that are very important hotspot areas characterized by high population density the global hydrolakes database messager et al 2016 was used in this study for positioning the lakes natural lakes and reservoirs on the river network one single lake was included in each grid cell and the area of the lakes provided by the hydrolake dataset was considered in the calculation of the lake retention in the mediterranean area 671 lakes were included for a total surface area of 97 500 km2 2 3 2 agronomic hydrologic and climatic characteristics the model green rgrid uses annual precipitation and irrigation as proxies for the basin retention of nitrogen and only precipitation for phosphorus the spatial information on annual precipitation from 2000 to 2014 was obtained from the global historic precipitation dataset mswep beck et al 2017 the mswep dataset consists of a global high resolution gridded dataset 0 25 degrees of precipitation obtained by merging satellite information with reanalysis data the annual irrigation mm spatialized at 5 min grid cell level was defined based on a downscaling procedure using the net irrigation volume m3 reported at country level by aquastat fao 2016 the irrigated area in each cell retrieved from spam you et al 2014 and the difference between the potential evapotranspiration pet and precipitation pcp in particular the annual potential evapotranspiration was estimated as a function of annual temperature according to langbein 1949 5 pet i 325 21 t i 0 9 t i 2 where pet is the potential evapotranspiration in mm y of year i and t is the average annual temperature c of year i retrieved from dee et al 2011 the consumptive water use of irrigation is defined as the volume of water needed to compensate for the deficit between potential evapotranspiration and effective precipitation over the crop growing period the net irrigation volume at country level was thus spatialized based on the distribution of the difference pet pcp in irrigated cells the spam model provides for 42 crops and four levels of agriculture intensification the crop specific physical area harvest area sum of areas considering multiple harvest in a year yield and production product of yield and harvest area data are available for the year 2005 average of 3 years centered on 2005 for four production systems including irrigated high inputs production rainfed high inputs production rainfed low inputs production rainfed subsistence production you et al 2014 the crops used in spam are described in table s1 the sum of the areas of all irrigated crops within each grid cell provided the irrigated area of the cell 2 3 3 nutrient inputs from diffuse and point sources information on nutrient sources at high spatial resolution is difficult to retrieve or is only partially available at large scale grizzetti et al 2011 for this reason we developed global spatially explicit layers at 5 min resolution of n and p pressures from anthropogenic and natural sources using the most recent available global spatial datasets for year 2005 these high spatial resolution nutrient inputs are described in detail and in this study we provide a synthesis 2 3 3 1 landuse a landuse dataset was created in order to spatialize the nutrient inputs from agricultural urbanized and natural areas the globcover 2009 map arino et al 2008 was used to define 10 classes of land cover cropland fodder grassland forest shrub bare urban area water sea and snow the extent of the class cropland was constrained using the information of the spatial production allocation model spam you et al 2014 at 5 min resolution the class fodder was obtained as the areal difference between the aggregated classes of globcover representative of cropland and the spam cropland cropland includes permanent and non permanent irrigated and rainfed crops and fodder forest bare and shrub are considered natural areas while urban areas water sea and snow are considered together as other areas 2 3 3 2 diffuse sources the diffuse sources of n and p considered in this study include nitrogen and phosphorus surplus on cropland and grassland areas atmospheric deposition in natural areas natural background nutrient transported via erosion nutrient in washoff phosphorus weathering and scattered dwellings people not connected to a wastewater collecting system the cropland and fodder nitrogen and phosphorus surpluses were calculated as the difference between the sum of mineral and manure fertilizers plant fixation only for nitrogen atmospheric deposition only for nitrogen and nutrient uptake by crops and fodder the nutrient surplus in grassland areas was calculated as the difference between the sum of mineral and manure fertilizers atmospheric deposition only for nitrogen and a 60 of all nutrient inputs bouwman et al 2005 the n and p mineral fertilizers on cropland at 5 min resolution were obtained by downscaling the total amount of net mineral fertilizers available at country scale from faostat faostat 2016a for the year 2005 using the spatial distribution of nutrient crop uptake estimated at grid cell level the total net amount of n fertilizer by country was calculated as the difference between the gross mineral fertilizers and the total gaseous losses the gaseous losses of nitrogen were estimated using the emission factor nh3 losses of n content reported in bouwman et al 1997 and faostat factors faostat 2016b a portion of the total fertilization was applied on grassland using the percentages provided by lassaletta et al 2014 we distributed the national net mineral fertilizers in each grid cell on non leguminous crops based on the nitrogen content of the yield and on fodder based on the deficit between nitrogen fixation and nitrogen uptake the remaining fertilizer non applied on crop or fodder was distributed uniformly on grassland areas crop uptake was estimated at grid cell as the product of dry yield fresh yield reduced using coefficients of crop moisture content from the epic model williams 1995 and the nitrogen and phosphorus contents of each crop retrieved from the swat model database neitsch et al 2010 the wet yields of fodg were retrieved from faostat at country level and then converted in dry yields using the moisture content given in table s1 the nitrogen and phosphorus uptake in grassland was calculated as a 60 of all nutrients inputs bouwman et al 2005 the nitrogen fixation for each crop was calculated as the product of the specific nitrogen fixation amount in kg n ha retrieved from literature and the total harvest area of each crop in addition we assumed a specific nitrogen fixation of 65 kg ha and 4 kg ha for fodder and grassland respectively the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus available in animal manure was computed by multiplying the number of animals by category retrieved from faostat 2016c by the excretion coefficients by animal category kg n or p head y obtained from faostat faostat 2016d this approach is similar to that proposed by bouwman et al 2013 and liu et al 2010 we have taken into account the nh3 n2o and no gaseous losses during excretion using specific volatilization rates of different livestock categories reported in bouwman et al 1997 and faostat faostat 2016e the national total amount of stables and meadows manure was distributed on different landcover classes using specific manure application limits nitrogen atmospheric deposition was retrieved from global rasters of 1 degree resolution from the world data centre for precipitation chemistry web site http wdcpc org the distribution of total nitrogen deposition between the landcover classes in each grid cell was proportional to the area of each class the phosphorus release from weathering was calculated based on the lithological map glim hartmann and moosdorf 2012 that provides 16 lithological classes for the whole globe assigning values of specific p release kg p km2 y for each of the classes as described in hartmann et al 2014 the total value of p release at 5 min grid cell was obtained summing the p release obtained for each lithological class present in each grid cell nutrient emissions from built up areas washoff were calculated at grid cell level as the product of urban population and the specific n and p emission for inhabitant proposed by de wit 2000 n and p emissions via erosion into surface waters were calculated as the product of three factors i soil erosion loss ton y ii nutrient content in the top soil and iii sediment delivery ratio in particular soil erosion loss was estimated for the period 2000 2014 using the modified rusle model renard et al 1997 2 3 3 3 point sources nutrient inputs produced by human settlements connected to sewers wastewater treatment plants industries and paved areas were considered as point sources hereafter wwtp in the model and were estimated taking into account urban and rural population emission rates per person the percentage of urban and rural population connected to wastewater treatment plants and their treatment level the methodology to define these nutrient specific emissions from points sources kg person at grid cell level consisted in determining the nutrient point sources at country level and then to downscale them using population density as spatial proxy the product of nutrient specific emission the connected population and the treatment level efficiency resulted in the gridded point sources map at 5 min we distinguish the rural and urban population inside each grid cell using the ghsl datasets dijkstra and poelmann 2014 available for year 2015 at resolution of 1 km the original data was rescaled for the year 2005 using the faostat population values faostat 2016f specific domestic emissions were estimated according to the methodology described by grizzetti et al 2012 considering human protein intake the percentage of food waste the connection rates and the urban and rural population point source emissions from industries were estimated as 15 of human emissions as suggested by morée et al 2013 while phosphorus from detergents was calculated based on a relationship between stp sodium tri phosphate detergents consumed by selected countries and the gdp gross domestic product for year 2005 people not connected to a sewage collecting system were considered as scattered dwellings and their emissions were added to the pool of diffuse nutrient inputs a summary of the major inputs used by the model for the major river basins discharging into the mediterranean sea is given in tables 1 and 2 for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively 2 3 4 monitoring network times series of annual loads of nitrate orthophosphate total nitrogen and total phosphorus are needed for the calibration of the model green rgrid we collected time series of daily and annual nutrient concentrations from different sources for the period 2000 2014 at global scale we retrieved annual data from the gems water data center meybeck and ragu 1997 at european scale the data provided by the european environmental agency waterbase 2016 and the jrc internal database were used grizzetti et al 2012 other water quality data usually average annual data were retrieved directly from literature in particular for northern african countries aissaoui 2013 guasmi et al 2012 merzoug and merazing 2012 taybi et al 2016 brahimi et al 2014 makhoukh et al 2011 the final monitoring dataset for the period 2003 2007 consists in about 500 monitoring points fig 1 with 1661 1077 1367 and 1085 data entries of annual concentration of n no3 tn p po4 and tp respectively for northern african countries and turkey we managed to collect 9 values of annual nitrate concentration and 4 values for orthophosphate albeit the efforts in collecting monitoring data these monitoring stations resulted limited in space covering mainly the rhone river basin with around 28 of all measurements the po with 15 of tp and tn observations and the ebro with around 28 of n no3 and p po4 measurements the nile river is the largest ungauged basin in the mediterranean similar problems of limited availability of water quality data were reported by ludwig et al 2009 during their assessment of nutrient discharge into the mediterranean sea however it must be stressed that the data collected in this study is significantly richer than that used by ludwig et al 2009 who limited their data collection at the outlets of the major rivers the daily time series of tn tp n no3 and p po4 were considered only if at least 8 values per year were available in addition when total nitrogen was not available it was calculated as the sum of total kjeldahl nitrogen nitrates and nitrites finally we checked that for any specific monitoring point and for any specific period the values of n no3 and p po4 were lower than tn and tp respectively the annual concentration was then converted to annual load multiplying the concentration with the flow obtained from lisflood van der knijff et al 2010 2 4 calibration method and extrapolation the model runs on an annual basis and it was calibrated using a sequential approach we first calibrated n no3 then we calibrated the difference between tn and n no3 load as estimated in the previous calibration similarly we calibrated p po4 and then the difference between tp and p po4 imposing the calibrated p po4 load this procedure was followed to ensure consistency between the estimation of the total nutrient loads and their various components the calibration of the model was performed for the period 2003 2007 using a latin hypercube algorithm only the basins with available monitoring data were selected during the calibration the calibration of the nutrient components was performed finding the optimal values of model parameters using the ideal point error ipe approach that is a dimensionless composite index that measures model performance with respect to an ideal point in a n dimensional space where n is the number of model performance evaluation metrics employed an ipe value of zero corresponds to a perfect ideal point our ipe index integrates five popular metrics and is defined as follows 6 i p e 0 2 r m s e max r m s e 2 n s e 1 min n s e 1 2 b r 2 1 min b r 2 1 2 1 r s r max r s r min r s r max r s r 2 1 a b s p b i a s max a b s p b i a s min abspbias max abspbias 2 0 5 where rmse is the root mean square error the nse is the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 br 2 is the coefficient of determination r 2 multiplied by the slope of the regression line between simulated and observed rsr is the ratio of the rmse between simulated and observed values and the standard deviation of the observations and pbias is the percent bias between simulated and observed values these statistics were also used to investigate the robustness of the model calibration in addition to graphical plots of the predicted versus measured loads showing the agreement between measurement and model estimations the coefficient of determination r 2 multiplied by the slope of the regression line between simulated and observed br 2 indicates the degree of linear relationship between simulated and observed data a br 2 value close to one indicates a better performance however it is very sensitive to high values the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is a normalized statistic that ranges from to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match nse tends to give more importance to higher values and lesser importance to lower values legates and mccabe 1999 percent bias pbias is an error index that calculates the average tendency of the simulated data to be either larger or smaller than their observed counterparts with zero indicating the optimal value gupta et al 1999 positive values indicate overestimation bias whereas negative values indicate model underestimation bias zambrano bigiarini 2017 rsr combines the feature of an error index rmse and a normalization factor so that it can be applied to various constituents moriasi et al 2007 rsr ranges from the optimal value of 0 to infinity with smaller values indicating a better fit the ipe was adjusted to give a major weight to the three river basins where more data were available po rhone and ebro we defined thus the ipew as follows 7 ipew ipe group ipe po ipe rhone ipe ebro 1 4 where ipegroup was calculated considering all the basins with data excluding the po rhone and ebro the calibration was performed considering all the available data due to the limited number of measurements in north africa the procedure was organized according to the following steps a calibration of n no3 and tn estimate the load of nitrate originating from atmospheric deposition in natural areas in basins with fraction of natural areas forest bare shrub greater than 50 this fraction is identified with the parameter η 1000 runs were performed the optimal value was found calculating the ipe based on the comparison between the annual observed and simulated n no3 loads using the calibrated η for n no3 estimate the optimal α eq 2 a eq 3 b eq 3 and c eq 4 for n no3 in all basins with available observed loads 1000 runs were performed the optimal values were found calculating the ipew based on the comparison between the annual observed and simulated n no3 loads using the previous calibrated dataset for n no3 η α a b and c estimate the optimal η for tn in the basins with fraction of natural areas forest bare shrub greater than 50 1000 runs were performed the optimal value was found calculating the ipe based on the comparison between the annual observed and simulated tn loads using the calibrated η for tn estimate the optimal a b and c for tn minus n no3 previously calibrated in all basins with data available 1000 runs were performed the optimal values were found calculating the ipew based on the comparison between the annual observed and simulated tn loads b calibration of p po4 and tp estimate the optimal α a b and c for p po4 in all basins with data available 1000 runs were performed the optimal values were found calculating the ipew based on the comparison between the annual observed and simulated p po4 loads using the previous calibrated dataset for p po4 estimate the optimal α a b and c for tp minus p po4 in all basins with data available 1000 runs were performed the optimal values were found calculating the ipew based on the comparison between the annual observed and simulated tp loads finally the parameter values obtained during the calibration were used to extrapolate the model estimation in all the grid cells of the mediterranean region due to the limited data availability all monitoring data was used during the calibration process so the model could not be validated it must be stressed that the modelled results obtained in the southern basins should be interpreted with care because of the scarcity of monitoring data these results could be significantly improved with the development of effective monitoring programmes to track improvement of water quality metcalfe et al 2017 finally it must be pointed out that the calibrated parameter set is unique for the whole mediterranean but the retention factors are specific to a grid cell since we use in equations 2 to 5 the precipitation and irrigation amount as well as the discharge specific to each cell 2 5 sensitivity analysis of model parameters the sensitivity analysis of the model parameters was assessed using dotty plots these are plots of parameter values of relative changes versus the objective function ipew the main purpose of these graphs is to show the distribution of the sampling points as well as to give an idea of the parameter sensitivity they have the advantage to help identifying the most appropriate range to achieve the highest performance and thus reducing the uncertainty in model prediction in addition the sensitivity of each parameter with respect to the others was assessed relating the randomly generated parameters latin hypercube against the objective function value as follows 8 g μ i 1 m β i b i where g is the objective function b is the parameter μ and β are the coefficients of regression and m is the number of simulations the t value and the significance level of each parameter were used to identify the relative significance of each parameter b i 2 6 management strategies and scenarios of nutrient reduction quantifying the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus discharged to the coastal waters and the identification of their sources in the river basin is crucial to plan management strategies for the protection of coastal ecosystems and their services the modelling framework presented in this study allows quantifying nutrient fluxes to the sea considering the contribution of natural processes and different sources such as agriculture domestic and industries in particular nitrogen and phosphorus losses in soil rivers and lakes are estimated capturing all natural processes responsible for nutrient retention in the river basin in addition the contribution of different sectoral sources is investigated to identify efficient and targeted nutrient reduction strategies two scenarios of nutrient control were investigated nutrient surplus reduction by 50 s1 and improvement of wwtp treatment efficiency assuming that all wastewater is treated to the tertiary level s2 s1 consists in the reduction of the nutrient surplus in each grid cell in the mediterranean region and thus it is assumed that crop yield is not affected as all crops still receive fertilizers in excess of their requirements s2 increases where possible the treatment efficiency at the tertiary level this is expected to have high impact in the southern part of the mediterranean sea where a large portion of the collected wastewater is discharged directly into the sea without any treatment powley et al 2016 3 results 3 1 results of the model calibration the final results were obtained after the application of the sensitivity analysis the analysis of the dotty plots for each parameter of the calibrated variables has allowed reducing the ranges of sampling thus reducing the uncertainty in the estimation of the optimal parameter values table 3 shows the reduced ranges with respect to their initial values and the optimal parameters obtained after calibration the relative sensitivity analysis of the parameters for each variable table 4 showed that the most sensitive parameters for nitrates total phosphorus are a and b which are related to river retention while orthophosphate and total nitrogen are mostly controlled by α and c which are related to soil and lake retention the model calibration yielded results in good agreement with the measured data for each of the calibrated variables fig 3 and table 5 the calibration of nitrate resulted better than the calibration of phosphorus due to the higher mobility of n in water compared to p and the complex chemical properties of p in natural waters jarvie et al 2002 the nash sutcliffe efficiency is good for all determinands the analysis of the pbias indicates that the model tends to overestimate tn and tp and slightly underestimate n no3 and p po4 this was observed also in grizzetti et al 2008 a similar trend is found in the african and asian basins 3 2 the nutrient fluxes in the mediterranean sea for the period 2003 2007 we estimated that on average 1 87 tg y of tn 1 22 tg y of n no3 0 11 tg y of tp and 0 03 tg y of p po4 are discharged into the mediterranean sea the nile po rhone and ebro were the main river basins that contribute to the nutrient discharge in the mediterranean sea figs 4 and 5 tables 1 and 2 we estimated that n no3 tn and p po4 tp ratios were respectively around 0 65 and 0 27 these ratios are in good agreement with the studies of ludwig et al 2009 and turner et al 2003 hotspots of high biological productivity and eutrophication originating from anthropogenic nutrient inputs are present in coastal areas in the south levantine sle adriatic sea adr north west mediterranean new and aegean sea aeg they correspond to the influence of large rivers including the nile the po the rhone and the ebro and the northern greece s rivers respectively map 2017 macias et al 2018a these hotspots are clearly detected by our model simulation of tn and tp loads and in particular of n no3 and p po4 fluxes fig 6 which represent the major anthropogenic components of nutrient export to coastal waters in particular the south levantine sle and the adriatic adr received about 0 83 tg y of n no3 and 0 016 tg of p po4 nitrate is the dominant component of tn in all parts of the mediterranean sea while orthophosphate ranged from 7 to 39 of tp in all the mediterranean sea areas except for the south levantine 67 3 3 nutrient retention fig 7 shows the percentages of nutrient retention and discharged loads into the mediterranean sea these percentages were calculated comparing the sum of retained loads and discharged loads of all basins in the mediterranean area with the total inputs it is noteworthy that more than 80 of total inputs are retained for tn 84 and n no3 81 these percentages increase to more than 95 for p po4 and tp the major part of retention of total nutrient inputs occurs in soils more than 50 of diffuse sources of n no3 tn and p po4 were captured before reaching the river network while around 38 of tp diffuse sources were retained in rivers the retention was estimated around 18 for n no3 25 for tn and 6 for p po4 while the reduction of tp was the highest around 34 lake retention was approximately similar to that obtained for rivers albeit slightly lower for n no3 and tn lake retention was estimated around 13 and 9 respectively the lowest values were obtained for p po4 around 6 while the highest value was for tp 27 these percentages are in the range of those reported in literature for instance romero et al 2016 estimates that n retained in the mediterranean basins of the iberian peninsula is around 87 3 4 source apportionment nitrogen surplus in cropland and fodder constitutes the dominant source of nitrate 48 and total nitrogen 37 discharged into the sea followed by natural background with 32 and 22 respectively phosphate loads are mainly composed by discharge from wastewater treatment plants 48 and by scattered dwellings 19 fig 8 for total phosphorus agriculture and discharge from wastewater treatment plants have the highest contributions 24 and 20 respectively however the influence of erosion of arable soils increases the contribution of the agricultural sector to 38 the source apportionment for the whole mediterranean region is mostly controlled by the situation of its main river basins including the nile po ebro and rhone river basins in these areas the actions to reduce nitrogen should focus on cropland and grassland and phosphorus needs also to be kept under control as it might be rapidly recycled from water sediments garnier et al 2010 therefore the control of both nitrogen and phosphorus is necessary to reduce eutrophication in coastal waters also for the complexity of the interactions of the two elements howarth and marino 2006 3 5 potential reduction of nutrient loads in the mediterranean fig 9 shows the comparison between the nutrient reduction for scenarios s1 and s2 with respect to the baseline simulation of total discharged nutrient loads into the mediterranean area in the period 2003 2007 scenario s1 which simulates the reduction of nitrogen surplus on cropland land and grassland and scenario s2 which foresees the improvement of wastewater treatments are examples of actions to address nitrogen and phosphorus reduction in the river basins for the mediterranean basins s1 option could reduce tn by about 22 n no3 by 29 tp by 13 and p po4 of 7 fig 9 scenario s2 leads to a reduction of phosphates by 25 tp by 10 and by less than 5 for n no3 and tn s1 scenario is coherent with a similar scenario detailed in thieu et al 2012 and bouraoui et al 2014 in particular our scenario s1 shows that a 50 decrease of nitrogen surplus on cropland and grassland would entail more than 20 reduction of nitrogen input to coastal waters fig 9 this might appear quite a drastic scenario but it provides a benchmark for the evaluation of impacts for example passy et al 2016 simulated a scenario of 50 reduction of nitrogen input to coastal water in the seine bay in order to observe a drastic reduction of noxious algal blooms in addition even though the nitrogen surplus in european mediterranean countries has already decreased by about 8 from 53 kg n ha in 2005 to 48 kg n ha in 2015 weighted average by country area eurostat 2018 and a strong reduction of nitrogen surplus is still desirable in some regions such as malta cyprus and egypt that have high nitrogen surplus lassaletta et al 2014 4 discussion in the mediterranean sea intensive fishing and changes in primary productivity driven by anthropogenic nutrient pollution have altered the ecosystem and species biodiversity with a reduction in abundance of important fish species and top predators compared to the 50ys piroddi et al 2017 analyses of satellite images of the mediterranean sea over the last 20 years show that chlorophyll concentration which is used as a proxy of phytoplankton biomass to detect eutrophication has been increasing in the south east spanish coast in the ligurian provençal basin and in the rhodes gyre region while it has been decreasing in the north adriatic sea off the rhone river mouth and in the aegean sea the evidence also indicates that eutrophication problems persist in the area of influence of the nile delta colella et al 2016 these trends result from the expansion of urban areas and intensification of fertilizers use in agriculture for example in turkey and egypt faostat 2018 as well as from the implementation of policies to reduce agricultural nutrient pollution or wastewater discharges such as in the rhone and po river basins following the enforcement of the eu nitrates directive 91 676 eec and urban waste water directive 91 271 eec it is clear that socio economic activities in a river basin can affect the amount and forms of nitrogen and phosphorus exported to the coastal waters and can also alter the n p ratio which strongly influences the eutrophication process according to our modelling estimates in the period 2003 2007 the ratio tn tp was 41 19 23 15 in sle adr nwe and aeg respectively while the ratio n no3 p po4 was 55 39 32 38 fig 10 the highest values of n no3 p po4 were observed in ion and sle as these values are higher than the redfield n p ratio of 16 they indicate that phosphorus can act as limiting nutrient for eutrophication which is in line with evidence found in the literature for the mediterranean sea considered generally p limited tanhua et al 2013 in addition for the period 2001 2005 romero et al 2013 reported values of the icep index billen and garnier 2007 at the outlets of the rhone ebro and po rivers indicating a potential risk of eutrophication related to an excess of nitrogen over silica the persistent and widespread eutrophication processes that impact especially enclosed coastal bays in the mediterranean sea resulted in a huge effort in the last half century to control the phenomena understanding the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus discharged to the sea their sources by a given sector and the losses retention in the river basin is crucial to plan management strategies for the protection of coastal ecosystems and their services the modelling framework presented in this study allows quantifying nutrient fluxes to the sea considering the contribution of natural processes and different sources including agriculture and domestic activities the estimations of soils rivers and lakes contribution to the retention of nitrogen and phosphorus forms like those provided in this study fig 7 can help understanding the role of reservoirs soils and river systems in the total removal of nutrients the control of nitrogen and phosphorus losses to waters involves the understanding of the natural processes responsible for nutrient retention in the river basin these processes depend on the mobility of the different nitrogen and phosphorus forms in water they are mediated by the water residence time the climate the action of bacteria denitrification the plants and algae growth and the processes of sedimentation especially in standing waters and in lakes grizzetti et al 2015 maintaining and enhancing natural riparian filters supports nutrient retention processes in the river network viaroli et al 2015 soana et al 2017 while intensification of dams in the mediterranean region can increase retention but at the same time expand nitrogen pollution in aquifers and soils romero et al 2016 in reference to the major challenges that the mediterranean area will face in future years i e intensification of economic activities population increase urban sprawling and climate changes the scenarios s1 and s2 of this study provided significant management options in particular they provide the potential effectiveness of mitigation measures on the various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus it is noteworthy that due to the structure of green rgrid we can assess trade offs scenarios in particular those linked to change of land use and change of irrigated areas and associated impacts on crop production and fertilizer requirements despite the current conflict in syria and the related political instability of some countries of the area economic activities and population are expected to increase in north africa and middle east the expansion of the economic sectors and agriculture may increase water demand by 18 by 2025 mainly in the southern and eastern countries plan bleu 2008 the coastal urban population in the mediterranean is projected to increase by 30 from 2005 to 2025 the increase will take place mainly in urban areas in the eastern and southern coasts of the mediterranean plan bleu 2008 all these aspects could exacerbate the current pressure on the rich and fragile ecosystem that sustains the people and economic activities of the region eea 2015 concurrently in the mediterranean area the climate is expected to be warmer and drier by the end of the century ipcc 2013 this will reduce water availability and affect nutrient cycling in coastal regions the increase of temperature and the change in precipitation patterns could foster the growth of phytoplankton biomass macias et al 2018b as a consequence of the population increase higher direct discharges of nutrient through sewage systems can be expected in the mediterranean coasts under a growing population upgrading wastewater treatment to tertiary level especially for direct discharges into the sea is a necessary measure to protect the marine and coastal environment powley et al 2016 estimated nitrogen and phosphorus wastewater directly discharged by coastal cities into the mediterranean sea their scenario indicates that treating these discharges to tertiary level would be needed to keep pollution in 2050 at the same level of 2003 despite the population increase but it would involve additional costs over 2 billion y our scenario s2 which considers the contribution of wastewater from coastal cities and also from the whole drainage basin shows that a 10 reduction of tp input could be achieved by upgrading the existing wastewater treatment facilities fig 9 this reduction could be up to 30 in the coastal areas of northern african and asian basins such as in the nile and turkish basins where chlorophyll increasing concentrations have been observed colella et al 2016 reducing nitrogen surplus on agricultural soils together with collecting wastewaters and upgrading treatment levels as exemplified by scenarios s1 and s2 in this study are necessary measures to protect the water resources and coastal and marine ecosystems in the mediterranean basin and to ensure the long term sustainability of the economic activities and ecosystem services in the region these measures are also relevant in view of the future climatic and demographic challenges the region will face regarding nutrients in the agriculture water nexus in conclusion the assessment and modelling tool presented in this study have shown how the interlinkage between water and agriculture can be explored considering the basin coastal relationship and nutrient sources and sinks from different sectors in an integrated way making it a valuable tool not only for the mediterranean area but also for all the other seas appendix a

8446,study region this study has three spatial scales global 0 5 macro regional and country scale the database of drought events has specific entries for each macro region and country study focus we constructed a database of meteorological drought events from 1951 to 2016 now hosted by the global drought observatory of the european commission s joint research centre events were detected at macro regional and country scale based on the separate analysis of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the standardized precipitation index spi at different accumulation scales from 3 to 72 months using as input the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and climatic research unit cru time series datasets the database includes approximately 4800 events based on spei 3 and 4500 based on spi 3 each event is described by its start and end date duration intensity severity peak average and maximum area in drought and a special score to classify 52 mega droughts new hydrological insights for the region under study we derived trends in drought frequency and severity separately for spi and spei at a 12 month accumulation scale which is usually related to hydrological droughts results show several drought hotspots in the last decades amazonia southern south america the mediterranean region most of africa north eastern china and to a lesser extent central asia and southern australia over north america central europe central asia and australia the recent progressive temperature increase outbalanced the increase in precipitation causing more frequent and severe droughts keywords climate change drought events global database meteorological drought spei spi 1 introduction the complex nature of droughts makes them one of the most difficult climate hazards to perceive wilhite 2000 other recurrent weather related hazards such as heatwaves floods and windstorms can be skilfully forecasted in certain cases vitart 2006 komma et al 2007 lowe et al 2011 and in general unequivocally quantified and classified milly et al 2002 russo et al 2015 in addition a wide spectrum of impacts of such events is usually documented in the scientific and non scientific literature examples are deaths caused by a heatwave kovats and kristie 2006 tree fall after a windstorm schlyter et al 2006 or damages to infrastructures hit by a flood blöschl et al 2013 instead drought develops slowly its main characteristics such as the onset duration and severity are not easily quantified and impacts are often indirect non structural and spread over large areas dai 2011 consequently drought impacts are often not easily related to a given drought event and difficult to measure in economic terms there is no unique definition of drought as we can distinguish between meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic droughts mishra and singh 2010 depending on the hydrological compartment affected and or the related impacts drought impacts are often recorded incompletely or in a qualitative manner only ding et al 2011 in addition drought impacts depend on the exposure and vulnerability of affected societies and can be exacerbated for example by poor land management practices cook et al 2009 van dijk et al 2013 eventually leading to irreversible land and soil degradation cook et al 2014 reynolds et al 2007 wonkka et al 2016 marengo et al 2017 given the difficulties to analyze droughts mentioned above one consequence is that at the time of writing to our knowledge neither a global database of droughts nor a comprehensive global database of drought impacts exist one of the objectives of the european commission s global drought observatory gdo http edo jrc ec europa eu gdo is to incorporate amongst its features data regarding drought characteristics and their impacts in order to understand the relationships between both to do this the first essential step is to construct a global database of drought events and their characteristics which is the main goal of this study here we focus on meteorological drought which owes its name to the meteorological variables usually precipitation and temperature analyzed therefore meteorological drought can be defined as a prolonged lack of or below normal rainfall keyantash and dracup 2002 possibly aggravated by hot temperatures causing high evapotranspiration rates vicente serrano et al 2015 the role of temperature which is needed to compute potential evapotranspiration pet is still debated in the scientific literature dai et al 2018 in particular most formulations tend to overestimate pet compared to actual evapotranspiration in semi arid and arid hot areas sheffield et al 2012 dai 2013 trenberth et al 2014 van der schrier et al 2015 leading to uncertainties in the analyses of past and projected droughts dai and zhao 2017 consequently we investigated meteorological droughts driven by precipitation separately from those driven by precipitation and temperature this work builds on two previous studies dealing with the collection of meteorological drought events one focused on the carpathian region and over the period 1961 2010 spinoni et al 2013 and the other on the entire european continent and over the period 1950 2012 spinoni et al 2015a as in those two studies we used spi and spei at different accumulation scales however the new global database of events has specific entries for macro regions and for countries similar to spinoni et al 2015a while the current period of interest is 1951 2016 with planned updates every two or three years consequently in 2019 or 2020 the period will be extended to 1951 2018 and so on depending also on input data availability as in spinoni et al 2015a for europe here we assigned to each event a set of parameters as well as a special score based on duration severity intensity and area involved in order to compare events in different countries and macro regions the scoring system enables the differentiation of three classes moderate severe and exceptional droughts and a classification of the biggest meteorological drought events occurring at global scale during 1951 2016 the list of the biggest events together with time series of monthly maps 0 5 spatial resolution and statistics are hosted by the european commission s gdo the remainder of this paper is structured into three main sections section 2 focuses on methods applied to data collection computation of drought indicators and description of parameters for the single drought events section 3 focuses on results and describes separately the database structure the biggest drought events collected global drought trends and hotspots and the importance of temperature in meteorological drought analyses section 4 summarizes the most relevant findings and anticipates possibilities for further development of the database such as the incorporation of vegetation based indicators 2 data and methods 2 1 input data precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet the choice of input data was guided by four pre requisites medium high spatial resolution at least 0 5 if possible temporal range at least as far back as the 1950s global availability of daily or monthly precipitation and temperature or pet and high data quality consequently we selected two global datasets mostly based on station observed data the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc schneider et al 2008 becker et al 2013 dataset of the german weather service dwd and the climatic research unit time series cru ts harris et al 2014 of the university of east anglia from gpcc version 7 we obtained monthly gridded precipitation data for 1901 2013 at 0 5 spatial resolution and from cru ts version 4 01 we obtained monthly gridded precipitation and pet data for 1901 2016 also at 0 5 spatial resolution we analyzed data only from 1951 onwards due to the limited availability of station records before the 1950s in particular regarding precipitation at high latitudes and in tropical regions as the amazon rainforest schneider et al 2014 spinoni et al 2014 both datasets have been frequently used in climate studies for example in kottek et al 2006 rubel and kottek 2010 weedon et al 2011 morice et al 2012 trenberth et al 2014 and spinoni et al 2015b regarding precipitation we used data from the gpcc for 1951 2013 and from the cru ts for 2014 2016 to ensure continuity from 2013 to 2014 and over the entire period we tested the 1951 2016 series for homogeneity using the newest version i e 3 03 of the multiple analysis of series for homogenization mash szentimrey 1999 2006 software for each area we created a reference series using a varying number of grid points in the surroundings up to eight then we compared each single series with the reference series using mash this introduces a possible bias but we took it as a good compromise to exclude biased series given that we used grid point series only only 1 7 of grid points failed the homogeneity tests more than 90 of which are located in regions that we masked see next sections and fig 2 the remaining are mostly located in arctic russia in semi desert parts of the arabian peninsula and in the australian central outback for grid points that failed the tests and are located in regions of drought interest we used up to eight surrounding grid points to adjust the series after this procedure only 0 2 of grid points failed a second round of homogeneity tests and were excluded from the analyses the entire procedure was simplified by two facts both the gpcc and the cru ts data have the same spatial grid and share many stations used to create the grids becker et al 2013 schneider et al 2014 we opted for precipitation data from the gpcc instead of using the cru data only because we already successfully used them in previous studies at global scale spinoni et al 2014 2015b moreover the gpcc uses an interpolation algorithm over space and time which results in dynamic values over areas poor of stations becker et al 2013 while the cru sometimes uses the long term climatology for example over the amazon forest in the mid 20th century causing critical problems for drought indicators based on statistical distributions we highlight that the overall number of stations in particular those with precipitation data used to create the grids shows a decrease from the 1970s onwards becker et al 2013 consequently the analyses over the periods with the highest number of records from the 1960s to the 2000s are the most accurate regarding pet this is provided by the cru ts dataset which estimates it using penman monteith s formulation and based on sunshine duration temperature vapour pressure humidity and wind speed data allen et al 2006 to be precise pet data in the cru ts dataset are not estimated using real wind data but a fixed monthly climatology as well as sunshine duration and humidity data derived from other variables as temperature cloud cover and latitude harris et al 2014 the penman monteith approach requires many variables that are not easily retrievable from historical records over large areas however it is often considered the most suitable for drought related analyses trenberth et al 2014 dai and zhao 2017 although it is not free from criticism and other formulations are accepted van der schrier et al 2011 spinoni et al 2017 in particular the assumptions in the penman monteith approach refer to a surface of well clipped grass with a sufficient amount of water these conditions are not met everywhere and at any time moreover under water stress the actual evaporation aet tends to decrease while the potential evapotranspiration tends to increase brutsaert and parlange 1998 so when the conditions are very or extremely dry the penman monteith equation tends to overestimate pet and consequently the spei overestimates drought this limitation could be partly overcome with the use of the self calibrated palmer drought severity index sc pdsi wells et al 2004 which is less affected by this issue as it is based on an estimated actual evapotranspiration and might be included in the updates of the database as in the case of precipitation we tested the pet series for homogeneity before using them to compute the drought indicators in this case only 0 3 of grid points falling into the area of drought interest were rejected 2 2 drought indicators the spi and the spei as anticipated in the introduction we decided to account for the temperature related effects on drought events without discarding the droughts forced by rainfall deficits only thus we split our database of drought events in two sections depending on the indicator used the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 guttman 1999 which is based on precipitation only and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 beguería et al 2014 which is based on precipitation and pet which includes temperature following this approach we made our database more flexible and suitable for sectors sensitive to droughts and high temperatures williams et al 2013 naumann et al 2015 shukla et al 2015 in addition this approach allows us to exploit the database to consider how the past meteorological drought trends change at global scale including or excluding temperature effects as already evaluated at european scale spinoni et al 2017 both spi and spei are standardized indicators that fit the input variable s with a statistical distribution over a baseline and classify the drought conditions with a simple scheme related to standard deviations from the median in order to compute the standardized indicators we fitted the gamma for spi and log logistic for spei probability distributions over the baseline 1951 2016 the applied distributions are the most widely used in literature and recommended by the indicators original developers cressie 2015 presents a detailed description on the theoretical background of the distributions both indicators have been computed at multiple temporal accumulation periods from 3 to 72 months in order to let the user choose the accumulation period which best accounts for the sector of interest in this paper we focus on 3 and 12 month periods however in gdo the user will find results derived also for all the other accumulation periods as a baseline we decided to use the entire period 1951 2016 in order to fit the distribution on the longest possible time series and to derive robust results guttman 1999 moreover semi arid and arid areas can be problematic with meteorological indicators computed at short accumulation periods especially with spi in fact a notable number of zero values no cumulated precipitation for example for more than half of 3 month periods would result in unreliable estimations of the indicator for statistical reasons such as a gamma distribution fitted with too few non zero values cressie 2015 on the other hand fitting the difference between precipitation and pet over a short baseline period can result in problems computing spei due to climate change effects i e rising temperatures that are manifest in pet over recent decades ipcc 2014 in fact with a baseline of 1951 1980 for example spei values of recent years or decades may be unrealistic because recent differences between precipitation and pet fall outside the range recorded during the baseline period thus biasing the fit of the statistical distribution 2 3 meteorological drought events definition and parameters in this section we use spei 3 as an example however all definitions and explanations apply to both spi and spei at any accumulation period in this study a drought event starts once the analyzed indicator falls below the value corresponding to a given negative standard deviation e g spei 3 σ for at least two consecutive months and ends when the indicator rises above 0 usually the threshold for the start of the event is 1 mckee et al 1993 in this study this is valid when a drought event is evaluated for individual grid points since 1 corresponds to 1σ for the indicators however this is not valid for a country or region which contains a non unitary number of grid points so how do we define whether a country or region is affected by a drought event firstly we computed country time series by averaging the time series at grid point level in that country secondly we calculated the standard deviation over the averaged time series e g σ 0 75 thirdly we used the new standard deviation as a threshold in this example a drought event starts once the indicator is below 0 75 for at least two consecutive months with the two months criterion we excluded the very short droughts one month only which are rarely impacting differently than flash floods and could outstandingly increase the number of events of low importance in the database as for grid points also at country or regional scales the drought event ends when the indicators become positive in this study after the end of a drought event at least 2 months should pass before a new event is considered fig 1 shows as an example the country series of spei for four accumulation periods for argentina it demonstrates that at country scale there is no need that the drought indicator falls below 1 for a drought event in red to start however when the database is implemented in gdo the user will also have access to the indicator values at grid point scale 0 5 as shown for example in fig 2 which represents the month of august 2015 which between 1951 and 2016 and according to the spei 3 shows the largest percentage of global land areas under meteorological drought conditions 27 4 all numbers reported in this paper and statistics included in gdo do not consider the masked areas in fig 2 other than antarctica not shown in this paper we excluded deserts condition average precipitation pet ratio for 1951 2016 below 0 05 and cold areas condition average pet for 1951 2016 below 365 mm as was done previously in spinoni et al 2014 the database collects drought events for countries and at a larger spatial scale for macro regions we focus on countries because most of the drought impacts registered in open online e g the em dat database see https www emdat be and proprietary e g munichre 2019 databases deal with country data macro regions are included because we aim to classify the mega droughts of the last decades possibly involving multiple countries or even different climatological regions regarding countries we included only those having an extent of at least three grid points and at least 95 of valid data over 1951 2016 for both the spi and the spei at 3 and 12 month accumulation periods thus we discarded small islands and very small countries and collected drought events for 171 countries moreover we performed the analyses and collected events for 23 macro regions following the same procedure for countries see fig 3 and table 1 for the corresponding acronyms the macro regions are similar to those described in giorgi 2006 with some exceptions we excluded high latitude cold areas e g greenland and the sahara the borders do not perfectly match with those in giorgi 2006 as we aimed at macro regions with roughly comparable dimensions excluding alaska ala northern europe neu and northern asia nas all regions range between approximately 3 and 8 million km2 for each drought event we assigned a set of parameters describing its key characteristics table 2 start and end month and year duration severity intensity average area in drought conditions during the event lowest indicator value and the widest area in drought conditions the last two parameters with corresponding month and year as in spinoni et al 2015a we calculated severity as the sum in absolute values of indicator values during the drought event and intensity as the ratio between severity and duration finally we calculated a special score allowing for an overall comparison of events see section 2 4 the drought duration severity and average area were then used to investigate drought trends at various spatial scales see section 3 moreover to each event we assigned information on the indicator and accumulation period used a country code and two numbers referring to the number of the event for that country or macro region in the entire database in gdo each drought event has a unique 30 character code that helps searching for a particular event 2 4 a special scoring system to compare droughts at different scales in the last few years whether in the newspapers on the internet or in the media in general it is not uncommon to find popular claims that the latest event for example the california drought of 2014 science news 2014 moscow s heatwave in summer 2016 russia beyond 2016 or the south asia flood of 2017 the guardian 2017 broke century or millennial records sometimes these claims are based on robust data and analyses but sometimes not one of the goals of this study is to define a methodology that can compare and classify drought events at different locations we emphasize that our approach focuses on drought events not drought conditions thus it differs from drought classifications such as in the united states drought monitor svoboda et al 2002 and in the european drought observatory sepulcre canto et al 2012 table 3 shows how our special scoring system for drought events derives from the aggregation of six parameters the first two deal with the severity and intensity and assign a score from 0 to 5 points depending on how the event compared with all events included in our database for the selected drought indicator and accumulation period at national or macro regional scale severity and intensity as defined in this study are often mutually exclusive as the typical severe event is slowly developing and long lasting whilst an intense event such as a flash drought usually lasting just a few months has a sudden severe breakthrough and ends in a few months severity and intensity are important features of droughts as they relate to impacts affecting different sectors for example a severe event is more likely to affect the hydrological cycle van loon 2015 and an intense event is more likely to affect soil moisture hayes et al 1999 according to spei 12 in our database one example of an exceptionally severe drought is the event in the mid 1950s in the united states also known as the 1950s texas drought woodhouse and overpeck 1998 on the other hand an example of an exceptionally intense drought is that in the philippines during the infamous 1997 1998 el niño event mcphaden 1999 the wider the area the bigger the chance that the event caused remarkable impacts sheffield et al 2009 thus the third parameter the average percentage of area in drought conditions during the event assigns up to 5 points the philippines drought in 1997 1998 was not only exceptionally intense but also covered on average more than 80 of the national territories thus this event receives 4 points in this category extra points one for each feature are given if for a given country or macro region the drought event is the longest most severe most intense or widest in the period 1951 2016 we underline that these thresholds though based on percentiles are necessarily subjective choices the last two categories in table 3 regard the drought peak which in some occasions could be linked with the largest impacts as occurred for the central european drought and heatwave in the summer of 2003 fink et al 2004 ciais et al 2005 we considered two different peaks the maximum intensity and the largest area hit by a drought for example the 1950s drought in the united states receives 3 points in the peak area category as its maximum extension exceeded 1 million km2 stahle and cleaveland 1988 based on the total number of points the drought events are divided into three classes moderate severe and exceptional the definition of an extreme event is therefore different from that applied in previous studies spinoni et al 2013 2015a using the spei 12 our database contains for example 72 exceptional events at macro regional scale without considering events involving more than a macro region 85 severe events and 112 moderate events at macro regional scale the event with the highest total score 20 is the drought over southern south america in 2008 2009 which caused more than four billion dollar of damages to argentinian farmers bbc news 2009 inter press service 2009 united states department of agriculture 2008 this event also features in our database at country scale for argentina score 21 uruguay score 16 and paraguay score 16 in this study the special scoring described above has been applied to each detected drought event for both drought indicators and at all spatial scales and accumulation periods we then used the special score derived from the spei 12 indicator at macro regional scale in order to list the biggest mega droughts from 1951 to 2016 depending on the indicator and accumulation period analyzed this list might change to some extent however extreme droughts will reflect significantly in all indicators and accumulation periods it should be also borne in mind that the proposed classification system should be viewed as a first attempt which may be refined in planned updates of the database although the three main classes should not be used in a quantitative way they do however follow an objective classification system partly inspired by round table discussions with experts during the 2017 european drought observatory user meeting vogt et al 2017 in this study we focused on country and macro regional scales to assign the single parameters and the special score to drought events this choice has limitations when for example a country is large and a drought event occurs in a relatively small part of the country only in such a case it can be missed or the statistics at country scale might not represent its characteristics in a proper way in fig 4 we show some country and macro regional time series for the spei 3 and how the user can investigate single events month by month in the web platform of gdo an example are the united states which suffered multiple droughts between 2011 and 2017 los angeles times 2017 in particular over the south west and central plains according to our data the most severe period started in autumn 2011 and ended early 2013 a in fig 4 special score for the united states is 16 exceptional drought but another peak was observed in spring 2015 b in fig 4 special score is 9 severe drought which corresponds to the exacerbation of drought in california usc 2015 in our database the events a and b can be found for both the united states and the macro region wna but no information on the location can be inferred from the statistical parameters associated to them however on the gdo website the user can visualize not only the country or macro region series and the associated droughts with their parameters but also the gridded indicators in this way the geographical features of the drought events can be visualized fig 4 right column one of the planned improvements for our database is the choice of more refined macro regions and the splitting of large countries in the current version we already did this for russia divided into european and asian russia in this way one can better characterize events like the one that hit western russia in summer 2010 russo et al 2015 c in fig 4 3 results and discussions 3 1 the database of drought events the new global database of meteorological drought events is subdivided according to the indicator and accumulation period considered in this section we focus on the spei 12 and spi 12 indicators providing also some statistics on the events derived from spei 3 and spi 3 data and events derived from other accumulation periods are available in gdo for countries at the global level and based on spei 3 the overall number of drought events collected is 4827 while based on spi 3 it is slightly smaller 4504 for longer accumulation periods i e spei 12 and spi 12 the numbers are smaller 1992 and 1947 respectively of course any event that spread over two or more countries is assigned to more than one country such large scale events are also included in the database dedicated to macro regions where based on spei 3 and spi 3 the user will find 617 and 614 events respectively and based on spei 12 and spi 12 269 and 266 events respectively in section 3 2 we validate the list of the 52 detected mega droughts between 1951 and 2016 checking their effective reporting in the scientific literature and media having a limited number of exceptional events to check makes it a feasible validation exercise but looking for a confirmation of more than 4000 events is barely impossible in reasonable time thus we focus on europe which is made of three macro regions see table 1 and as reference we used the independent european drought reference edr and european drought impact report inventory edii databases http www geo uio no edc droughtdb index php including events and impacts collected as part of the drought r spi project stahl et al 2016 we highlight that this database was created based on impact reports so it might suffer from a distribution of events biased towards the later decades we also highlight that no real quantitative comparison can be done so the validation is qualitative presence or absence of the events table 4 details how many of the 37 drought events included in the edr edii database period 1951 2012 can be found in our database depending on which input indicator and time scale we used to make the comparison we used the events per country in our database if the event in the edr edii is labelled with a single country and we used the events per macro region if the event in the edr edii is labelled with a region e g scandinavia in edr edii corresponds to northern europe in our database 30 out of 37 events i e the 81 are included in our database in at least one of the four subsets analyzed and 30 out of 36 events i e 83 if we consider the drought in europe and northern europe in spring 2012 as a single event in our database however many more than 37 drought events are reported for europe in the period 1951 2012 as an example we take the case of greece according to the edr edii five droughts occurred in greece in that period 1989 1990 1999 2002 2006 and 2007 labelled as eastern europe in edr in our database and according to the spei 12 one can find eight events 1957 1977 1978 1985 1986 1989 1991 1992 1995 2000 2002 2007 2009 including all those in edr edii with the exception of the one in 2006 which is contained in our database if the spei 3 is selected as input indicator this example suggests that a combined use of the edr edii database with ours is a viable option for analysing past drought events over europe users can exploit our database to discover for example which countries experienced the largest increase or decrease in drought frequency between the periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2016 according to spei 12 four of the top 10 countries showing the largest increase in drought frequency between these periods are in the mediterranean region italy ranked first tunisia montenegro spain while five are in the sahel and central western africa liberia chad niger cameroon central african republic the same areas are hotspots according to spi 12 because the corresponding top 10 countries include two mediterranean countries albania spain and six sub saharan countries south sudan ranked first central african republic chad ethiopia ghana cameroon conversely both spei 12 and spi 12 highlight north eastern europe as the region with the largest decrease of drought frequency during the last decades according to spei 12 four of the top 10 countries with the largest decrease in drought frequency are iceland sweden finland european russia also georgia and armenia while using spi 12 we find the same four countries plus latvia and poland table 5 shows the difference in frequency and severity of drought events between the periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2016 for macro regions five macro regions show an increase in both frequency and severity mediterranean med equatorial and southern africa eqf saf central and eastern asia cas eas and four show a corresponding decrease in both quantities central north america can northern and north eastern europe neu nee southern asia sas the largest combined increases are in the mediterranean region and equatorial africa using the classification shown in table 3 and applied to macro regions the largest increases of extreme drought events are in western north america the mediterranean region and eastern africa based on spei 12 and in eastern western and southern africa and eastern asia based on spi 12 to summarize fig 5 shows all of the detected drought events at macro regional scale between 1951 and 2016 according to the spei 12 in the 1950s and 1960s north and south america and northern europe were hit by frequent extreme events the 1970s saw the overall smallest number of droughts in the 1980s north america and the sahel were the most hit by droughts while the 1970s and early 1990s saw fewer droughts than other periods from the late 1990s up to the present southern europe africa most of asia and southern australia show a tendency towards more frequent droughts with a couple of huge events over eastern asia and australia that lasted three years or more one example is the millennium drought over south east australia that lasted from the late 1990s until 2009 heberger 2012 van dijk et al 2013 3 2 the biggest drought events from 1951 to 2016 using the scoring system reported in table 3 and selecting spei 12 as the input indicator we found 52 exceptional drought events at macro regional scale score 11 which we named mega droughts for this task we chose spei 12 as it includes temperature and detects droughts forced by mega heatwaves such as that in summer 2003 over central europe rebetez et al 2006 moreover a medium accumulation scale filters the flash droughts but detects seasonal and annual drought events spinoni et al 2015a the most important drawback is that some events might be recorded in our database with a few months delay especially when they break out suddenly mega droughts encompassing two or more macro regions can show smaller scores in one of the regions as the event can be centred over the borders between regions the list of the mega droughts during 1951 2016 table 6 has been validated through a careful search of scientific papers and reliable media reports out of 52 events only one could not be traced thus we can estimate an accuracy of 98 of course this validation does not check if an event has been omitted over all possible droughts as this would be unfeasibly complex and time consuming however we highlight the fact that other regionally widespread droughts such as the amazon drought of 2005 zeng et al 2008 are classified as severe and consequently are included in the database but not in table 6 because this is a list of exceptional events at very large scale thus missing well known droughts may be included in our database under a different class furthermore as table 6 is based on input data until december 2016 there are a few droughts that were still ongoing at the end of 2016 consequently the parameters of such events could change in updated versions of the database we should also mention that for recent droughts it was not always easy to find scientific information for validation as usually publications based on research projects or phd theses focusing on specific drought events are published with considerable delays table 6 provides an overview of the periods that experienced big droughts during 1951 2016 four exceptional droughts occurred in the 1950s one of which encompassed three macro regions central america eastern and central north america the 1960s were characterized by six exceptional events two ending in the 1970s none having a special score higher than 16 also the 1970s saw six exceptional events while the 1980s had five such events an increasing trend is evident from the early 1990s onwards eight exceptional events in the 1990s thirteen in the 2000s and ten during 2010 2016 if we compare the number of exceptional events during 1951 1980 16 versus 1981 2016 36 the tendency towards more frequent exceptional droughts is evident table 6 also includes some details on the drivers and sectorial impacts of the 52 mega droughts a recurrent feature of the events listed in table 6 is the correlation between strong el niño events and mega droughts such as 1982 1983 1997 1998 and 2014 2016 wang et al 2017 on the other hand extreme droughts and la niña events are less frequently correlated e g 1988 1989 and 2010 2011 more details about el niño and la niña events can be found in trenberth 1997 3 3 global drought tendencies from 1951 1980 to 1981 2016 we used time series of the spei 12 and spi 12 indicators to investigate drought trends specifically we compared the frequency fig 6 and average severity fig 7 of drought events during the periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2016 some areas experienced increased drought frequency based on both indicators but larger based on spei 12 the u s east coast amazonia and north eastern brazil patagonia the mediterranean region most of africa north eastern china the most relevant decrease is in northern argentina uruguay and northern europe compared to 1951 1980 during 1981 2016 the meteorological droughts were more severe for both spei 12 and spi 12 over north western u s parts of patagonia and southern chile the sahel the congo river basin southern europe north eastern china and south eastern australia conversely eastern u s south eastern brazil northern europe and central northern australia experienced less severe droughts combining the results in figs 6 and 7 we can identify the hotspots hit by more frequent and more severe meteorological droughts in the last decades patagonia the mediterranean region the sahel the congo river basin north eastern china the same hotspots were indicated by sheffield et al 2012 dai 2011 2013 spinoni et al 2014 and dai and zhao 2017 though the spatial borders do not perfectly overlap because of the use of different indicators e g the palmer drought severity index palmer 1965 and time periods patagonia and southern south america however represents an exception as it is not considered a hotspot in sheffield et al 2012 and only limited areas in southern chile and argentina show a trend towards more frequent droughts according to dai 2013 spinoni et al 2014 and dai and zhao 2017 the main reason for the discrepancy concerns the climate data that were included in the different studies in dai 2013 and spinoni et al 2014 these extended only until 2010 in dai and zhao 2017 only until 2012 in sheffield et al 2012 only until 2008 and in our study until 2016 according to table 6 an extreme drought hit argentina and chile in 2008 2010 and this event could not be taken into account in sheffield et al 2012 moreover in our database for spei 12 out of eleven droughts over southern south america in 1951 2016 three occurred in 2008 2016 specifically 2008 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 naumann et al 2019 regarding the areas in drought fig 8 our results agree with the previously cited studies at global level and according to spei 12 a small increase is observable especially after the mid 1990s since no significant trend is found according to spi 12 the trend documented by spei 12 is likely temperature driven the macro regions with a tendency towards a higher percentage of areas in drought are southern south america ssa the mediterranean region med central and eastern asia cas and eas the entire african continent south of the sahara waf eaf eqf and saf 3 4 the role of temperature in meteorological drought table 7 shows the average global shifts between 1951 1980 and 1981 2016 according to the spei 12 indicator the increase of drought frequency is approximately 9 7 and the absolute increase of areas in drought is 3 3 according to spi 12 however an opposite slight decrease of drought frequency and areas in drought can be observed on average both indicators point towards longer more severe and slightly more intense droughts but they diverge on drought frequency and areas in drought table 7 the difference between the two indicators is small for drought frequency in 1951 1980 with spei 12 showing a smaller number of events compared to spi 12 over semi arid areas in kazakhstan uzbekistan and northern china fig 9 in 1951 1980 spei 12 shows a larger drought severity compared to spi 12 over northern colombia and venezuela bolivia and semi arid areas in western argentina whilst fewer severe events are shown especially over southern central australia in 1981 2016 the differences between the indicators are greater due to the progressive temperature increase in the last decades ipcc 2014 with the largest differences over southern africa and western australia regarding drought frequency and over western amazonia the sahel central asia mongolia and southern australia regarding drought severity the role of temperature in meteorological droughts is crucial dai et al 2018 and the methodology to estimate evapotranspiration has been frequently debated van der schrier et al 2011 trenberth et al 2014 spinoni et al 2017 in this study we used the penman monteith approach allen et al 2006 which is generally considered more robust than two of the most used approaches hargreaves samani hargreaves and samani 1985 samani 2000 and thorntwaite thornthwaite 1948 however particularly for short accumulation periods spei can be problematic in semi arid areas and tends to overestimate drought severity compared with spi because of the difficulty to estimate potential evapotranspiration pet in such conditions e g hernandez and uddameri 2014 examples are north western chile the arabian peninsula mountainous regions surrounding the aral sea the cold gobi desert and the australian outback fig 9 similarly to spinoni et al 2015c for europe we analyzed the change in precipitation and pet between 1951 1980 and 1981 2016 as shown in fig 10 to evaluate whether the drying or wetting tendency reflected by drought indicators was driven by precipitation temperature as included in pet or both the only input variable for spi is precipitation so an increase or decrease in precipitation is very likely to result in respectively a wetting or drying tendency for spi however over some countries the variability of precipitation plays a more important role than the mean change in guyana poland and libya for example spi 12 shows a slight wetting tendency despite a small decrease in precipitation conversely in armenia georgia oman tajikistan and bangladesh spi 12 suggests a drying tendency despite a small increase in precipitation this occurs in particular in small countries such as oman and tajikistan where arid and semi arid areas are predominant and consequently the computation of spi may suffer from biases fig 10 also provides a visualization of the geographical patterns according to spi 12 and with few exceptions in the last decades north america southern south america excluding chile central and northern europe central northern and eastern asia excluding north korea and japan and australasia experienced a wetting tendency conversely tropical south america southern europe most of africa excluding the horn of africa and south asia experienced a drying tendency the influence of temperature on drought trends is clear from fig 10 switching from spi 12 to spei 12 mexico canada central europe central and eastern asia and australia change from a wetting to a drying tendency and in most of the countries characterized by this change this is due to the increase in pet i e hotter climate which outweighs the wetting trend over the united states northern europe russia and south eastern asia the warming trend is not strong enough to outweigh the precipitation increase according to spei 12 the worst drying combination i e precipitation decrease and pet increase occurs over brazil the mediterranean region most of africa the middle east south asia and japan combining the information in fig 10 with the drought hotspots listed in previous sections we distinguish three different situations over the mediterranean region the sahel and the congo river basin the increase of drought frequency and severity is due to both precipitation decrease and hotter climate conditions over north eastern china the outstanding increase in pet due to hotter temperatures is the main driver of more frequent and severe meteorological droughts argentina with the exception of patagonia shows on average a decrease in drought frequency and severity for both spi 12 and spei 12 due to a precipitation increase and a very small decrease in pet especially at southernmost latitudes patagonia which was hit by recurrent long and severe drought events in the last decades exhibits a different behaviour 4 conclusions the presented global database of meteorological drought events during the period 1951 2016 contains thousands of events organized according to country and macro region each featured event is assigned a set of parameters that may be used as proxy variables for analysing potential drought impacts the database is also divided according to the spi and spei indicator and for various accumulation periods ranging from 3 to 72 months all entries in the database together with dedicated maps time series and charts are available to the public through the european commission s global drought observatory it can be exploited to look for past events to perform historical analyses and to compare current events with those that have previously occurred the information in the database can support the development of drought management strategies estrela and vargas 2012 and thus drought mitigation and preparedness efforts wilhite et al 2007 vogt and somma 2000 especially countries with a scarcity of long term high quality climatic data mirza 2003 can benefit from this country based historical dataset of drought events we have furthermore presented the first scientific results derived by exploiting the database such as trends in global drought frequency and severity between 1951 and 2016 which enables the identification of drought hotspots around the globe it is planned to update the drought database approximately every two years although this depends also on the updating frequency of the input datasets i e gpcc and cru ts a most recent update which extends the time interval of the gpcc dataset from 1891 to 2016 will be included in the next version of our database a limitation in our study is the use of two input datasets only an evaluation is currently underway of two other updating options the terraclimate dataset abatzoglou et al 2018 already available until 2017 and the era5 reanalyses dataset of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf whose complete release is scheduled for 2019 with a higher spatial resolution than 0 5 these datasets enable analysis of drought patterns at finer scales a note of caution is that the introduction of other datasets not only provides information that is more complete but can also increase uncertainty especially if different input data lead to contradicting results e g occurrence or non occurrence regarding single drought events despite the large number of drought indicators currently in use heim 2002 mishra and singh 2011 we deliberately limited our analysis to spi and spei as the major objective of our study was to analyze meteorological droughts due to rainfall deficits and separately those forced by climate conditions that are both dry and hot this choice has its limitations and no sector based drought modelling was included the use of two indicators and multiple time scales however enlarges the potential applicability of the database while the events based on a 3 to 6 month accumulation periods are often used to investigate on agricultural drought impacts rhee et al 2010 those based on 12 month or longer time scales are often linked with hydrological drought impacts nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 for example in the near future we plan to consider also vegetation indicators to examine for example if the detected meteorological droughts have affected forests and green areas mccormick and gobron 2016 and how far changes in land use and land cover such as deforestation processes in the amazonia and the congo basins malhi et al 2008 megevand et al 2013 affect drought events and are interconnected with drought patterns candidate indicators are the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar myneni and williams 1994 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi peters et al 2002 the leaf area index lai carlson and ripley 1997 and the vegetation health index vhi bento et al 2018 in this study we have detected the following drought hotspots that have experienced a robust increase in drought frequency and severity between the periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2016 patagonia the mediterranean region the sahel the congo river basin north eastern china and though not unanimously agreed by all indicators central asia and southern australia using the same indicators methodology and regions that are described in this paper we are currently investigating the drought hotspots as the 21st century progresses preliminary results obtained using more than a hundred simulations from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex indicate that the hotspots of the last decades are projected to see a further increase in frequency duration and severity of meteorological droughts consequently it is important to implement efficient adaptation strategies to avoid severe economic impacts or even triggering irreversible land degradation processes in these areas these results and the likely increase of drought frequency and severity under a changing climate underline the need for efficient adaptation strategies 
8446,study region this study has three spatial scales global 0 5 macro regional and country scale the database of drought events has specific entries for each macro region and country study focus we constructed a database of meteorological drought events from 1951 to 2016 now hosted by the global drought observatory of the european commission s joint research centre events were detected at macro regional and country scale based on the separate analysis of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and the standardized precipitation index spi at different accumulation scales from 3 to 72 months using as input the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and climatic research unit cru time series datasets the database includes approximately 4800 events based on spei 3 and 4500 based on spi 3 each event is described by its start and end date duration intensity severity peak average and maximum area in drought and a special score to classify 52 mega droughts new hydrological insights for the region under study we derived trends in drought frequency and severity separately for spi and spei at a 12 month accumulation scale which is usually related to hydrological droughts results show several drought hotspots in the last decades amazonia southern south america the mediterranean region most of africa north eastern china and to a lesser extent central asia and southern australia over north america central europe central asia and australia the recent progressive temperature increase outbalanced the increase in precipitation causing more frequent and severe droughts keywords climate change drought events global database meteorological drought spei spi 1 introduction the complex nature of droughts makes them one of the most difficult climate hazards to perceive wilhite 2000 other recurrent weather related hazards such as heatwaves floods and windstorms can be skilfully forecasted in certain cases vitart 2006 komma et al 2007 lowe et al 2011 and in general unequivocally quantified and classified milly et al 2002 russo et al 2015 in addition a wide spectrum of impacts of such events is usually documented in the scientific and non scientific literature examples are deaths caused by a heatwave kovats and kristie 2006 tree fall after a windstorm schlyter et al 2006 or damages to infrastructures hit by a flood blöschl et al 2013 instead drought develops slowly its main characteristics such as the onset duration and severity are not easily quantified and impacts are often indirect non structural and spread over large areas dai 2011 consequently drought impacts are often not easily related to a given drought event and difficult to measure in economic terms there is no unique definition of drought as we can distinguish between meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic droughts mishra and singh 2010 depending on the hydrological compartment affected and or the related impacts drought impacts are often recorded incompletely or in a qualitative manner only ding et al 2011 in addition drought impacts depend on the exposure and vulnerability of affected societies and can be exacerbated for example by poor land management practices cook et al 2009 van dijk et al 2013 eventually leading to irreversible land and soil degradation cook et al 2014 reynolds et al 2007 wonkka et al 2016 marengo et al 2017 given the difficulties to analyze droughts mentioned above one consequence is that at the time of writing to our knowledge neither a global database of droughts nor a comprehensive global database of drought impacts exist one of the objectives of the european commission s global drought observatory gdo http edo jrc ec europa eu gdo is to incorporate amongst its features data regarding drought characteristics and their impacts in order to understand the relationships between both to do this the first essential step is to construct a global database of drought events and their characteristics which is the main goal of this study here we focus on meteorological drought which owes its name to the meteorological variables usually precipitation and temperature analyzed therefore meteorological drought can be defined as a prolonged lack of or below normal rainfall keyantash and dracup 2002 possibly aggravated by hot temperatures causing high evapotranspiration rates vicente serrano et al 2015 the role of temperature which is needed to compute potential evapotranspiration pet is still debated in the scientific literature dai et al 2018 in particular most formulations tend to overestimate pet compared to actual evapotranspiration in semi arid and arid hot areas sheffield et al 2012 dai 2013 trenberth et al 2014 van der schrier et al 2015 leading to uncertainties in the analyses of past and projected droughts dai and zhao 2017 consequently we investigated meteorological droughts driven by precipitation separately from those driven by precipitation and temperature this work builds on two previous studies dealing with the collection of meteorological drought events one focused on the carpathian region and over the period 1961 2010 spinoni et al 2013 and the other on the entire european continent and over the period 1950 2012 spinoni et al 2015a as in those two studies we used spi and spei at different accumulation scales however the new global database of events has specific entries for macro regions and for countries similar to spinoni et al 2015a while the current period of interest is 1951 2016 with planned updates every two or three years consequently in 2019 or 2020 the period will be extended to 1951 2018 and so on depending also on input data availability as in spinoni et al 2015a for europe here we assigned to each event a set of parameters as well as a special score based on duration severity intensity and area involved in order to compare events in different countries and macro regions the scoring system enables the differentiation of three classes moderate severe and exceptional droughts and a classification of the biggest meteorological drought events occurring at global scale during 1951 2016 the list of the biggest events together with time series of monthly maps 0 5 spatial resolution and statistics are hosted by the european commission s gdo the remainder of this paper is structured into three main sections section 2 focuses on methods applied to data collection computation of drought indicators and description of parameters for the single drought events section 3 focuses on results and describes separately the database structure the biggest drought events collected global drought trends and hotspots and the importance of temperature in meteorological drought analyses section 4 summarizes the most relevant findings and anticipates possibilities for further development of the database such as the incorporation of vegetation based indicators 2 data and methods 2 1 input data precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet the choice of input data was guided by four pre requisites medium high spatial resolution at least 0 5 if possible temporal range at least as far back as the 1950s global availability of daily or monthly precipitation and temperature or pet and high data quality consequently we selected two global datasets mostly based on station observed data the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc schneider et al 2008 becker et al 2013 dataset of the german weather service dwd and the climatic research unit time series cru ts harris et al 2014 of the university of east anglia from gpcc version 7 we obtained monthly gridded precipitation data for 1901 2013 at 0 5 spatial resolution and from cru ts version 4 01 we obtained monthly gridded precipitation and pet data for 1901 2016 also at 0 5 spatial resolution we analyzed data only from 1951 onwards due to the limited availability of station records before the 1950s in particular regarding precipitation at high latitudes and in tropical regions as the amazon rainforest schneider et al 2014 spinoni et al 2014 both datasets have been frequently used in climate studies for example in kottek et al 2006 rubel and kottek 2010 weedon et al 2011 morice et al 2012 trenberth et al 2014 and spinoni et al 2015b regarding precipitation we used data from the gpcc for 1951 2013 and from the cru ts for 2014 2016 to ensure continuity from 2013 to 2014 and over the entire period we tested the 1951 2016 series for homogeneity using the newest version i e 3 03 of the multiple analysis of series for homogenization mash szentimrey 1999 2006 software for each area we created a reference series using a varying number of grid points in the surroundings up to eight then we compared each single series with the reference series using mash this introduces a possible bias but we took it as a good compromise to exclude biased series given that we used grid point series only only 1 7 of grid points failed the homogeneity tests more than 90 of which are located in regions that we masked see next sections and fig 2 the remaining are mostly located in arctic russia in semi desert parts of the arabian peninsula and in the australian central outback for grid points that failed the tests and are located in regions of drought interest we used up to eight surrounding grid points to adjust the series after this procedure only 0 2 of grid points failed a second round of homogeneity tests and were excluded from the analyses the entire procedure was simplified by two facts both the gpcc and the cru ts data have the same spatial grid and share many stations used to create the grids becker et al 2013 schneider et al 2014 we opted for precipitation data from the gpcc instead of using the cru data only because we already successfully used them in previous studies at global scale spinoni et al 2014 2015b moreover the gpcc uses an interpolation algorithm over space and time which results in dynamic values over areas poor of stations becker et al 2013 while the cru sometimes uses the long term climatology for example over the amazon forest in the mid 20th century causing critical problems for drought indicators based on statistical distributions we highlight that the overall number of stations in particular those with precipitation data used to create the grids shows a decrease from the 1970s onwards becker et al 2013 consequently the analyses over the periods with the highest number of records from the 1960s to the 2000s are the most accurate regarding pet this is provided by the cru ts dataset which estimates it using penman monteith s formulation and based on sunshine duration temperature vapour pressure humidity and wind speed data allen et al 2006 to be precise pet data in the cru ts dataset are not estimated using real wind data but a fixed monthly climatology as well as sunshine duration and humidity data derived from other variables as temperature cloud cover and latitude harris et al 2014 the penman monteith approach requires many variables that are not easily retrievable from historical records over large areas however it is often considered the most suitable for drought related analyses trenberth et al 2014 dai and zhao 2017 although it is not free from criticism and other formulations are accepted van der schrier et al 2011 spinoni et al 2017 in particular the assumptions in the penman monteith approach refer to a surface of well clipped grass with a sufficient amount of water these conditions are not met everywhere and at any time moreover under water stress the actual evaporation aet tends to decrease while the potential evapotranspiration tends to increase brutsaert and parlange 1998 so when the conditions are very or extremely dry the penman monteith equation tends to overestimate pet and consequently the spei overestimates drought this limitation could be partly overcome with the use of the self calibrated palmer drought severity index sc pdsi wells et al 2004 which is less affected by this issue as it is based on an estimated actual evapotranspiration and might be included in the updates of the database as in the case of precipitation we tested the pet series for homogeneity before using them to compute the drought indicators in this case only 0 3 of grid points falling into the area of drought interest were rejected 2 2 drought indicators the spi and the spei as anticipated in the introduction we decided to account for the temperature related effects on drought events without discarding the droughts forced by rainfall deficits only thus we split our database of drought events in two sections depending on the indicator used the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 guttman 1999 which is based on precipitation only and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 beguería et al 2014 which is based on precipitation and pet which includes temperature following this approach we made our database more flexible and suitable for sectors sensitive to droughts and high temperatures williams et al 2013 naumann et al 2015 shukla et al 2015 in addition this approach allows us to exploit the database to consider how the past meteorological drought trends change at global scale including or excluding temperature effects as already evaluated at european scale spinoni et al 2017 both spi and spei are standardized indicators that fit the input variable s with a statistical distribution over a baseline and classify the drought conditions with a simple scheme related to standard deviations from the median in order to compute the standardized indicators we fitted the gamma for spi and log logistic for spei probability distributions over the baseline 1951 2016 the applied distributions are the most widely used in literature and recommended by the indicators original developers cressie 2015 presents a detailed description on the theoretical background of the distributions both indicators have been computed at multiple temporal accumulation periods from 3 to 72 months in order to let the user choose the accumulation period which best accounts for the sector of interest in this paper we focus on 3 and 12 month periods however in gdo the user will find results derived also for all the other accumulation periods as a baseline we decided to use the entire period 1951 2016 in order to fit the distribution on the longest possible time series and to derive robust results guttman 1999 moreover semi arid and arid areas can be problematic with meteorological indicators computed at short accumulation periods especially with spi in fact a notable number of zero values no cumulated precipitation for example for more than half of 3 month periods would result in unreliable estimations of the indicator for statistical reasons such as a gamma distribution fitted with too few non zero values cressie 2015 on the other hand fitting the difference between precipitation and pet over a short baseline period can result in problems computing spei due to climate change effects i e rising temperatures that are manifest in pet over recent decades ipcc 2014 in fact with a baseline of 1951 1980 for example spei values of recent years or decades may be unrealistic because recent differences between precipitation and pet fall outside the range recorded during the baseline period thus biasing the fit of the statistical distribution 2 3 meteorological drought events definition and parameters in this section we use spei 3 as an example however all definitions and explanations apply to both spi and spei at any accumulation period in this study a drought event starts once the analyzed indicator falls below the value corresponding to a given negative standard deviation e g spei 3 σ for at least two consecutive months and ends when the indicator rises above 0 usually the threshold for the start of the event is 1 mckee et al 1993 in this study this is valid when a drought event is evaluated for individual grid points since 1 corresponds to 1σ for the indicators however this is not valid for a country or region which contains a non unitary number of grid points so how do we define whether a country or region is affected by a drought event firstly we computed country time series by averaging the time series at grid point level in that country secondly we calculated the standard deviation over the averaged time series e g σ 0 75 thirdly we used the new standard deviation as a threshold in this example a drought event starts once the indicator is below 0 75 for at least two consecutive months with the two months criterion we excluded the very short droughts one month only which are rarely impacting differently than flash floods and could outstandingly increase the number of events of low importance in the database as for grid points also at country or regional scales the drought event ends when the indicators become positive in this study after the end of a drought event at least 2 months should pass before a new event is considered fig 1 shows as an example the country series of spei for four accumulation periods for argentina it demonstrates that at country scale there is no need that the drought indicator falls below 1 for a drought event in red to start however when the database is implemented in gdo the user will also have access to the indicator values at grid point scale 0 5 as shown for example in fig 2 which represents the month of august 2015 which between 1951 and 2016 and according to the spei 3 shows the largest percentage of global land areas under meteorological drought conditions 27 4 all numbers reported in this paper and statistics included in gdo do not consider the masked areas in fig 2 other than antarctica not shown in this paper we excluded deserts condition average precipitation pet ratio for 1951 2016 below 0 05 and cold areas condition average pet for 1951 2016 below 365 mm as was done previously in spinoni et al 2014 the database collects drought events for countries and at a larger spatial scale for macro regions we focus on countries because most of the drought impacts registered in open online e g the em dat database see https www emdat be and proprietary e g munichre 2019 databases deal with country data macro regions are included because we aim to classify the mega droughts of the last decades possibly involving multiple countries or even different climatological regions regarding countries we included only those having an extent of at least three grid points and at least 95 of valid data over 1951 2016 for both the spi and the spei at 3 and 12 month accumulation periods thus we discarded small islands and very small countries and collected drought events for 171 countries moreover we performed the analyses and collected events for 23 macro regions following the same procedure for countries see fig 3 and table 1 for the corresponding acronyms the macro regions are similar to those described in giorgi 2006 with some exceptions we excluded high latitude cold areas e g greenland and the sahara the borders do not perfectly match with those in giorgi 2006 as we aimed at macro regions with roughly comparable dimensions excluding alaska ala northern europe neu and northern asia nas all regions range between approximately 3 and 8 million km2 for each drought event we assigned a set of parameters describing its key characteristics table 2 start and end month and year duration severity intensity average area in drought conditions during the event lowest indicator value and the widest area in drought conditions the last two parameters with corresponding month and year as in spinoni et al 2015a we calculated severity as the sum in absolute values of indicator values during the drought event and intensity as the ratio between severity and duration finally we calculated a special score allowing for an overall comparison of events see section 2 4 the drought duration severity and average area were then used to investigate drought trends at various spatial scales see section 3 moreover to each event we assigned information on the indicator and accumulation period used a country code and two numbers referring to the number of the event for that country or macro region in the entire database in gdo each drought event has a unique 30 character code that helps searching for a particular event 2 4 a special scoring system to compare droughts at different scales in the last few years whether in the newspapers on the internet or in the media in general it is not uncommon to find popular claims that the latest event for example the california drought of 2014 science news 2014 moscow s heatwave in summer 2016 russia beyond 2016 or the south asia flood of 2017 the guardian 2017 broke century or millennial records sometimes these claims are based on robust data and analyses but sometimes not one of the goals of this study is to define a methodology that can compare and classify drought events at different locations we emphasize that our approach focuses on drought events not drought conditions thus it differs from drought classifications such as in the united states drought monitor svoboda et al 2002 and in the european drought observatory sepulcre canto et al 2012 table 3 shows how our special scoring system for drought events derives from the aggregation of six parameters the first two deal with the severity and intensity and assign a score from 0 to 5 points depending on how the event compared with all events included in our database for the selected drought indicator and accumulation period at national or macro regional scale severity and intensity as defined in this study are often mutually exclusive as the typical severe event is slowly developing and long lasting whilst an intense event such as a flash drought usually lasting just a few months has a sudden severe breakthrough and ends in a few months severity and intensity are important features of droughts as they relate to impacts affecting different sectors for example a severe event is more likely to affect the hydrological cycle van loon 2015 and an intense event is more likely to affect soil moisture hayes et al 1999 according to spei 12 in our database one example of an exceptionally severe drought is the event in the mid 1950s in the united states also known as the 1950s texas drought woodhouse and overpeck 1998 on the other hand an example of an exceptionally intense drought is that in the philippines during the infamous 1997 1998 el niño event mcphaden 1999 the wider the area the bigger the chance that the event caused remarkable impacts sheffield et al 2009 thus the third parameter the average percentage of area in drought conditions during the event assigns up to 5 points the philippines drought in 1997 1998 was not only exceptionally intense but also covered on average more than 80 of the national territories thus this event receives 4 points in this category extra points one for each feature are given if for a given country or macro region the drought event is the longest most severe most intense or widest in the period 1951 2016 we underline that these thresholds though based on percentiles are necessarily subjective choices the last two categories in table 3 regard the drought peak which in some occasions could be linked with the largest impacts as occurred for the central european drought and heatwave in the summer of 2003 fink et al 2004 ciais et al 2005 we considered two different peaks the maximum intensity and the largest area hit by a drought for example the 1950s drought in the united states receives 3 points in the peak area category as its maximum extension exceeded 1 million km2 stahle and cleaveland 1988 based on the total number of points the drought events are divided into three classes moderate severe and exceptional the definition of an extreme event is therefore different from that applied in previous studies spinoni et al 2013 2015a using the spei 12 our database contains for example 72 exceptional events at macro regional scale without considering events involving more than a macro region 85 severe events and 112 moderate events at macro regional scale the event with the highest total score 20 is the drought over southern south america in 2008 2009 which caused more than four billion dollar of damages to argentinian farmers bbc news 2009 inter press service 2009 united states department of agriculture 2008 this event also features in our database at country scale for argentina score 21 uruguay score 16 and paraguay score 16 in this study the special scoring described above has been applied to each detected drought event for both drought indicators and at all spatial scales and accumulation periods we then used the special score derived from the spei 12 indicator at macro regional scale in order to list the biggest mega droughts from 1951 to 2016 depending on the indicator and accumulation period analyzed this list might change to some extent however extreme droughts will reflect significantly in all indicators and accumulation periods it should be also borne in mind that the proposed classification system should be viewed as a first attempt which may be refined in planned updates of the database although the three main classes should not be used in a quantitative way they do however follow an objective classification system partly inspired by round table discussions with experts during the 2017 european drought observatory user meeting vogt et al 2017 in this study we focused on country and macro regional scales to assign the single parameters and the special score to drought events this choice has limitations when for example a country is large and a drought event occurs in a relatively small part of the country only in such a case it can be missed or the statistics at country scale might not represent its characteristics in a proper way in fig 4 we show some country and macro regional time series for the spei 3 and how the user can investigate single events month by month in the web platform of gdo an example are the united states which suffered multiple droughts between 2011 and 2017 los angeles times 2017 in particular over the south west and central plains according to our data the most severe period started in autumn 2011 and ended early 2013 a in fig 4 special score for the united states is 16 exceptional drought but another peak was observed in spring 2015 b in fig 4 special score is 9 severe drought which corresponds to the exacerbation of drought in california usc 2015 in our database the events a and b can be found for both the united states and the macro region wna but no information on the location can be inferred from the statistical parameters associated to them however on the gdo website the user can visualize not only the country or macro region series and the associated droughts with their parameters but also the gridded indicators in this way the geographical features of the drought events can be visualized fig 4 right column one of the planned improvements for our database is the choice of more refined macro regions and the splitting of large countries in the current version we already did this for russia divided into european and asian russia in this way one can better characterize events like the one that hit western russia in summer 2010 russo et al 2015 c in fig 4 3 results and discussions 3 1 the database of drought events the new global database of meteorological drought events is subdivided according to the indicator and accumulation period considered in this section we focus on the spei 12 and spi 12 indicators providing also some statistics on the events derived from spei 3 and spi 3 data and events derived from other accumulation periods are available in gdo for countries at the global level and based on spei 3 the overall number of drought events collected is 4827 while based on spi 3 it is slightly smaller 4504 for longer accumulation periods i e spei 12 and spi 12 the numbers are smaller 1992 and 1947 respectively of course any event that spread over two or more countries is assigned to more than one country such large scale events are also included in the database dedicated to macro regions where based on spei 3 and spi 3 the user will find 617 and 614 events respectively and based on spei 12 and spi 12 269 and 266 events respectively in section 3 2 we validate the list of the 52 detected mega droughts between 1951 and 2016 checking their effective reporting in the scientific literature and media having a limited number of exceptional events to check makes it a feasible validation exercise but looking for a confirmation of more than 4000 events is barely impossible in reasonable time thus we focus on europe which is made of three macro regions see table 1 and as reference we used the independent european drought reference edr and european drought impact report inventory edii databases http www geo uio no edc droughtdb index php including events and impacts collected as part of the drought r spi project stahl et al 2016 we highlight that this database was created based on impact reports so it might suffer from a distribution of events biased towards the later decades we also highlight that no real quantitative comparison can be done so the validation is qualitative presence or absence of the events table 4 details how many of the 37 drought events included in the edr edii database period 1951 2012 can be found in our database depending on which input indicator and time scale we used to make the comparison we used the events per country in our database if the event in the edr edii is labelled with a single country and we used the events per macro region if the event in the edr edii is labelled with a region e g scandinavia in edr edii corresponds to northern europe in our database 30 out of 37 events i e the 81 are included in our database in at least one of the four subsets analyzed and 30 out of 36 events i e 83 if we consider the drought in europe and northern europe in spring 2012 as a single event in our database however many more than 37 drought events are reported for europe in the period 1951 2012 as an example we take the case of greece according to the edr edii five droughts occurred in greece in that period 1989 1990 1999 2002 2006 and 2007 labelled as eastern europe in edr in our database and according to the spei 12 one can find eight events 1957 1977 1978 1985 1986 1989 1991 1992 1995 2000 2002 2007 2009 including all those in edr edii with the exception of the one in 2006 which is contained in our database if the spei 3 is selected as input indicator this example suggests that a combined use of the edr edii database with ours is a viable option for analysing past drought events over europe users can exploit our database to discover for example which countries experienced the largest increase or decrease in drought frequency between the periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2016 according to spei 12 four of the top 10 countries showing the largest increase in drought frequency between these periods are in the mediterranean region italy ranked first tunisia montenegro spain while five are in the sahel and central western africa liberia chad niger cameroon central african republic the same areas are hotspots according to spi 12 because the corresponding top 10 countries include two mediterranean countries albania spain and six sub saharan countries south sudan ranked first central african republic chad ethiopia ghana cameroon conversely both spei 12 and spi 12 highlight north eastern europe as the region with the largest decrease of drought frequency during the last decades according to spei 12 four of the top 10 countries with the largest decrease in drought frequency are iceland sweden finland european russia also georgia and armenia while using spi 12 we find the same four countries plus latvia and poland table 5 shows the difference in frequency and severity of drought events between the periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2016 for macro regions five macro regions show an increase in both frequency and severity mediterranean med equatorial and southern africa eqf saf central and eastern asia cas eas and four show a corresponding decrease in both quantities central north america can northern and north eastern europe neu nee southern asia sas the largest combined increases are in the mediterranean region and equatorial africa using the classification shown in table 3 and applied to macro regions the largest increases of extreme drought events are in western north america the mediterranean region and eastern africa based on spei 12 and in eastern western and southern africa and eastern asia based on spi 12 to summarize fig 5 shows all of the detected drought events at macro regional scale between 1951 and 2016 according to the spei 12 in the 1950s and 1960s north and south america and northern europe were hit by frequent extreme events the 1970s saw the overall smallest number of droughts in the 1980s north america and the sahel were the most hit by droughts while the 1970s and early 1990s saw fewer droughts than other periods from the late 1990s up to the present southern europe africa most of asia and southern australia show a tendency towards more frequent droughts with a couple of huge events over eastern asia and australia that lasted three years or more one example is the millennium drought over south east australia that lasted from the late 1990s until 2009 heberger 2012 van dijk et al 2013 3 2 the biggest drought events from 1951 to 2016 using the scoring system reported in table 3 and selecting spei 12 as the input indicator we found 52 exceptional drought events at macro regional scale score 11 which we named mega droughts for this task we chose spei 12 as it includes temperature and detects droughts forced by mega heatwaves such as that in summer 2003 over central europe rebetez et al 2006 moreover a medium accumulation scale filters the flash droughts but detects seasonal and annual drought events spinoni et al 2015a the most important drawback is that some events might be recorded in our database with a few months delay especially when they break out suddenly mega droughts encompassing two or more macro regions can show smaller scores in one of the regions as the event can be centred over the borders between regions the list of the mega droughts during 1951 2016 table 6 has been validated through a careful search of scientific papers and reliable media reports out of 52 events only one could not be traced thus we can estimate an accuracy of 98 of course this validation does not check if an event has been omitted over all possible droughts as this would be unfeasibly complex and time consuming however we highlight the fact that other regionally widespread droughts such as the amazon drought of 2005 zeng et al 2008 are classified as severe and consequently are included in the database but not in table 6 because this is a list of exceptional events at very large scale thus missing well known droughts may be included in our database under a different class furthermore as table 6 is based on input data until december 2016 there are a few droughts that were still ongoing at the end of 2016 consequently the parameters of such events could change in updated versions of the database we should also mention that for recent droughts it was not always easy to find scientific information for validation as usually publications based on research projects or phd theses focusing on specific drought events are published with considerable delays table 6 provides an overview of the periods that experienced big droughts during 1951 2016 four exceptional droughts occurred in the 1950s one of which encompassed three macro regions central america eastern and central north america the 1960s were characterized by six exceptional events two ending in the 1970s none having a special score higher than 16 also the 1970s saw six exceptional events while the 1980s had five such events an increasing trend is evident from the early 1990s onwards eight exceptional events in the 1990s thirteen in the 2000s and ten during 2010 2016 if we compare the number of exceptional events during 1951 1980 16 versus 1981 2016 36 the tendency towards more frequent exceptional droughts is evident table 6 also includes some details on the drivers and sectorial impacts of the 52 mega droughts a recurrent feature of the events listed in table 6 is the correlation between strong el niño events and mega droughts such as 1982 1983 1997 1998 and 2014 2016 wang et al 2017 on the other hand extreme droughts and la niña events are less frequently correlated e g 1988 1989 and 2010 2011 more details about el niño and la niña events can be found in trenberth 1997 3 3 global drought tendencies from 1951 1980 to 1981 2016 we used time series of the spei 12 and spi 12 indicators to investigate drought trends specifically we compared the frequency fig 6 and average severity fig 7 of drought events during the periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2016 some areas experienced increased drought frequency based on both indicators but larger based on spei 12 the u s east coast amazonia and north eastern brazil patagonia the mediterranean region most of africa north eastern china the most relevant decrease is in northern argentina uruguay and northern europe compared to 1951 1980 during 1981 2016 the meteorological droughts were more severe for both spei 12 and spi 12 over north western u s parts of patagonia and southern chile the sahel the congo river basin southern europe north eastern china and south eastern australia conversely eastern u s south eastern brazil northern europe and central northern australia experienced less severe droughts combining the results in figs 6 and 7 we can identify the hotspots hit by more frequent and more severe meteorological droughts in the last decades patagonia the mediterranean region the sahel the congo river basin north eastern china the same hotspots were indicated by sheffield et al 2012 dai 2011 2013 spinoni et al 2014 and dai and zhao 2017 though the spatial borders do not perfectly overlap because of the use of different indicators e g the palmer drought severity index palmer 1965 and time periods patagonia and southern south america however represents an exception as it is not considered a hotspot in sheffield et al 2012 and only limited areas in southern chile and argentina show a trend towards more frequent droughts according to dai 2013 spinoni et al 2014 and dai and zhao 2017 the main reason for the discrepancy concerns the climate data that were included in the different studies in dai 2013 and spinoni et al 2014 these extended only until 2010 in dai and zhao 2017 only until 2012 in sheffield et al 2012 only until 2008 and in our study until 2016 according to table 6 an extreme drought hit argentina and chile in 2008 2010 and this event could not be taken into account in sheffield et al 2012 moreover in our database for spei 12 out of eleven droughts over southern south america in 1951 2016 three occurred in 2008 2016 specifically 2008 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 naumann et al 2019 regarding the areas in drought fig 8 our results agree with the previously cited studies at global level and according to spei 12 a small increase is observable especially after the mid 1990s since no significant trend is found according to spi 12 the trend documented by spei 12 is likely temperature driven the macro regions with a tendency towards a higher percentage of areas in drought are southern south america ssa the mediterranean region med central and eastern asia cas and eas the entire african continent south of the sahara waf eaf eqf and saf 3 4 the role of temperature in meteorological drought table 7 shows the average global shifts between 1951 1980 and 1981 2016 according to the spei 12 indicator the increase of drought frequency is approximately 9 7 and the absolute increase of areas in drought is 3 3 according to spi 12 however an opposite slight decrease of drought frequency and areas in drought can be observed on average both indicators point towards longer more severe and slightly more intense droughts but they diverge on drought frequency and areas in drought table 7 the difference between the two indicators is small for drought frequency in 1951 1980 with spei 12 showing a smaller number of events compared to spi 12 over semi arid areas in kazakhstan uzbekistan and northern china fig 9 in 1951 1980 spei 12 shows a larger drought severity compared to spi 12 over northern colombia and venezuela bolivia and semi arid areas in western argentina whilst fewer severe events are shown especially over southern central australia in 1981 2016 the differences between the indicators are greater due to the progressive temperature increase in the last decades ipcc 2014 with the largest differences over southern africa and western australia regarding drought frequency and over western amazonia the sahel central asia mongolia and southern australia regarding drought severity the role of temperature in meteorological droughts is crucial dai et al 2018 and the methodology to estimate evapotranspiration has been frequently debated van der schrier et al 2011 trenberth et al 2014 spinoni et al 2017 in this study we used the penman monteith approach allen et al 2006 which is generally considered more robust than two of the most used approaches hargreaves samani hargreaves and samani 1985 samani 2000 and thorntwaite thornthwaite 1948 however particularly for short accumulation periods spei can be problematic in semi arid areas and tends to overestimate drought severity compared with spi because of the difficulty to estimate potential evapotranspiration pet in such conditions e g hernandez and uddameri 2014 examples are north western chile the arabian peninsula mountainous regions surrounding the aral sea the cold gobi desert and the australian outback fig 9 similarly to spinoni et al 2015c for europe we analyzed the change in precipitation and pet between 1951 1980 and 1981 2016 as shown in fig 10 to evaluate whether the drying or wetting tendency reflected by drought indicators was driven by precipitation temperature as included in pet or both the only input variable for spi is precipitation so an increase or decrease in precipitation is very likely to result in respectively a wetting or drying tendency for spi however over some countries the variability of precipitation plays a more important role than the mean change in guyana poland and libya for example spi 12 shows a slight wetting tendency despite a small decrease in precipitation conversely in armenia georgia oman tajikistan and bangladesh spi 12 suggests a drying tendency despite a small increase in precipitation this occurs in particular in small countries such as oman and tajikistan where arid and semi arid areas are predominant and consequently the computation of spi may suffer from biases fig 10 also provides a visualization of the geographical patterns according to spi 12 and with few exceptions in the last decades north america southern south america excluding chile central and northern europe central northern and eastern asia excluding north korea and japan and australasia experienced a wetting tendency conversely tropical south america southern europe most of africa excluding the horn of africa and south asia experienced a drying tendency the influence of temperature on drought trends is clear from fig 10 switching from spi 12 to spei 12 mexico canada central europe central and eastern asia and australia change from a wetting to a drying tendency and in most of the countries characterized by this change this is due to the increase in pet i e hotter climate which outweighs the wetting trend over the united states northern europe russia and south eastern asia the warming trend is not strong enough to outweigh the precipitation increase according to spei 12 the worst drying combination i e precipitation decrease and pet increase occurs over brazil the mediterranean region most of africa the middle east south asia and japan combining the information in fig 10 with the drought hotspots listed in previous sections we distinguish three different situations over the mediterranean region the sahel and the congo river basin the increase of drought frequency and severity is due to both precipitation decrease and hotter climate conditions over north eastern china the outstanding increase in pet due to hotter temperatures is the main driver of more frequent and severe meteorological droughts argentina with the exception of patagonia shows on average a decrease in drought frequency and severity for both spi 12 and spei 12 due to a precipitation increase and a very small decrease in pet especially at southernmost latitudes patagonia which was hit by recurrent long and severe drought events in the last decades exhibits a different behaviour 4 conclusions the presented global database of meteorological drought events during the period 1951 2016 contains thousands of events organized according to country and macro region each featured event is assigned a set of parameters that may be used as proxy variables for analysing potential drought impacts the database is also divided according to the spi and spei indicator and for various accumulation periods ranging from 3 to 72 months all entries in the database together with dedicated maps time series and charts are available to the public through the european commission s global drought observatory it can be exploited to look for past events to perform historical analyses and to compare current events with those that have previously occurred the information in the database can support the development of drought management strategies estrela and vargas 2012 and thus drought mitigation and preparedness efforts wilhite et al 2007 vogt and somma 2000 especially countries with a scarcity of long term high quality climatic data mirza 2003 can benefit from this country based historical dataset of drought events we have furthermore presented the first scientific results derived by exploiting the database such as trends in global drought frequency and severity between 1951 and 2016 which enables the identification of drought hotspots around the globe it is planned to update the drought database approximately every two years although this depends also on the updating frequency of the input datasets i e gpcc and cru ts a most recent update which extends the time interval of the gpcc dataset from 1891 to 2016 will be included in the next version of our database a limitation in our study is the use of two input datasets only an evaluation is currently underway of two other updating options the terraclimate dataset abatzoglou et al 2018 already available until 2017 and the era5 reanalyses dataset of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf whose complete release is scheduled for 2019 with a higher spatial resolution than 0 5 these datasets enable analysis of drought patterns at finer scales a note of caution is that the introduction of other datasets not only provides information that is more complete but can also increase uncertainty especially if different input data lead to contradicting results e g occurrence or non occurrence regarding single drought events despite the large number of drought indicators currently in use heim 2002 mishra and singh 2011 we deliberately limited our analysis to spi and spei as the major objective of our study was to analyze meteorological droughts due to rainfall deficits and separately those forced by climate conditions that are both dry and hot this choice has its limitations and no sector based drought modelling was included the use of two indicators and multiple time scales however enlarges the potential applicability of the database while the events based on a 3 to 6 month accumulation periods are often used to investigate on agricultural drought impacts rhee et al 2010 those based on 12 month or longer time scales are often linked with hydrological drought impacts nalbantis and tsakiris 2009 for example in the near future we plan to consider also vegetation indicators to examine for example if the detected meteorological droughts have affected forests and green areas mccormick and gobron 2016 and how far changes in land use and land cover such as deforestation processes in the amazonia and the congo basins malhi et al 2008 megevand et al 2013 affect drought events and are interconnected with drought patterns candidate indicators are the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar myneni and williams 1994 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi peters et al 2002 the leaf area index lai carlson and ripley 1997 and the vegetation health index vhi bento et al 2018 in this study we have detected the following drought hotspots that have experienced a robust increase in drought frequency and severity between the periods 1951 1980 and 1981 2016 patagonia the mediterranean region the sahel the congo river basin north eastern china and though not unanimously agreed by all indicators central asia and southern australia using the same indicators methodology and regions that are described in this paper we are currently investigating the drought hotspots as the 21st century progresses preliminary results obtained using more than a hundred simulations from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex indicate that the hotspots of the last decades are projected to see a further increase in frequency duration and severity of meteorological droughts consequently it is important to implement efficient adaptation strategies to avoid severe economic impacts or even triggering irreversible land degradation processes in these areas these results and the likely increase of drought frequency and severity under a changing climate underline the need for efficient adaptation strategies 
8447,study region southern ontario canada study focus the evaluation of possible climate change consequence on extreme rainfall has significant implications for the design of engineering structures and socioeconomic resources development to date there has been no comprehensive comparison or evaluation of intensity duration frequency idf statistics at a regional scale considering both stationary versus nonstationary models for the future climate projection to understand how extreme precipitation may affect future idfs we used an ensemble of three regional climate models rcms participating in the na cordex domain over eight selected rainfall stations across southern ontario one of the most densely populated and major economic regions in canada we modeled precipitation extremes at different durations using extreme value distributions considering parameters that are either stationary or nonstationary as a linear function of time new hydrological insights for the region extreme precipitation intensity driven by future climate forcing shows a significant increase in intensity for 10 year events in the 2050s 2030 2070 relative to 1990s 1970 2010 baseline period across most of the locations for longer return period i e 25 year we note detectable changes in design storm considering a nonstationary model than that of the stationary ones finally the results of this study are not only limited to develop nonstationary idfs for the future emission scenario but the proposed framework can serve as a basis to improve weather generator accounting nonstationary nature of extreme precipitation keywords extreme precipitation nonstationarity return period intensity duration frequency curves 1 introduction extreme precipitation events have significant societal consequences and important implications for urban and rural development public infrastructure agriculture and human health hatfield et al 2011 mailhot and duchesne 2009 ipcc srex 2012 rosenberg et al 2010 rosenzweig et al 2001 the review of literature across different regions of the world has indicated short duration sub hourly to hourly extreme rainfall is expected to intensify due to global warming bao et al 2017 fischer and knutti 2016 lehmann et al 2015 prein et al 2017 rastogi et al 2017 further a recent study zhang et al 2013 suggested the magnitude of increase in daily annual maxima am precipitation over northern hemisphere land areas is consistent with an increase in global mean surface temperature historical climate records indicate an increasing trend in annual precipitation over canada since 1950s often statistically significant kunkel et al 1999 shephard et al 2014 with an overall increase in mean precipitation of about 12 5 35 in southern canada during the period 1950 1998 ligeti et al 2006 one of the primary assumptions for designing intensity duration frequency idf curves for civil infrastructural design is based on the concept of stationarity in extreme rainfall intensity and frequency inferring parameters of probability density function describing extreme rainfall statistics are time invariant however as climate variability and change pose a challenge regarding stationarity assumption in the design of hydraulic structures this necessitates to investigate how changing climate information will be translated into the future idf development arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 milly et al 2008 willems et al 2012 the global climate models gcms the physically based models that provide information of current and future climate conditions are typically designed to simulate large scale atmospheric processes large scale models horizontal grid spacing of 150 300 km although there are different downscaling methods discussed in the literature viz statistical hayhoe et al 2004 2008 stoner et al 2013 and dynamical giorgi 2006 giorgi and mearns 1991 to capture fine scale regional information for impact adaptation and vulnerability iav studies at a daily time scale the perfect prognosis assumption i e establishing a statistical link between observed large and local scales of statistically downscaled climate variables makes them quite susceptible to gcm biases ines and hansen 2006 maraun 2016 the added value feser et al 2011 gutmann et al 2012 of dynamical downscaling method in improving spatial resolution typically by the factor of five ten times as compared to the host gcms allows modelers to widely use the downscaled climate information in iav studies ganguli and ganguly 2016 gao et al 2012 glotter et al 2014 li et al 2017 mailhot et al 2012 yang et al 2016 yoo and galewsky 2016 however a common problem associated with the use of regional climate model rcm outputs directly in hydrologic impact assessment is that the simulated precipitation exhibits significant biases teutschbein and seibert 2010 2012 which stem from the intrinsic rcm physics or from the errors in the lateral boundary conditions provided by the reanalysis data or by the host gcm schoetter et al 2012 therefore bias correction is often required to match rcm simulated rainfall to observations for impact assessment studies currently many large collaborative projects are generating downscaled climate information which is archived and publicly available several studies ekström et al 2005 fowler and ekström 2009 mailhot et al 2012 najafi and moradkhani 2014 have investigated these datasets for the analysis of precipitation extremes at a regional scale over north america and europe one such effort in north american domain includes the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap since 2006 which generated high resolution 50 km climate projections for the united states canada and northern mexico mearns et al 2012 narccap offers a suite of climate models consisting of six different rcms driven by four different gcms http www narccap ucar edu data model info html which helps in estimating climate uncertainties in multi model ensembles on a regional scale however the narccap simulations are available only at a limited 30 year period 1970 2000 historical and 2040 2077 future mearns et al 2012 and to project future climate scenarios the host gcms are forced with the sres special report on emission scenarios a2 emission scenario as applied in the coupled model intercomparison project phase iii cmip3 in this context the latest generation gcms that are part of the fifth phase of climate model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 involve over 20 modeling groups and more than 40 climate models offers higher horizontal resolutions improved parameterizations and additional physical process representation such as careful model tuning resulting in a slightly improved ability to simulate clouds and seasonal precipitation than that of its earlier version cmip3 kumar et al 2014 sillmann et al 2013a b sheffield et al 2013 lauer and hamilton 2013 the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex is a program started by the world climate research program wcrp to develop fine scale regional climate projections within the cmip5 modeling framework in the ipcc ar5 intergovernmental panel of the climate change fifth assessment report phase 5 stocker et al 2013 timeline 1 1 state of the art and research gaps in assessing extreme rainfall statistics so far most efforts to develop future idf curves are limited to individual cities or regions assuming stationarity in precipitation extremes chandra et al 2015 elshorbagy et al 2015 hassanzadeh et al 2013 li et al 2017 lima et al 2016 rana et al 2013 rodríguez et al 2014 vu et al 2017 one of the first attempts to derive future idf curves in canada by employing spatiotemporal downscaling of daily am precipitation at a local scale over 15 rain gauges at québec nguyen et al 2007 in this study a scaling relationship was introduced between the large scale climate variables and daily precipitation extremes using a stationary generalized extreme value gev model to temporally disaggregate two gcms hadcm3a2 and cgcm2a2 archived at the third phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip3 under a2 emission scenario and then derive idf statistics using stationary gev models results of their analyses reveal the idf statistics obtained from the hadcm3a2 showed small changes in the projected scenario while the values estimated from cgcm2a2 indicated a large increasing trend for the future however their analysis was based on statistical downscaling of older generation gcm simulations and limited to assessment of future rainfall statistics of québec province recently ganguli and coulibaly 2017 updated the historical idf statistics in southern ontario with augmented rain data from environment and climate change canada in general the analysis suggests despite apparent signals of nonstationarity in precipitation extremes in all sites the stationary versus nonstationary models do not exhibit any significant differences in the design storm intensity dsi especially for shorter recurrence intervals of up to 10 year comparison of new dsi with current design standard showed a required update up to 7 for shorter return period 10 year or less events typical for urban drainage design whereas for longer return period events 50 100 year updates ranging from 2 to 44 are suggested depending upon durations and return periods however to our knowledge in southern ontario no study has been carried out comparing the existing state of the practice the stationary versus the nonstationary dsis in the context of future climate projections the review of the literature wilby and dessai 2010 shows to date more scientific efforts are being towards characterizing the uncertainty in climate change projections rather than on developing robust adaptation strategies from a range of plausible climate scenarios effective management of climate induced risks requires robust characterization of the probability of extremes accounting for both historical nonstationarity and the likelihood of future changes diffenbaugh et al 2017 mote et al 2016 the cities across southern ontario the prominent economic hub bourne and simmons 2003 partridge et al 2007 are especially vulnerable to extreme climatic events given their larger population concentration property and aging infrastructure than any other part of canada hayhoe et al 2010 kling et al 2003 ligeti et al 2006 this study adds value to existing knowledge in several aspects first we use a suite of state of the art dynamically downscaled climate model simulations that are the part of north american coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment na cordex with boundary conditions as the latest generation gcms available at the cmip5 archive in general dynamically downscaled climate models allow simulation of topographic complexity and fine scale atmospheric dynamics and are not limited to either locations or length of records hence dynamically downscaled climate variables in general respond physically more consistent ways to external forcing giorgi and mearns 1991 wang and kotamarthi 2015 as compared to their statistically downscaled counterparts the added value feser et al 2011 gutmann et al 2012 of dynamical downscaling method in improving spatial resolution typically by the factor of five ten times as compared to the host gcms allows modelers to widely use the downscaled climate information in iav studies gao et al 2012 glotter et al 2014 li et al 2017 mailhot et al 2012 yang et al 2016 yoo and galewsky 2016 second we use an improved bias correction methodology taking into account of durations and site locations to derive regional idf statistics we evaluate the performance of quantile based both nonparametric kernel density based and parametric gev distribution based bias correction schemes to model regional am statistics which takes into account of the nonstationarity of the climate system maraun 2016 third for the first time we compare the stationary versus nonstationary idf curves in the projected period 2050s relative to the recent baseline 2010s period which may provide an interesting insight concerning to regional water management practices in southern ontario one of the heavily populated urbanized locations in canada 1 2 research objectives given these challenges the primary research objectives of the present study are to evaluate the credibility of the suite of dynamically downscaled climate model simulations participating in the na cordex program in attributing extreme rainfall statistics at different durations and return periods with reference to ground based historical observations to evaluate the impact of climate change on idf curves by comparing design storms of historical versus projected climate under both stationary and nonstationary conditions thus we performed a two way comparison between historical and projected idfs for impact assessment stationary future versus stationary historical and nonstationary future versus nonstationary historical to address these research objectives we characterize extreme precipitation frequency at different durations using the concept of t year return period i e likelihood of a particular event to occur once in every t year and develop stationary and nonstationary idf relations for the historical and projected time periods the typical planning horizon of 30 40 years is often used by climatologists to filter out natural variability as well as a tradeoff between data length required to perform nonstationary analysis wmo 2009 palutikof et al 1999 in this study frequency analyses up to 25 year return period are considered as the representative of rare and extreme events this return period length and durations are in agreement with previous studies kharin et al 2007 mailhot et al 2012 palutikof et al 1999 wehner 2013 which is a trade off between the bias and variance resulting from the length of the record analyzed i e 40 year and the fit of gev distributions owing to sensitivity to its parameters first the statistical characteristics of ground based extreme rainfall events for the historical period 1970 2010 centered around 1990 are compared with extreme rainfall statistics from an ensemble of regional climate models then comparative analyses of the future climate 2030 2070 centered around 2050 relative to the past are performed to estimate expected changes in extreme precipitation statistics since the 2050s represent a reasonable planning horizon for multisector stakeholders perspective ganguly et al 2015 hall et al 2014 watts et al 2015 we consider rcm simulations from 2030 to 2070 as the projected planning period a flowchart of this study is shown in fig 1 the organization of the paper is as follows section 2 describes study area observational data regional climate models the bias correction method and evaluation statistics section 3 presents historical evaluation at sub daily and daily scales at different return periods section 4 discusses relative changes in precipitation intensities under stationary and nonstationary conditions the summary and discussion follow in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 study region the study is conducted across eight rain gauge locations over southern ontario specifically the southwest northeast transect in the southernmost region of canada fig 2 the proximity to great lakes and topographic effect especially in areas to the lee of lakes erie lake ontario and the georgian bay significantly modifies the climate in the region baldwin et al 2011 convective storms and thunderstorms primarily modulate the summer rainfall but fall rainfall is dominated by reduced convective activity and increased lake effect precipitation baldwin et al 2011 lapen and hayhoe 2003 2 2 station based observational data since a recent observation based study has indicated a steady increase in

rcp8 5 hereafter meinshausen et al 2011 table s2 shows details of models and their spatial resolutions both cordex generation canadian rcms canrcm4 scinocca et al 2016 von salzen et al 2013 and crcm5 martynov et al 2013 share the common dynamical core however differ in nesting strategy employed and land surface and physics schemes whan and zwiers 2016 zadra et al 2003 we use rcm outputs to project future precipitation for the 2050s 2030 2070 considering rcp8 5 scenario for computational purposes all climate model outputs are regridded to a common grid point of 0 5 latitude longitude resolution using bilinear interpolation scheme the commonly used method for climate grid interpolation schulzweida 2017 grid based rcm simulations are downloaded at the four nearest neighbor values of station based observation and a distance weighted average remapping scheme was employed schulzweida 2017 since rcms on an average simulate a small amount of precipitation at a regular time step as a threshold for discrimination between wet and dry days a value of 0 1 mm day was chosen wehner 2013 the rcm simulations available at a daily time scales are temporally downscaled using a multiplicative cascade based disaggregation technique güntner et al 2001 olsson 1995 1998 rana et al 2013 the downscaled climate information is corrected by employing the quantile based parametric and non parametric bias correction methodologies panofsky et al 1958 further we consider a multi ensemble approach of rcm simulations multi model median and associated bounds defined by minimum and maximum simulation of am series to take into account the variability of the climate system hawkins and sutton 2009 2011 meehl et al 2009 while the ensemble median of climate simulations multi model median hereafter mm med represents the most likely case the ensemble minima multi model minimum hereafter mm min and maxima multi model maximum hereafter mm max are considered as the best and worst case scenarios ganguli and ganguly 2016 vousdoukas et al 2017 2 4 bias correction given the scale mismatch issues between rcm and point rainfall a bias correction is required to correct biases in the grid based climate model output we employ quantile mapping qm for historical 1970 2010 rcm simulations we also explore the effect of bias correction taking into account the duration and location of the sites on model performance for applying bias correction to climate model simulated rainfall different options are available for example bias correction can be applied to entire time series which then can be used to extract am series for the idf development on the other hand since only am rainfall is required for the idf development it is also possible to correct am precipitation li et al 2017 found that bias correcting am rainfall based on empirical distribution followed by frequency analysis yields design storm closest to the observations hence we employ quantile mapping bias correction on rcm simulated historical am time series in quantile mapping a quantile of the present day simulated distribution is replaced by the same quantile of the historical observed distribution maraun 2016 given a precipitation time series x the method is formulated as ines and hansen 2006 maraun 2016 vu et al 2017 1 x m c f o c 1 f m c x m c where x is the bias corrected precipitation f is the cdf and f 1 is its inverse of either the observations o or model m for the historical training period or current climate c condition since rcms simulate too many wet days the drizzle effect the qm is automatically able to adjust the number of wet days gutowski et al 2003 hay and clark 2003 based on distributional choices qm can be both parametric and nonparametric however for high quantiles where sampling noise is high nonparametric qm may produce noisy results maraun 2016 hence we evaluate the performance of both parametric based on generalized extreme value gev and nonparametric based on kernel density estimate kde distributions for qm of historical am series for parametric qm the gev distribution with three parameters location scale and shape is first fitted to observed and current climate model am series then cdf of the gev distribution is fitted to the current model data which is again mapped to the cdf of the observed data an inverse cdf transformation is then employed to bias correct am series of the modelled time series eq 1 for kde based bias correction nonparametric kernel density function is fitted to the am series mathematically kde f ˆ x is mcginnis et al 2015 2 f ˆ x 1 n i 1 n k h x x i where k h is the kernel function at a bandwidth h following a previous study mcginnis et al 2015 we employ gaussian kernel function and silverman s rule of thumb for h calculation however the basic assumption of qm is that the future distribution properties such as variance and skew remain similar to the reference period and only mean changes however owing to nonstationarity of the climate system this assumption may not hold true in the future li et al 2010 milly et al 2008 hence following previous studies li et al 2010 srivastav et al 2014 vu et al 2017 we applied equidistant quantile mapping eqm to bias correct projected am precipitation which is presented as follows 3 x m p x m p f o c 1 f m p x m p f m c 1 f m p x m p however eq 3 cannot guarantee that the corrected am series will have positive value for example multimodel minimum 24 hour am series in london and multimodel maximum 12 hour am series in toronto when kde based bias correction is applied hence in these cases following an earlier study wang and chen 2014 we employed equiratio qm to the am series using following mathematical expression 4 x m p x m p f o c 1 f m p x m p f m c 1 f m p x m p 2 5 detection of trend and nonstationarity in observed precipitation extreme we used non parametric mann kendall test with correction for ties and autocorrelation hamed and rao 1998 reddy and ganguli 2013 to detect signature of monotonic trends in the observed am time series at different durations d 1 2 6 12 24 hour in addition we estimate the trend using theil sen s slope estimator gilbert 1987 sen 1968 presence of nonstationarity in am rainfall record is detected using frequency based priestley and subbarao test psr test priestley and rao 1969 to increase the power of the test we relax the statistical significance of trend estimate to 10 significance level i e p value 0 10 2 6 extreme value analysis stationary and nonstationary gev models at a given return period and storm duration the average dsi is determined from the idf relationship the idf curves are based on fitting a theoretical probability distribution derived from the gev distribution to short duration am precipitation the approach can be implemented either locally at site or regionally rfa although rfa method can be employed when available record length is too small only 10 or 15 year record or at locations with no observations various rfa estimation methods have a number of limitations komi et al 2016 for example in bayesian method of regionalization the prior distribution of parameters are often not precise enough and do not add precision to the estimates in hierarchical approach the method may produce abrupt changes in the parameters from one site to another however in our case available records are of 40 year for both historical 1970 2010 centered around 1990 and projected rcp scenario 2030 2070 centered around 2050 which are more than the climatology typically a 30 year time slice is often considered as a climatology of a region hence here we employ at site frequency analysis method the gev distribution is a combination of three different distributions viz fréchet ζ 0 weibull ζ 0 and the gumbel ζ 0 depending on the sign of the shape ζ parameter the cumulative distribution function cdf of stationary gev model is given as coles et al 2001 5 g z exp 1 ζ z μ σ 1 ζ if ζ 0 exp exp z μ σ if ζ 0 where y max y 0 with sign indicates positive part of the argument μ is a location parameter and σ is a scale parameter the shape parameter ζ determines the symmetry and heaviness of the tail el adlouni et al 2008 for nonstationary gev model we incorporate time varying covariates into gev location gev i to describe trends as a linear function of time in years i e μ t μ 1 t μ 0 since we limit our planning horizon to 40 years and modeling temporal changes in shape and scale parameters requires long term records following an earlier study cheng et al 2014 we assume these two parameters as constant for estimation of gev parameters a bayesian inference is performed combined with differential evaluation markov chain de mc monte carlo mc simulation as suggested by cheng et al 2014 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 martins et al 2000 this approach combines knowledge from a prior distribution and the observation vector y y t t 1 n y indicates timeseries of am rainfall with sample length n into the posterior distribution of parameters ω μ σ ζ and λ μ 0 μ 1 σ ζ assuming stationarity and nonstationary conditions respectively the priors for the location and scale parameters are non informative normal distributions whereas prior for the shape parameter is a normal distribution with standard deviation of 0 3 renard et al 2013 de mc is an adaptive monte carlo markov chain mcmc algorithm ter braak and vrugt 2008 in which multiple chains here we fix chain length n 5 are run in parallel the resulting mc simulations are then run to an equilibrium since it is standard practice to discard initial iterations or burn in samples of simulated samples as they are strongly influenced by starting values and do not provide any usable information about the target distribution we run de mc simulations for 3000 iterations and kept 2001 30 00th iterations of each chain the convergence of the de mc simulation is checked by a potential scale reduction factor r ˆ gelman and shirley 2011 that suggests the value of r ˆ should remain below the threshold value of 1 1 the post burn in simulated draws from posterior distribution is then used to construct predictive distribution for the am time series the parameters are derived by computing 50th median 5th and 95th the lower and the upper bounds of the de mc sampled i e post burn in draws gev parameters constructing a 90 credibility interval for the design rainfall for stationary gev model the design storm intensity q p associated with t year return period is obtained using following expression coles and tawn 1996 6 q p μ σ ζ 1 ln 1 p ζ ζ 0 μ σ l o g l o g 1 p ζ 0 where p is the exceedance probability the computation of nonstationary dsi is similar to the stationary model except the inclusion of time varying location parameter cheng et al 2014 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 for nonstationary gev model the time variant location parameter μ t and time invariant scale and shape parameters are derived by computing the median and corresponding 90 credibility bounds of post burn in draws as explained earlier the model parameters are then used to estimate the nonstationary design rainfall intensity analogous to eq 6 7 q p μ σ ζ 1 ln 1 p ζ ζ 0 μ σ l o g l o g 1 p ζ 0 where μ is a time variant parameter given as μ ϕ k μ t1 μ t2 μ tn and μ t μ 1 t μ 0 where μ 1 and μ 0 are slope and intercept of linear regression ϕ k indicates a function to calculate kth percentile where k 50 yields the median of n location parameters μ t1 μ t2 μ tn 2 7 historical model agreement and relative changes to assess bias corrected models performance relative to observations we compute a skill score based on taylor diagram that takes into account of models spread and correlation reference to the observation taylor 2001 8 s 4 1 r σ ˆ f 1 σ ˆ f 2 1 r 0 s 0 1 where r is the pattern correlation σ ˆ f is the normalized standard deviation r 0 is the maximum attainable correlation calculated from the maximum of inter ensemble correlation apart from taylor s skill score metrics we assessed the model performance using intensity i versus duration d plots and vertical boxplots showing the relative difference between observed and multi model median climate ensemble at selected stations and return periods finally the percentage change between future calculated from mm med ensemble run and historical period is attributed to changes in precipitation extremes the statistically significant difference between future and baseline design intensity is computed using standardized z statistics which is given by madsen et al 2009 mikkelsen et al 2005 9 z z ˆ t future z ˆ t baseline 0 5 var z ˆ t future var z ˆ t baseline where z ˆ t future is the t year intensity obtained from the mm med climate model ensemble from a stationary nonstationary model z ˆ t baseline describes the same but with the present day condition the denominator indicates predictive uncertainty var z ˆ t future and var z ˆ t baseline are the estimated variance obtained from the t year event estimates and associated credibility interval the z statistic can be interpreted as statistically equivalent to quantiles of standard normal distribution i e z 1 96 and 1 64 correspond to 5 and 10 significance levels the null hypothesis of the test assumes that t year event estimate in the future planning period is significantly different from the baseline value 3 rcm evaluation of historical simulation 3 1 overall performance of rcms and bias correction methods although in gcm driven runs gcm output represents a perfect boundary condition for both historical and future climate simulations in this case model performance cannot be evaluated against individual events and hence comparison with observations is only possible for statistical attributes independent of time steps therefore we obtained statistics from bias corrected am series and compared it with observed am to comprehend if the model simulations are credible enough to project future climate change thus we obtain information on overall performance of each bias correction methods both kernel and gev based and its transferability to model extreme precipitation statistics at southern ontario next given the scope of the paper we limit our analyses to evaluation of extreme precipitation statistics as captured by return levels at various standard durations commonly adopted in engineering design from the historical simulation of gcm driven rcms against the ground based observations we evaluate bias corrected models performance using the skill score diagnostic metrics as described in eq 8 taylor 2001 while fig 3 presents a graphical assessment of individual models and their multi model ensembles skill in the form of heat maps across all durations tables s3 s7 show quantitative evaluation of bias corrected climate ensembles relative to ground based observations the skill score improves gradually from higher to lower temporal resolution tables s3 s7 the variability among models is small and a moderate skill score varies from more than 0 3 to 0 6 is noted for mm med climate ensemble across different durations table s3 among individual model performance regcm4 shows the highest skill score over oshawa whereas crcm5 exhibits the lowest skill over fergus shand dam for 1 hour am series likewise for daily am series regcm4 performed the best over london whereas the worst over trenton in many cases we found that the performance of a single model is better than or comparable to that of the multi model climate ensembles however as noted in the previous assessments ganguli and ganguly 2016 kumar et al 2014 martre et al 2015 min et al 2014 the main advantage of using a multi model ensemble is not the vast improvement over the best performing single model but the consistently better performance of multimodel runs considering all aspects of projection finally we chose the method of bias correction based on the skill score 3 2 analysis of trend and nonstationarity in observed precipitation extreme next we analyze the presence of trends and nonstationarity in the observed am series at different durations the rationale is to systematically evaluate whether present day time series show any signatures of nonstationarity table s8 summarizes the results in general we found presence of significant nonstationarity in five out of 8 sites in short duration precipitation records as confirmed by the psr test significant at 10 level while hourly precipitation extreme at toronto shows a downward trend significant at 10 level the daily extremes at oshawa and trenton show upward trends significant at 5 level however for none of the sites magnitudes of trend estimates are zero 3 3 simulation of gev shape parameter since shape parameter directly influences the nature of simulated extremes ragulina and reitan 2017 we compare the shape parameters of observed versus rcms for both stationary and nonstationary gev models table 1 presents the shape parameters simulated by mm med climate ensembles relative to baseline observation we found rcms simulates shape parameters reasonably well in most of the cases the shape parameters vary in the range of 0 30 to 0 30 table 1 for daily precipitation extreme the spatial average of observed shape parameters across the stations is ζ 0 13 with the highest in toronto ζ med 0 25 ζ med indicates shape parameter obtained from the 50th percentile of de mc simulated samples and the least in fergus shand dam median ζ med 0 05 on the other hand the spatial average simulated by mm med cordex rcms slightly overestimates the observed mean ζ 0 15 with the highest being in stratford ζ med 0 29 and the least in london ζ med 0 04 our results are consistent with a recent study ragulina and reitan 2017 which estimated a global average of shape parameter around 0 14 with a 95 confidence interval between 0 13 and 0 15 using daily gridded precipitation extremes from the global historical climatology network daily database version 2 60 further the authors showed for southern ontario estimates of shape parameter varies from 0 13 to 0 16 fig 5 in ragulina and reitan 2017 which is little different in our case given the fact that we are dealing with extreme precipitation and the ground based observations are subjected to biases resulting from multiple sources adam and lettenmaier 2003 new et al 2001 next we investigate the variation of shape parameter in nonstationary models table 1 the shape parameters for daily observed am series varies between ζ med 0 06 for fergus shand dam and ζ med 0 31 for stratford with an average estimate of ζ 0 19 on the other hand for cordex rcm we found models slightly underestimates the spatial average shape parameter ζ 0 16 which varies between ζ med 0 31 in stratford and ζ med 0 05 in london evaluation of shape parameter across different time steps suggests that the most positive shape parameter values occur for 12 hour storm duration in stratford in stationary simulation ζ med 0 34 and toronto in nonstationary simulation ζ med 0 41 respectively on an average the shape parameter simulated by the nonstationary model is higher than that of the stationary model indicating the former adequately simulates the presence of heavy upper tail or the higher likelihood of extreme events halmstad et al 2013 markose and alentorn 2011 3 4 idf uncertainty 3 4 1 translating parameter gev uncertainty in design storm estimation while in earlier section we discuss climate model error growth resulting from disaggregation and bias correction processes relative to observations using a simple taylor skill score in this section we further investigate the effect of gev parameter uncertainty of stationary time invariant versus nonstationary time variant models on the estimation of idf statistics to test the hypothesis we have chosen sub daily 12 hour precipitation extremes at toronto and daily precipitation at windsor as the representative observations based on the following rationale i toronto pearson airport shows the largest value of shape parameter for the nonstationary gev model at 12 hour duration ζ 0 41 ii both toronto and windsor is a good illustration of the temporal variability of extreme rainfall in 2011 windsor experienced the wettest year on record measuring 1568 mm rain compared to annual average rainfall of 844 mm ccap 2012 on 8th july 2013 over a 2 hour period the city of toronto experienced a significant flash flood event that produced 126 mm of rain on a single day boodoo et al 2015 iii both of these cities are among the largest metropolitan areas more than 100 000 inhabitants in 2016 https www12 statcan gc ca that make it a sensible case for rainfall induced flood hazard assessment figs 4 and 5 illustrate how uncertainty in parameter estimates translates into design storm estimates here we show density estimates of gev parameters and the 25 and 50 year return levels for the stationary and nonstationary models at 12 and 24 hour durations the probabilistic nature of idf estimates allows investigations of model uncertainty through the posterior histograms of the model parameters the posterior density of shape parameter for the nonstationary model in fig 4 departs significantly from the bell shaped gaussian distribution with a sharp peak around 0 4 with a very narrow credible interval this produces asymmetries in return level estimates for nonstationary models fig 4 bottom right most panel with sharper peaks as compared to the stationary models unlike sub daily precipitation extremes at toronto the density function of the gev shape parameters for daily precipitation extremes at windsor fig 5 for both models show a similar behavior with a wider credible interval the return level plots of fig 6 illustrates how the asymmetries in gev parameters translated into the uncertainty of return level estimates particularly for larger return periods the nonstationary models in fig 4 allow large asymmetry in shape parameter estimates which in turn gives a narrow credible interval for the nonstationary model in fig 6 left nevertheless the nonstationary models are in close agreement with empirical cdf the circles in red for lower return periods the uncertainty dominates at higher return period in which the stationary model performed satisfactorily on the other hand the credible intervals for stationary and nonstationary models at 24 hour durations in windsor are comparable to each other and the median return levels are in close agreement with the observation taken together the difference in design storm estimates at higher return periods i e 25 year are mainly due to differences in the scale of the ζ parameters of both models 3 4 2 simulation of idf statistics stationary versus nonstationary models next we compare the simulated idf statistics of observed versus cordex rcms fig 7 illustrates design storm estimates for t 5 10 and 25 year return periods at three selected station locations toronto international airport oshawa wpcp and windsor airport weak trends also have considerable impacts on results of exceedance probability porporato and ridolfi 1998 therefore we modeled nonstationarity considering time as a covariate in the location parameters of the gev distribution the uncertainty in design storm is shown using the vertical boxplots tables s9 s11 show parameters of the fitted gev distributions and the ratio between upper and lower bounds of corresponding dsis for 25 year return period table s12 presents a statistical performance of stationary versus nonstationary gev models for the durations of 1 and 6 hour using akaike information criteria with small sample correction aic c akaike 1974 hurvich and tsai 1990 the skill of the individual model as measured by the aic c statistics does not exhibit any consistent patterns either based on the locations or the storm durations in general we found cordex rcms able to simulate observed dsi reasonably well for all three locations tables s9 s11 and fig 7 tables s9 s11 show the fitted gev parameters for mm med cordex ensemble are close to that of the observed am series as noted from the plots the uncertainty in design storm estimates is higher for the lower storm durations d 1 and 2 hour and higher return periods i e 25 year further in general it is noted that the ratio between upper and lower bound is smaller for nonstationary models than that of the stationary models for all three sites at durations d 6 hour the simulated rainfall intensity with 25 year return period tend to underestimate the observed ones secondly for oshawa we note an increase in observed rainfall intensity in nonstationary models relative to the stationary ones at short durations of 2 hour and return periods t 10 year and beyond this may be attributed to consistent upward trend in am rainfall intensity across all durations in oshawa further we find at shorter durations in nonstationary models the length of top whisker in the boxplot tend to be longer than the bottom one indicating the model adequately describes the asymmetric nature of extremes our findings are consistent with an earlier study cheng and aghakouchak 2014 in which authors reported the difference between nonstationary and stationary rainfall intensities are more prominent at shorter durations and higher return periods and the differences gradually diminish at longer durations for detailed exploratory analysis we present relative changes in rainfall intensity for 1 in 10 year i e t 10 year and 1 in 25 year events respectively fig 8 while the top panel in the figure fig 8a shows stationary models the bottom one fig 8b shows the nonstationary ones corresponding to design rainfall intensity at t 10 year and 25 year return periods which can be themselves categorized as less and more intense events at lower return period t 10 year the relative difference between observation and the mm med climate ensemble is close to zero while the differences tend to increase at higher return period t 25 year a few exceptions exist for example london international airport shows large negative bias for 24 hour rainfall extreme 4 projection of future idf 4 1 projection of gev shape parameter in this section we discuss changes in shape parameter of simulated extreme in future relative to the baseline period table 2 compares the shape parameters of the gev distribution in the baseline 1970 2010 versus projected 2030 2070 scenarios table 2 shows during 2050s 2030 2070 the shape parameters tend to be negative across all durations irrespective of the nature of simulations a negative shape parameter indicates the gev distribution has a bounded upper tail i e an identified upper limit to those extreme events or a weibull type distribution implying a tendency towards heavy lower tail for stationary gev models the values of shape parameter are most negative at 12 hour duration and ranged from 0 57 at trenton followed by 0 49 at toronto to 0 06 at hamilton with spatial standard deviation of 0 29 at same duration for nonstationary gev models ζ values ranged from 0 66 at trenton followed by 0 65 at toronto to 0 33 at stratford with spatial standard deviation 0 09 these values in shape parameter are more negative than those conventionally considered as physically reasonable in hydrology literature martins et al 2000 when ζ is less than 0 33 the am distribution has an infinite third moment and when ζ is less than 0 5 the distribution has infinite variance as suggested by an earlier study morrison and smith 2002 a very negative value of the shape parameter suggests that the distribution of am precipitation tends to have a very heavy tail however we found at shorter durations 1 6 hour the ζ values ranged between 0 33 and 0 23 and well within the physically consistent limit 4 2 future changes in idf statistics table s13 lists the performance of stationary versus nonstationary gev models using aicc statistics for the selected i e 1 and 6 hour storm durations during projected time periods during the 2050s table s13 for 1 hour storm duration stationary gev model performs the best among six out of eight sites however for longer storm duration in this case 6 hour the spatial pattern is not consistent fig 9 compares projected intensity versus duration relations for 1 in 25 year events for stationary top panel and nonstationary bottom panel simulations the uncertainty in rainfall intensities at different durations are shown using boxplots the nature of intensity versus duration id curves follows a uniform pattern throughout to further evaluate how the future intensities are sensitive towards the choice of frequency analysis i e stationary nonstationary the boxplots of difference between future and historical dsis for 10 and 25 year events are presented in figs 10 and 11 the absolute changes in future dsi relative to baseline period are shown for two distinct cases stationary future versus stationary historical and nonstationary future versus nonstationary historical for 1 in 10 year events except stratford at all locations the quantile boxes are above zero for 24 hour duration for stratford at 24 hour duration the intensity of rainfall remains relatively unchanged over time as indicated by the locations of quantile boxes which is close to zero irrespective of the choice of the return period estimates for durations up to 6 hour the increase is observed for hamilton oshawa and trenton in contrast for 1 in 25 year events except a few cases eg stratford where quantile boxes are below zero for all durations for most of the sites the quantile boxes are above zero for short duration precipitation indicating an increase in precipitation intensity in the future period at 24 hour duration the dsi remains relatively unchanged for 1 in 25 year events fig 11 for all locations further for both events although the differences in dsi are apparent for durations up to 2 hour they follow the same trend irrespective of the choice of frequency analysis however the magnitude of differences fade away at durations of 6 hour and beyond to quantify the relative changes in projected intensity with respect to the baseline period we present heat maps of the difference in rainfall intensity of the 2050s versus 1990s for 10 and 25 year return periods figs 12 and 13 while the left panels of the figure show the z statistics indicating statistical significance of the change the right panel summarizes the median changes in projected rainfall intensities for the future relative to the baseline period expressed in percentage a positive value indicates an increase relative to baseline period whereas negative ones indicate a decrease for 10 year return period under stationarity assumption fig 12 top panel a significant increase in dsi is observed for rainfall extremes in all sites except hourly rainfall extreme at london airport in particular the projected increase ranges from 1 to 40 and 1 to 38 respectively assuming stationary and non stationary methods of frequency analysis for 25 year return period fig 13 the performance is mixed with a few stations exhibit an increase for instance 6 and 24 hour rainfall extreme in toronto 6 hour extreme in oshawa while others show a decrease i e 12 hour rainfall extreme in toronto and trenton 1 and 2 hour hour extremes in london and fergus shand dam respectively however considering stationary assumption none of these changes are significant fig 13 top panel in contrast to nonstationary assumption fig 13 bottom panel in which differences in dsi estimates are deemed to be significant taken together the following broader insights emerge for future precipitation extremes in southern ontario i for 1 in 10 year events an increase in dsi is observed across most of the stations and durations irrespective of the choice of frequency analysis ii for more extreme events i e 1 in 25 year detectable differences in dsi estimates are noted considering non stationary model in contrast to the stationary model 5 discussions and conclusions extreme precipitation poses a significant challenge to pluvial flood hazard management for cities across southern ontario owing to their densely settled urban infrastructural networks henstra and thistlethwaite 2017 we characterize extreme rainfall frequency using idf statistics with a suite of high resolution new generation regional climate model participating in na cordex domain with an elevated global greenhouse forcing rcp8 5 scenario since the study area comprises urban catchments the idf statistics are compared primarily for 5 10 and 25 year return periods the rcm performance in simulating extreme rainfall statistics in the present day climate is validated using ground based am precipitation records our analyses suggest the temporally downscaled na cordex rcm ensembles enable to simulate the observed idf statistics reasonably well further we modeled dsi using extreme value statistics using stationary and nonstationary gev models with a time varying location parameter the following conclusions emerge from the present analysis a robust bias correction methodology is employed to correct systematic biases in the rcm outputs for different time scales and across individual station locations however the skill of bias correction does not follow any specific trend either based on locations or the duration in the rcp8 5 scenario an increase in storm intensity for return periods up to 10 year is evident over most of the sites irrespective of the choice of frequency analyses for longer return periods i e 25 year a detectable change in dsi is apparent assuming a nonstationary form of idf than that of the stationary ones amid in a warming climate scenario this paper presents a proof of principal results to compare changes in extreme precipitation intensity in the 2050s using three regional climate models with the future atmosphere represented by the rcp8 5 scenario here we not only present a probabilistic framework to assess cascade of uncertainty owing to multiple model chains in future return level estimates but also evaluate all plausible combinations of dsis to understand whether the nature of spatial trends in future is sensitive towards the choice of frequency analysis in order to better prepare for a resilient planning in the changing climatic condition the review of literature indicates that it remained an open ended question whether we should consider stationarity or nonstationarity in precipitation extremes for estimating dsi using global land based database 1940 2009 of annual precipitation a recent study sun et al 2018 has indicated detectable changes at only 14 of the global land surface however the analysis was confined to a coarser temporal resolution while canada s national climate change assessment indicates an increase in average precipitation volume across several regions nationally bush et al 2014 short duration extreme precipitation only at a limited number of stations nationwide less than 5 show statistically significant increasing or decreasing trend shephard et al 2014 however the nature of trend differs regionally based on ground based precipitation records over ontario adamowski et al 2010 showed different parts of ontario reveal different trends in extreme precipitation although no spatial patterns or uniform rates were evident across stations finally results of their study indicate due to existence of trends as a consequence of either climate change and or natural climate variability the design storms in the future might occur more frequently depending on durations and return periods further based on elevated greenhouse gas emission scenarios a few studies have indicated an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation in southern ontario by the 2050s deng et al 2016 mailhot et al 2012 overall while exploring advantages and limitations of nonstationary versus stationary methods of analyses koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 serinaldi et al 2018 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 is beyond the scope of current study our analyses adds value in existing state of the art in multiple ways first our study bridge the gap between ground based observation and climate model based future projection studies especially for southern ontario by estimating design storm intensity taking into account of trend in the time series that may arise due to climate change and or natural variability and then we include impact of climate change on the idf statistics by considering the most aggravated greenhouse gas emission scenario rcp8 5 consistent with earlier findings deng et al 2016 mailhot et al 2012 we find an significant increase in rainfall intensity at 6 and 24 hour extremes for 10 year events over majority of stations irrespective of the method of frequency analysis secondly for 25 year return period we note an increase across several stations for different durations nevertheless in future projection magnitude of increase is more prominent and larger if we assume nonstationary form of idfs than that of the stationary model this might be a consequence of the nonstationary model that takes into account of trend in the data which the stationary model fails to consider in a few cases we find a decrease in extreme precipitation which could be a consequence of complex interplay between circulation local temperature and convective updraft changes wehner 2013 the relative mix of these mechanisms is a function of location and rarity of the extreme event as noted in previous assessments wang and zhang 2008 wehner 2013 the projected changes in gev parameters table 2 can reflect these mechanisms wang and zhang 2008 for instance circulation changes primarily influence the location parameter of the gev distribution followed by a little impact on the spread of the extreme values whereas moisture increase have a strong impact on all parameters including scale and shape parameters of the gev distribution resulting into a shift in the tail of the distribution to larger values wang and zhang 2008 in general based on the estimated gev shape parameters a negative shape parameter value for sub daily precipitation is not consistent with a positive value for daily precipitation this indicates the sub daily precipitation is bounded while daily precipitation is not bounded in this respect pooling data for different durations and estimating a single gev distribution in a simple scaling or multiple scaling langousis and veneziano 2007 can be helpful to handle this issue furthermore pooling data from neighboring locations and introducing a spatial covariate such as mean annual rainfall panthou et al 2012 can also be helpful to reduce uncertainty in parameter estimates some of the caveats of the study include the heavy computational requirement involving successive spatiotemporal downscaling of extreme precipitation at individual station level has limited us to use only three rcms however uncertainty in climate change projection results from both model responses and internal climate variability hawkins and sutton 2009 2011 a series of previous studies deser et al 2012 2014 kay et al 2015 wettstein and deser 2014 have examined the effect of intrinsic climate variability and anthropogenic climate change on climate projections using a multi member climate model ensemble such as either 40 member ensemble runs from national center for atmospheric research ncar s cesm large ensemble community project lens kay et al 2015 or a 50 member ensemble runs from canadian earth system model version 2 canesm2 arora et al 2011 these studies explored various aspects of uncertainty resulting from intrinsic climate variability and found substantial climate uncertainty on a global and regional scale the role of internal climate variability is considerably higher at a regional scale and in shorter lead time hawkins and sutton 2009 2012 therefore using three member rcms may not be sufficient to capture the full spectrum of climate variability by the 2050s projection horizon next findings presented here provide a conservative estimation of changes in return levels given a limited number of meteorological stations and climate model runs analyzed and cautions should be exercised when generalizing the results for larger spatial domain however this is indeed a common problem in most hydrologic frequency analysis as long length with good quality rainfall records is often not available for this study we select all those stations across southern ontario which contains the longest and best quality available records the same datasets have also been used in earlier assessments ganguli and coulibaly 2017 switzman et al 2017 and their use herein also facilitate further inter comparison third while hourly and sub daily extreme precipitation required for engineering design are often produced by convective events global and regional climate models are not able to simulate such events well because of models limited spatial and temporal resolution and convection is not explicitly resolved in these models zhang et al 2017 although high resolution convective permitting models may provide a reliable representation of local storm dynamics kendon et al 2014 these models still suffer from inherent uncertainties in simulating extremes hagos et al 2014 singh and o gorman 2014 the cascade of uncertainty may also stem from spatial and temporal downscaling of rcm output we assume that the selected bias correction method at the historical period is time independent and the same will holds good for correcting bias in the future period future research will be directed to include nonstationarity in idf curves considering temperature or large scale climatic oscillations as a covariate in the nonstationary model the temperature as a covariate allows interpretation of findings in terms of scaling rate between precipitation and temperatures that could be approximately comparable to 7 8 increase in extreme precipitation per degree rise in surface air temperature following the clausius clapeyron relationship prein et al 2017 the review of the literature suggests the influence of large scale climate oscillations such as el niño southern oscillation enso and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo zhang et al 2010 on extreme precipitation occurrences over southern ontario the inclusions of physical covariates in idfs can provide useful information to engineers and stakeholders to better understand the influence of regional climate variability on extreme precipitation occurrences and enables better use of climate model outputs the obtained rate can be translated to update historical idf parameters in a warming climate the methodology employed in the study can be extended to include any geographical locations around the globe to develop future idfs considering a range of physical covariates and to further assess cascade of uncertainty in return level estimates owing to multiple model chains finally the results of this study are not only limited to analyze the credibility of nonstationary rainfall idfs at a warming environment but also serve as a generic tool to improve weather generator furrer and katz 2008 kodra et al 2017 considering nonstationary

8447,study region southern ontario canada study focus the evaluation of possible climate change consequence on extreme rainfall has significant implications for the design of engineering structures and socioeconomic resources development to date there has been no comprehensive comparison or evaluation of intensity duration frequency idf statistics at a regional scale considering both stationary versus nonstationary models for the future climate projection to understand how extreme precipitation may affect future idfs we used an ensemble of three regional climate models rcms participating in the na cordex domain over eight selected rainfall stations across southern ontario one of the most densely populated and major economic regions in canada we modeled precipitation extremes at different durations using extreme value distributions considering parameters that are either stationary or nonstationary as a linear function of time new hydrological insights for the region extreme precipitation intensity driven by future climate forcing shows a significant increase in intensity for 10 year events in the 2050s 2030 2070 relative to 1990s 1970 2010 baseline period across most of the locations for longer return period i e 25 year we note detectable changes in design storm considering a nonstationary model than that of the stationary ones finally the results of this study are not only limited to develop nonstationary idfs for the future emission scenario but the proposed framework can serve as a basis to improve weather generator accounting nonstationary nature of extreme precipitation keywords extreme precipitation nonstationarity return period intensity duration frequency curves 1 introduction extreme precipitation events have significant societal consequences and important implications for urban and rural development public infrastructure agriculture and human health hatfield et al 2011 mailhot and duchesne 2009 ipcc srex 2012 rosenberg et al 2010 rosenzweig et al 2001 the review of literature across different regions of the world has indicated short duration sub hourly to hourly extreme rainfall is expected to intensify due to global warming bao et al 2017 fischer and knutti 2016 lehmann et al 2015 prein et al 2017 rastogi et al 2017 further a recent study zhang et al 2013 suggested the magnitude of increase in daily annual maxima am precipitation over northern hemisphere land areas is consistent with an increase in global mean surface temperature historical climate records indicate an increasing trend in annual precipitation over canada since 1950s often statistically significant kunkel et al 1999 shephard et al 2014 with an overall increase in mean precipitation of about 12 5 35 in southern canada during the period 1950 1998 ligeti et al 2006 one of the primary assumptions for designing intensity duration frequency idf curves for civil infrastructural design is based on the concept of stationarity in extreme rainfall intensity and frequency inferring parameters of probability density function describing extreme rainfall statistics are time invariant however as climate variability and change pose a challenge regarding stationarity assumption in the design of hydraulic structures this necessitates to investigate how changing climate information will be translated into the future idf development arnbjerg nielsen et al 2013 milly et al 2008 willems et al 2012 the global climate models gcms the physically based models that provide information of current and future climate conditions are typically designed to simulate large scale atmospheric processes large scale models horizontal grid spacing of 150 300 km although there are different downscaling methods discussed in the literature viz statistical hayhoe et al 2004 2008 stoner et al 2013 and dynamical giorgi 2006 giorgi and mearns 1991 to capture fine scale regional information for impact adaptation and vulnerability iav studies at a daily time scale the perfect prognosis assumption i e establishing a statistical link between observed large and local scales of statistically downscaled climate variables makes them quite susceptible to gcm biases ines and hansen 2006 maraun 2016 the added value feser et al 2011 gutmann et al 2012 of dynamical downscaling method in improving spatial resolution typically by the factor of five ten times as compared to the host gcms allows modelers to widely use the downscaled climate information in iav studies ganguli and ganguly 2016 gao et al 2012 glotter et al 2014 li et al 2017 mailhot et al 2012 yang et al 2016 yoo and galewsky 2016 however a common problem associated with the use of regional climate model rcm outputs directly in hydrologic impact assessment is that the simulated precipitation exhibits significant biases teutschbein and seibert 2010 2012 which stem from the intrinsic rcm physics or from the errors in the lateral boundary conditions provided by the reanalysis data or by the host gcm schoetter et al 2012 therefore bias correction is often required to match rcm simulated rainfall to observations for impact assessment studies currently many large collaborative projects are generating downscaled climate information which is archived and publicly available several studies ekström et al 2005 fowler and ekström 2009 mailhot et al 2012 najafi and moradkhani 2014 have investigated these datasets for the analysis of precipitation extremes at a regional scale over north america and europe one such effort in north american domain includes the north american regional climate change assessment program narccap since 2006 which generated high resolution 50 km climate projections for the united states canada and northern mexico mearns et al 2012 narccap offers a suite of climate models consisting of six different rcms driven by four different gcms http www narccap ucar edu data model info html which helps in estimating climate uncertainties in multi model ensembles on a regional scale however the narccap simulations are available only at a limited 30 year period 1970 2000 historical and 2040 2077 future mearns et al 2012 and to project future climate scenarios the host gcms are forced with the sres special report on emission scenarios a2 emission scenario as applied in the coupled model intercomparison project phase iii cmip3 in this context the latest generation gcms that are part of the fifth phase of climate model intercomparison project cmip5 taylor et al 2012 involve over 20 modeling groups and more than 40 climate models offers higher horizontal resolutions improved parameterizations and additional physical process representation such as careful model tuning resulting in a slightly improved ability to simulate clouds and seasonal precipitation than that of its earlier version cmip3 kumar et al 2014 sillmann et al 2013a b sheffield et al 2013 lauer and hamilton 2013 the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex is a program started by the world climate research program wcrp to develop fine scale regional climate projections within the cmip5 modeling framework in the ipcc ar5 intergovernmental panel of the climate change fifth assessment report phase 5 stocker et al 2013 timeline 1 1 state of the art and research gaps in assessing extreme rainfall statistics so far most efforts to develop future idf curves are limited to individual cities or regions assuming stationarity in precipitation extremes chandra et al 2015 elshorbagy et al 2015 hassanzadeh et al 2013 li et al 2017 lima et al 2016 rana et al 2013 rodríguez et al 2014 vu et al 2017 one of the first attempts to derive future idf curves in canada by employing spatiotemporal downscaling of daily am precipitation at a local scale over 15 rain gauges at québec nguyen et al 2007 in this study a scaling relationship was introduced between the large scale climate variables and daily precipitation extremes using a stationary generalized extreme value gev model to temporally disaggregate two gcms hadcm3a2 and cgcm2a2 archived at the third phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip3 under a2 emission scenario and then derive idf statistics using stationary gev models results of their analyses reveal the idf statistics obtained from the hadcm3a2 showed small changes in the projected scenario while the values estimated from cgcm2a2 indicated a large increasing trend for the future however their analysis was based on statistical downscaling of older generation gcm simulations and limited to assessment of future rainfall statistics of québec province recently ganguli and coulibaly 2017 updated the historical idf statistics in southern ontario with augmented rain data from environment and climate change canada in general the analysis suggests despite apparent signals of nonstationarity in precipitation extremes in all sites the stationary versus nonstationary models do not exhibit any significant differences in the design storm intensity dsi especially for shorter recurrence intervals of up to 10 year comparison of new dsi with current design standard showed a required update up to 7 for shorter return period 10 year or less events typical for urban drainage design whereas for longer return period events 50 100 year updates ranging from 2 to 44 are suggested depending upon durations and return periods however to our knowledge in southern ontario no study has been carried out comparing the existing state of the practice the stationary versus the nonstationary dsis in the context of future climate projections the review of the literature wilby and dessai 2010 shows to date more scientific efforts are being towards characterizing the uncertainty in climate change projections rather than on developing robust adaptation strategies from a range of plausible climate scenarios effective management of climate induced risks requires robust characterization of the probability of extremes accounting for both historical nonstationarity and the likelihood of future changes diffenbaugh et al 2017 mote et al 2016 the cities across southern ontario the prominent economic hub bourne and simmons 2003 partridge et al 2007 are especially vulnerable to extreme climatic events given their larger population concentration property and aging infrastructure than any other part of canada hayhoe et al 2010 kling et al 2003 ligeti et al 2006 this study adds value to existing knowledge in several aspects first we use a suite of state of the art dynamically downscaled climate model simulations that are the part of north american coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment na cordex with boundary conditions as the latest generation gcms available at the cmip5 archive in general dynamically downscaled climate models allow simulation of topographic complexity and fine scale atmospheric dynamics and are not limited to either locations or length of records hence dynamically downscaled climate variables in general respond physically more consistent ways to external forcing giorgi and mearns 1991 wang and kotamarthi 2015 as compared to their statistically downscaled counterparts the added value feser et al 2011 gutmann et al 2012 of dynamical downscaling method in improving spatial resolution typically by the factor of five ten times as compared to the host gcms allows modelers to widely use the downscaled climate information in iav studies gao et al 2012 glotter et al 2014 li et al 2017 mailhot et al 2012 yang et al 2016 yoo and galewsky 2016 second we use an improved bias correction methodology taking into account of durations and site locations to derive regional idf statistics we evaluate the performance of quantile based both nonparametric kernel density based and parametric gev distribution based bias correction schemes to model regional am statistics which takes into account of the nonstationarity of the climate system maraun 2016 third for the first time we compare the stationary versus nonstationary idf curves in the projected period 2050s relative to the recent baseline 2010s period which may provide an interesting insight concerning to regional water management practices in southern ontario one of the heavily populated urbanized locations in canada 1 2 research objectives given these challenges the primary research objectives of the present study are to evaluate the credibility of the suite of dynamically downscaled climate model simulations participating in the na cordex program in attributing extreme rainfall statistics at different durations and return periods with reference to ground based historical observations to evaluate the impact of climate change on idf curves by comparing design storms of historical versus projected climate under both stationary and nonstationary conditions thus we performed a two way comparison between historical and projected idfs for impact assessment stationary future versus stationary historical and nonstationary future versus nonstationary historical to address these research objectives we characterize extreme precipitation frequency at different durations using the concept of t year return period i e likelihood of a particular event to occur once in every t year and develop stationary and nonstationary idf relations for the historical and projected time periods the typical planning horizon of 30 40 years is often used by climatologists to filter out natural variability as well as a tradeoff between data length required to perform nonstationary analysis wmo 2009 palutikof et al 1999 in this study frequency analyses up to 25 year return period are considered as the representative of rare and extreme events this return period length and durations are in agreement with previous studies kharin et al 2007 mailhot et al 2012 palutikof et al 1999 wehner 2013 which is a trade off between the bias and variance resulting from the length of the record analyzed i e 40 year and the fit of gev distributions owing to sensitivity to its parameters first the statistical characteristics of ground based extreme rainfall events for the historical period 1970 2010 centered around 1990 are compared with extreme rainfall statistics from an ensemble of regional climate models then comparative analyses of the future climate 2030 2070 centered around 2050 relative to the past are performed to estimate expected changes in extreme precipitation statistics since the 2050s represent a reasonable planning horizon for multisector stakeholders perspective ganguly et al 2015 hall et al 2014 watts et al 2015 we consider rcm simulations from 2030 to 2070 as the projected planning period a flowchart of this study is shown in fig 1 the organization of the paper is as follows section 2 describes study area observational data regional climate models the bias correction method and evaluation statistics section 3 presents historical evaluation at sub daily and daily scales at different return periods section 4 discusses relative changes in precipitation intensities under stationary and nonstationary conditions the summary and discussion follow in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 study region the study is conducted across eight rain gauge locations over southern ontario specifically the southwest northeast transect in the southernmost region of canada fig 2 the proximity to great lakes and topographic effect especially in areas to the lee of lakes erie lake ontario and the georgian bay significantly modifies the climate in the region baldwin et al 2011 convective storms and thunderstorms primarily modulate the summer rainfall but fall rainfall is dominated by reduced convective activity and increased lake effect precipitation baldwin et al 2011 lapen and hayhoe 2003 2 2 station based observational data since a recent observation based study has indicated a steady increase in the global warming trend from the 1970s onwards rahmstorf et al 2017 we selected the baseline period for the current analysis from 1970 to 2010 station based historical 1970 2010 am precipitation time series at durations d 1 2 6 12 24 hour are obtained from environment and climate change canada engineering database http climate weather gc ca prods servs engineering e html for the eight rain gauge locations over southern ontario the available data is thoroughly quality controlled shephard et al 2014 and have been previously analyzed for the assessment of national extreme rainfall trends burn and taleghani 2013 shephard et al 2014 simonovic et al 2016 switzman et al 2017 the extent of missing values in the sub daily am rainfall time series ranges between 2 and 20 average 13 with the least being in toronto only am rainfall for the year 2005 is missing and the highest are in hamilton 1970 and 2004 2010 are missing and stratford 1973 1999 2005 2010 respectively we obtained daily and hourly rainfall records and daily maximum air temperature data from the environment and climate change canada eccc historical database http climate weather gc ca historical data we infilled missing values and updated the extreme precipitation records till 2010 by successively disaggregating daily rainfall values to hourly and sub hourly time steps using multiplicative random cascade mrc based disaggregation tool olsson 1995 1998 güntner et al 2001 the details of the disaggregation procedure of historical precipitation time series are described in supplementary section section si 1 table s1 figures s1 and s2 2 3 regional climate model the cordex north american domain involves several universities and partner institutions to simulate high resolution regional climate information horizontal resolution of 50 km driven by several gcms https na cordex org and archived at earth system grid esg data portal for regional impact assessment studies we used archived prediction data from three rcms available at na cordex domain the models include fourth generation of the canadian regional climate model canrcm4 driven by the second generation of the canadian earth system model canesm2 fifth generation of the canadian regional climate model crcm5 driven by canesm2 and regional climate model version 4 regcm4 nested in hadley center global environmental model version 2 hadgem2 es gcm the specific rcms are chosen based on their extensive use of high resolution multi decadal climate change simulations over north america in general and canada in particular and claim to simulate hydroclimate of southern ontario reasonably well ashfaq et al 2010 jalbert et al 2017 naz et al 2016 šeparović et al 2013 singh et al 2013 whan and zwiers 2016 using high resolution regional climate model regcm4 ashfaq et al 2016 developed a framework to dynamically downscale 11 gcms to a finer resolution over a north american domain including some parts of canada and mexico their results confirm the existence of clausius clapeyron scaling relationship at a regional scales that lead to an intensification of extreme precipitation at a rate of approximately 7 8 c 1 warming naz et al 2016 analyzed hydrological response to climate change over the united states using a semi distributed hydrological model variable infiltration capacity vic model forced with a ten member ensemble projections of precipitation and air temperature that were dynamically downscaled using regcm4 considering the business as usual high emission scenario the representative concentration pathways 8 5 rcp8 5 hereafter meinshausen et al 2011 table s2 shows details of models and their spatial resolutions both cordex generation canadian rcms canrcm4 scinocca et al 2016 von salzen et al 2013 and crcm5 martynov et al 2013 share the common dynamical core however differ in nesting strategy employed and land surface and physics schemes whan and zwiers 2016 zadra et al 2003 we use rcm outputs to project future precipitation for the 2050s 2030 2070 considering rcp8 5 scenario for computational purposes all climate model outputs are regridded to a common grid point of 0 5 latitude longitude resolution using bilinear interpolation scheme the commonly used method for climate grid interpolation schulzweida 2017 grid based rcm simulations are downloaded at the four nearest neighbor values of station based observation and a distance weighted average remapping scheme was employed schulzweida 2017 since rcms on an average simulate a small amount of precipitation at a regular time step as a threshold for discrimination between wet and dry days a value of 0 1 mm day was chosen wehner 2013 the rcm simulations available at a daily time scales are temporally downscaled using a multiplicative cascade based disaggregation technique güntner et al 2001 olsson 1995 1998 rana et al 2013 the downscaled climate information is corrected by employing the quantile based parametric and non parametric bias correction methodologies panofsky et al 1958 further we consider a multi ensemble approach of rcm simulations multi model median and associated bounds defined by minimum and maximum simulation of am series to take into account the variability of the climate system hawkins and sutton 2009 2011 meehl et al 2009 while the ensemble median of climate simulations multi model median hereafter mm med represents the most likely case the ensemble minima multi model minimum hereafter mm min and maxima multi model maximum hereafter mm max are considered as the best and worst case scenarios ganguli and ganguly 2016 vousdoukas et al 2017 2 4 bias correction given the scale mismatch issues between rcm and point rainfall a bias correction is required to correct biases in the grid based climate model output we employ quantile mapping qm for historical 1970 2010 rcm simulations we also explore the effect of bias correction taking into account the duration and location of the sites on model performance for applying bias correction to climate model simulated rainfall different options are available for example bias correction can be applied to entire time series which then can be used to extract am series for the idf development on the other hand since only am rainfall is required for the idf development it is also possible to correct am precipitation li et al 2017 found that bias correcting am rainfall based on empirical distribution followed by frequency analysis yields design storm closest to the observations hence we employ quantile mapping bias correction on rcm simulated historical am time series in quantile mapping a quantile of the present day simulated distribution is replaced by the same quantile of the historical observed distribution maraun 2016 given a precipitation time series x the method is formulated as ines and hansen 2006 maraun 2016 vu et al 2017 1 x m c f o c 1 f m c x m c where x is the bias corrected precipitation f is the cdf and f 1 is its inverse of either the observations o or model m for the historical training period or current climate c condition since rcms simulate too many wet days the drizzle effect the qm is automatically able to adjust the number of wet days gutowski et al 2003 hay and clark 2003 based on distributional choices qm can be both parametric and nonparametric however for high quantiles where sampling noise is high nonparametric qm may produce noisy results maraun 2016 hence we evaluate the performance of both parametric based on generalized extreme value gev and nonparametric based on kernel density estimate kde distributions for qm of historical am series for parametric qm the gev distribution with three parameters location scale and shape is first fitted to observed and current climate model am series then cdf of the gev distribution is fitted to the current model data which is again mapped to the cdf of the observed data an inverse cdf transformation is then employed to bias correct am series of the modelled time series eq 1 for kde based bias correction nonparametric kernel density function is fitted to the am series mathematically kde f ˆ x is mcginnis et al 2015 2 f ˆ x 1 n i 1 n k h x x i where k h is the kernel function at a bandwidth h following a previous study mcginnis et al 2015 we employ gaussian kernel function and silverman s rule of thumb for h calculation however the basic assumption of qm is that the future distribution properties such as variance and skew remain similar to the reference period and only mean changes however owing to nonstationarity of the climate system this assumption may not hold true in the future li et al 2010 milly et al 2008 hence following previous studies li et al 2010 srivastav et al 2014 vu et al 2017 we applied equidistant quantile mapping eqm to bias correct projected am precipitation which is presented as follows 3 x m p x m p f o c 1 f m p x m p f m c 1 f m p x m p however eq 3 cannot guarantee that the corrected am series will have positive value for example multimodel minimum 24 hour am series in london and multimodel maximum 12 hour am series in toronto when kde based bias correction is applied hence in these cases following an earlier study wang and chen 2014 we employed equiratio qm to the am series using following mathematical expression 4 x m p x m p f o c 1 f m p x m p f m c 1 f m p x m p 2 5 detection of trend and nonstationarity in observed precipitation extreme we used non parametric mann kendall test with correction for ties and autocorrelation hamed and rao 1998 reddy and ganguli 2013 to detect signature of monotonic trends in the observed am time series at different durations d 1 2 6 12 24 hour in addition we estimate the trend using theil sen s slope estimator gilbert 1987 sen 1968 presence of nonstationarity in am rainfall record is detected using frequency based priestley and subbarao test psr test priestley and rao 1969 to increase the power of the test we relax the statistical significance of trend estimate to 10 significance level i e p value 0 10 2 6 extreme value analysis stationary and nonstationary gev models at a given return period and storm duration the average dsi is determined from the idf relationship the idf curves are based on fitting a theoretical probability distribution derived from the gev distribution to short duration am precipitation the approach can be implemented either locally at site or regionally rfa although rfa method can be employed when available record length is too small only 10 or 15 year record or at locations with no observations various rfa estimation methods have a number of limitations komi et al 2016 for example in bayesian method of regionalization the prior distribution of parameters are often not precise enough and do not add precision to the estimates in hierarchical approach the method may produce abrupt changes in the parameters from one site to another however in our case available records are of 40 year for both historical 1970 2010 centered around 1990 and projected rcp scenario 2030 2070 centered around 2050 which are more than the climatology typically a 30 year time slice is often considered as a climatology of a region hence here we employ at site frequency analysis method the gev distribution is a combination of three different distributions viz fréchet ζ 0 weibull ζ 0 and the gumbel ζ 0 depending on the sign of the shape ζ parameter the cumulative distribution function cdf of stationary gev model is given as coles et al 2001 5 g z exp 1 ζ z μ σ 1 ζ if ζ 0 exp exp z μ σ if ζ 0 where y max y 0 with sign indicates positive part of the argument μ is a location parameter and σ is a scale parameter the shape parameter ζ determines the symmetry and heaviness of the tail el adlouni et al 2008 for nonstationary gev model we incorporate time varying covariates into gev location gev i to describe trends as a linear function of time in years i e μ t μ 1 t μ 0 since we limit our planning horizon to 40 years and modeling temporal changes in shape and scale parameters requires long term records following an earlier study cheng et al 2014 we assume these two parameters as constant for estimation of gev parameters a bayesian inference is performed combined with differential evaluation markov chain de mc monte carlo mc simulation as suggested by cheng et al 2014 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 martins et al 2000 this approach combines knowledge from a prior distribution and the observation vector y y t t 1 n y indicates timeseries of am rainfall with sample length n into the posterior distribution of parameters ω μ σ ζ and λ μ 0 μ 1 σ ζ assuming stationarity and nonstationary conditions respectively the priors for the location and scale parameters are non informative normal distributions whereas prior for the shape parameter is a normal distribution with standard deviation of 0 3 renard et al 2013 de mc is an adaptive monte carlo markov chain mcmc algorithm ter braak and vrugt 2008 in which multiple chains here we fix chain length n 5 are run in parallel the resulting mc simulations are then run to an equilibrium since it is standard practice to discard initial iterations or burn in samples of simulated samples as they are strongly influenced by starting values and do not provide any usable information about the target distribution we run de mc simulations for 3000 iterations and kept 2001 30 00th iterations of each chain the convergence of the de mc simulation is checked by a potential scale reduction factor r ˆ gelman and shirley 2011 that suggests the value of r ˆ should remain below the threshold value of 1 1 the post burn in simulated draws from posterior distribution is then used to construct predictive distribution for the am time series the parameters are derived by computing 50th median 5th and 95th the lower and the upper bounds of the de mc sampled i e post burn in draws gev parameters constructing a 90 credibility interval for the design rainfall for stationary gev model the design storm intensity q p associated with t year return period is obtained using following expression coles and tawn 1996 6 q p μ σ ζ 1 ln 1 p ζ ζ 0 μ σ l o g l o g 1 p ζ 0 where p is the exceedance probability the computation of nonstationary dsi is similar to the stationary model except the inclusion of time varying location parameter cheng et al 2014 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 for nonstationary gev model the time variant location parameter μ t and time invariant scale and shape parameters are derived by computing the median and corresponding 90 credibility bounds of post burn in draws as explained earlier the model parameters are then used to estimate the nonstationary design rainfall intensity analogous to eq 6 7 q p μ σ ζ 1 ln 1 p ζ ζ 0 μ σ l o g l o g 1 p ζ 0 where μ is a time variant parameter given as μ ϕ k μ t1 μ t2 μ tn and μ t μ 1 t μ 0 where μ 1 and μ 0 are slope and intercept of linear regression ϕ k indicates a function to calculate kth percentile where k 50 yields the median of n location parameters μ t1 μ t2 μ tn 2 7 historical model agreement and relative changes to assess bias corrected models performance relative to observations we compute a skill score based on taylor diagram that takes into account of models spread and correlation reference to the observation taylor 2001 8 s 4 1 r σ ˆ f 1 σ ˆ f 2 1 r 0 s 0 1 where r is the pattern correlation σ ˆ f is the normalized standard deviation r 0 is the maximum attainable correlation calculated from the maximum of inter ensemble correlation apart from taylor s skill score metrics we assessed the model performance using intensity i versus duration d plots and vertical boxplots showing the relative difference between observed and multi model median climate ensemble at selected stations and return periods finally the percentage change between future calculated from mm med ensemble run and historical period is attributed to changes in precipitation extremes the statistically significant difference between future and baseline design intensity is computed using standardized z statistics which is given by madsen et al 2009 mikkelsen et al 2005 9 z z ˆ t future z ˆ t baseline 0 5 var z ˆ t future var z ˆ t baseline where z ˆ t future is the t year intensity obtained from the mm med climate model ensemble from a stationary nonstationary model z ˆ t baseline describes the same but with the present day condition the denominator indicates predictive uncertainty var z ˆ t future and var z ˆ t baseline are the estimated variance obtained from the t year event estimates and associated credibility interval the z statistic can be interpreted as statistically equivalent to quantiles of standard normal distribution i e z 1 96 and 1 64 correspond to 5 and 10 significance levels the null hypothesis of the test assumes that t year event estimate in the future planning period is significantly different from the baseline value 3 rcm evaluation of historical simulation 3 1 overall performance of rcms and bias correction methods although in gcm driven runs gcm output represents a perfect boundary condition for both historical and future climate simulations in this case model performance cannot be evaluated against individual events and hence comparison with observations is only possible for statistical attributes independent of time steps therefore we obtained statistics from bias corrected am series and compared it with observed am to comprehend if the model simulations are credible enough to project future climate change thus we obtain information on overall performance of each bias correction methods both kernel and gev based and its transferability to model extreme precipitation statistics at southern ontario next given the scope of the paper we limit our analyses to evaluation of extreme precipitation statistics as captured by return levels at various standard durations commonly adopted in engineering design from the historical simulation of gcm driven rcms against the ground based observations we evaluate bias corrected models performance using the skill score diagnostic metrics as described in eq 8 taylor 2001 while fig 3 presents a graphical assessment of individual models and their multi model ensembles skill in the form of heat maps across all durations tables s3 s7 show quantitative evaluation of bias corrected climate ensembles relative to ground based observations the skill score improves gradually from higher to lower temporal resolution tables s3 s7 the variability among models is small and a moderate skill score varies from more than 0 3 to 0 6 is noted for mm med climate ensemble across different durations table s3 among individual model performance regcm4 shows the highest skill score over oshawa whereas crcm5 exhibits the lowest skill over fergus shand dam for 1 hour am series likewise for daily am series regcm4 performed the best over london whereas the worst over trenton in many cases we found that the performance of a single model is better than or comparable to that of the multi model climate ensembles however as noted in the previous assessments ganguli and ganguly 2016 kumar et al 2014 martre et al 2015 min et al 2014 the main advantage of using a multi model ensemble is not the vast improvement over the best performing single model but the consistently better performance of multimodel runs considering all aspects of projection finally we chose the method of bias correction based on the skill score 3 2 analysis of trend and nonstationarity in observed precipitation extreme next we analyze the presence of trends and nonstationarity in the observed am series at different durations the rationale is to systematically evaluate whether present day time series show any signatures of nonstationarity table s8 summarizes the results in general we found presence of significant nonstationarity in five out of 8 sites in short duration precipitation records as confirmed by the psr test significant at 10 level while hourly precipitation extreme at toronto shows a downward trend significant at 10 level the daily extremes at oshawa and trenton show upward trends significant at 5 level however for none of the sites magnitudes of trend estimates are zero 3 3 simulation of gev shape parameter since shape parameter directly influences the nature of simulated extremes ragulina and reitan 2017 we compare the shape parameters of observed versus rcms for both stationary and nonstationary gev models table 1 presents the shape parameters simulated by mm med climate ensembles relative to baseline observation we found rcms simulates shape parameters reasonably well in most of the cases the shape parameters vary in the range of 0 30 to 0 30 table 1 for daily precipitation extreme the spatial average of observed shape parameters across the stations is ζ 0 13 with the highest in toronto ζ med 0 25 ζ med indicates shape parameter obtained from the 50th percentile of de mc simulated samples and the least in fergus shand dam median ζ med 0 05 on the other hand the spatial average simulated by mm med cordex rcms slightly overestimates the observed mean ζ 0 15 with the highest being in stratford ζ med 0 29 and the least in london ζ med 0 04 our results are consistent with a recent study ragulina and reitan 2017 which estimated a global average of shape parameter around 0 14 with a 95 confidence interval between 0 13 and 0 15 using daily gridded precipitation extremes from the global historical climatology network daily database version 2 60 further the authors showed for southern ontario estimates of shape parameter varies from 0 13 to 0 16 fig 5 in ragulina and reitan 2017 which is little different in our case given the fact that we are dealing with extreme precipitation and the ground based observations are subjected to biases resulting from multiple sources adam and lettenmaier 2003 new et al 2001 next we investigate the variation of shape parameter in nonstationary models table 1 the shape parameters for daily observed am series varies between ζ med 0 06 for fergus shand dam and ζ med 0 31 for stratford with an average estimate of ζ 0 19 on the other hand for cordex rcm we found models slightly underestimates the spatial average shape parameter ζ 0 16 which varies between ζ med 0 31 in stratford and ζ med 0 05 in london evaluation of shape parameter across different time steps suggests that the most positive shape parameter values occur for 12 hour storm duration in stratford in stationary simulation ζ med 0 34 and toronto in nonstationary simulation ζ med 0 41 respectively on an average the shape parameter simulated by the nonstationary model is higher than that of the stationary model indicating the former adequately simulates the presence of heavy upper tail or the higher likelihood of extreme events halmstad et al 2013 markose and alentorn 2011 3 4 idf uncertainty 3 4 1 translating parameter gev uncertainty in design storm estimation while in earlier section we discuss climate model error growth resulting from disaggregation and bias correction processes relative to observations using a simple taylor skill score in this section we further investigate the effect of gev parameter uncertainty of stationary time invariant versus nonstationary time variant models on the estimation of idf statistics to test the hypothesis we have chosen sub daily 12 hour precipitation extremes at toronto and daily precipitation at windsor as the representative observations based on the following rationale i toronto pearson airport shows the largest value of shape parameter for the nonstationary gev model at 12 hour duration ζ 0 41 ii both toronto and windsor is a good illustration of the temporal variability of extreme rainfall in 2011 windsor experienced the wettest year on record measuring 1568 mm rain compared to annual average rainfall of 844 mm ccap 2012 on 8th july 2013 over a 2 hour period the city of toronto experienced a significant flash flood event that produced 126 mm of rain on a single day boodoo et al 2015 iii both of these cities are among the largest metropolitan areas more than 100 000 inhabitants in 2016 https www12 statcan gc ca that make it a sensible case for rainfall induced flood hazard assessment figs 4 and 5 illustrate how uncertainty in parameter estimates translates into design storm estimates here we show density estimates of gev parameters and the 25 and 50 year return levels for the stationary and nonstationary models at 12 and 24 hour durations the probabilistic nature of idf estimates allows investigations of model uncertainty through the posterior histograms of the model parameters the posterior density of shape parameter for the nonstationary model in fig 4 departs significantly from the bell shaped gaussian distribution with a sharp peak around 0 4 with a very narrow credible interval this produces asymmetries in return level estimates for nonstationary models fig 4 bottom right most panel with sharper peaks as compared to the stationary models unlike sub daily precipitation extremes at toronto the density function of the gev shape parameters for daily precipitation extremes at windsor fig 5 for both models show a similar behavior with a wider credible interval the return level plots of fig 6 illustrates how the asymmetries in gev parameters translated into the uncertainty of return level estimates particularly for larger return periods the nonstationary models in fig 4 allow large asymmetry in shape parameter estimates which in turn gives a narrow credible interval for the nonstationary model in fig 6 left nevertheless the nonstationary models are in close agreement with empirical cdf the circles in red for lower return periods the uncertainty dominates at higher return period in which the stationary model performed satisfactorily on the other hand the credible intervals for stationary and nonstationary models at 24 hour durations in windsor are comparable to each other and the median return levels are in close agreement with the observation taken together the difference in design storm estimates at higher return periods i e 25 year are mainly due to differences in the scale of the ζ parameters of both models 3 4 2 simulation of idf statistics stationary versus nonstationary models next we compare the simulated idf statistics of observed versus cordex rcms fig 7 illustrates design storm estimates for t 5 10 and 25 year return periods at three selected station locations toronto international airport oshawa wpcp and windsor airport weak trends also have considerable impacts on results of exceedance probability porporato and ridolfi 1998 therefore we modeled nonstationarity considering time as a covariate in the location parameters of the gev distribution the uncertainty in design storm is shown using the vertical boxplots tables s9 s11 show parameters of the fitted gev distributions and the ratio between upper and lower bounds of corresponding dsis for 25 year return period table s12 presents a statistical performance of stationary versus nonstationary gev models for the durations of 1 and 6 hour using akaike information criteria with small sample correction aic c akaike 1974 hurvich and tsai 1990 the skill of the individual model as measured by the aic c statistics does not exhibit any consistent patterns either based on the locations or the storm durations in general we found cordex rcms able to simulate observed dsi reasonably well for all three locations tables s9 s11 and fig 7 tables s9 s11 show the fitted gev parameters for mm med cordex ensemble are close to that of the observed am series as noted from the plots the uncertainty in design storm estimates is higher for the lower storm durations d 1 and 2 hour and higher return periods i e 25 year further in general it is noted that the ratio between upper and lower bound is smaller for nonstationary models than that of the stationary models for all three sites at durations d 6 hour the simulated rainfall intensity with 25 year return period tend to underestimate the observed ones secondly for oshawa we note an increase in observed rainfall intensity in nonstationary models relative to the stationary ones at short durations of 2 hour and return periods t 10 year and beyond this may be attributed to consistent upward trend in am rainfall intensity across all durations in oshawa further we find at shorter durations in nonstationary models the length of top whisker in the boxplot tend to be longer than the bottom one indicating the model adequately describes the asymmetric nature of extremes our findings are consistent with an earlier study cheng and aghakouchak 2014 in which authors reported the difference between nonstationary and stationary rainfall intensities are more prominent at shorter durations and higher return periods and the differences gradually diminish at longer durations for detailed exploratory analysis we present relative changes in rainfall intensity for 1 in 10 year i e t 10 year and 1 in 25 year events respectively fig 8 while the top panel in the figure fig 8a shows stationary models the bottom one fig 8b shows the nonstationary ones corresponding to design rainfall intensity at t 10 year and 25 year return periods which can be themselves categorized as less and more intense events at lower return period t 10 year the relative difference between observation and the mm med climate ensemble is close to zero while the differences tend to increase at higher return period t 25 year a few exceptions exist for example london international airport shows large negative bias for 24 hour rainfall extreme 4 projection of future idf 4 1 projection of gev shape parameter in this section we discuss changes in shape parameter of simulated extreme in future relative to the baseline period table 2 compares the shape parameters of the gev distribution in the baseline 1970 2010 versus projected 2030 2070 scenarios table 2 shows during 2050s 2030 2070 the shape parameters tend to be negative across all durations irrespective of the nature of simulations a negative shape parameter indicates the gev distribution has a bounded upper tail i e an identified upper limit to those extreme events or a weibull type distribution implying a tendency towards heavy lower tail for stationary gev models the values of shape parameter are most negative at 12 hour duration and ranged from 0 57 at trenton followed by 0 49 at toronto to 0 06 at hamilton with spatial standard deviation of 0 29 at same duration for nonstationary gev models ζ values ranged from 0 66 at trenton followed by 0 65 at toronto to 0 33 at stratford with spatial standard deviation 0 09 these values in shape parameter are more negative than those conventionally considered as physically reasonable in hydrology literature martins et al 2000 when ζ is less than 0 33 the am distribution has an infinite third moment and when ζ is less than 0 5 the distribution has infinite variance as suggested by an earlier study morrison and smith 2002 a very negative value of the shape parameter suggests that the distribution of am precipitation tends to have a very heavy tail however we found at shorter durations 1 6 hour the ζ values ranged between 0 33 and 0 23 and well within the physically consistent limit 4 2 future changes in idf statistics table s13 lists the performance of stationary versus nonstationary gev models using aicc statistics for the selected i e 1 and 6 hour storm durations during projected time periods during the 2050s table s13 for 1 hour storm duration stationary gev model performs the best among six out of eight sites however for longer storm duration in this case 6 hour the spatial pattern is not consistent fig 9 compares projected intensity versus duration relations for 1 in 25 year events for stationary top panel and nonstationary bottom panel simulations the uncertainty in rainfall intensities at different durations are shown using boxplots the nature of intensity versus duration id curves follows a uniform pattern throughout to further evaluate how the future intensities are sensitive towards the choice of frequency analysis i e stationary nonstationary the boxplots of difference between future and historical dsis for 10 and 25 year events are presented in figs 10 and 11 the absolute changes in future dsi relative to baseline period are shown for two distinct cases stationary future versus stationary historical and nonstationary future versus nonstationary historical for 1 in 10 year events except stratford at all locations the quantile boxes are above zero for 24 hour duration for stratford at 24 hour duration the intensity of rainfall remains relatively unchanged over time as indicated by the locations of quantile boxes which is close to zero irrespective of the choice of the return period estimates for durations up to 6 hour the increase is observed for hamilton oshawa and trenton in contrast for 1 in 25 year events except a few cases eg stratford where quantile boxes are below zero for all durations for most of the sites the quantile boxes are above zero for short duration precipitation indicating an increase in precipitation intensity in the future period at 24 hour duration the dsi remains relatively unchanged for 1 in 25 year events fig 11 for all locations further for both events although the differences in dsi are apparent for durations up to 2 hour they follow the same trend irrespective of the choice of frequency analysis however the magnitude of differences fade away at durations of 6 hour and beyond to quantify the relative changes in projected intensity with respect to the baseline period we present heat maps of the difference in rainfall intensity of the 2050s versus 1990s for 10 and 25 year return periods figs 12 and 13 while the left panels of the figure show the z statistics indicating statistical significance of the change the right panel summarizes the median changes in projected rainfall intensities for the future relative to the baseline period expressed in percentage a positive value indicates an increase relative to baseline period whereas negative ones indicate a decrease for 10 year return period under stationarity assumption fig 12 top panel a significant increase in dsi is observed for rainfall extremes in all sites except hourly rainfall extreme at london airport in particular the projected increase ranges from 1 to 40 and 1 to 38 respectively assuming stationary and non stationary methods of frequency analysis for 25 year return period fig 13 the performance is mixed with a few stations exhibit an increase for instance 6 and 24 hour rainfall extreme in toronto 6 hour extreme in oshawa while others show a decrease i e 12 hour rainfall extreme in toronto and trenton 1 and 2 hour hour extremes in london and fergus shand dam respectively however considering stationary assumption none of these changes are significant fig 13 top panel in contrast to nonstationary assumption fig 13 bottom panel in which differences in dsi estimates are deemed to be significant taken together the following broader insights emerge for future precipitation extremes in southern ontario i for 1 in 10 year events an increase in dsi is observed across most of the stations and durations irrespective of the choice of frequency analysis ii for more extreme events i e 1 in 25 year detectable differences in dsi estimates are noted considering non stationary model in contrast to the stationary model 5 discussions and conclusions extreme precipitation poses a significant challenge to pluvial flood hazard management for cities across southern ontario owing to their densely settled urban infrastructural networks henstra and thistlethwaite 2017 we characterize extreme rainfall frequency using idf statistics with a suite of high resolution new generation regional climate model participating in na cordex domain with an elevated global greenhouse forcing rcp8 5 scenario since the study area comprises urban catchments the idf statistics are compared primarily for 5 10 and 25 year return periods the rcm performance in simulating extreme rainfall statistics in the present day climate is validated using ground based am precipitation records our analyses suggest the temporally downscaled na cordex rcm ensembles enable to simulate the observed idf statistics reasonably well further we modeled dsi using extreme value statistics using stationary and nonstationary gev models with a time varying location parameter the following conclusions emerge from the present analysis a robust bias correction methodology is employed to correct systematic biases in the rcm outputs for different time scales and across individual station locations however the skill of bias correction does not follow any specific trend either based on locations or the duration in the rcp8 5 scenario an increase in storm intensity for return periods up to 10 year is evident over most of the sites irrespective of the choice of frequency analyses for longer return periods i e 25 year a detectable change in dsi is apparent assuming a nonstationary form of idf than that of the stationary ones amid in a warming climate scenario this paper presents a proof of principal results to compare changes in extreme precipitation intensity in the 2050s using three regional climate models with the future atmosphere represented by the rcp8 5 scenario here we not only present a probabilistic framework to assess cascade of uncertainty owing to multiple model chains in future return level estimates but also evaluate all plausible combinations of dsis to understand whether the nature of spatial trends in future is sensitive towards the choice of frequency analysis in order to better prepare for a resilient planning in the changing climatic condition the review of literature indicates that it remained an open ended question whether we should consider stationarity or nonstationarity in precipitation extremes for estimating dsi using global land based database 1940 2009 of annual precipitation a recent study sun et al 2018 has indicated detectable changes at only 14 of the global land surface however the analysis was confined to a coarser temporal resolution while canada s national climate change assessment indicates an increase in average precipitation volume across several regions nationally bush et al 2014 short duration extreme precipitation only at a limited number of stations nationwide less than 5 show statistically significant increasing or decreasing trend shephard et al 2014 however the nature of trend differs regionally based on ground based precipitation records over ontario adamowski et al 2010 showed different parts of ontario reveal different trends in extreme precipitation although no spatial patterns or uniform rates were evident across stations finally results of their study indicate due to existence of trends as a consequence of either climate change and or natural climate variability the design storms in the future might occur more frequently depending on durations and return periods further based on elevated greenhouse gas emission scenarios a few studies have indicated an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation in southern ontario by the 2050s deng et al 2016 mailhot et al 2012 overall while exploring advantages and limitations of nonstationary versus stationary methods of analyses koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 serinaldi et al 2018 serinaldi and kilsby 2016 is beyond the scope of current study our analyses adds value in existing state of the art in multiple ways first our study bridge the gap between ground based observation and climate model based future projection studies especially for southern ontario by estimating design storm intensity taking into account of trend in the time series that may arise due to climate change and or natural variability and then we include impact of climate change on the idf statistics by considering the most aggravated greenhouse gas emission scenario rcp8 5 consistent with earlier findings deng et al 2016 mailhot et al 2012 we find an significant increase in rainfall intensity at 6 and 24 hour extremes for 10 year events over majority of stations irrespective of the method of frequency analysis secondly for 25 year return period we note an increase across several stations for different durations nevertheless in future projection magnitude of increase is more prominent and larger if we assume nonstationary form of idfs than that of the stationary model this might be a consequence of the nonstationary model that takes into account of trend in the data which the stationary model fails to consider in a few cases we find a decrease in extreme precipitation which could be a consequence of complex interplay between circulation local temperature and convective updraft changes wehner 2013 the relative mix of these mechanisms is a function of location and rarity of the extreme event as noted in previous assessments wang and zhang 2008 wehner 2013 the projected changes in gev parameters table 2 can reflect these mechanisms wang and zhang 2008 for instance circulation changes primarily influence the location parameter of the gev distribution followed by a little impact on the spread of the extreme values whereas moisture increase have a strong impact on all parameters including scale and shape parameters of the gev distribution resulting into a shift in the tail of the distribution to larger values wang and zhang 2008 in general based on the estimated gev shape parameters a negative shape parameter value for sub daily precipitation is not consistent with a positive value for daily precipitation this indicates the sub daily precipitation is bounded while daily precipitation is not bounded in this respect pooling data for different durations and estimating a single gev distribution in a simple scaling or multiple scaling langousis and veneziano 2007 can be helpful to handle this issue furthermore pooling data from neighboring locations and introducing a spatial covariate such as mean annual rainfall panthou et al 2012 can also be helpful to reduce uncertainty in parameter estimates some of the caveats of the study include the heavy computational requirement involving successive spatiotemporal downscaling of extreme precipitation at individual station level has limited us to use only three rcms however uncertainty in climate change projection results from both model responses and internal climate variability hawkins and sutton 2009 2011 a series of previous studies deser et al 2012 2014 kay et al 2015 wettstein and deser 2014 have examined the effect of intrinsic climate variability and anthropogenic climate change on climate projections using a multi member climate model ensemble such as either 40 member ensemble runs from national center for atmospheric research ncar s cesm large ensemble community project lens kay et al 2015 or a 50 member ensemble runs from canadian earth system model version 2 canesm2 arora et al 2011 these studies explored various aspects of uncertainty resulting from intrinsic climate variability and found substantial climate uncertainty on a global and regional scale the role of internal climate variability is considerably higher at a regional scale and in shorter lead time hawkins and sutton 2009 2012 therefore using three member rcms may not be sufficient to capture the full spectrum of climate variability by the 2050s projection horizon next findings presented here provide a conservative estimation of changes in return levels given a limited number of meteorological stations and climate model runs analyzed and cautions should be exercised when generalizing the results for larger spatial domain however this is indeed a common problem in most hydrologic frequency analysis as long length with good quality rainfall records is often not available for this study we select all those stations across southern ontario which contains the longest and best quality available records the same datasets have also been used in earlier assessments ganguli and coulibaly 2017 switzman et al 2017 and their use herein also facilitate further inter comparison third while hourly and sub daily extreme precipitation required for engineering design are often produced by convective events global and regional climate models are not able to simulate such events well because of models limited spatial and temporal resolution and convection is not explicitly resolved in these models zhang et al 2017 although high resolution convective permitting models may provide a reliable representation of local storm dynamics kendon et al 2014 these models still suffer from inherent uncertainties in simulating extremes hagos et al 2014 singh and o gorman 2014 the cascade of uncertainty may also stem from spatial and temporal downscaling of rcm output we assume that the selected bias correction method at the historical period is time independent and the same will holds good for correcting bias in the future period future research will be directed to include nonstationarity in idf curves considering temperature or large scale climatic oscillations as a covariate in the nonstationary model the temperature as a covariate allows interpretation of findings in terms of scaling rate between precipitation and temperatures that could be approximately comparable to 7 8 increase in extreme precipitation per degree rise in surface air temperature following the clausius clapeyron relationship prein et al 2017 the review of the literature suggests the influence of large scale climate oscillations such as el niño southern oscillation enso and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo zhang et al 2010 on extreme precipitation occurrences over southern ontario the inclusions of physical covariates in idfs can provide useful information to engineers and stakeholders to better understand the influence of regional climate variability on extreme precipitation occurrences and enables better use of climate model outputs the obtained rate can be translated to update historical idf parameters in a warming climate the methodology employed in the study can be extended to include any geographical locations around the globe to develop future idfs considering a range of physical covariates and to further assess cascade of uncertainty in return level estimates owing to multiple model chains finally the results of this study are not only limited to analyze the credibility of nonstationary rainfall idfs at a warming environment but also serve as a generic tool to improve weather generator furrer and katz 2008 kodra et al 2017 considering nonstationary

atlantic and indian oceans induced wind system southwest monsoon components and the mountainous topography over the region li et al 2016 segele and lamb 2005 the interactions of these factors are controlled by large scale systems and basin wide indices are modulated by inter annual climate variability making precipitation particularly sensitive to climate change a study by lanckriet et al 2015 examined the atmospheric teleconnections in northern ethiopia their results highlight the importance of elniño southern oscillation enso la niña indian ocean dipole and southwest monsoons for a significant portion of rainy season precipitation variability furthermore pacific and atlantic sea surface temperature ssts are additional factors in explaining the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation over ethiopia according to diro et al 2011 such complex oceanic and terrestrial interactions of the ethiopian climate are challenging for global climate models gcms li et al 2016 otieno and anyah 2013 recently results from gcms have been used to investigate the projected temperature and precipitation patterns and their effects on hydrology and water resources of northern ethiopia hadgu et al 2015 taye et al 2011 beyene et al 2009 though mostly focusing either the national level e g jury 2015 monerie et al 2012 or larger scales such as the nile river basin level e g siam and eltahi 2017 elshamy 2009 yates and strzepek 1998 most of the investigations were conducted in humid environments e g wagena et al 2016 elsanabary and gan 2015 setegn et al 2011 taye et al 2011 moreover many of the previous assessments relied upon few gcms making them less reliable in their the future projections elshamy 2009 gcms simulations show different results of climate change over northern ethiopia there are high levels of confidence in projecting future temperature increase over the region teklesadik et al 2017 wagena et al 2016 hadgu et al 2015 however the climate change effects might not be similar throughout this region because of several co varying factors as mentioned above for instance mean annual precipitation is expected to decrease e g yimer et al 2009 increase e g setegn et al 2011 or remain unchanged e g hadgu et al 2015 and both frequency and intensity of events exhibited much disparity korecha and sorteberg 2013 nma 2007 kinfe 1999 investigated the potential effects of climate change and its effect on the hydrology of awash river basin they found a decreasing trend in mean annual streamflow of even 34 for the far future period 2071 2100 in the eastern part of the country based on the results from 11 gcms beyene et al 2009 projected an increase in streamflow over the nile basin in the period 2010 2039 followed by a decrease again taye et al 2011 investigated changes in daily climate and hydrological extremes for two catchments within the nile river basin using 17 gcms for two global emission scenarios they indicated increasing peak flows for the nyando catchment but trends for lake tana catchment precipitation and mean discharge were unclear half of the gcms projected an increase while the other half projected a decrease they also observed that wider signals for precipitation than for temperature and emphasized that an investigation of climate change impact that relied upon a small number of gcms and emission scenarios is subject to large uncertainty global climate models gcms fowler et al 2007 dibike and coulibaly 2006 have a spatial resolution that is too coarse for regional studies hence downscaling techniques need to resolve this scale disparity to translate large scale climate model results to local climate like temperature and precipitation dibike et al 2008 wilby et al 2004 dynamic downscaling and statistical downscaling are the most widely used techniques for this purpose dynamic downscaling approaches are physically process driven and complex and computationally demanding on the other hand statistical downscaling models are data driven and easy to apply and require much less computational time jeong et al 2012 fowler et al 2007 linear regression methods like multiple linear regression and non linear regression methods like artificial neural networks anns are commonly used statistical downscaling methods that are used for forecasting hydro climatic variables with reliable estimates fowler et al 2007 wilby et al 2004 in this work an improved artificial neural networks anns modeling technique was employed to downscale gcm output and for forecasting streamflow for the twenty first century artificial neural networks anns models are one such type of model which can serve as universal approximators and make a more reliable estimations for complex and non linear system asce 2000 hewitson and crane 1996 thus anns perform more accurately and rapidly in simulating hydro climatic variables von storch et al 2000 previous studies have noted that attempts to project the future of hydro climatic variables yield inconsistent results even though most of them concerned humid regions e g teklesadik et al 2017 wagena et al 2016 berhane et al 2013 taye et al 2011 this might be attributed to different spatial scales that were the investigated e g reda et al 2015 anyah and qiu 2012 conway and schipper 2011 use of different time periods chosen for the analysis e g setegn et al 2011 kinfe 1999 and due to considering only few gcms e g wagena et al 2016 hadgu et al 2015 yimer et al 2009 inconsistencies were not only due to methodological differences for instance only few previous studies presented observational evidences to support their hypothesis and they estimated the changes in hydro climate only using gcms simulation results of gcms may differ both in magnitude and direction of projected changes siam and eltahir 2017 accordingly consensus is not easily obtained regarding changes of climate and its impact on the streamflow this lack of consensus obstructs the development of effective climate change adaptation plans mcsweeney et al 2012 therefore it is essential that understanding of climate variability and change during the past and under future warming at spatial and temporal scales in a region which is vulnerable to climate change in this study we combine recent observations with multi gcms simulations keeping spatial variability into account with the objectives to i investigate the nature of the observed hydro climatic change for and within tekeze river basin 1961 2014 ii evaluate the performance of 30 cmip5 gcms output and their ensemble means in simulating hydro climatic patterns over the study region and iii construct a reliable ensemble mean projection for temperature and precipitation and study the hydrological impacts of future climate projections we considered three time horizons the early twenty first century 2010 2039 mid twenty first century 2040 2069 late twenty first century 2071 2099 against the reference period 1961 1990 under emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 at annual seasonal and monthly time scales these simulations are performed for the river tekeze sub basin in northern ethiopia that drains into nile river basin as it is representative of the relatively dry biogeophysical environments in the highlands of northern ethiopia that has received little research attention in the past 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site tekeze river basin tb covers about 66 541 km2 in the northern part of ethiopia extends from 35º52 32 to 39º52 34 east and 11 37 10 to 14 48 20 north fig 1 the tb is one of the upstream parts of the nile river basin and is characterized by a typical dry biogeophysical environment the elevations range from 481 m a s l to 4517 m a s l with average elevation being 1740 m 659 more than 70 of the basin is located in the highlands with an elevation exceeding 1500 m a s l the highest point is situated in the central part of the basin the tekeze river from its source near mt abun yosef 4190 m a s l to the confluence of the three rivers tekeze angereb and goang is 830 km long the sub basins of tekeze river basin originating in the highlands of ethiopia are gilgel tekeze belesa tserare ras dejen geba and worie zarema sibta and humera sub basins are located in the lower region of the basin fig 1 the climate is dry with a distinctly seasonal precipitation with most of which 81 is during the major rainy season from june to september and the short rainy period in march april and may a dry period starts in october and lasts for four months the mean annual precipitation for the 1961 2014 period ranged from about 409 mm in the northeast part of the upper region to over 1300 mm in the highlands of southwest parts of the lower region of tekeze river basin large scale atmospheric circulations and topographic settings strongly influence the spatio temporal precipitation patterns over the region segele and lamb 2005 the annual precipitation variability in the basin is large with a coefficient of variation ranging from 0 1 in the lower region to 0 5 over its highland parts of the basin the mean annual temperature in the basin ranges from 10 c in the highlands to over 28 c in the lowlands the maximum and minimum mean annual potential evapotranspiration are 2538 mm in the west part and 905 mm in the central highlands of the basin with average value of 1688 mm gebreyohannes et al 2013 the mean annual streamflow at humera gauging station see fig 1 near to the basin outlet is 11 428 mm3 and varies from more than 4142 mm3 month in august to less than 247 mm3 month on average in the drier period december to april the topography of the basin comprises of hills with uplands in the north eastern and southern parts and is dominated by valleys in the western parts the lithology is dominated by precambrian crystalline rocks eocene flood basalts late jurassic limestone shale and gypsum and jurassic sandstone ismail and abdelsalam 2012 the main soil types are eutric vertisols on the level lands eutric leptosol eutric vertisol eutric and calcric cambisol and haplic luvisol on the sloping lands eutric leptosol on the steep lands and leptosol on composite landforms fao 1998 land use and land cover is dominated by cropland shrub covered areas open woodlands and grasslands fao 2014 the areas with the highest slopes 35 are covered by shrublands and woodlands while the flatter areas 7 15 are covered with crop and grasslands 2 2 datasets and models we examine the datasets of temperature t precipitation p streamflow sf cmip5 gcms outputs and predictors of large scale atmospheric variables ncep ncar reanalysis project data for climate models we use output from 30 gcms participating in cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 experiments source https esgf node llnl gov projects esgf llnl reanalysis fields include zonal and meridional wind geopotential height vertical velocity and virtual temperature are used in the current study appendix a table a 3 historical estimations of these variables are available from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and national center for atmospheric research ncar reanalysis database source http www cpc ncep noaa gov products wesley reanalysis html 2 2 1 meteorological and hydrological data the national meteorological agency nma provide daily meteorological data for t and p for the period 1961 2014 a total of 51 meteorological stations were used 42 of which are within the tb and 9 are outside but close to the boundaries of the basin see fig 1 detailed information is presented in table a 1 of appendix a daily sf data for the 12 river gauging stations fig 1 for the period 1961 2014 was found from the ethiopia ministry of water resources irrigation and electricity appendix a table a 2 the hydro climatic data has some missing data appendix a table a 1 and a 2 missing data were filled using weighting factor method based on correlation coefficients after estimating a high significant correlations p 0 0001 between neighbouring stations during the period where both of them have climate records woldesenbet et al 2017 2 2 2 cmip5 gcms and ncep ncar data data for the 30 gcms were obtained from the fifth report of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 multi model dataset https esgf node llnl gov projects esgf llnl the cmip5 gcms experimental design are described by taylor et al 2012 the cmip5 gcms have different ensemble members r1 r2 r3 etc and differ only in initial conditions around 1850 but the physics and the greenhouse gas forcing are the same for the simulations in this study since different versions of the same model often exhibit similarities aloysius et al 2016 monerie et al 2012 we used only the first member from the gcms one ensemble member per model to avoid model bias the utilized ensemble was r1i1p1 where r i and p represent the realization initialization method indicator and perturbed physics ensemble respectively details of the models used and affiliations responsible for the model development are presented in table 1 two time periods of the multi model ensemble are taken into account 1961 2005 for the historical simulations which correspond to the observed data and 2006 2100 for the future simulations of climate change the two representative concentration pathways rcps high concentrations scenario rcp8 5 moss et al 2010 and moderate concentrations scenario rcp4 5 thomson et al 2011 were chosen for this study because they are the most widely simulated global emission scenarios in all models taylor et al 2011 2012 and therefore suitable for comparison with other investigations for downscaling gcms output reanalysis data of monthly large scale predictor fields at each station were obtained from the reanalysis 1 and 2 projects of the ncep ncar archive kalnay et al 1996 these data were used in this work because of their longer time coverage compared with those in other reanalysis products 2 3 data analysis observed and projected t p and sf trends analysis were conducted using the mann kendall test appendix b prior to testing we applied pre whitening on the time series hydro climatic data to remove the effect of serial correlations yue et al 2003 the rate of change over the years having a linear trend was estimated through a least squares fit of a regression line 2 3 1 downscaling strategy the first step for the development of downscaling models for both t and p starts with selection of appropriate predictors anns is then trained and validated for hydro climatic variables finally the downscaling model is used to obtain projections of t and p from gcms outputs prior to the downscaling of gcms output cross correlations and scatter plots are estimated between 25 potential predictors and the two predictands i e t and p for each station based on the deseasonalized predictor and predictand series over the available record from 1961 to 2014 spearman s rank correlation spearman 1904a 1904b product moment correlation pearson 1896 and kendall s tau kendall 1975 are used to investigate the correlations between predictor and predictands variables which have passed the two tailed test at the 1 significance level were considered for using in the modelling processes and these are shown in bold text in appendix a table a 3 artificial neural networks anns were used to downscale the present and future t and p from the large scale atmospheric variables section 2 4 the monthly t and p data were calculated by thiessen polygon to obtain the interpolated value to each model and emission scenario for the tb and its sub regions the correlation coefficient between observed monthly t and p data and observed sf are assessed appendix a table a 4 for the prediction of sf in the tekeze river basin and its sub regions t tt 1 tt 2 p pt 1 pt 2 were chosen as input to the ann model where tt i and pt i refer to the previous ith month t and p respectively 2 3 2 gcms performance assessment and future projection the assessment of gcms performance is based on estimates of the absolute differences between the observed data and databases simulated using 30 gcms for the period 1961 1990 and changes of magnitude during 1961 1980 relative to 1986 2005 furthermore to investigate whether the differences between the observed data and databases simulated using 30 gcms is significant or not this is tested with non parametric method of the kruskal wallis test we graded the models by their performance for individual hydro climatic variables and sub regions and overall model ranks for the tb and its sub regions are assigned based on average rank for all variables table 4 in this case the model assigned to rank 1 30 represent lowest highest differences to the observed value and show better worse model performance in reproducing the present day hydro climate törnqvist et al 2014 general linear model univariate analysis was used to examine the future spatio temporal variations of t p and sf from gcms output all ensemble mean datasets were investigated using analysis of variance anova of the four factors 1 the regions factor upper lower and the entire tekeze river basin 2 the emission scenarios factor rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 3 the period s factor 1961 1990 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 and 4 seasonal factor annual rainy small rainy and dry seasons monthly mean temperature total precipitation and total streamflow were used as the dependent variables 2 4 artificial neural networks anns artificial neural networks are mathematical algorithmic models initiated by the biological nervous system and intelligence haykin 1994 a neural network consists of a group of processing elements neurons which are linked through networks with a corresponding weight and activated by functions to fit with the outputs the arrangements are structured in the form of layers input hidden and hidden output layers dibike coulibaly 2006 we develop a three layer feed forward neural network ffnn with an input layer one hidden layer and one output layer to downscaling large scale climatic variables to a local scale and estimate hydro climatic values fig 2 equation for output y k from ffnn with a hidden layer of jth neuron given by 1 y k a o j 1 m w k j a h i 1 n w j i x i w j b w k b where x i is the input variables wj i and w k j are the weight associated with input hidden and hidden output layers wjb and wkb represent the biases for input hidden and hidden output layers and ah and ao are activation functions for the hidden nodes and the output layer respectively to account for nonlinearities between input and output associations a tan hyperbolic function is used to each neuron in the hidden and output layers and the processes of network training use a backpropagation algorithm the levenberg marquardt backpropagation method hagan and menhaj 1994 is employed as the training algorithm in the ffnn for the adjustments of weights until the value of the errors shown in fig 2 is considered to be at a minimum chadwick et al 2011 the optimal number of hidden nodes is identified by trial and error several network training experiments within 10 40 neurons are conducted the best combination of training testing and validation errors with the small number of neurons is selected as the best network for the training period 70 of the observed data are used the remaining 30 used for validation to eliminate dimensional differences dawson and wilby 1998 before the training process the inputs and target data were standardised to values in the range 0 1 as presented in eq 2 2 y x x m i n x m a x x m i n in eq 2 y represents the final normalized data x the observed data x m a x and x m i n are the maximum and minimum of values for the observed data 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed hydro climatic changes the temperature t and precipitation p records between 1961 and 2014 are shown in appendix a table a 1 fig 3 illustrate the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal mean t and total p over the tekeze river basin tb the basin wide average of annual t was 19 67 c there is an increasing slope of t from the southern region with approximately 15 29 c in the northwest region of the basin mean annual p over the basin was 852 mm year and it was largest 1300 mm year in the southwest and the smallest 409 mm year in northeast of the basin the results for annual and seasonal t and p trends investigated using the mann kendall method are summarized in appendix a table a 5 fig 3 a d e h also shown the spatial coverage of temporal trends during the period 1961 2014 for observed annual and seasonal t and p over the basin the trend analysis of basin scale t and p revealed a significant increasing trend in t and a slight increasing non significant trend in p in fig 4 a and b t increase is approximately 0 01 c year 0 54 c during 1961 2014 period and p increase is approximately by 2 36 mm year 127 mm during 1961 2014 period the annual mean t and total p of the period 1991 2014 are larger than the long term average as shown in fig 4d and e analysis of observed t data for the 1961 2014 period showed both increasing and decreasing trends fig 3a d and appendix a table a 5 there were strong increasing trends in annual and seasonal mean t at most of the stations annual mean t tended to increase at about 79 of the stations whereas a decreasing trend was observed at the stations in the northwest of the basin e g adewa selehelehi and shiraro these increasing and decreasing trends are statistically significant at 0 05 level of significance at about 66 and 8 of the stations respectively and most stations found in the eastern region of the basin showed an increasing trend fig 3a the increase and decrease in t among stations ranged from 0 05 to 1 5 c and 0 04 0 5 c per decade respectively the observed warming over the past decades at the stations is in line with nma 2007 that reported a national warming rate of 0 37 c decade for 1951 2006 and hansen et al 2006 who also indicated that global average temperature is increasing at the rate of 0 2 c decade during the twentieth century these results are consistent with those previously reported in the northern ethiopia e g tesfaye et al 2017 hadgu et al 2015 gebrehiwot and van der veen 2013 mcsweeney et al 2008 nma 2007 the study by tesfaye et al 2017 also found a warming trend in mean annual temperature in the range of 0 26 0 84 c decade for geba catchment located within tb during the 1980 2014 period trends of annual and seasonal total p and mann kendall test values for the examined stations are shown in fig 3e h appendix a table a 5 and 35 3 of the stations have a statistically significant trend annual p has a significant decreasing trend for 19 6 of the stations and an increasing trend for 15 7 of the stations at 0 05 significance level the magnitudes of the trends ranged from 1 2 to 25 3 and from 0 4 to 37 4 mm year per year respectively most of the stations which are found in the north eastern region of the basin have a significant decreasing trends in annual and rainy season precipitation whereas increasing trends are found in the southern region of the basin there is thus a regional difference for both the annual and seasonal data and the direction of trends the annual and seasonal precipitation cycle in northern ethiopia is much affected by the development of indian monsoons camberlin 1997 and it is clear that the declining precipitation can be related to a cool tropical indian ocean seleshi and zanke 2004 the spatial variability of precipitation over the northern ethiopian highlands is attributed to topographical factors and the northwards and eastwards movements of the itcz jacob et al 2013 nyssen et al 2005 krauer 1988 in the rainy season the monsoon develops over the area due to the migration of the itcz to northern position and southerly moisture flow krauer 1988 and the western and southern slopes obtain higher precipitation nyssen et al 2005 the p trend analysis is in agreement with recent investigations in the northern ethiopia gebremicael et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 tekleab et al 2013 tabari et al 2015 found mixed results of increasing and decreasing trends in total annual and seasonal precipitation in the blue nile river basin declining trends in the annual and seasonal precipitation in northern and central highlands of ethiopia were observed by osman and sauerborn 2002 and seleshi and demaree 1995 and insignificant trends by gebremicael et al 2017 seleshi and camberlin 2006 and conway 2000 differences in time period and spatial scale of the different investigations may be the cause of these inconsistencies nicholson 2000 pointed out that p during the 1950s showed an increasing trend in ethiopia while in the 1960s it showed a decreasing trend during the 1970s mixed trends within the region are obtained but in the 1980s again it showed a decreasing trend the 1990s and the late 2000s showed again an increase mcsweeney and new 2008 also conway et al 2004 indicated that the decreasing and increasing trends in annual p could be less distinct when a longer period is considered and they found no trend is observed in p over one century 1898 2002 for addis abeba in central ethiopia these observations illustrate the importance of the period over which a trend analysis is conducted in ethiopia for all investigated periods of annual rainy season and small rainy season streamflow sf most of the stations showed a decreasing trend fig 3i l and appendix a table a 6 and these are predominantly found in the upper region ur of the basin fig 3i l here annual sf at the three stations suluh agula and yechila displayed a significant decreasing trends while sf at genfel station displayed a significant increasing trend comparing fig 3e and i reveal that stations with a decreasing trend in sf agreed to some extent with stations with a decreasing trend in precipitation within and close to the sub basins remarkable is that despite decreasing trends in sf for the majority of ur stream gauging stations the trend at the basin wide outlet humera station is instead an increasing one this implies that other factors such as anthropogenic activities and topographic settings in the upper region probably cause this difference sf at the basin during 1967 1976 fig 4f is smaller by approximately 28 than for the period 1994 till 2014 for the entire 47 years period figs 3i and 4 c the annual sf has an increasing but not significant trend these results are consistent with those of fenta et al 2017 gebremicael et al 2017 and tesfaye et al 2017 who reported the large spatial variability of streamflow in northern ethiopia land use and land cover changes implementation of large scale soil and water conservation measures construction of hydropower dam and micro dams for irrigation are non uniformly spread across the river basin and are predominantly found in the upper region gebremicael et al 2017 guyassa et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 this leads to large disparity between p patterns and sf trends fenta et al 2017 tesfaalem et al 2014 rientjes et al 2013 with monthly and seasonal analysis of the stations the spatio temporal variability of hydro climatic change was examined figs 3 and 4 the monthly change for t p and sf during the periods 1961 1990 and 1991 2014 as shown in fig 4 d f has a significant increasing trend for t during the small rainy and dry periods for p mainly the rainy season june september has an increasing trend and p would remain at a high level for two to three months from july to september rather than gradually arriving at a peak in july and then starting to decrease fig 4e in general about 81 of the p occurs in the rainy season in average 852 mm year sf displays the largest increase in the small rainy and dry periods streamflow at the ur outlet and in the lr showed significant increasing trends both in small rainy and dry periods fig 3i l and appendix a table a 6 the increasing t is expected to induce more evapotranspiration and hence decreases the proportion of available water to the total sf however as figs 3i and 4 c show there is an increasing trend in sf which might be attributed to some degree by the increase in p at the southern stations the slight increasing trend in rainy season p contributed to the enhanced sf in this period for the significant increase during the small rainy fig 3k and dry periods fig 3l human intervention such as ecological rehabilitation deforestation soil and water conservation and the start of operation of the tekeze hydropower dam in 2009 in the ur gebremicael et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 nyssen et al 2010 haregeweyn et al 2008 is the most likely factor that affect sf weather forcing and basin characteristics such as land use and land cover changes and topographic settings are intrinsic drivers for streamflow variation the association between climatic patterns and sf trends for a particular basin stay comparable except the basin characteristics have been altered milly et al 2005 our spatio temporal trend analysis of the annual p for the entire basin showed that the patterns of precipitation are not significantly changed during the analysed period whereas the trends of annual average streamflow did and reveal the relevance of the space time variant variable like land use and land cover changes besides to climatic condition when understanding the changes on the streamflow of the basin environmental rehabilitation programmes and water abstractions for irrigation which contribute to changes in sf differ between the sub basins fenta et al 2017 gebremicael et al 2017 and dile et al 2016 mentioned that recent human interventions have contributed mainly to the variations of streamflow in northern ethiopia for instance soil and water conservation measures have altered the underlying terrain and stored additional rainwater behind the dams as a consequence less water is available for streamflow and peak discharges are affected more than low discharges 3 2 gcms performance assessment we aim to select a subset from gcms based on their ability to reproduce the observed climate patterns and causal mechanisms to improve the quality of simulation over the tekeze river basin tb to evaluate the performance of gcms for tb we compared the 30 years 1961 1990 observed temperature t precipitation p and streamflow sf to the database of 30 gcms as shown in fig 5 the gcms ensemble mean for both p and sf is overestimated for the period where we have observations for t this is only the case for the lower region lr whereas t is underestimated for the upper region ur and for the entire tb in absolute numbers differences vary from 1 33 to 0 37 c for t and 24 16 to 462 13 mm for p for the entire tb for sf the differences ranged from 0 93 to 114 57 mm which indicates that for some models the deviation from observed values are quite important as table 2 reveals a large number of the gcms lead to overestimation of p and sf and underestimation of t for tb and both ur and lr since we have also observations for the period 1986 2014 we can evaluate gcm performance also regarding how well they predict change after 1980 so we consider the two periods 1961 1980 and 1986 2005 for the evaluation the gcms perform better for temperature than for precipitation and streamflow fig 5 table 2 and table 3 table 2 and table 3 suggest that the simulated change in t is lower than the observed change whereas the simulated changes for p and sf is not only lower in magnitude but also in the opposite direction in table 4 we showed model ranking for the 30 gcms based on their performances regarding absolute values as well as concerning how well they capture changes between two time periods appendix a table a 7 a 10 the best performances rank 1 are indicated in bold these results indicate that the best performance depends on the indicators variates and sub basins that are considered it is therefore plausible that if other indicators or variates were chosen also the ranking would change the agreement between model results and observations can also be assessed by multiple pair wise comparisons for the kruskal wallis test table 5 for the ur and lr and appendix a table a 11 including for the entire tb these results give useful information on which models present similar values for instance model databases of gfdl esm2m 11 cnrm cm5 7 and ipsl cm5a lr 20 lead to similar simulated values for t p and sf for ur for lr the model databases of hadgem2 es 18 gfdl esm2m 11 giss e2 r 14 and for tb giss e2 h 12 cnrm cm5 7 and giss e2 r cc 15 models capture very well the observations from the evaluation of gcms performance ccsm4 gent et al 2011 mri cgcm3 yukimoto et al 2006 and gfdl cm3 donner et al 2011 perform well for most of the measures of model evaluation over tb this may be partially attributed to these gcms having a better resolution as this results in an improved representation of land surface features e g topography and atmospheric conditions li et al 2016 accounting for the annual cycle of soil water storage and ecosystem dynamics in their land models donner et al 2011 gent et al 2011 and enso variability and sea surface temperatures along the equator in mean and annual cycle representation in their ocean models deser et al 2012 griffies 2006 leads to improvements in model performance for northern ethiopia figs 6 8 show the monthly mean of t p and sf distributions respectively for all gcm models as well as for all ensemble means enms and for selected model ensemble means senms senms is derived from those models which showed significant similarity with the observed data as apparent in the kruskal wallis test and best overall model performance up to 10 for each parameters and in each region the mean annual cycle of the 1961 2005 temperature reveals that most of the gcms underestimated t when compared to the observed data for the entire tb and its sub regions e g figs 6g with 4 d the mean monthly t distributions differ much in lr fig 6d f while the march may peak and seasonal cycles in t are captured well the models differ in their representations of annual p cycles fig 7 yet most models capture the june september peak and seasonal cycles in p well for the entire tb and its sub regions although with the tendency to over estimate precipitation especially in lr the models differ in the projection of the annual cycle however the lr climate is also less densely monitored compared to the ur see figs 1 and 3 and therefore prone to have larger errors the larger bias between the gcms and observations may therefore be attributed to a poor average climate monitoring stations located in the lr models also have difficulties in predicting the sf cycle fig 8 most of the models captured well monthly patterns and seasonal cycles of sf of the entire tb and the two sub regions during high flow rates the lr had the poorest performance regarding the monthly sf pattern and seasonal cycles compared to the ur and the entire tb as was already mentioned earlier gcms mostly underestimated t and overestimated p and sf and it is probable that differences in model skill insufficient spatial resolution in resolving orographic features in more detail as well as land surface processes are causes for this performance li et al 2016 biasutti 2013 slingo et al 2005 for instance the complex topography over northern ethiopia results in complex climate and precipitation pattern jury 2015 rientjes et al 2013 haile et al 2009 segele and lamb 2005 one cause why models do not perform better for tropical hydro climatic variables is the variability related with e g the pacific ocean el niño southern oscillation enso and its global teleconnections aloysius et al 2016 suzuki 2011 balas et al 2007 atlantic ocean ssts indian ocean ssts land surface moisture and vegetation response dezfuli and nicholson 2013 siam et al 2014 segele et al 2009 for example li and xie 2014 reported excessive precipitation in the tropics partly due to bias in the double itczs in relation with excessive downward solar radiation representation and parameterization of physical processes in models their dynamical core and potential inadequacies for tropical regions are further discussed in li and xie 2014 monerie et al 2012 shongwe et al 2010 and dai 2006 model developers recognized that improvements of these aspects could advance the climate simulation quality for tropical regions birch et al 2014 biasutti 2013 knutti and sedlacek 2013 moss et al 2010 the all ensemble means enms and selected ensemble means senms reasonably captured the mean monthly distribution particularly months which have largest value and seasonal cycles in all hydro climate variables figs 6 8 the value of an ensemble mean of simulated hydro climatic variables has been mentioned by others e g haile and rientjes 2015 kim et al 2014 otieno and anyah 2013 taye and willems 2012 knutti et al 2010 in being more accurate than individual models however our results for the entire tb and its sub regions show that several models outperform the ensemble mean table 3 also the performance of gcms shown to differ in dependence of frameworks regions and hydro climatic variables despite that an average of better performing models has been suggested assumed to be more reliable than an all model ensemble for hydro climatic changes contrasting results are discussed in knutti et al 2010 therefore in the current study emphasis has been on performance metrics to assess models skill and used all ensemble means for future projections of t p and sf as in next section 3 3 projected hydro climatic change 3 3 1 projected temperature on average for the entire tekeze river basin tb and both sub regions the results from all gcms for both emission scenarios and all seasons indicate that the temperature t is projected to decrease by 0 104 c during 2010 2039 and to increase by 0 31 c during 2041 2070 and by 0 39 c during 2071 2099 all relative to the historical period 1961 1990 similarly an increase in t is observed for rcp4 5 by 0 13 c and rcp8 5 by 0 27 c at the end of the twenty first century table 6 a significant warming is also expected to occur at the end of this period p 0 001 appendix a table a 12 all assessed factors regions rcps and seasons affected the temperature p 0 001 table 6 the simulation indicated that the temperature in rcp8 5 scenario is significantly higher than rcp4 5 and both the emission scenarios have shown significant interactions p 0 01 table 6 the entire tb is projected to witness an increase of t anomalies with reference to the 1961 1990 average over the years fig 9 i l with t anomalies reaching 0 13 c decade in the rcp8 5 scenario and greater than 0 1 c decade in the rcp4 5 scenario at the end of twenty first century fig 9i near similar t features are projected for the tb during rainy and dry seasons under both scenarios fig 9j and l temperature changes during the small rainy season shows no change under rcp4 5 and a slight increase under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 9k the changes in temperature over the ur are near uniform across the years with less uncertainty compared to lr fig 9a h for ur changes in projected t are at an average rate of 0 1 c decade and 0 2 c decade in both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively over the years fig 9a the rate of projected t changes for the lower region lr is smaller than the changes in the upper region ur under rcp8 5 scenario fig 9a h changes in t under rcp8 5 scenario was 0 1 c decade 0 1 c decade smaller than the rate at ur the magnitude of increasing trends are also similar in the annual fig 9e rainy fig 9h and dry fig 9h seasons for lr nonetheless t changes over the lr during small rainy season fig 9g shows a decreasing anomaly by 0 07 c decade under rcp4 5 and by 0 03 c decade under the rcp8 5 scenarios for the end of the century generally the largest increase in t is projected for ur of the basin compared to the entire basin and the lr the difference in projected t increase decrease between ur and lr of the tb is somewhat spatial dependent in line with what was reported in historical temperature records see section 3 1 our analysis shows that the observed geographical dependent warming may become more pronounced in the future in fig 6 the annual cycles of t for the 30 gcms enms and senms under gcms future and historical outputs are compared with those of the observed seasonal variation fig 4d a bias to higher temperature over the tb and its sub regions is observed for the majority of gcms the models representations of annual t cycle much differ in lr fig 6d f whilst models capture well the march may peak in t some show a bias to lower temperatures the models representations under rcp4 5 scenario vary much and are biased to the lower temperatures than under rcp8 5 scenario our result is consistent with other studies teklesadik et al 2017 wagena et al 2016 hadgu et al 2015 conway and schipper 2011 which indicated that temperature projected in different parts of ethiopia by gcms is warmer in the future 3 3 2 projected precipitation the trend analysis in p shows a significant decreasing trend from the reference period 1961 1990 to the future 2040 2069 and 2071 2099 as shown in table 6 the simulated p is expected to increase by 5 8 in the period 2010 2039 relative to the reference period 1961 1990 afterwards p will decrease by 1 8 and 6 3 during the mid 21st century 2041 2070 and the late 21st century 2071 2099 respectively table 6 also shows that there are significant differences depending on all factors regions emission scenarios seasons and their interactions future changes in annual and seasonal p anomalies as a function of time are shown in fig 10 predicted average p anomalies decrease by 2 6 mm year for rcp8 5 scenario and increase than 1 9 mm year under rcp4 5 scenario at the end of twenty first century in the tb fig 10i similar p features are projected during rainy and dry seasons fig 10j and 10 l under both emission scenarios whereas p changes during the small rainy season fig 10k show an increasing anomaly by 0 06 mm year in both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the increased p during the small rainy season in the future may benefit the agricultural however the higher t will lead to an increased evapotranspiration which can cause moisture loss in the tb conway and schipper 2011 changes in annual p for ur showed a significantly decreasing trend from 2010 to the end of twenty first century fig 10a and appendix a table a 13 the changes are showing a significant difference in both rcp4 5 1 4 mm year and rcp8 5 1 9 mm year scenarios fig 10 however disparate changes are shown in the trends of p during rainy and small rainy seasons fig 10b and c the trend of increasing p for rcp8 5 shows both a steeper slope than for rcp4 5 and a larger variability similarly a trend of decreasing p is shown during dry season 2 mm year but a little higher in the range of variability for rcp8 5 fig 10d projected precipitation for lr is expected to decrease by more than 1 6 mm year at the end of the twenty first century in both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios it is found that the tendency under rcp8 5 2 9 mm year is stronger than that under rcp4 5 and both scenarios showed roughly the same pattern of variability furthermore the projected p anomalies tend to decrease in both scenarios during rainy and dry seasons at the end of twenty first century while p anomalies during small rainy season slightly increase with 0 08 mm year for rcp4 5 by the middle of the 21 st century the scenario under rcp8 5 displays much wider variability over the years than rcp4 5 scenario despite the average projected precipitation which is significantly different for these scenarios precipitation variability shows roughly similar characteristic the weak changes and variability in spatial averaged p is probably due to the variations in expected driving forces of p variability across the region and seasons jury 2015 the annual cycles of p indicates that models tend to better predict on average lower p than larger p depth fig 7 most of the gcms exhibit a dry bias over the tb and its sub regions for the rcp8 5 scenario results are very variable and with a dry bias compared with rcp4 5 furthermore the monthly p pattern will have a different distribution patterns under both emission scenarios and across the regions in this regard p in june july and august will decrease in both scenarios fig 7 given a decreasing trends of p in june august and a slight increase for the subsequent months a shift of the rainy season is expected towards earlier in the year in northern ethiopia similar results are reported and the spatio temporal projections of p are highly variable araya and stroosnijder 2011 for example yimer et al 2009 predicted a decline in annual p for the period 2050s while hadgu et al 2015 mention no change for the period 2030s and 2050s over northern ethiopia inconsistent trends were also reported in the studies by setegn et al 2011 and beyene et al 2009 projections of p over northern ethiopia both regarding direction and magnitude depend on the length of periods and model types which are used for the projections conway and schipper 2011 setegn et al 2011 thus besides to the natural variability of p varied results from different studies are also due to the gcms type and number that used to simulate p data in this region mcsweeney et al 2010 segele and lamb 2005 3 3 3 projected streamflow the potential impacts of future climate change on the flow of tb and its sub regions towards the end of the twenty first century were studied using the downscaled t and p as predictor inputs to the artificial neural networks anns model table 6 shows that the annual sf for the projected periods display generally a decline particularly for the rcp8 5 scenario the average simulated sf decreases by 6 3 during the mid period 2040 2069 and 8 during the last period 2070 2099 while the average sf shows an increase by 3 during the early period 2010 2039 relative to the reference period 1961 1990 at the end of twenty first century under both scenarios the projected higher t and lower p relative to the historical period lead to a reduction of the sf in the tb table 6 and fig 11 fig 11 represents the gcms ensemble mean in annual and seasonal sf anomalies simulated for historical rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios annual sf anomalies showed a decrease of 0 7 mm year under rcp8 5 scenario and over 0 5 mm year decrease under rcp4 5 scenario during 2010 2099 fig 11i similarly decreasing trends in sf are projected during rainy small rainy and dry seasons over the tb fig 11j k under both scenarios however the trend in sf is less steep during the small rainy season under both rcp4 5 0 02 mm year and rcp8 5 0 06 mm year scenarios fig 11k than in the rainy season streamflow changes over ur showed a significantly decreasing trend over the years fig 11a d from 2010 to the end of twenty first century 2099 for the entire basin the changes are significant in both scenarios table 6 however during rainy and small rainy seasons fig 11b and c there is a distinct difference in the trends of the sf in the ur streamflow increase during rainy season under rcp8 5 stronger than sf increase during small rainy season under rcp4 5 with larger variability under rcp8 5 scenario the dry season sf change is similar as the annual change fig 11d and the variability of sf is larger for rcp8 5 scenario the projected streamflow anomalies over the lr are expected to decline by more than 0 36 mm year in both scenarios at the end of the twenty first century in the rcp8 5 scenario the anomalies trend 0 5 mm year is slightly stronger and the range of variability between the scenarios is not visible during the small rainy season for both scenarios an increasing trend in the projected sf anomalies is observed in addition the projected small rainy season sf anomalies are slightly increased by 3 2 mm decade and 3 7 mm decade by the end of the twenty first century for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the variability under rcp8 5 is much larger compared to rcp4 5 and the mean sf appeared to be significantly different under the two emission scenarios table 6 the mean monthly sf for baseline conditions 1961 1990 and for climate change scenarios are shown in fig 8 streamflow shown a distinct response to a large change in p in the future as it decreases more than p this response is plausible in view of increasing temperatures that would increase evapotranspiration and reduce water storage and discharge compared with the baseline period significant sf decreases are expected from june to september under both future scenarios appendix a table a 12 because much less rain will falls in the rainy seasons the baseline sf variation indicates that the streamflow typically reaches its peak in july at the mid rainy season fig 4f which corresponds with results of nyssen et al 2010 in future scenarios sf would remain at a high level for three to four months from july to october rather than gradually arriving at a peak and then starting to decrease fig 8 which is attributed to changing the future precipitation pattern and also lag response contribution to sf in line with our results other studies on the hydrological response to warming in northern ethiopia e g dile et al 2016 setegn et al 2011 elshamy 2009 conway and hulme 1996 show a decrease of sf dile et al 2016 predicted a very similar annual decrease in streamflow for the rainy season at the end of twenty first century abdo et al 2009 investigated the hydrological effect of climate change in gelgel abay ethiopia they expect a 2 9 decrease in mean annual sf in comparison with the period 1996 2006 furthermore in the eastern part of ethiopia kinfe 1999 projected a decrease in mean annual sf up to 34 during 2071 2100 compared with 1971 1990 the disagreement not only in magnitude abdo et al 2009 kinfe 1999 but also in direction siam and eltahir 2017 beyene et al 2009 of simulated changes in sf with our results might be that the other investigations had other approaches and reference periods such differences unfortunately complicate it to reach consensus on how climate change affects hydrological responses and what the implications are for the development and management of water resources in northern ethiopia it is not surprising that assessment of hydro climatic change suffers from much uncertainty the uncertainty originating from gcms rcps downscaling and projection methods of causes differences as well as uncertainty in of hydro climatic estimates hawkins and sutton 2009 wilby and harris 2006 the projected t p and sf display significant differences between gcms gcms show relative small difference for t than p and sf table 6 and appendix a table a 13 18 the projected t vary from 0 12 to 4 2 c under rcp4 5 and from 0 41 to 4 8 c under rcp8 5 for p however the range from 30 to 31 under rcp4 5 and from 42 to 55 under rcp8 5 appendix a table a 13 a 15 the uncertainty in projected t and p would bring differences in the projected future sf these indeed vary between 43 and 30 for rcp4 5 and between 64 and 44 for rcp8 5 appendix a table a 13 15 the range of uncertainties between rcps for an individual gcm in the three periods are from 1 4 to 1 6 c for t 27 to 46 for p and 49 to 40 for sf appendix a table a 16 18 the results show that the magnitude of changes in the simulated value between rcps are smaller than between gcms this reflects the fact that in both rcps and gcms uncertainty is substantial more generally there are many examples for different regions of the difficulty of gcms to accurately model hydro climatic variables in river basins knutti and sedlácek et al 2013 ipcc 2007 in different river basins of the region e g setegn et al 2011 taye et al 2011 beyene et al 2009 elshamy 2009 there is therefore a need for more accurate consideration of large scale atmospheric circulation patterns and its mechanism from the three oceanic regions pacific indian and atlantic ocean segele et al 2009 topographic features and climate processes mcsweeney et al 2010 segele and lamb 2005 and human ecosystem changes and its effects on hydro climatic variabilities moore et al 2012 either in special hydro climatic modules of gcms or in external hydro climatic models connected to gcms 4 conclusions hydro climatic variability in semi arid regions has been linked to the spatial and temporal variations of temperature and precipitation patterns in northern ethiopia both extent and occurrence of droughts are increased and impacting on agricultural production and availability of water resources this serious situation may further worse by climate change to develop better global regional and local climate adaptation strategies a robust assessment of historical and future hydro climatic changes in these regions is crucial this study has investigated the hydro climatic changes for tekeze river basin tb and its sub regions the upper region ur and lower region lr through analysis of spatio temporal variation of the historical and future changes in temperature t precipitation p and streamflow sf temperature precipitation and streamflow observations for a period in the recent past 1961 2014 appeared to vary in a complicated way for northern ethiopia not only can variability of temperature and precipitation lead to both synergistic and antagonistic effects on the water balance of an area but these effects can also control whether streamflow increases or decreases variability of climatic factors as temperature and precipitation was observed to be both spatially and temporally diverse for the considered tekeze river basin accordingly the response of streamflow was also spatiotemporally complex this complexity is of course affected by the hierarchical ordering of upstream downstream interactions our results suggest that the interpretation of streamflow response to climate change needs to account for spatiotemporal variations of climate forcing as well as the hydrological connectivity of a catchment or basin in terms of forecasting the hydro climatic variables for northern ethiopia it appears to be rational to consider either multi gcm ensemble means or means of selected gcm projections rather than individual gcm results but also this study suggests that selection of gcms with well defined evaluation criteria can be important in this region of northern ethiopia in its sub river basins and in other similarly complex regions in such a selection it is important that the objectives of study relevant metrics and variates and the regional complexity of climatological and physiographic factors are taken into account the lack of consensus between the previous studies that investigated the impacts of climate change on hydrological responses of northern ethiopia obstructs the development and management of water resources therefore understanding on climate change and its impact on hydrological responses is important to develop plans the current best prediction is that the water resources in northern ethiopia based on our results are projected to become under more stress during the twenty first century due to climate change this projected impact could be minimized by the development of future effective mitigation and adaptation measures conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements

8448,study region this study focuses on tekeze river basin of northern ethiopia and it is characterized by a typical dry biogeophysical environment study focus in recent years recurrent droughts are having an adverse impact on agricultural production and water resources in northern ethiopia climate change through changes on temperature precipitation and streamflow may further strain this critical situation this study has investigated the observed 1961 2014 and potential 2006 2099 hydro climatic changes in tekeze river basin of northern ethiopia artificial neural networks anns are used to downscale temperature and precipitation predicated by 30 general circulation models gcms as well as the projected streamflow changes for two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenario new hydrological insights for the region results indicate that the variability of climatic factors as temperature and precipitation was observed to be both spatially and temporally diverse for the considered tekeze river basin accordingly the response of streamflow was also spatiotemporally complex gcms were evaluated with several performance indictors regarding patterns in hydro climatic variables the analysis showed the superiority of the multimodel ensemble means compared with individual gcm output gcm projections for the 21century indicate a gradual reductions in streamflow attributed to the combined effect of increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation the persistent increase of temperature and decrease of precipitation will have negative impacts on water availability and agriculture hence site specific adaptation strategies are necessary keywords climate change temperature precipitation streamflow gcm artificial neural networks 1 introduction climate change alters the terrestrial water cycle through changes in spatio temporal distribution and magnitude of both temperature and precipitation and this will affect the regional water budget and ecological environment witte et al 2012 ramanathan et al 2001 changes in precipitation combined with rising temperatures may adversely influence the availability of water streamflow soil moisture and the occurrence of droughts li et al 2018 asadieh and krakauer 2016 shanko and camberlin 1998 to mitigate such impacts and to sustainably use water also with regard to downstream ecosystems it is important to understand the consequences on hydrological responses both in present and the upcoming periods siam and eltahir 2017 washington et al 2013 in sub saharan africa the climate has experienced significant warming ipcc 2014 for ethiopia and particularly its northern regions climate change impacts on river basins are of major concern in view of the sustainability of water resources and agricultural production conway and schipper 2011 nma 2007 there is growing evidence that climate change will have both serious and multiple effects especially in the drier parts of this region that already suffers from profound water shortages and heat stress hadgu et al 2015 araya and stroosnijder 2011 whereas globally averaged warming is expected to exceed 3 celsius by 2100 ipcc 2014 the observed warming over the northern ethiopia is larger than the global average hadgu et al 2015 conway and schipper 2011 in northern ethiopia the variability with regard to the climate physiography lithology vegetation cover and land management may imply a considerable variation in the hydrological response at both catchment and basin scales guyassa et al 2017 taye et al 2017 haregeweyn et al 2015 this variability poses major challenges for the management of water resources taye et al 2013 zenebe et al 2013 including soil and water conservation rural livelihood in northern ethiopia is highly associated with climate variability and change as crop production is predominantly rain fed and the relatively large livestock density that provides a major source of income is threatened by more frequent and severe drought events over the past decades unesco 2004 drought associated food shortages in the region have been recently attributed to climate variability fews net 2016 edossa et al 2010 the spatial distribution and the frequency of its occurrence have increased in recent years nearly every two three years northern ethiopia experiences localized drought with a different level of intensity such as in the years 1983 85 1987 1988 1991 92 1993 94 1997 98 1999 2001 02 and 2002 03 edossa et al 2010 unesco 2004 during 1983 85 both the catastrophic drought and civil war in the northern ethiopia and sudan caused more than one million people to lose their lives gebrehiwot et al 2011 devereux 2000 the 2015 2016 drought affected 10 2 million inhabitants in the country which shows the magnitude and the proportion of the problem fews net 2016 variability and intensity of precipitation is affected by the oscillatory inter tropical convergence zone itcz atlantic and indian oceans induced wind system southwest monsoon components and the mountainous topography over the region li et al 2016 segele and lamb 2005 the interactions of these factors are controlled by large scale systems and basin wide indices are modulated by inter annual climate variability making precipitation particularly sensitive to climate change a study by lanckriet et al 2015 examined the atmospheric teleconnections in northern ethiopia their results highlight the importance of elniño southern oscillation enso la niña indian ocean dipole and southwest monsoons for a significant portion of rainy season precipitation variability furthermore pacific and atlantic sea surface temperature ssts are additional factors in explaining the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation over ethiopia according to diro et al 2011 such complex oceanic and terrestrial interactions of the ethiopian climate are challenging for global climate models gcms li et al 2016 otieno and anyah 2013 recently results from gcms have been used to investigate the projected temperature and precipitation patterns and their effects on hydrology and water resources of northern ethiopia hadgu et al 2015 taye et al 2011 beyene et al 2009 though mostly focusing either the national level e g jury 2015 monerie et al 2012 or larger scales such as the nile river basin level e g siam and eltahi 2017 elshamy 2009 yates and strzepek 1998 most of the investigations were conducted in humid environments e g wagena et al 2016 elsanabary and gan 2015 setegn et al 2011 taye et al 2011 moreover many of the previous assessments relied upon few gcms making them less reliable in their the future projections elshamy 2009 gcms simulations show different results of climate change over northern ethiopia there are high levels of confidence in projecting future temperature increase over the region teklesadik et al 2017 wagena et al 2016 hadgu et al 2015 however the climate change effects might not be similar throughout this region because of several co varying factors as mentioned above for instance mean annual precipitation is expected to decrease e g yimer et al 2009 increase e g setegn et al 2011 or remain unchanged e g hadgu et al 2015 and both frequency and intensity of events exhibited much disparity korecha and sorteberg 2013 nma 2007 kinfe 1999 investigated the potential effects of climate change and its effect on the hydrology of awash river basin they found a decreasing trend in mean annual streamflow of even 34 for the far future period 2071 2100 in the eastern part of the country based on the results from 11 gcms beyene et al 2009 projected an increase in streamflow over the nile basin in the period 2010 2039 followed by a decrease again taye et al 2011 investigated changes in daily climate and hydrological extremes for two catchments within the nile river basin using 17 gcms for two global emission scenarios they indicated increasing peak flows for the nyando catchment but trends for lake tana catchment precipitation and mean discharge were unclear half of the gcms projected an increase while the other half projected a decrease they also observed that wider signals for precipitation than for temperature and emphasized that an investigation of climate change impact that relied upon a small number of gcms and emission scenarios is subject to large uncertainty global climate models gcms fowler et al 2007 dibike and coulibaly 2006 have a spatial resolution that is too coarse for regional studies hence downscaling techniques need to resolve this scale disparity to translate large scale climate model results to local climate like temperature and precipitation dibike et al 2008 wilby et al 2004 dynamic downscaling and statistical downscaling are the most widely used techniques for this purpose dynamic downscaling approaches are physically process driven and complex and computationally demanding on the other hand statistical downscaling models are data driven and easy to apply and require much less computational time jeong et al 2012 fowler et al 2007 linear regression methods like multiple linear regression and non linear regression methods like artificial neural networks anns are commonly used statistical downscaling methods that are used for forecasting hydro climatic variables with reliable estimates fowler et al 2007 wilby et al 2004 in this work an improved artificial neural networks anns modeling technique was employed to downscale gcm output and for forecasting streamflow for the twenty first century artificial neural networks anns models are one such type of model which can serve as universal approximators and make a more reliable estimations for complex and non linear system asce 2000 hewitson and crane 1996 thus anns perform more accurately and rapidly in simulating hydro climatic variables von storch et al 2000 previous studies have noted that attempts to project the future of hydro climatic variables yield inconsistent results even though most of them concerned humid regions e g teklesadik et al 2017 wagena et al 2016 berhane et al 2013 taye et al 2011 this might be attributed to different spatial scales that were the investigated e g reda et al 2015 anyah and qiu 2012 conway and schipper 2011 use of different time periods chosen for the analysis e g setegn et al 2011 kinfe 1999 and due to considering only few gcms e g wagena et al 2016 hadgu et al 2015 yimer et al 2009 inconsistencies were not only due to methodological differences for instance only few previous studies presented observational evidences to support their hypothesis and they estimated the changes in hydro climate only using gcms simulation results of gcms may differ both in magnitude and direction of projected changes siam and eltahir 2017 accordingly consensus is not easily obtained regarding changes of climate and its impact on the streamflow this lack of consensus obstructs the development of effective climate change adaptation plans mcsweeney et al 2012 therefore it is essential that understanding of climate variability and change during the past and under future warming at spatial and temporal scales in a region which is vulnerable to climate change in this study we combine recent observations with multi gcms simulations keeping spatial variability into account with the objectives to i investigate the nature of the observed hydro climatic change for and within tekeze river basin 1961 2014 ii evaluate the performance of 30 cmip5 gcms output and their ensemble means in simulating hydro climatic patterns over the study region and iii construct a reliable ensemble mean projection for temperature and precipitation and study the hydrological impacts of future climate projections we considered three time horizons the early twenty first century 2010 2039 mid twenty first century 2040 2069 late twenty first century 2071 2099 against the reference period 1961 1990 under emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 at annual seasonal and monthly time scales these simulations are performed for the river tekeze sub basin in northern ethiopia that drains into nile river basin as it is representative of the relatively dry biogeophysical environments in the highlands of northern ethiopia that has received little research attention in the past 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site tekeze river basin tb covers about 66 541 km2 in the northern part of ethiopia extends from 35º52 32 to 39º52 34 east and 11 37 10 to 14 48 20 north fig 1 the tb is one of the upstream parts of the nile river basin and is characterized by a typical dry biogeophysical environment the elevations range from 481 m a s l to 4517 m a s l with average elevation being 1740 m 659 more than 70 of the basin is located in the highlands with an elevation exceeding 1500 m a s l the highest point is situated in the central part of the basin the tekeze river from its source near mt abun yosef 4190 m a s l to the confluence of the three rivers tekeze angereb and goang is 830 km long the sub basins of tekeze river basin originating in the highlands of ethiopia are gilgel tekeze belesa tserare ras dejen geba and worie zarema sibta and humera sub basins are located in the lower region of the basin fig 1 the climate is dry with a distinctly seasonal precipitation with most of which 81 is during the major rainy season from june to september and the short rainy period in march april and may a dry period starts in october and lasts for four months the mean annual precipitation for the 1961 2014 period ranged from about 409 mm in the northeast part of the upper region to over 1300 mm in the highlands of southwest parts of the lower region of tekeze river basin large scale atmospheric circulations and topographic settings strongly influence the spatio temporal precipitation patterns over the region segele and lamb 2005 the annual precipitation variability in the basin is large with a coefficient of variation ranging from 0 1 in the lower region to 0 5 over its highland parts of the basin the mean annual temperature in the basin ranges from 10 c in the highlands to over 28 c in the lowlands the maximum and minimum mean annual potential evapotranspiration are 2538 mm in the west part and 905 mm in the central highlands of the basin with average value of 1688 mm gebreyohannes et al 2013 the mean annual streamflow at humera gauging station see fig 1 near to the basin outlet is 11 428 mm3 and varies from more than 4142 mm3 month in august to less than 247 mm3 month on average in the drier period december to april the topography of the basin comprises of hills with uplands in the north eastern and southern parts and is dominated by valleys in the western parts the lithology is dominated by precambrian crystalline rocks eocene flood basalts late jurassic limestone shale and gypsum and jurassic sandstone ismail and abdelsalam 2012 the main soil types are eutric vertisols on the level lands eutric leptosol eutric vertisol eutric and calcric cambisol and haplic luvisol on the sloping lands eutric leptosol on the steep lands and leptosol on composite landforms fao 1998 land use and land cover is dominated by cropland shrub covered areas open woodlands and grasslands fao 2014 the areas with the highest slopes 35 are covered by shrublands and woodlands while the flatter areas 7 15 are covered with crop and grasslands 2 2 datasets and models we examine the datasets of temperature t precipitation p streamflow sf cmip5 gcms outputs and predictors of large scale atmospheric variables ncep ncar reanalysis project data for climate models we use output from 30 gcms participating in cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 experiments source https esgf node llnl gov projects esgf llnl reanalysis fields include zonal and meridional wind geopotential height vertical velocity and virtual temperature are used in the current study appendix a table a 3 historical estimations of these variables are available from the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and national center for atmospheric research ncar reanalysis database source http www cpc ncep noaa gov products wesley reanalysis html 2 2 1 meteorological and hydrological data the national meteorological agency nma provide daily meteorological data for t and p for the period 1961 2014 a total of 51 meteorological stations were used 42 of which are within the tb and 9 are outside but close to the boundaries of the basin see fig 1 detailed information is presented in table a 1 of appendix a daily sf data for the 12 river gauging stations fig 1 for the period 1961 2014 was found from the ethiopia ministry of water resources irrigation and electricity appendix a table a 2 the hydro climatic data has some missing data appendix a table a 1 and a 2 missing data were filled using weighting factor method based on correlation coefficients after estimating a high significant correlations p 0 0001 between neighbouring stations during the period where both of them have climate records woldesenbet et al 2017 2 2 2 cmip5 gcms and ncep ncar data data for the 30 gcms were obtained from the fifth report of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 multi model dataset https esgf node llnl gov projects esgf llnl the cmip5 gcms experimental design are described by taylor et al 2012 the cmip5 gcms have different ensemble members r1 r2 r3 etc and differ only in initial conditions around 1850 but the physics and the greenhouse gas forcing are the same for the simulations in this study since different versions of the same model often exhibit similarities aloysius et al 2016 monerie et al 2012 we used only the first member from the gcms one ensemble member per model to avoid model bias the utilized ensemble was r1i1p1 where r i and p represent the realization initialization method indicator and perturbed physics ensemble respectively details of the models used and affiliations responsible for the model development are presented in table 1 two time periods of the multi model ensemble are taken into account 1961 2005 for the historical simulations which correspond to the observed data and 2006 2100 for the future simulations of climate change the two representative concentration pathways rcps high concentrations scenario rcp8 5 moss et al 2010 and moderate concentrations scenario rcp4 5 thomson et al 2011 were chosen for this study because they are the most widely simulated global emission scenarios in all models taylor et al 2011 2012 and therefore suitable for comparison with other investigations for downscaling gcms output reanalysis data of monthly large scale predictor fields at each station were obtained from the reanalysis 1 and 2 projects of the ncep ncar archive kalnay et al 1996 these data were used in this work because of their longer time coverage compared with those in other reanalysis products 2 3 data analysis observed and projected t p and sf trends analysis were conducted using the mann kendall test appendix b prior to testing we applied pre whitening on the time series hydro climatic data to remove the effect of serial correlations yue et al 2003 the rate of change over the years having a linear trend was estimated through a least squares fit of a regression line 2 3 1 downscaling strategy the first step for the development of downscaling models for both t and p starts with selection of appropriate predictors anns is then trained and validated for hydro climatic variables finally the downscaling model is used to obtain projections of t and p from gcms outputs prior to the downscaling of gcms output cross correlations and scatter plots are estimated between 25 potential predictors and the two predictands i e t and p for each station based on the deseasonalized predictor and predictand series over the available record from 1961 to 2014 spearman s rank correlation spearman 1904a 1904b product moment correlation pearson 1896 and kendall s tau kendall 1975 are used to investigate the correlations between predictor and predictands variables which have passed the two tailed test at the 1 significance level were considered for using in the modelling processes and these are shown in bold text in appendix a table a 3 artificial neural networks anns were used to downscale the present and future t and p from the large scale atmospheric variables section 2 4 the monthly t and p data were calculated by thiessen polygon to obtain the interpolated value to each model and emission scenario for the tb and its sub regions the correlation coefficient between observed monthly t and p data and observed sf are assessed appendix a table a 4 for the prediction of sf in the tekeze river basin and its sub regions t tt 1 tt 2 p pt 1 pt 2 were chosen as input to the ann model where tt i and pt i refer to the previous ith month t and p respectively 2 3 2 gcms performance assessment and future projection the assessment of gcms performance is based on estimates of the absolute differences between the observed data and databases simulated using 30 gcms for the period 1961 1990 and changes of magnitude during 1961 1980 relative to 1986 2005 furthermore to investigate whether the differences between the observed data and databases simulated using 30 gcms is significant or not this is tested with non parametric method of the kruskal wallis test we graded the models by their performance for individual hydro climatic variables and sub regions and overall model ranks for the tb and its sub regions are assigned based on average rank for all variables table 4 in this case the model assigned to rank 1 30 represent lowest highest differences to the observed value and show better worse model performance in reproducing the present day hydro climate törnqvist et al 2014 general linear model univariate analysis was used to examine the future spatio temporal variations of t p and sf from gcms output all ensemble mean datasets were investigated using analysis of variance anova of the four factors 1 the regions factor upper lower and the entire tekeze river basin 2 the emission scenarios factor rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 3 the period s factor 1961 1990 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 and 4 seasonal factor annual rainy small rainy and dry seasons monthly mean temperature total precipitation and total streamflow were used as the dependent variables 2 4 artificial neural networks anns artificial neural networks are mathematical algorithmic models initiated by the biological nervous system and intelligence haykin 1994 a neural network consists of a group of processing elements neurons which are linked through networks with a corresponding weight and activated by functions to fit with the outputs the arrangements are structured in the form of layers input hidden and hidden output layers dibike coulibaly 2006 we develop a three layer feed forward neural network ffnn with an input layer one hidden layer and one output layer to downscaling large scale climatic variables to a local scale and estimate hydro climatic values fig 2 equation for output y k from ffnn with a hidden layer of jth neuron given by 1 y k a o j 1 m w k j a h i 1 n w j i x i w j b w k b where x i is the input variables wj i and w k j are the weight associated with input hidden and hidden output layers wjb and wkb represent the biases for input hidden and hidden output layers and ah and ao are activation functions for the hidden nodes and the output layer respectively to account for nonlinearities between input and output associations a tan hyperbolic function is used to each neuron in the hidden and output layers and the processes of network training use a backpropagation algorithm the levenberg marquardt backpropagation method hagan and menhaj 1994 is employed as the training algorithm in the ffnn for the adjustments of weights until the value of the errors shown in fig 2 is considered to be at a minimum chadwick et al 2011 the optimal number of hidden nodes is identified by trial and error several network training experiments within 10 40 neurons are conducted the best combination of training testing and validation errors with the small number of neurons is selected as the best network for the training period 70 of the observed data are used the remaining 30 used for validation to eliminate dimensional differences dawson and wilby 1998 before the training process the inputs and target data were standardised to values in the range 0 1 as presented in eq 2 2 y x x m i n x m a x x m i n in eq 2 y represents the final normalized data x the observed data x m a x and x m i n are the maximum and minimum of values for the observed data 3 results and discussion 3 1 observed hydro climatic changes the temperature t and precipitation p records between 1961 and 2014 are shown in appendix a table a 1 fig 3 illustrate the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal mean t and total p over the tekeze river basin tb the basin wide average of annual t was 19 67 c there is an increasing slope of t from the southern region with approximately 15 29 c in the northwest region of the basin mean annual p over the basin was 852 mm year and it was largest 1300 mm year in the southwest and the smallest 409 mm year in northeast of the basin the results for annual and seasonal t and p trends investigated using the mann kendall method are summarized in appendix a table a 5 fig 3 a d e h also shown the spatial coverage of temporal trends during the period 1961 2014 for observed annual and seasonal t and p over the basin the trend analysis of basin scale t and p revealed a significant increasing trend in t and a slight increasing non significant trend in p in fig 4 a and b t increase is approximately 0 01 c year 0 54 c during 1961 2014 period and p increase is approximately by 2 36 mm year 127 mm during 1961 2014 period the annual mean t and total p of the period 1991 2014 are larger than the long term average as shown in fig 4d and e analysis of observed t data for the 1961 2014 period showed both increasing and decreasing trends fig 3a d and appendix a table a 5 there were strong increasing trends in annual and seasonal mean t at most of the stations annual mean t tended to increase at about 79 of the stations whereas a decreasing trend was observed at the stations in the northwest of the basin e g adewa selehelehi and shiraro these increasing and decreasing trends are statistically significant at 0 05 level of significance at about 66 and 8 of the stations respectively and most stations found in the eastern region of the basin showed an increasing trend fig 3a the increase and decrease in t among stations ranged from 0 05 to 1 5 c and 0 04 0 5 c per decade respectively the observed warming over the past decades at the stations is in line with nma 2007 that reported a national warming rate of 0 37 c decade for 1951 2006 and hansen et al 2006 who also indicated that global average temperature is increasing at the rate of 0 2 c decade during the twentieth century these results are consistent with those previously reported in the northern ethiopia e g tesfaye et al 2017 hadgu et al 2015 gebrehiwot and van der veen 2013 mcsweeney et al 2008 nma 2007 the study by tesfaye et al 2017 also found a warming trend in mean annual temperature in the range of 0 26 0 84 c decade for geba catchment located within tb during the 1980 2014 period trends of annual and seasonal total p and mann kendall test values for the examined stations are shown in fig 3e h appendix a table a 5 and 35 3 of the stations have a statistically significant trend annual p has a significant decreasing trend for 19 6 of the stations and an increasing trend for 15 7 of the stations at 0 05 significance level the magnitudes of the trends ranged from 1 2 to 25 3 and from 0 4 to 37 4 mm year per year respectively most of the stations which are found in the north eastern region of the basin have a significant decreasing trends in annual and rainy season precipitation whereas increasing trends are found in the southern region of the basin there is thus a regional difference for both the annual and seasonal data and the direction of trends the annual and seasonal precipitation cycle in northern ethiopia is much affected by the development of indian monsoons camberlin 1997 and it is clear that the declining precipitation can be related to a cool tropical indian ocean seleshi and zanke 2004 the spatial variability of precipitation over the northern ethiopian highlands is attributed to topographical factors and the northwards and eastwards movements of the itcz jacob et al 2013 nyssen et al 2005 krauer 1988 in the rainy season the monsoon develops over the area due to the migration of the itcz to northern position and southerly moisture flow krauer 1988 and the western and southern slopes obtain higher precipitation nyssen et al 2005 the p trend analysis is in agreement with recent investigations in the northern ethiopia gebremicael et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 tekleab et al 2013 tabari et al 2015 found mixed results of increasing and decreasing trends in total annual and seasonal precipitation in the blue nile river basin declining trends in the annual and seasonal precipitation in northern and central highlands of ethiopia were observed by osman and sauerborn 2002 and seleshi and demaree 1995 and insignificant trends by gebremicael et al 2017 seleshi and camberlin 2006 and conway 2000 differences in time period and spatial scale of the different investigations may be the cause of these inconsistencies nicholson 2000 pointed out that p during the 1950s showed an increasing trend in ethiopia while in the 1960s it showed a decreasing trend during the 1970s mixed trends within the region are obtained but in the 1980s again it showed a decreasing trend the 1990s and the late 2000s showed again an increase mcsweeney and new 2008 also conway et al 2004 indicated that the decreasing and increasing trends in annual p could be less distinct when a longer period is considered and they found no trend is observed in p over one century 1898 2002 for addis abeba in central ethiopia these observations illustrate the importance of the period over which a trend analysis is conducted in ethiopia for all investigated periods of annual rainy season and small rainy season streamflow sf most of the stations showed a decreasing trend fig 3i l and appendix a table a 6 and these are predominantly found in the upper region ur of the basin fig 3i l here annual sf at the three stations suluh agula and yechila displayed a significant decreasing trends while sf at genfel station displayed a significant increasing trend comparing fig 3e and i reveal that stations with a decreasing trend in sf agreed to some extent with stations with a decreasing trend in precipitation within and close to the sub basins remarkable is that despite decreasing trends in sf for the majority of ur stream gauging stations the trend at the basin wide outlet humera station is instead an increasing one this implies that other factors such as anthropogenic activities and topographic settings in the upper region probably cause this difference sf at the basin during 1967 1976 fig 4f is smaller by approximately 28 than for the period 1994 till 2014 for the entire 47 years period figs 3i and 4 c the annual sf has an increasing but not significant trend these results are consistent with those of fenta et al 2017 gebremicael et al 2017 and tesfaye et al 2017 who reported the large spatial variability of streamflow in northern ethiopia land use and land cover changes implementation of large scale soil and water conservation measures construction of hydropower dam and micro dams for irrigation are non uniformly spread across the river basin and are predominantly found in the upper region gebremicael et al 2017 guyassa et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 this leads to large disparity between p patterns and sf trends fenta et al 2017 tesfaalem et al 2014 rientjes et al 2013 with monthly and seasonal analysis of the stations the spatio temporal variability of hydro climatic change was examined figs 3 and 4 the monthly change for t p and sf during the periods 1961 1990 and 1991 2014 as shown in fig 4 d f has a significant increasing trend for t during the small rainy and dry periods for p mainly the rainy season june september has an increasing trend and p would remain at a high level for two to three months from july to september rather than gradually arriving at a peak in july and then starting to decrease fig 4e in general about 81 of the p occurs in the rainy season in average 852 mm year sf displays the largest increase in the small rainy and dry periods streamflow at the ur outlet and in the lr showed significant increasing trends both in small rainy and dry periods fig 3i l and appendix a table a 6 the increasing t is expected to induce more evapotranspiration and hence decreases the proportion of available water to the total sf however as figs 3i and 4 c show there is an increasing trend in sf which might be attributed to some degree by the increase in p at the southern stations the slight increasing trend in rainy season p contributed to the enhanced sf in this period for the significant increase during the small rainy fig 3k and dry periods fig 3l human intervention such as ecological rehabilitation deforestation soil and water conservation and the start of operation of the tekeze hydropower dam in 2009 in the ur gebremicael et al 2017 tesfaye et al 2017 nyssen et al 2010 haregeweyn et al 2008 is the most likely factor that affect sf weather forcing and basin characteristics such as land use and land cover changes and topographic settings are intrinsic drivers for streamflow variation the association between climatic patterns and sf trends for a particular basin stay comparable except the basin characteristics have been altered milly et al 2005 our spatio temporal trend analysis of the annual p for the entire basin showed that the patterns of precipitation are not significantly changed during the analysed period whereas the trends of annual average streamflow did and reveal the relevance of the space time variant variable like land use and land cover changes besides to climatic condition when understanding the changes on the streamflow of the basin environmental rehabilitation programmes and water abstractions for irrigation which contribute to changes in sf differ between the sub basins fenta et al 2017 gebremicael et al 2017 and dile et al 2016 mentioned that recent human interventions have contributed mainly to the variations of streamflow in northern ethiopia for instance soil and water conservation measures have altered the underlying terrain and stored additional rainwater behind the dams as a consequence less water is available for streamflow and peak discharges are affected more than low discharges 3 2 gcms performance assessment we aim to select a subset from gcms based on their ability to reproduce the observed climate patterns and causal mechanisms to improve the quality of simulation over the tekeze river basin tb to evaluate the performance of gcms for tb we compared the 30 years 1961 1990 observed temperature t precipitation p and streamflow sf to the database of 30 gcms as shown in fig 5 the gcms ensemble mean for both p and sf is overestimated for the period where we have observations for t this is only the case for the lower region lr whereas t is underestimated for the upper region ur and for the entire tb in absolute numbers differences vary from 1 33 to 0 37 c for t and 24 16 to 462 13 mm for p for the entire tb for sf the differences ranged from 0 93 to 114 57 mm which indicates that for some models the deviation from observed values are quite important as table 2 reveals a large number of the gcms lead to overestimation of p and sf and underestimation of t for tb and both ur and lr since we have also observations for the period 1986 2014 we can evaluate gcm performance also regarding how well they predict change after 1980 so we consider the two periods 1961 1980 and 1986 2005 for the evaluation the gcms perform better for temperature than for precipitation and streamflow fig 5 table 2 and table 3 table 2 and table 3 suggest that the simulated change in t is lower than the observed change whereas the simulated changes for p and sf is not only lower in magnitude but also in the opposite direction in table 4 we showed model ranking for the 30 gcms based on their performances regarding absolute values as well as concerning how well they capture changes between two time periods appendix a table a 7 a 10 the best performances rank 1 are indicated in bold these results indicate that the best performance depends on the indicators variates and sub basins that are considered it is therefore plausible that if other indicators or variates were chosen also the ranking would change the agreement between model results and observations can also be assessed by multiple pair wise comparisons for the kruskal wallis test table 5 for the ur and lr and appendix a table a 11 including for the entire tb these results give useful information on which models present similar values for instance model databases of gfdl esm2m 11 cnrm cm5 7 and ipsl cm5a lr 20 lead to similar simulated values for t p and sf for ur for lr the model databases of hadgem2 es 18 gfdl esm2m 11 giss e2 r 14 and for tb giss e2 h 12 cnrm cm5 7 and giss e2 r cc 15 models capture very well the observations from the evaluation of gcms performance ccsm4 gent et al 2011 mri cgcm3 yukimoto et al 2006 and gfdl cm3 donner et al 2011 perform well for most of the measures of model evaluation over tb this may be partially attributed to these gcms having a better resolution as this results in an improved representation of land surface features e g topography and atmospheric conditions li et al 2016 accounting for the annual cycle of soil water storage and ecosystem dynamics in their land models donner et al 2011 gent et al 2011 and enso variability and sea surface temperatures along the equator in mean and annual cycle representation in their ocean models deser et al 2012 griffies 2006 leads to improvements in model performance for northern ethiopia figs 6 8 show the monthly mean of t p and sf distributions respectively for all gcm models as well as for all ensemble means enms and for selected model ensemble means senms senms is derived from those models which showed significant similarity with the observed data as apparent in the kruskal wallis test and best overall model performance up to 10 for each parameters and in each region the mean annual cycle of the 1961 2005 temperature reveals that most of the gcms underestimated t when compared to the observed data for the entire tb and its sub regions e g figs 6g with 4 d the mean monthly t distributions differ much in lr fig 6d f while the march may peak and seasonal cycles in t are captured well the models differ in their representations of annual p cycles fig 7 yet most models capture the june september peak and seasonal cycles in p well for the entire tb and its sub regions although with the tendency to over estimate precipitation especially in lr the models differ in the projection of the annual cycle however the lr climate is also less densely monitored compared to the ur see figs 1 and 3 and therefore prone to have larger errors the larger bias between the gcms and observations may therefore be attributed to a poor average climate monitoring stations located in the lr models also have difficulties in predicting the sf cycle fig 8 most of the models captured well monthly patterns and seasonal cycles of sf of the entire tb and the two sub regions during high flow rates the lr had the poorest performance regarding the monthly sf pattern and seasonal cycles compared to the ur and the entire tb as was already mentioned earlier gcms mostly underestimated t and overestimated p and sf and it is probable that differences in model skill insufficient spatial resolution in resolving orographic features in more detail as well as land surface processes are causes for this performance li et al 2016 biasutti 2013 slingo et al 2005 for instance the complex topography over northern ethiopia results in complex climate and precipitation pattern jury 2015 rientjes et al 2013 haile et al 2009 segele and lamb 2005 one cause why models do not perform better for tropical hydro climatic variables is the variability related with e g the pacific ocean el niño southern oscillation enso and its global teleconnections aloysius et al 2016 suzuki 2011 balas et al 2007 atlantic ocean ssts indian ocean ssts land surface moisture and vegetation response dezfuli and nicholson 2013 siam et al 2014 segele et al 2009 for example li and xie 2014 reported excessive precipitation in the tropics partly due to bias in the double itczs in relation with excessive downward solar radiation representation and parameterization of physical processes in models their dynamical core and potential inadequacies for tropical regions are further discussed in li and xie 2014 monerie et al 2012 shongwe et al 2010 and dai 2006 model developers recognized that improvements of these aspects could advance the climate simulation quality for tropical regions birch et al 2014 biasutti 2013 knutti and sedlacek 2013 moss et al 2010 the all ensemble means enms and selected ensemble means senms reasonably captured the mean monthly distribution particularly months which have largest value and seasonal cycles in all hydro climate variables figs 6 8 the value of an ensemble mean of simulated hydro climatic variables has been mentioned by others e g haile and rientjes 2015 kim et al 2014 otieno and anyah 2013 taye and willems 2012 knutti et al 2010 in being more accurate than individual models however our results for the entire tb and its sub regions show that several models outperform the ensemble mean table 3 also the performance of gcms shown to differ in dependence of frameworks regions and hydro climatic variables despite that an average of better performing models has been suggested assumed to be more reliable than an all model ensemble for hydro climatic changes contrasting results are discussed in knutti et al 2010 therefore in the current study emphasis has been on performance metrics to assess models skill and used all ensemble means for future projections of t p and sf as in next section 3 3 projected hydro climatic change 3 3 1 projected temperature on average for the entire tekeze river basin tb and both sub regions the results from all gcms for both emission scenarios and all seasons indicate that the temperature t is projected to decrease by 0 104 c during 2010 2039 and to increase by 0 31 c during 2041 2070 and by 0 39 c during 2071 2099 all relative to the historical period 1961 1990 similarly an increase in t is observed for rcp4 5 by 0 13 c and rcp8 5 by 0 27 c at the end of the twenty first century table 6 a significant warming is also expected to occur at the end of this period p 0 001 appendix a table a 12 all assessed factors regions rcps and seasons affected the temperature p 0 001 table 6 the simulation indicated that the temperature in rcp8 5 scenario is significantly higher than rcp4 5 and both the emission scenarios have shown significant interactions p 0 01 table 6 the entire tb is projected to witness an increase of t anomalies with reference to the 1961 1990 average over the years fig 9 i l with t anomalies reaching 0 13 c decade in the rcp8 5 scenario and greater than 0 1 c decade in the rcp4 5 scenario at the end of twenty first century fig 9i near similar t features are projected for the tb during rainy and dry seasons under both scenarios fig 9j and l temperature changes during the small rainy season shows no change under rcp4 5 and a slight increase under the rcp8 5 scenario fig 9k the changes in temperature over the ur are near uniform across the years with less uncertainty compared to lr fig 9a h for ur changes in projected t are at an average rate of 0 1 c decade and 0 2 c decade in both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively over the years fig 9a the rate of projected t changes for the lower region lr is smaller than the changes in the upper region ur under rcp8 5 scenario fig 9a h changes in t under rcp8 5 scenario was 0 1 c decade 0 1 c decade smaller than the rate at ur the magnitude of increasing trends are also similar in the annual fig 9e rainy fig 9h and dry fig 9h seasons for lr nonetheless t changes over the lr during small rainy season fig 9g shows a decreasing anomaly by 0 07 c decade under rcp4 5 and by 0 03 c decade under the rcp8 5 scenarios for the end of the century generally the largest increase in t is projected for ur of the basin compared to the entire basin and the lr the difference in projected t increase decrease between ur and lr of the tb is somewhat spatial dependent in line with what was reported in historical temperature records see section 3 1 our analysis shows that the observed geographical dependent warming may become more pronounced in the future in fig 6 the annual cycles of t for the 30 gcms enms and senms under gcms future and historical outputs are compared with those of the observed seasonal variation fig 4d a bias to higher temperature over the tb and its sub regions is observed for the majority of gcms the models representations of annual t cycle much differ in lr fig 6d f whilst models capture well the march may peak in t some show a bias to lower temperatures the models representations under rcp4 5 scenario vary much and are biased to the lower temperatures than under rcp8 5 scenario our result is consistent with other studies teklesadik et al 2017 wagena et al 2016 hadgu et al 2015 conway and schipper 2011 which indicated that temperature projected in different parts of ethiopia by gcms is warmer in the future 3 3 2 projected precipitation the trend analysis in p shows a significant decreasing trend from the reference period 1961 1990 to the future 2040 2069 and 2071 2099 as shown in table 6 the simulated p is expected to increase by 5 8 in the period 2010 2039 relative to the reference period 1961 1990 afterwards p will decrease by 1 8 and 6 3 during the mid 21st century 2041 2070 and the late 21st century 2071 2099 respectively table 6 also shows that there are significant differences depending on all factors regions emission scenarios seasons and their interactions future changes in annual and seasonal p anomalies as a function of time are shown in fig 10 predicted average p anomalies decrease by 2 6 mm year for rcp8 5 scenario and increase than 1 9 mm year under rcp4 5 scenario at the end of twenty first century in the tb fig 10i similar p features are projected during rainy and dry seasons fig 10j and 10 l under both emission scenarios whereas p changes during the small rainy season fig 10k show an increasing anomaly by 0 06 mm year in both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios the increased p during the small rainy season in the future may benefit the agricultural however the higher t will lead to an increased evapotranspiration which can cause moisture loss in the tb conway and schipper 2011 changes in annual p for ur showed a significantly decreasing trend from 2010 to the end of twenty first century fig 10a and appendix a table a 13 the changes are showing a significant difference in both rcp4 5 1 4 mm year and rcp8 5 1 9 mm year scenarios fig 10 however disparate changes are shown in the trends of p during rainy and small rainy seasons fig 10b and c the trend of increasing p for rcp8 5 shows both a steeper slope than for rcp4 5 and a larger variability similarly a trend of decreasing p is shown during dry season 2 mm year but a little higher in the range of variability for rcp8 5 fig 10d projected precipitation for lr is expected to decrease by more than 1 6 mm year at the end of the twenty first century in both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios it is found that the tendency under rcp8 5 2 9 mm year is stronger than that under rcp4 5 and both scenarios showed roughly the same pattern of variability furthermore the projected p anomalies tend to decrease in both scenarios during rainy and dry seasons at the end of twenty first century while p anomalies during small rainy season slightly increase with 0 08 mm year for rcp4 5 by the middle of the 21 st century the scenario under rcp8 5 displays much wider variability over the years than rcp4 5 scenario despite the average projected precipitation which is significantly different for these scenarios precipitation variability shows roughly similar characteristic the weak changes and variability in spatial averaged p is probably due to the variations in expected driving forces of p variability across the region and seasons jury 2015 the annual cycles of p indicates that models tend to better predict on average lower p than larger p depth fig 7 most of the gcms exhibit a dry bias over the tb and its sub regions for the rcp8 5 scenario results are very variable and with a dry bias compared with rcp4 5 furthermore the monthly p pattern will have a different distribution patterns under both emission scenarios and across the regions in this regard p in june july and august will decrease in both scenarios fig 7 given a decreasing trends of p in june august and a slight increase for the subsequent months a shift of the rainy season is expected towards earlier in the year in northern ethiopia similar results are reported and the spatio temporal projections of p are highly variable araya and stroosnijder 2011 for example yimer et al 2009 predicted a decline in annual p for the period 2050s while hadgu et al 2015 mention no change for the period 2030s and 2050s over northern ethiopia inconsistent trends were also reported in the studies by setegn et al 2011 and beyene et al 2009 projections of p over northern ethiopia both regarding direction and magnitude depend on the length of periods and model types which are used for the projections conway and schipper 2011 setegn et al 2011 thus besides to the natural variability of p varied results from different studies are also due to the gcms type and number that used to simulate p data in this region mcsweeney et al 2010 segele and lamb 2005 3 3 3 projected streamflow the potential impacts of future climate change on the flow of tb and its sub regions towards the end of the twenty first century were studied using the downscaled t and p as predictor inputs to the artificial neural networks anns model table 6 shows that the annual sf for the projected periods display generally a decline particularly for the rcp8 5 scenario the average simulated sf decreases by 6 3 during the mid period 2040 2069 and 8 during the last period 2070 2099 while the average sf shows an increase by 3 during the early period 2010 2039 relative to the reference period 1961 1990 at the end of twenty first century under both scenarios the projected higher t and lower p relative to the historical period lead to a reduction of the sf in the tb table 6 and fig 11 fig 11 represents the gcms ensemble mean in annual and seasonal sf anomalies simulated for historical rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios annual sf anomalies showed a decrease of 0 7 mm year under rcp8 5 scenario and over 0 5 mm year decrease under rcp4 5 scenario during 2010 2099 fig 11i similarly decreasing trends in sf are projected during rainy small rainy and dry seasons over the tb fig 11j k under both scenarios however the trend in sf is less steep during the small rainy season under both rcp4 5 0 02 mm year and rcp8 5 0 06 mm year scenarios fig 11k than in the rainy season streamflow changes over ur showed a significantly decreasing trend over the years fig 11a d from 2010 to the end of twenty first century 2099 for the entire basin the changes are significant in both scenarios table 6 however during rainy and small rainy seasons fig 11b and c there is a distinct difference in the trends of the sf in the ur streamflow increase during rainy season under rcp8 5 stronger than sf increase during small rainy season under rcp4 5 with larger variability under rcp8 5 scenario the dry season sf change is similar as the annual change fig 11d and the variability of sf is larger for rcp8 5 scenario the projected streamflow anomalies over the lr are expected to decline by more than 0 36 mm year in both scenarios at the end of the twenty first century in the rcp8 5 scenario the anomalies trend 0 5 mm year is slightly stronger and the range of variability between the scenarios is not visible during the small rainy season for both scenarios an increasing trend in the projected sf anomalies is observed in addition the projected small rainy season sf anomalies are slightly increased by 3 2 mm decade and 3 7 mm decade by the end of the twenty first century for the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the variability under rcp8 5 is much larger compared to rcp4 5 and the mean sf appeared to be significantly different under the two emission scenarios table 6 the mean monthly sf for baseline conditions 1961 1990 and for climate change scenarios are shown in fig 8 streamflow shown a distinct response to a large change in p in the future as it decreases more than p this response is plausible in view of increasing temperatures that would increase evapotranspiration and reduce water storage and discharge compared with the baseline period significant sf decreases are expected from june to september under both future scenarios appendix a table a 12 because much less rain will falls in the rainy seasons the baseline sf variation indicates that the streamflow typically reaches its peak in july at the mid rainy season fig 4f which corresponds with results of nyssen et al 2010 in future scenarios sf would remain at a high level for three to four months from july to october rather than gradually arriving at a peak and then starting to decrease fig 8 which is attributed to changing the future precipitation pattern and also lag response contribution to sf in line with our results other studies on the hydrological response to warming in northern ethiopia e g dile et al 2016 setegn et al 2011 elshamy 2009 conway and hulme 1996 show a decrease of sf dile et al 2016 predicted a very similar annual decrease in streamflow for the rainy season at the end of twenty first century abdo et al 2009 investigated the hydrological effect of climate change in gelgel abay ethiopia they expect a 2 9 decrease in mean annual sf in comparison with the period 1996 2006 furthermore in the eastern part of ethiopia kinfe 1999 projected a decrease in mean annual sf up to 34 during 2071 2100 compared with 1971 1990 the disagreement not only in magnitude abdo et al 2009 kinfe 1999 but also in direction siam and eltahir 2017 beyene et al 2009 of simulated changes in sf with our results might be that the other investigations had other approaches and reference periods such differences unfortunately complicate it to reach consensus on how climate change affects hydrological responses and what the implications are for the development and management of water resources in northern ethiopia it is not surprising that assessment of hydro climatic change suffers from much uncertainty the uncertainty originating from gcms rcps downscaling and projection methods of causes differences as well as uncertainty in of hydro climatic estimates hawkins and sutton 2009 wilby and harris 2006 the projected t p and sf display significant differences between gcms gcms show relative small difference for t than p and sf table 6 and appendix a table a 13 18 the projected t vary from 0 12 to 4 2 c under rcp4 5 and from 0 41 to 4 8 c under rcp8 5 for p however the range from 30 to 31 under rcp4 5 and from 42 to 55 under rcp8 5 appendix a table a 13 a 15 the uncertainty in projected t and p would bring differences in the projected future sf these indeed vary between 43 and 30 for rcp4 5 and between 64 and 44 for rcp8 5 appendix a table a 13 15 the range of uncertainties between rcps for an individual gcm in the three periods are from 1 4 to 1 6 c for t 27 to 46 for p and 49 to 40 for sf appendix a table a 16 18 the results show that the magnitude of changes in the simulated value between rcps are smaller than between gcms this reflects the fact that in both rcps and gcms uncertainty is substantial more generally there are many examples for different regions of the difficulty of gcms to accurately model hydro climatic variables in river basins knutti and sedlácek et al 2013 ipcc 2007 in different river basins of the region e g setegn et al 2011 taye et al 2011 beyene et al 2009 elshamy 2009 there is therefore a need for more accurate consideration of large scale atmospheric circulation patterns and its mechanism from the three oceanic regions pacific indian and atlantic ocean segele et al 2009 topographic features and climate processes mcsweeney et al 2010 segele and lamb 2005 and human ecosystem changes and its effects on hydro climatic variabilities moore et al 2012 either in special hydro climatic modules of gcms or in external hydro climatic models connected to gcms 4 conclusions hydro climatic variability in semi arid regions has been linked to the spatial and temporal variations of temperature and precipitation patterns in northern ethiopia both extent and occurrence of droughts are increased and impacting on agricultural production and availability of water resources this serious situation may further worse by climate change to develop better global regional and local climate adaptation strategies a robust assessment of historical and future hydro climatic changes in these regions is crucial this study has investigated the hydro climatic changes for tekeze river basin tb and its sub regions the upper region ur and lower region lr through analysis of spatio temporal variation of the historical and future changes in temperature t precipitation p and streamflow sf temperature precipitation and streamflow observations for a period in the recent past 1961 2014 appeared to vary in a complicated way for northern ethiopia not only can variability of temperature and precipitation lead to both synergistic and antagonistic effects on the water balance of an area but these effects can also control whether streamflow increases or decreases variability of climatic factors as temperature and precipitation was observed to be both spatially and temporally diverse for the considered tekeze river basin accordingly the response of streamflow was also spatiotemporally complex this complexity is of course affected by the hierarchical ordering of upstream downstream interactions our results suggest that the interpretation of streamflow response to climate change needs to account for spatiotemporal variations of climate forcing as well as the hydrological connectivity of a catchment or basin in terms of forecasting the hydro climatic variables for northern ethiopia it appears to be rational to consider either multi gcm ensemble means or means of selected gcm projections rather than individual gcm results but also this study suggests that selection of gcms with well defined evaluation criteria can be important in this region of northern ethiopia in its sub river basins and in other similarly complex regions in such a selection it is important that the objectives of study relevant metrics and variates and the regional complexity of climatological and physiographic factors are taken into account the lack of consensus between the previous studies that investigated the impacts of climate change on hydrological responses of northern ethiopia obstructs the development and management of water resources therefore understanding on climate change and its impact on hydrological responses is important to develop plans the current best prediction is that the water resources in northern ethiopia based on our results are projected to become under more stress during the twenty first century due to climate change this projected impact could be minimized by the development of future effective mitigation and adaptation measures conflict of interest there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements

model new hydrological insights for the region through simulations in the southern appalachian mountains we found that the spatiotemporal variability of radiative properties significantly influences the diurnal cycle of the surface energy budget with marked differences in sensible heat fluxes up to 10 20 better performance of streamflow simulations achieved by using the improved vegetation attributes is tied to changes in rainfall interception and evapotranspiration reflecting the importance of se forests in the regional water cycle the largest improvements in streamflow simulations

reported significant improvements in simulations of energy fluxes by replacing land cover dependent vegetation data and climatologically based vegetation data at low resolution 0 144 or approximately 15 km used in the noah model with the standard modis 8 day products at relatively high spatial resolution 1 km for a four day simulation regarding the impacts of dynamic vegetation characteristics on water flux simulations previous work showed that the joint space time distribution of fvc and lai are essential to capture the seasonality and inter annual variability of streamflow in hydrologic models yildiz and barros 2005 2007 2009 specifically yildiz and barros 2007 first implemented direct assimilation of time varying vegetation by deriving their own lai and fvc products from avhrr ndvi normalized difference vegetation index in the lshm for continuous 6 month simulations of spring summer conditions under dry and wet hydrometeorological regimes inter comparison studies also demonstrated that using time varying vegetation characteristics can improve the simulations of soil moisture ford and quiring 2013 and streamflow andersen et al 2002 tesemma et al 2015 by contrasting the results against conventionally static lai the impact on the coupled water carbon cycle was recently examined by lowman and barros 2018 who introduced prognostic phenology into an existing implementation of the lshm with dynamic vegetation garcia quijano and barros 2005 they showed that model vegetation develops adaptation water use strategies in response to seasonal and inter annual climate variations that feedback nonlinearly into soil moisture and gross primary productivity gpp despite the growing awareness of the need to use time varying vegetation characteristics few hydrologic models prescribe vegetation conditions using real time dynamic vegetation products with realistic inter and intra annual variability due to the lack of continuous gap free time varying vegetation products at a high temporal resolution a major challenge in addressing this impasse is the combination of retrieval uncertainty systematic errors and data gaps in optical remote sensing products e g avhrr modis etc caused by cloud fog and precipitation contamination as extensively documented in the literature gao et al 2008 lopez burgos et al 2013 román et al 2009 williamson et al

topography duan and barros 2017 wilson and barros 2014 2017 severe cloud contamination can significantly handicap the use of optical remote sensing products however to date most efforts in the remote sensing community that have been devoted to improving the accuracy of remote sensing products tend to focus on assessments of land use land cover lulc change impacts baret et al 2013 camacho et al 2013 liang et al 2014 liu et al 2013 masson et al 2003 myneni et al 2002 xiao et al 2014 and less so in systematically evaluating their fidelity in the context of the water cycle generally and watershed hydrology in particular previous studies that investigated hydrological impacts of time varying vegetation characteristics e g ford and quiring 2013 tesemma et al 2015 yildiz and barros 2007 did not discuss the impacts of cloud contamination on the quality of remote sensing products for instance parr et al 2015 replaced climatologically based lai with dynamic lai data directly using the modis standard product in the vic model to improve the estimation of evapotranspiration and streamflow without discussing the quality control for the modis lai product and its impact on vic calibration likewise the quality of avhrr data were taken at face value by yildiz and barros 2005 2007 and 2009 further it is difficult to detect and attribute error to vegetation parameters in many modeling studies due to the short time span of simulations e g days in kumar et al 2014 29 cloud free days in long et al 2011 the cumulative long term impacts of using high quality i e with cloud correction time variant vegetation characteristics products at high temporal resolution e g at least daily to sub daily on basin scale simulations of water fluxes e g evapotranspiration streamflow etc remain to be investigated similar challenges affect two other key land surface radiative parameters examined here the shortwave broadband albedo and longwave broadband emissivity broadband emissivity is required for hydrological modeling to quantify emitted longwave radiation over the full electromagnetic spectrum mainly longwave thermal infrared 8 12 μm and broadband albedo is used to quantify the fraction of incoming shortwave radiation 0 3 3 μm that is reflected which varies instantaneously with solar zenith angle and illumination geometry schaaf et al 2002 wang et al 2004 these two radiative properties are also important indicators of land cover change over long time scales e g deforestation and reforestation dickinson and kennedy 1992 dirmeyer and shukla 1994 garratt 1993 liu 2011 qu et al 2015 as well as indicators of land surface disturbances e g wildfires hydroclimate conditions e g wet or drought and irrigation practices at shorter time scales jin et al 2012 pryor et al 2016 and thus vary both in space and time especially the surface broadband albedo however there are no spatially and temporally varying surface shortwave broadband albedo and longwave broadband emissivity products available for direct use in hydrologic applications for instance modis products include daily or 16 day spectral reflectance under a given observation geometry spectral band and also broadband brdf bidirectional reflectance distribution function parameters black sky albedo directional hemispherical reflectance at a given solar zenith angle e g at local solar noon and white sky albedo bihemispherical reflectance for certain range of bands but continuous gap free products of actual land surface broadband albedo blue sky albedo a weighted average of black sky albedo and white sky albedo with dynamic weights depending on the fraction of diffuse skylight including diurnal variations as needed in high resolution energy flux modeling are not available in addition modis emissivity products only provide daily 8 day and monthly narrowband emissivity data note that previous research has shown that large biases in estimated longwave radiation based on the planck function and the stefan boltzmann law could be attributed to using spectral narrowband emissivity instead of broadband emissivity wang et al 2005 although detailed algorithms for mapping surface broadband albedo using satellite based brdf parameters schaaf et al 2002 and the narrowband to broadband conversion algorithms for generating surface broadband emissivity and albedo from spectral observations jin and liang 2006 liang et al 1999 have been widely used in the remote sensing community qu et al 2015 the importance of this work has not been well recognized and transferred to the hydrological modeling community indeed almost all currently used lsms and hydrological models still adopt either land cover dependent static albedo estimated by radiative transfer models e g the two stream approximation described in bonan 1996 zeng et al 2002 or the spatially varying but temporally semi invariant e g climatologically based seasonal or diurnal varying albedo derived from satellite observations e g modis and avhrr csiszar and gutman 1999 strugnell et al 2001 that are characterized by improved accuracy relative to the former oleson et al 2003 wei et al 2001 using static or semi static albedo influences the surface energy budget the land surface skin temperature and thus the energy exchange at the air ground interface for instance cedilnik et al 2012 found that using daily bihemispherical white sky albedo derived from satellite brdf parameters instead of climatologically based monthly albedo in nwp numerical weather prediction simulations significantly reduced the bias in modeled surface net radiation likewise even very small changes in emissivity have a strong impact in the radiation budget when integrated over time because of the fourth power dependence of emitted longwave radiation on the surface temperature in the application of the stefan boltzmann law see also forster et al 2007 for relevant climate sensitivity discussion to this end the specific scientific questions we aim to address in this study include 1 what is the impact of incorporating corrected spatially and temporally varying landscape attributes i e vegetation characteristics and surface radiative properties into a distributed hydrological model on the simulations of streamflow and evapotranspiration and 2 what is the quantitative impact of using corrected landscape attributes data on the hydrologic chain of interacting processes rainfall interception evapotranspiration soil moisture runoff streamflow net longwave and shortwave radiation net surface radiation sensible heat flux soil temperature etc and consequently on the basin integrated water and energy budgets in topographically complex regions we hypothesized that i large uncertainty and errors are present within remote sensing specifically modis standard products of landscape attributes especially over mountainous regions such as the sam where persistent clouds and lingering heavy fog handicap satellite based data acquisition and that such errors can be corrected at least in part by appropriate post processing methods ii vegetation attributes lai and fvc strongly impact the simulations of evapotranspiration and streamflow both at short and long time scales therefore the corrected vegetation parameters should improve the simulations of streamflow and regional water budget and iii using realistic temporally and spatially varying radiative properties albedo and emissivity will result in improved simulations of the diurnal cycle and sub seasonal and seasonal variability of the surface energy budget including the net total radiation and sensible heat fluxes compared to using the conventional treatment to albedo and emissivity i e land cover dependent values to test these hypotheses we first developed high quality radiative and vegetation properties datasets from modis standard products see table 1 over the iphex2014 domain integrated precipitation and hydrology experiment 2014 see section 2 and barros et al 2014 in the southeast se us at a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km and hourly time step continuously for a seven year time period 2007 2013 these data sets were used for operational hydrological forecasting during iphex using the fully distributed duke coupled surface subsurface hydrology model dchm tao et al 2016 here five modeling experiments were designed to systematically evaluate the propagation of errors associated with standard modis products on dchm simulations of water and energy fluxes in three headwater basins and to characterize the integrated impact of using the improved landscape attributes on basin scale water and energy budgets the objective of this study is two fold i to present a straightforward framework for systematically developing high quality time varying vegetation characteristics and radiative properties that reflect realistic land surface variability e g land cover land use change caused by both natural and human activity factors for hydrologic applications in regions of complex terrain for the first time at hourly temporal resolution and then ii to examine both the long term years and short term one month impacts of using these realistic dynamic i e high quality spatially and temporally varying landscape attributes on water and energy budgets at basin scale using the dchm throughout the paper the term landscape attributes refers to both surface radiative properties and vegetation parameters where the surface radiative properties specifically refer to longwave broadband emissivity and shortwave broadband albedo and the vegetation parameters refer to lai and fvc the developed data over the iphex domain in the se us are publicly and freely available at duke university dois and links are provided at the end of this article moreover the framework presented here provides an easy to follow roadmap for hydrologists to generate quality and continuous gap free data for their modeling studies in different regions or different periods of interest the study region and iphex2014 are described in section 2 the hydrological model the methodology for deriving high quality hourly surface radiative properties and vegetation characteristics products as well as the experimental design to examine the research hypotheses enunciated above are described in section 3 section 4 presents the newly developed datasets focusing on the improvement with respect to modis standard products without post processing the value of the new datasets to improve the fidelity of multi year hydrologic simulations is assessed in section 4 along with an illustrative process analysis of simulated water and energy fluxes using a limited duration case study one month section 5 provides a summary of the work and further discussion 2 study area and evaluation data the iphex2014 was a ground validation gv field campaign in support of nasa s global precipitation measurement gpm satellite mission barros et al 2014 petersen and barros 2018 the iphex domain is centered on the southern appalachian mountains sam and spans the piedmont and coastal plain regions of the se us centered on the four river basins with headwaters in the southern appalachians upper tennessee river basin savannah river basin santee river basin and yadkin pee dee river basin as shown in fig 1 a key objective of iphex was to improve quantitative precipitation estimates qpes and quantitative precipitation forecasts qpfs with application to hydrologic forecasting activities in regions of topographically complex terrain e g the inner regions of the sam under the auspices of iphex an operational hydrological forecasting testbed was established during the intensive observing period iphex iop for 12 headwater basins in the inner region of sam tao et al 2016 in preparation for the forecasting testbed a benchmark project for generating high quality consistent data sets necessary including hydro geographic data soil hydraulic parameters atmospheric forcing landscape attributes etc to implement and operate hydrologic models for the major river basins in the se us was completed for a 7 year period 2007 2013 using high quality historical atmospheric forcing tao and barros 2018 and the landscape attributes data presented here and described in the data report tao and barros 2014b it was possible to conduct long term hydrological model spin up simulations to generate realistic initial conditions e g soil moisture and water tables for operational hydrological forecasting during the iphex iop tao et al 2016 and evaluate the qpes and qpfs products driving the dchm previously point evaluation of the developed atmospheric forcing fields was conducted at four ameriflux towers and the duke environmental physics laboratory dkepl tower at purchase knob in the sam marked in fig 1 tao and barros 2018 the ameriflux towers monitor key variables states affecting ecosystem carbon water and energy fluxes including atmospheric pressure atmospheric temperature upwelling and downward longwave radiation and shortwave radiation albedo can be estimated from the reflected global solar radiation divided by the incoming global solar radiation observations however the comparison of tower observations with the constructed albedo at 1 km resolution is limited by the spatial heterogeneity and the uncertainty associated with the spatial scale gap e g from the point scale to pixel scale that is its representativeness cescatti et al 2012 liu et al 2009 román et al 2011 2013 román et al 2009 to assess whether the tower based albedo estimates can represent the spatial variability of the surrounding landscape at the spatial scales of modis products román et al 2009 concluded in their study that the us chr tower fig 1 and table 2 is the only tower spatially representative of its surrounding landscape in the se us thus the albedo measurements at us chr are used here to validate our constructed albedo estimates from modis brdf parameters although there are no available observations of lai fvc and emissivity at the ameriflux towers the newly developed data are contrasted against standard modis products at three selected flux tower locations with different land cover types and very distinct topography table 2 in addition an indirect evaluation strategy was pursued through end to end hydrologic modeling to examine the fidelity of the developed landscape attributes data by comparing simulated streamflow against observations specifically three headwater catchments of the pigeon river basin prb in the sam that are equipped with usgs united states geological survey stream gauges but not affected by dam operations were selected to evaluate the hydrological simulation results the cataloochee creek basin in the inner mountain region ccb 128 km2 and the west fork pigeon river basin wfprb 71 km2 and the east fork pigeon river basin efprb 131 km2 on the eastern ridges of the sam fig 1 the prb features topographically complex terrain characterized by gentle to very steep slopes and dominated by very dense forest mix forest and deciduous broadleaf forest figure s1 in the supplementary file the three headwater basins exhibit very different hydro geomorphic features the wfprb has relatively shallower soils and limited aquifer storage while the ccb and efprb have deep alluvial deposits with large subsurface flow tao and barros 2013 and 2014a besides the ccb is at the lowest elevation among the three basins and wfprb and efprb sit at the highest elevation nested among the eastern ridgelines of the sam notably the hydrometeorology of the ccb is characterized by a strong diurnal cycle with persistent low level clouds fog and light rainfall in the inner valleys in addition to persistent cloudiness above the ridges for all three basins at midday consistent with the time of satellite overpass e g duan and barros 2017 wilson and barros 2014 therefore the original modis standard products are expected to have the lowest quality over ccb among the three basins and the larger hydrologic impacts should also be expected in simulations of ccb hydrology 3 methodology 3 1 duke coupled surface groundwater hydrology model dchm and the input data 3 1 1 brief introduction to dchm the dchm duke coupled surface subsurface hydrology model has evolved over the years from a column svat soil vegetation atmosphere implementation devonec and barros 2002 with dynamic vegetation garcia quijano and barros 2005 to a fully distributed hydrologic model yildiz and barros 2005 2007 and 2009 including progressively more detailed representation of surface groundwater interactions and flood propagation at a very high tempo spatial resolution e g 250 m and 5 min in tao and barros 2013 and 2014a tao et al 2016 the components processes in the dchm that are relevant to the developed data sets are described in the appendix a more detailed description can be found in tao 2015 the equations processes directly or indirectly influenced by the landscape attributes prescribed in the dchm are synthesized in table 3 the emissivity and albedo not only directly affect net longwave net shortwave and thus net total radiation but also the surface latent and sensible heat fluxes as indicated by table 3 and equation ap1 in the appendix specifically equation ap3 describes how albedo controls the magnitude of reflected solar radiation and thus affects the total net solar shortwave radiation while emissivity affects the outgoing longwave radiation together both directly impact the total net radiation eq ap3 which in turn affects the surface energy budget soil temperature and sensible latent and ground heat fluxes eq ap1 the lai and fvc modulate rainfall interception evapotranspiration and thus soil moisture and streamflow response lai directly influences the calculation of canopy resistance jarvis formulation eq ap8 and thus significantly impacts the estimations of transpiration ap7 besides it is also used for determining the storage capacity of the canopy skin reservoir and thus affects canopy skin evaporation and the interception capacity and thus controls rainfall interception as per eq ap11 that is rainfall partitioning the fvc i e the fractional vegetation coverage represents the ratio of the vegetated area within a grid cell to the total area of the grid and it modulates evapotranspiration by weighting the magnitude of canopy skin evaporation vegetation transpiration and bare soil evaporation eq ap6 note that the energy balance equations eq ap1 and water balance equation eq ap9 are fully coupled in the dchm relying on a semi implicit numerical scheme e g crank nicholson scheme following devonec and barros 2002 thus the changes in water fluxes caused by the vegetation attributes also influence the energy partitioning and the impacts of radiative properties on energy fluxes feedback into the water fluxes nevertheless relative to the impacts on water fluxes caused by vegetation attributes the influence of radiative properties on water fluxes is comparatively small the dchm has been used in previous hydrological studies in headwater basins of prb see section 2 to investigate the predictability of flash floods and debris flow initiation for particular short term storm events tao and barros 2013 2014a tao et al 2016 here the focus is on sensitivity analysis of long term hydrological simulations and thus the time integrated impacts of landscape attributes data we conducted all dchm simulations at the iphex nominal resolution 1 km 1 km and hourly time step see details about model simulation configurations in section 3 3 3 1 2 input data required by dchm the dchm and distributed hydrological models generally require two types of input the generic static time invariant parameters and dynamic time variant inputs including meteorological forcing and landscape attributes all the input data have to be consistently prepared at a unified spatiotemporal resolution under the same projected coordinate system i e utm17 n at wgs84 datum in this study note the spatial resolution and temporal resolution has to be closely related to assure computational stability of numerical modeling for the iphex nominal spatial resolution at 1 km 1 km an hourly temporal resolution is adequate to ensure numerical stability 3 1 2 1 static time invariant parameters the most fundamental hydro geographical static dataset required by dchm the digital elevation model dem data were extracted from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data farr et al 2007 from which dchm calculates slopes and flow directions at model grid pixels soil hydraulic parameters including saturated hydraulic conductivity porosity field capacity and wilting point were extracted from the state soil geographic statsgo dataset miller and white 1998 also we extracted land cover data over the iphex domain from the modis terra and aqua combined land cover type yearly global product at 500 m 463 3 m resolution mcd12q1 v051 and generated yearly land cover for iphex at 1 km spatial resolution although mixed land cover types may be present it is assumed that the physical processes are dominated by the majority of the land cover type in each pixel 2 2 http iphex pratt duke edu datacenter time invariantdatasets landcover the resultant land cover data in 2009 for the pigeon river basin as well as over the se us in 2009 are shown in figure s1 in the supplementary file as an example with a googleearth image included for reference the landcover product is subsequently used in dchm to specify temporally invariant spatially distributed physical vegetation parameters including the minimum stomatal resistance roughness length and displacement height thus affecting the calculation of aerodynamic drag coefficients dickinson et al 1993 mahfouf et al 1995 as well as the vertical distribution of vegetation root zeng 2001 all these static data are publicly available from the iphex website 3 3 https iphex pratt duke edu datacenter time invariant 20datasets 3 1 2 2 dynamic time variant input meteorological forcing fields precipitation input to dchm as the most important meteorological forcing was generated from the national center for environmental prediction ncep stage iv data a mosaic precipitation analyses product derived from multi sensor next generation weather radar and rain gauges over the us baldwin and mitchell 1998 lin and mitchell 2005 we first downscaled the stage iv data from 4 km to 1 km using a transient multifractal downscaling method nogueira and barros 2015 and then used the ensemble mean of 50 hourly downscaled rainfall fields for the hydrological simulations presented here other atmospheric forcing fields e g air temperature air pressure specific humidity wind speed incoming shortwave and longwave radiation were downscaled from the 32 km 3 hourly north american regional reanalysis narr data to the iphex nominal resolution i e 1 km 1 km and hourly time step and were physically corrected for elevation topography and cloudiness effects as described in the companion paper tao and barros 2018 the developed atmospheric forcing fields are publicly and freely available at duke library 4 4 http dukespace lib duke edu dspace handle 10161 8958 doi 10 7924 g8rn35s6 3 1 2 3 dynamic time variant input landscape attributes the landscape attributes data specifically include lai fvc surface longwave broadband emissivity and shortwave broadband albedo as elaborated in the introduction current modis standard lai products have large severe errors caused by persistent cloud or cloud fog contamination also there are no standard longwave broadband emissivity and shortwave broadband albedo products here we develop continuous quality lai data by adjusting and then correcting cloud impacts within the modis lai product section 3 2 and then calculate fvc with the corrected lai data for emissivity we use a narrowband to broadband method section 3 2 to calculate the longwave broadband emissivity with the modis standard narrowband emissivity products first and then adjust the estimates further to correct potential errors regarding albedo we construct hourly shortwave broadband albedo with modis brdf broadband parameters see details in section 3 2 3 the new landscape attributes data with correction are publicly and freely available from duke library 5 5 http dukespace lib duke edu dspace handle 10161 8968 doi 10 7924 g8h41pbg 3 2 developing high quality vegetation parameters and surface radiative properties for distributed hydrologic modeling we developed continuous radiative properties i e emissivity and albedo and vegetation parameters i e lai and fvc over the se us at the iphex nominal resolution 1 km 1 km and hourly time step for seven years 2007 2013 fig 2 illustrates the workflow including the data model links i e how the landscape attributes data are used in the dchm as described in detail in section 3 1 1 and the appendix the detailed description of the methodology implemented to produce the high quality landscape attributes data are presented in the technical report by tao and barros 2014b here we describe the core methodology and algorithms only the focus is specifically on the correction of cloud fog contamination within modis land products listed in table 1 using temporal filtering method before any post processing the relevant standard modis products were first re projected to utm17 n wgs84 composited to the study area and then interpolated to the iphex domain grid system at 1 km 1 km resolution subsequently physically based checks e g seamless composition artifacts etc and temporal filtering were conducted to correct cloud and fog contamination toward reducing discontinuities and abnormal values in lai fvc and emissivity finally linear interpolation was applied to generate hourly products for the corrected vegetation data and emissivity as illustrated by fig 2a hourly albedo was constructed mainly relying on modis brdf parameters which differs from the methods applied for generating hourly emissivity lai and fvc 3 2 1 vegetation parameters lai and fvc the standard lai data were extracted from the combined terra and aqua modis 8 day lai product mcd15a2 collection 5 the mcd15a2 lai product was retrieved based on a look up table that represents the lai fpar reflectance relationship estimated by a three dimensional radiative transfer model myneni et al 2002 here we follow the method presented in yuan et al 2011 to improve modis lai to remove cloud impacts the core data processing algorithm is timesat a tool utilized for analyzing time series data has been widely applied for post processing satellite products eklundh et al 2009 heumann et al 2007 yuan et al 2011 the adaptive savitzky golay filter in timesat that fits the input time series data using a quadratic polynomial function was used to conduct the adaptive temporal filtering for modis products the method detects spikes outliers and assigns weights to the lai data relying on the seasonal trend decomposition using loess stl algorithm which first decomposes the time series into trends seasonality and remainder components and then assigns the weights accordingly important timesat parameters including the weights moving window size of polynomial fit and strength of the envelope adaptation etc were carefully investigated through sensitivity analysis in general high weights are assigned to good quality data e g clear sky conditions and low weights for the data with bad quality control flags e g cloudy conditions the moving window size 8 for the savitzky golay filter was determined iteratively to achieve the best fit to the upper envelope of the data and avoid negative bias other parameters were assigned according to the discussion and suggestions in the software manual by eklundh and jönssonb 2012 as indicated in fig 2a timesat was applied first to filter lai temporally and the gap free lai data were used to calculate fvc based on an empirical relationship choudhury 1987 choudhury et al 1994 french et al 2003a steven et al 1986 1 f v c 1 e x p k l a i where e x p k l a i represents the canopy transmittance and k is the attenuation coefficient or a leaf angle distribution term which is defined as 0 5 for the case of randomly oriented leaves choudhury et al 1994 french et al 2003b ross 1975 3 2 2 land surface longwave broadband emissivity the modis terra 8 day land surface temperature and emissivity product on a latitude longitude based 0 05 climate modeling grid system mod11c2 collection 5 consists of spectral emissivity for the various modis bands a linear relationship between the modis broadband emissivity and narrowband emissivity was established through regression analysis by jin and liang 2006 using the spectral emissivity at modis band 29 ε 29 8 400 8 700μm band 31 ε 31 10 780 11 280μm and band 32 ε 32 11 770 12 270μm as follows 2 ε b 0 0139 ε 29 0 4606 ε 31 0 5256 ε 32 this empirical relationship accounts for soil texture and mineral composition with the uncertainty of 0 005 jin and liang 2006 the broadband emissivity was calculated using equation 2 first followed by temporal filtering using timesat fig 2a as opposed to the stl decomposition method used for lai data sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the median filtering method was the most efficient approach to detect emissivity outliers resulting in very similar weights as the stl decomposition method thus the median filtering was selected for detecting spikes in the emissivity data while other parameters were derived using the same approach as for the lai data e g fitting method is savitzky golay seasonality parameter etc because emissivity data are governed by landcover soil moisture content and vegetation characteristics the upper envelope is not necessarily the true value the stl decomposition method is more favorable for fitting to the upper envelope of data such as in the case of lai 3 2 3 land surface shortwave broadband albedo currently there is no available standard albedo product at high temporal resolution i e hourly because it depends on the instantaneous solar zenith angle and illumination geometry at local scales liu et al 2009 schaaf et al 2002 here the modis brdf albedo model parameters product mcd43b1 that provides both spectral band and broadband brdf bidirectional reflectance distribution function model parameters every 8 days with 16 days acquisition interval was used to construct time varying albedo as a function of solar zenith angle and solar illumination geometry following schaaf et al 2002 given that the mcd43b1 was produced with 16 days acquisition intervals with fewer gaps compared to vegetation products we do not apply post processing to this product and use it to construct the surface albedo directly fig 2a the new hourly albedo product developed here is a function of the black sky albedo bsa or directional hemispherical albedo and white sky albedo wsa or bihemispherical albedo relying on the ross thick li sparse reciprocal rtlsr kernel driven brdf model the bsa α b s θ λ for any solar illumination geometry is derived by calculating the weighted sum of an isotropic parameter and kernels describing viewing and illumination geometry román et al 2009 schaaf et al 2002 as follows 3 α b s θ λ k f k λ g 0 k g 1 k θ 2 g 2 k θ 3 f i s o λ g 0 i s o g 1 i s o θ 2 g 2 i s o θ 3 f v o l λ g 0 v o l g 1 v o l θ 2 g 2 v o l θ 3 f g e o λ g 0 g e o g 1 g e o θ 2 g 2 g e o θ 3 where λ indicates a waveband e g either spectral band or band ranges and here specifically means the shortwave broadband 0 3 3 μm θ is the solar zenith angle g j k j 0 1 and 2 and k i s o v o l g e o are the coefficients provided in schaaf et al 2002 f i s o λ is the isotropic scattering component f v o l λ is the parameter for the ross thick volume scattering kernel and f g e o λ is the parameter for the li sparse reciprocal geometric scattering kernel these brdf model parameters including f i s o λ f v o l λ and f g e o λ are provided in the mcd43b1 8 day products note we only use the shortwave broadband 0 3 3 μm brdf parameters within mcd43b1 products to construct the hourly shortwave broadband albedo the wsa α w s λ can be directly calculated using these brdf parameters and the following empirical eq 4 4 α w s λ f i s o λ 0 189184 f v o l λ 1 377622 f g e o λ it is important to emphasize that the wsa α w s λ relies on the mcd43b1 brdf parameters and thus it is assumed constant over the 8 day period of the mcd43b1 product the bsa α b s θ λ in contrast is calculated at hourly time steps with the specific solar zenith angle at each pixel albeit using the same brdf parameters over the 8 day period finally the actual blue sky albedo α θ λ of the land surface is the weighted average of α b s θ λ and α w s λ where the weighting coefficient is the fraction of diffuse skylight s θ τ λ 5 α θ λ 1 s θ τ λ α b s θ λ s θ τ λ α w s λ the s θ τ λ was obtained from a lookup table 6 6 http www modis bu edu brdf userguide tools html relating solar zenith angle θ atmospheric optical depth τ λ and local aerosol types to diffuse skylight schaaf et al 2002 the aerosol optical depth a measurement of the extinction of solar radiation through the atmosphere due to absorbing or scattering by aerosol particles was obtained from the modis level 3 atmosphere daily product mod08 d3 the actual albedo α θ λ at hourly time scale was calculated by eq 5 with hourly s θ τ λ and hourly α b s θ λ assuming that α w s λ does not change over the 8 day period consistent with the mcd43b1 product 3 3 hydrologic simulations to investigate the hydrological impacts of the land attributes and demonstrate the value and utility of the corrected time varying landscape attributes datasets hydrological simulations at the iphex nominal resolution 1 km 1 km and hourly time step were conducted using dchm in three headwater sub basins of the pigeon river basin in the southern appalachian mountains see section 2 for four continuous water years from 2007 october to 2011 september encompassing an extreme drought 2007 2008 and a very wet hydrological year 2009 2010 brun and barros 2013 3 3 1 hydrologic simulation experiments design to examine the 2nd and 3rd hypotheses of the study we designed five modeling experiments as described in table 4 that includes the list of the subset of figures with results relevant for each experiment throughout the paper standard refers to modis standard products without any post processing i e correction adjustment specifically the standard lai was directly extracted from modis mcd15a2 product section 3 2 1 without any correction and the standard fvc was calculated using the standard lai in summary the terminology standard vegetation attributes refers to standard lai and fvc and the terminology adjusted vegetation attributes refers to corrected lai and the estimated fvc based on the corrected lai as described in section 3 2 1 regarding surface radiative properties since albedo and emissivity together impact the net total radiation in the energy balance equation ap1 that further affects hydrological processes along the heat exchange chain the two variables were examined in three categories conventional treatment standard treatment and constructed temporally and spatially varying data table 4 the conventional treatment of radiative properties follows the approach used in the noah model kumar et al 2011 by assigning static values for albedo and emissivity according to land cover type i e lc dependent as provided in table 5 there are no standard shortwave broadband albedo and longwave broadband emissivity products here we define the standard emissivity as the longwave broadband emissivity directly calculated from modis narrowband emissivity using the same method as described in section 3 2 2 thus it is also spatiotemporally varying but without corrections or adjustments therefore the standard radiative properties include the standard emissivity and lc dependent albedo finally the constructed radiative properties refer to the datasets developed in this work including the spatiotemporally varying emissivity with post processing adjustment section 3 2 2 and the constructed space time variant albedo reflecting realistic surface conditions atmospheric and environmental conditions and solar illumination geometry based on modis shortwave broadband brdf parameters section 3 2 3 as indicated in table 4 exp1 uses the most realistic landscape attributes data including the adjusted vegetation attributes i e lai and fvc and constructed temporally and spatially varying radiative properties e g emissivity and albedo produced in this study and thus is the reference or benchmark for all sensitivity experiments exp2 uses the standard vegetation attributes and the standard treatment for radiative properties representing the current standard configuration in hydrologic modeling practice with regard to the specification of land surface radiative properties the differences in simulated streamflow between exp1 and exp2 illustrate the integral impact of using more realistic vegetation attributes and radiative properties compared to using standard data or in other words the impact of the cloudiness correction applied to vegetation attributes and emissivity in addition to using the newly constructed spatiotemporally varying albedo as described in section 3 1 1 radiative properties mainly affect the simulations of energy fluxes and long term energy budget and vegetation characteristics primarily influence the simulations of water fluxes and long term water budget thus we also discuss the hydrological impacts of vegetation attributes and radiative properties separately to examine the impacts of vegetation attributes alone on the simulations of water fluxes exp3 is designed to use the newly constructed radiative properties as in exp1 and the standard vegetation attributes without correction comparing simulated water fluxes between exp1 and exp3 both at long and short time scales illuminates the propagation of errors from standard modis vegetation products in the hydrologic model and the translation of input errors into simulation bias to examine the impacts of radiative properties alone on the simulations of energy fluxes exp4 uses the adjusted vegetation attributes as in exp1 while prescribing the radiative properties with conventional treatment i e lc dependent albedo and emissivity we expect large diurnal and seasonal differences in the simulated energy fluxes between exp1 and exp4 given the contrasting differences between constructed radiative properties and the lc dependent values finally exp5 differs from exp4 only in the usage of standard emissivity comparing the differences between exp1 and exp4 with the differences between exp 1 and exp5 provides an alternative path for characterizing the value of using spatiotemporally varying emissivity directly estimated from modis standard products relative to the conventional lc dependent emissivity 3 3 2 analysis strategy 3 3 2 1 long term impacts errors and uncertainty in the initial soil water and groundwater storage severely impact streamflow predictability at the event scale by affecting the space time structure of rainfall runoff response across the watershed as well as long term water budgets in the case of continuous simulations thus spin up simulations similar to tao and barros 2018 and tao et al 2016 were conducted to redress uncertainty in initial conditions in all experiments in table 4 spin up simulations are repeated simulation cycles using the same forcing for a period of time with initial soil moisture and water table conditions equal to their values at the end of the preceding iteration until the differences between initial and end states are below a tolerance level note that unless the atmospheric forcing is precisely known the model structure is correct and model parameters are accurate it is not possible to completely eliminate uncertainty in the model initial conditions the purpose of model initialization by spin up is to achieve internal consistency among the unsaturated and saturated water stores in the model in synergy with the prevailing hydrometeorological regimes and regional conditions as described by the available atmospheric forcing topography and land cover attributes specifically the four year simulations were repeated 10 times for a total of 40 simulation years using the final states from the previous simulation as initial conditions for the next simulation with the same forcing until selected metrics see section 3 3 2 do not change within 1 tolerance note that the optimal number of spin up cycles depends on the basin and the efficiency metrics used for the sake of consistency we looped all the simulations 10 times the overall integrated effects emerging from using different landscape attributes are illustrated by the differences in streamflow estimates for the last 10th repetition between two experiments with different vegetation characteristics and radiative properties i e exp1 and exp2 in table 4 the long term simulation results are analyzed first in section 4 2 1 focusing on the overall impacts of landscape attributes data vegetation characteristics and radiative properties together on streamflow predictions over the four year continuous simulations by comparing exp1 with exp2 besides the long term impact of vegetation attributes on the regional water budget is also analyzed in section 4 2 2 by comparing four water year integrated water budget components between exp1 and exp3 3 3 2 2 short term impacts to facilitate linking cloud corrections of landscape attributes to changes in hydrological states and fluxes we first identify a representative short term period e g a month showing large contrast between standard modis data and the adjusted data we developed i e effective correction to the cloud contamination through detailed comparison in section 4 1 then the differences in simulated water and energy fluxes from different experiments are analyzed within the selected one month period consistent with the analysis in section 4 1 to evaluate day to day short term impacts of the landscape attributes data specifically the comparison combinations as mentioned in section 3 3 1 including exp1 vs exp3 exp1 vs exp4 and exp1 vs exp5 are all analyzed over this month as discussed in section 4 2 2 and 4 2 3 3 3 3 evaluation metrics we use three dimensionless efficiency indices to evaluate hydrologic modelling performance of the simulated hydrograph including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and the modified kge kge mod kling et al 2012 the nse equation 6 measures how large the residual variance in the simulations relative to the observational variance and ranges from negative infinity to unity with nse 1 indicating optimal performance the model simulation generally is considered satisfactory if nse 0 50 moriasi et al 2007 6 n s e 1 1 n t 1 n q s t q o t 2 σ o 2 where t means time step i e hourly in this study n is the total number of time steps q t is streamflow at time step t with as s representing simulations o representing observations and σ o is the standard deviation of observations the kge and kge mod are expressed in eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 k g e 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 α 1 2 8 k g e m o d 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r is the correlation coefficient β is the bias ratio β μ s μ o where μ is the mean α is the variability ratio α σ s σ o where σ is the standard deviation in k g e m o d the variability ratio α was modified by kling et al 2012 by replacing σ with the coefficient of variation c v and thus the modified variability ratio is calculated as γ c v s c v o this simple modification ensures that the bias and variability ratios are not cross correlated that otherwise might occur when the input precipitation is biased kling et al 2012 the three components i e correlation coefficient bias ratio and variability ratio define a three dimensional 3d space both kge and kge mod measure the difference between unity and the euclidian distance in the 3d space from the ideal point i e r 1 β 1 and α 1 or γ 1 thus unity is also the optimum value for kge and kge mod the three efficiency metrics described above are used to evaluate the simulated streamflow time series over the four water years of simulation at an hourly time step for short term analysis of streamflow response we mainly rely on nse besides the efficiency metrics mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean bias error mbe are also used in the analysis 4 results 4 1 developed lai fvc emissivity and albedo systematic analysis regarding the spatial pattern of the developed datasets including mean median standard deviation and probability density function pdf for each landcover type can be found in the associated technical report tao and barros 2014b in this section we focus on demonstrating the removal of cloud impacts within the original modis vegetation and emissivity product and how this affects the seasonal and sub seasonal variations of lai fvc and emissivity and the accuracy and rationale of the constructed albedo product 4 1 1 lai and fvc time series of lai and fvc before and after temporal filtering at the three tower locations are shown in fig 3 the land cover classes for these towers are listed in table 2 although no field measurements of lai and fvc are available for evaluation proper at these tower locations we show the comparison of time series to illustrate how the adaptive filtering method can significantly reduce the discontinuity and errors in lai and thus cv improving the overall data quality it can be seen from fig 3 that the adjusted lai series preserves the inter and intra annual variability of the original modis product and captures well the timing of the growing season which in turn adds confidence to the fvc estimates the lai and fvc at the dkepl tower exhibit the largest change compared to other towers largest rmse between lai before and after filtering i e 1 40 at dkepl versus 1 11 and 0 82 for uschr and usdk1 respectively because the adaptive filter corrected the significant contamination of the diurnal cycle of fog and low level clouds in the smoky mountains e g duan and barros 2017 wilson and barros 2014 and at the dkepl location in particular for the two other towers the most frequent contamination dramatically reduced values occurred during the summer time from june to october especially in 2009 a very wet hydrological year with frequent storm events during the atlantic hurricane season brun and barros 2013 for example there are virtually no cloud free modis data within an 8 day period around sep 16 in 2009 in the iphex domain a period of persistent rainfall in the se us that resulted in severe cloud contamination of the lai product as illustrated in the top and middle row panels in fig 4 the spatial distributions of the adjusted lai and fvc 10 days before and after sep 16 exhibit reasonable values and distribution patterns after correction in contrast with the very low values i e lai around two shown in red color in the standard lai and fvc products two archived photographs fig 4c available in sep and oct from a webcam 7 7 http www2 nature nps gov air webcams parks grsmpkcam grsmpk arc cfm 8 https lpdaac usgs gov products modis products table installed at purchase knob in the pigeon river basin show the forest status with very large lai and fvc at the time the contamination is successfully removed by the timesat adaptive filter as demonstrated by the central panel in fig 4 these results illustrate the importance of targeted quality control of standard products to reduce the discontinuity and abnormal values in lai and thus fvc panels a and b in fig 5 illustrate the space time heterogeneity of lai and fvc over the region including large seasonal and intra seasonal variations the northeast to southwest patterns of alternating high and low values are attributed to the various vegetation zones see land cover map figure s1 in the supplementary file the mixed zones of woody savanna and croplands close to the coast show low lai all year round top panel fig 5a in contrast to the adjacent mixed forest with persistently higher lai seasonality is shown more clearly in fig 5b compared to the forests in the sam the northeast to southwest mixed forest zones in between the woody savanna zones and close to the coast exhibit large fvc all year round note the large inter annual variability depicted in the bottom panels in fig 5a b with large differences between lai and fvc on the same day in 2007 a dry year and 2009 a wet year the frequent severe storms in august september of 2009 produced massive rainfall amounts over the se us especially over the sam causing significant vegetation disturbance brun and barros 2013 which explains the lower lai and fvc values on october 1 in 2009 than in 2007 4 1 2 land surface longwave broadband emissivity fig 6 shows the land surface longwave broadband emissivity before and after temporal filtering at the selected tower locations in contrast to lai and fvc for which most contamination is negatively biased the land surface emissivity exhibits large up and down fluctuations that are successfully eliminated by filtering generally vegetated areas have larger emissivity than non vegetated or sparsely vegetated areas fig 5c except for waterbodies land margins and wetlands for different types of vegetation many factors including vegetation species canopy structure and density phenology growth stage etc affect the emissivity snyder et al 1998 the top panel in fig 5c highlights contrasts among the coastal plain the piedmont and the appalachian mountains with large spatial heterogeneity explained by land cover emissivity in urban areas e g atlanta the largest cluster of red pixels in the iphex domain remains low although it varies temporally in response to surface wetness conditions i e precipitation overall for the southeast us the top panel in fig 5c displays high emissivity in february over the southeast sector from the mountains to the piedmont and then decreases through august and october increasing thereafter in december a behavior that is not correlated with regional phenology this can be explained in large part by leaf dryness i e vegetation water stress during the dry season olioso et al 2007 high emissivity values in the southern appalachian mountains especially along the blue ridge escarpment are associated with the seasonal leaf color change reflecting changes in the chemical composition of the leaves other factors influencing emissivity include real time vegetation growth stage weather conditions fog interception rain or snow accumulation on the ground and leaves and hydrological conditions i e soil moisture conditions snyder et al 1998 the inter annual variability in emissivity the difference of emissivity on the same day of 2007 and 2009 illustrated in the bottom row of fig 5c includes both the effects of vegetation growth stage and antecedent soil moisture conditions 4 1 3 land surface shortwave broadband albedo fig 7 a compares the produced land surface shortwave broadband albedo at the local solar noon lsn every day against the available observations at ameriflux tower us chr see fig 1 for location the modis brdf parameters were derived for snow free and cloud free conditions and thus the produced albedo are also snow free and cloud free to alleviate the presence of clouds the mean of the observed albedo within a 3 hour window centered at the lsn was calculated and then compared with the newly constructed albedo estimates as suggested by román et al 2009 nevertheless it is not possible to completely filter out cloud conditions at short times scales even using the 3 hr mean values which may explain the underestimation of the albedo in may the snow conditions were identified by air temperature less than zero degrees celsius observed at the tower void symbols in fig 7a in general the estimated albedo shows a good agreement with observations with a small root mean square error rmse 0 017 a small mean absolute error mae 0 013 and a small mean bias error mbe 0 007 fig 7b shows the comparison of the monthly mean diurnal cycle of the newly constructed hourly albedo with the us chr observations there is generally a good agreement with the tower observations except for the late afternoon with underestimation mainly during the winter time october to january further the albedo estimates display a diurnal cycle consistent with the assumption of symmetry at lsn as indicated in the theoretical retrieval algorithm for modis brdf albedo model liu et al 2009 schaaf et al 2002 whereas the observed albedo exhibits asymmetry the diurnal asymmetry of observed albedo may be attributed to dew and frost formation precipitation evaporation and wind effects causing surfaces to look brighter early in the day minnis et al 1997 previous studies on the diurnal asymmetry of albedo in grassland or cropland land categories reported that albedo in the early morning is usually larger than in the afternoon minnis et al 1997 song 1998 as strong directional winds deform the vegetation canopy and turn the back of leaves upward thus creating a brightening effect at us chr where the deciduous broadleaf forest is the dominant vegetation type table 2 the observed albedo has larger values in the late afternoon than in the early morning as shown in fig 7b this can be explained at least in part by the diurnal cycle in mountain valley circulations as this tower is located on the foothills of the western slopes of the appalachians in the ridge valley region also albedo also has strong seasonal variability increasing during the growing and blooming seasons and then decreasing during the dormant season the spatial distributions of bsa wsa and the actual broadband albedo at lsn on september 2009 are presented in fig 7c note the correspondence of spatial albedo patterns to those of land cover shown in figure s1 the same albedos bsa wsa and actual albedo on june 1 and december 1 of 2009 are provided in figure s2 in the supplementary file in support of the discussion here wetlands along the margins of river networks exhibit very low albedo compared to other land cover types especially near the coast large spatial variability follows the complex terrain in the southern appalachian mountains with contrasting values along ridges and valleys bsa heavily depends on solar zenith angle thus the difference between albedo at lsn in different months june september and december is small due to the small differences in the solar zenith angle wsa depends on the observed intrinsic properties of the land surface as indicated by equation 4 and consequently wsa exhibits large seasonal variations compare middle panel in fig 7c and figure s2 inspection of the temporal evolution of the broadband albedo reveals that large seasonal albedo variations are linked directly to changes in wsa generally the albedo in winter december is larger than in the summer june due to the large contrast of black dull color in december grey branches dark soils etc versus the bright and green colors in june as shown in figure s2 in the supplementary file 4 2 hydrologic model simulations 4 2 1 impacts of developed datasets on long term streamflow simulation the nse kge and kgemod streamflow metrics calculated at hourly time step over the four water years from 2007 october to 2011 september for each spin up cycle in the three sub basins wfprb efprb and ccb are displayed in fig 8 a for exp1 and exp2 it can be seen from fig 8a that all skill scores from both experiments increase with repeated spin up for the three basins illustrating the impact of improved initial conditions on hydrologic simulation fidelity the skill scores do reach a plateau above which further improvements are negligible after sufficient spin up cycles indicating that the model reached internal equilibrium and the maximum achievable predictive skill alternatively viewed as a predictability barrier that is different for each basin this predictability barrier for each evaluation metric i e skill scores for the last spin up is determined by the accuracy of input data i e atmospheric forcing and landscape attributes model parameters and the specific basin geomorphology characteristics that affect the propagation of forcing errors through current model configuration the predictive skill barrier could be improved through calibration note dchm is uncalibrated and by improving precipitation forcing as we conducted in previous studies tao and barros 2014a 2013 tao et al 2016 this is out of the scope of this study rather here we analyze the differences in the evaluation metrics for the final 10th spin up simulation between exp1 and exp2 to illustrate the impacts of using different landscape attributes on streamflow simulations with known rainfall errors as discussed by nogueira and barros 2014 2015 and fixed hydrologic parameters the three efficiency indices nse kge and kgemod see details in section 3 3 2 along with the correlation coefficient r the bias ratio β the variability ratio α and the modified variability ratio γ for the last spin up are provided in table 6 for the three basins the skill score differences between exp1 and exp2 for wfprb are either quite small e g nse and correlation coefficient meaning equivalent performance or indicate worsen performance for exp1 than exp2 for efprb exp1 shows slightly better nse 0 58 vs 0 54 equivalent kge 0 69 vs 0 70 but worse kge mod 0 46 vs 0 55 than exp2 due to the lower modified variability ratio γ i e away from unity this reflects the increased topographic and geomorphic complexity of this basin as well as the fact that rainfall errors are expected to be larger due to lack of raingauge observations in the basin and ground clutter effects on the radar rainfall product the bias ratio β and variability ratio both α and γ for ccb are closest to unity especially for exp1 resulting in the shortest euclidian distance between the point r β α or r β γ and the ideal point 1 1 1 among the three basins and thus best kge and kge mod efficiencies 0 75 for both are attained yet the hourly nse for ccb is comparatively low mainly due to poor performance for low flows i e 3 m3 s as shown in figure s3 in the supplementary file this is attributed to stage iv rainfall uncertainty in this inner mountain basin below the scanning levels of regional operational radars that is low level rainfall is missed whereas larger rainfall events appear to be overcorrected in the ccb tao and barros 2013 tao et al 2016 nevertheless in contrast to wfprb all the efficiency indices for exp1 are better than exp2 for the ccb i e nse kge and kge mod increases by 10 3 and 4 respectively with significantly improved performance using the newly developed landscape attributes data as discussed in section 2 ccb is located in the inner sam region of the great smoky mountains and thus low level clouds heavy fog and light rainfall are persistent which results in severe cloud contamination to modis product consequently the larger improvement in simulated streamflow for ccb compared to the other two basins are attributed to the effectiveness of the cloudiness correction of landscape attributes over this basin fig 8b displays the streamflow time series from the last spin up iteration and the scatter plot of simulations against observations for the three basins the left panel of fig 8b shows that exp2 green overestimates streamflow for many large events using the standard modis vegetation products and the standard treatment for radiative properties while exp1 red shows comparatively better performance the middle panels of fig 8b exhibit overall good agreement between simulated and observed streamflow for the two experiments with better performance using the corrected adjusted vegetation and constructed radiative data sets for the larger flow events winter djf streamflow is overestimated in all basins likely reflecting the overestimation of radar rainfall due to bright band artifacts i e due to the presence of snow and ice lower in the atmosphere because of very different geomorphology and hydrometeorology the seasonal behavior is different among the three basins as highlighted in the scatter plot in fig 8b the wfprb simulations exhibit relatively worse performance for winter storms djf in contrast with very good agreement for summer flows jja associated with heavy convective storm systems on the eastern slopes of the sam this is because summertime convective storms can be captured by the nearby national weather service operational radar in greenville south carolina and thus are well represented in stage iv precipitation data by contrast most large flow events in the ccb occurred in the winter associated with westerly frontal storms further the rainfall runoff response is directly tied to basin geomorphologic characteristics and complex topography wfprb is located on the highest mountain ridges in the eastern slopes of the appalachians and the rainfall runoff response is very fast due to steep slopes and shallow soils tao and barros 2013 for heavy rainfall events such as tropical storm fay the large peak in aug in 2008 differences in streamflow estimates are as large as 16 m3 s 10 of peak discharge between exp1 and exp2 in the wfprb with improved performance for exp1 in all basins resulting in peak discharge improvements up to 20 in the efprb and ccb similar behavior is seen for the ccb throughout the year though peak flows are lower since deep valley soils and active surface groundwater interactions provide more storage for individual events tao and barros 2014a in the cold season fog and persistence of low level cloudiness in the inner region valleys wilson and barros 2014 2017 duan and barros 2017 maintain the upper soil layers wet which favors runoff response even if the rainfall intensities are lower e g winter of 2009 in the efprb and ccb but these are not adequately observed by the operational network used to produce the merged radar raingauge stage iv precipitation product in summary we demonstrated a significant improvement in simulated streamflow over four water years by using the newly developed landscape attributes data i e adjusted corrected vegetation products and constructed radiative properties compared to the results using standard modis vegetation products and standard treatment to radiative properties over the ccb e g the nse calculated at an hourly time step was improved by 10 a basin that have most severe cloud contamination to modis standard products among the three basins the performance of exp1 for efprb is comparable to exp2 for efprb and is even worse for wfprb which is not unexpected under the context of current predictability barrier for each tested basin i e know rainfall errors the results substantiate the fidelity and utility of the developed landscape attributes data in simulating streamflow with distributed hydrologic models in mountainous regions 4 2 2 impacts of lai and fvc on water flux simulations the integrated impacts of landscape attributes data on streamflow estimation demonstrated in the previous section lump together the changes caused by using both adjusted vegetation characteristics and constructed radiative properties in this section we compare the results from exp3 with exp1 to illustrate the impacts of adjusted vegetation attributes lai and fvc on the simulated water fluxes at both short term and long term scales as indicated in table 4 all other parameters inputs for the dchm are the same between the two experiments thus any discrepancies between the two simulations are solely attributed to the difference in lai and fvc between standard exp3 and adjusted exp1 data sets to follow up the discussion initiated in section 4 1 1 about the correction to the persistent cloud and precipitation contamination in modis vegetation product in september of 2009 here we first focus on the simulated water fluxes for the same month then we analyze the cumulative difference in simulated water budget components between the two experiments over the whole simulating period i e four water years to illustrate the integrated impact of corrected vegetation attributes data on regional water budget the long term impact fig 9 shows the difference between the basin averaged vegetation parameters and water fluxes simulated by the dchm including rainfall interception transpiration evaporation and discharge simulated for the ccb wfprb and efprb in september of 2009 as described in the appendix dchm evaporation comprises the components from the bare soil area 1 fvc and also from the skin reservoir including canopy retention since cloud contamination generally reduces the magnitude of lai and fvc in the standard products the lai and fvc average adjustment mainly consisted of removing the downward peaks in the first half of september as pointed out earlier in fig 3 and also shown in the top two rows of fig 9 the corrections of lai and fvc translate into increases in intercepted rainfall amount and transpiration in all three basins up to sep 25 at which time lai and fvc before and after post processing are very similar the underestimated lai and fvc in the standard modis products results in lower canopy interception capacity in the model which is quite critical for both light rainfall and moderate to heavy rainstorm events for instance long duration light rainfall accumulations can rapidly exceed the underestimated interception capacity with the standard modis products leading to larger rainfall depths reaching the ground surface leading to overestimation of surface runoff response and eventually streamflow light rainfall retained in the canopy can be used by plants via foliar uptake especially under dry conditions and or evaporated later when a realistic canopy interception capacity is used that is when vegetation is prescribed with the adjusted lai and fvc for moderate or heavy rainfall scenarios more rainfall is retained in the canopy contributing to evaporation at a later time using the corrected lai and fvc exp1 as illustrated by the large evaporation during heavy rainfall periods shown in the 5th row of fig 9 and less rainfall infiltrates into the ground reducing soil moisture which in turn affects transpiration and discharge the magnitude of the corrected fvc is substantially larger than the standard product implying therefore a similarly large change decrease in the bare soil areal fraction 1 fvc changes in fvc lead to evaporation decreases and transpiration increases as illustrated by the large transpiration for exp1 using adjusted vegetation attributes shown in the 4th row of fig 9 and lower soil moisture in the active root layers specifically also considering the coupled land atmosphere system the differences in latent heat fluxes due to changes in evaporation and transpiration in september are significant to impact atmospheric boundary layer entropy and ultimately enhance convective activity and rainfall in mountainous regions e g sun and barros 2014 the integrated impact of using corrected vegetation parameters for the same month is examined by comparing simulated streamflow and observations in the bottom row of fig 9 both streamflow simulations using the standard and adjusted vegetation attributes agree well with observed discharge with regard to peak times although the peak values are overestimated and more so for exp3 than exp1 as expected based on the above analysis compared to exp3 the skill of streamflow predictions in exp1 is substantially better by using the adjusted vegetation attributes with nses at hourly time step for the month of september of 2009 increasing from 0 21 to 0 48 i e more than two fold increase for the ccb basin in the inner mountain region largely due to improvements in the simulation of low flows in the efprb nse changes are small improved from 0 64 to 0 71 and they are negligible for the wfprb i e 0 92 and 0 90 for exp3 and exp1 respectively demonstrating comparable or equivalent performance this negligible difference in nse about 2 for wfprb might be attributed to interactions among different sources of error mediated by the model physics errors in precipitation forcing compensate for using uncorrected vegetation data in exp3 thus resulting in higher skill at the basin outlet the large nse gains for the ccb are attributed to the nonlinear relationship between hydrometeorological regime persistent low level clouds and fog and light rainfall geomorphology extensive alluvial deposits and deep valley soils and water use by vegetation mixed forest with deciduous broad leaf trees the cloudiness corrections of lai and fvc result in better estimates of interception and evapotranspiration and consequently soil moisture more accurate soil moisture conditions result in more accurate runoff response to rainfall and consequently improved streamflow estimation this is also the case for the efprb which also features a wide alluvial valley though the overall performance is dominated by rainfall errors in this case as shown by the large discharge error on september 20th due overestimation of rainfall for late summer convective activity fig 10 a b shows the simulated spatial distributions of intercepted rainfall evaporation and transpiration in the prb using lai and fvc before exp3 and after the adjustment exp1 accumulated over the entire four water years to assess the impact on the regional water budget whereas the magnitude of the cumulative differences is small evapotranspiration et using the adjusted vegetation attributes is always larger than the et using the standard data and the difference is much larger in summer than in winter the increase in et results from large differences in transpiration in the forested areas of the ccb figure s1 in the supplementary file the cumulative evaporation in exp1 is less than that in exp3 using standard data as shown in the 2nd column of fig 10a b indicating that the decrease in evaporation due to reduced bare soil area exceeds the increase in canopy retention over the four water years period higher fvc leads to an overall increase in transpiration as shown by the 3rd column in fig 10a b fig 10c shows the time series of cumulative transpiration evaporation et and runoff averaged over the prb for exp1 and exp3 given the same rainfall input again note the nonlinear trade offs between exp1 and exp3 over the 2007 2011 period among transpiration dark blue 25 overall increase et 6 increase and runoff exiting the prb as streamflow 10 decrease nevertheless the changes in intercepted rainfall evaporation and transpiration also depend on vegetation type for instance transpiration is always very small in urban areas and in mixed use areas of cropland and woody savannahs in the northern section of the basin as indicated in figure s1 in the supplementary file large changes normally occur in mixed and deciduous forests in the inner mountain region where fog forms on a daily basis and thus the standard modis vegetation attributes are more likely to suffer from cloud fog contamination explaining the spatial patterns on the right panels in fig 10a b in summary the accuracy of vegetation attributes lai and fvc directly affects flood response i e high flow scenarios water partitioning at the basin scale and the overall water budget in a nonlinearly complex manner with corrected vegetation attributes the nse of simulated streamflow for ccb is improved by two fold although the improvement for efprb is small and the performance in weprb is comparable or equivalent in addition using corrected and thus realistic lai and fvc leads to increased et by 6 and decreased streamflow by 10 for the whole prb over four water years which imposes complex constraints in water availability from the point of view of regional resilience to drought the simulations presented here provide a first estimate of the error budget that can be attributed to vegetation characteristics in an uncalibrated model these errors and uncertainties can be masked by model calibration which has implications for the fidelity of the hydrological physics simulated by the model potentially leading to misinterpretation of cause effect mechanisms as illustrated for the wfprb previously yildiz and barros 2007 demonstrated that lai and fvc are as important as hydraulic conductivity to capture rainfall runoff response in long term hydrologic simulations using a distributed model with time varying vegetation in the central appalachians the present study explains the chain of interacting processes rainfall interception evapotranspiration soil moisture runoff that leads to improving streamflow prediction from improved vegetation parameters which effectively function as scaling metrics of evapotranspiration 4 2 3 impacts of albedo and emissivity on energy flux simulations in this section the simulations from exp4 conventional treatment and exp5 standard treatment are compared with exp1 constructed realistic data to illustrate the impacts of surface radiative properties i e shortwave broadband albedo and longwave broadband emissivity on simulations of energy fluxes the resultant time series of basin averaged values over the three headwater basins are presented in fig 11 with a focus on the comparison between exp1 and exp4 constructed vs conventional treatment and figure s4 in the supplementary file emphasizing the difference between constructed vs standard treatment of radiative properties see section 3 3 1 the amplitude range of the differences is better captured by the spatial maps in fig 12 a and b over the whole pigeon river basin the constructed hourly albedo values in the early morning or late afternoon are much larger than at lsn and exhibit large diurnal variability with a convex opening up u shape shown in the top row of fig 11 see also fig 7b which is opposite of the diurnal shape for the incoming solar radiation an opening down u shape consequently the net shortwave radiation shows larger diurnal amplitudes when using the constructed hourly albedo exp1 than using the lc dependent static albedo exp4 3rd row in fig 11 during september of 2009 the maximum difference in basin averaged net shortwave radiation is up to 50 w m2 for the three headwater basins the static lc dependent emissivity is lower 0 93 for deciduous broadleaf forest and 0 95 for the mixed forest compared to the adjusted emissivity product around 0 984 0 985 2nd row in fig 11 the lower emissivity in exp4 results in lower outgoing longwave radiation and thus larger net longwave radiation fluxes compared to exp1 this explains the negative difference 13 w m2 to 15 w m2 4th row in fig 11 between the net longwave radiation using adjusted time varying emissivity in exp1 and the fixed static lc dependent emissivity in exp4 overall the negative difference in net longwave radiation explains the negative baseline 13 w m2 to 15 w m2 in the net total radiation difference the 5th row in fig 11 between exp1 and exp4 while the variation in net total radiation difference is still dominated by the large diurnal difference in net shortwave radiation associated with the effects of albedo as a result the basin averaged top soil temperature estimates from exp1 and exp4 are within 0 2 c to 0 1 c in the three headwater basins with diurnal differences following the variations in total net radiation besides examining the impacts of lc dependent emissivity the standard emissivity data directly calculated from modis narrowband emissivity without correction or adjustment was utilized in exp5 for comparison against results using the adjusted emissivity in exp1 as shown in the top row in figure s4 the standard emissivity varies widely due to the cloud contamination of modis observations while the adjusted emissivity is slowly varying with time the differences between the adjusted and standard modis emissivity are much smaller than those between time varying and static lc dependent emissivity thus the differences in net longwave radiation between the two simulations are very small in contrast to their counterparts in fig 11 demonstrating that despite uncertainty the standard time varying modis emissivity leads already to more realistic net radiation simulations than using the static lc dependent emissivity that is conventionally used in hydrologic modeling the complex spatial patterns of differences in net total radiation δnetr between exp1 and exp4 fig 12a and between exp1 and exp5 fig 12b are transferred to sensible heat flux δsh with spatial variability matching the land cover patterns in the prb basin figure s1 in the supplementary file as pointed out earlier lower values of lc dependent emissivity result in larger net longwave radiation in exp4 contributing to larger net total radiation than in exp1 over the three headwater basins thus causing negative differences depicted by the blue tones in δnetr in fig 12a as also shown in some other areas over the prb the positive δnetr brown tones between exp1 and exp4 result from the increase of net shortwave radiation due to the lower albedo in exp1 as compared to the lc dependent albedo used in exp4 e g over ccb since differences between the adjusted exp1 and standard exp5 emissivity are very small and thus the changes in albedo are dominant the δnetr differences between exp1 and exp5 are positive nearly everywhere across the prb basin fig 12b the differences in net radiation are on the order of 5 10 and translate into 10 20 differences in sensible heat flux mirroring the changes in top soil temperature δt0 the dynamic range of the differences between exp1 and exp4 or exp5 in top soil temperature over the whole prb is 1 c 0 5 to 0 5 as indicated by fig 12a b left most panels note that the top soil temperature in the dchm is not the skin temperature proper e g devonec and barros 2002 see also appendix and thus the differences are smaller than what should be expected for the land surface skin temperature even if the difference in the soil temperature estimates in the top layer 5 10 cm depth generally remains 0 5 c at the pixel scale its impacts on regional energy budget and other processes e g photosynthesis are significant especially for long term hydro climatologic studies there is a strong seasonal signature in the time series of prb basin averaged energy fluxes shown in fig 12c for the entire 4 year simulation period because of the seasonal variability of albedo fig 7a and b with larger values from may to september consequently in the spring or winter seasons especially at noon when albedo is low as shown in fig 7 and also top panel in fig 11 and the net solar radiation is large the differences in net solar radiation between exp1 new hourly albedo and exp4 lc dependent albedo are large enough to exceed the negative differences in net longwave radiation due to using lc dependent emissivity as discussed above leading to positive δnetr in fig 12c resulting in a sign switch positive to negative from late spring to early fall see fig 11 for september however when the standard temporally varying modis emissivity was used in exp5 the δnetr sign switch is not observed fig 12d further shows that the positive δnetr pink lines is balanced by increases in sensible heat fluxes thus negative δsh up to 50 w m2 and higher over the four year simulation period in addition the absolute magnitude of δnetr and δsh between exp1 and exp5 is larger than that between exp1 and exp4 because the negative net longwave radiation is much smaller in exp5 when using the standard modis emissivity note exp4 and exp5 have the same vegetation attributes as exp1 and thus differences in latent heat fluxes are very low green lines in fig 12c and 12d compared to other energy balance terms in summary the diurnal variation of the constructed hourly albedo leads to large diurnal amplitudes of differences in the simulated net shortwave radiation and then net total radiation further the seasonal variability of the constructed albedo results in robust seasonality in the differences of simulated energy fluxes e g net total radiation and sensible heat flux over the 4 years simulated the impact of radiative properties on total net radiation includes both the influences on net shortwave radiation and net longwave radiation whereas the absolute magnitude of the sensitivity of total net radiation to albedo is larger than to emissivity e g 50 w m2 vs 15 w m2 in the three headwater basins the changes however significantly vary case by case at pixel scale depending on the differences between the prescribed static and constructed realistic i e temporally and spatially dynamic radiative properties these experiments illustrate the nonlinearity of the interactions among the various terms in the surface energy budget equation both in space and in time and the importance of using time varying radiative properties to capture seasonality 5 conclusions we present an end to end and easy to follow framework to produce continuous quality controlled and gap free landscape attributes datasets including lai fvc surface longwave broadband emissivity and shortwave broadband albedo for hydrologic modeling at a consistent spatiotemporal resolution 1 km 1 km hourly from the modis land products over the iphex domain barros et al 2014 in the se us from 2007 to 2013 the lai and fvc with adjustment i e quality control and adaptive temporal filtering to correct cloud or fog contamination effects exhibit improved space time variability especially for mountainous regions where low level cloud and fog are persistent both the broadband emissivity and albedo show realistic seasonal variability and dependence on land cover the newly constructed hourly broadband albedo exhibits large diurnal variability and shows an overall good agreement with tower observations except in the late afternoon with small underestimation during the winter time further analysis of hydrologic simulations using the uncalibrated dchm demonstrates that quality vegetation attributes lai and fvc result in overall better streamflow simulations at both short and long time scales and that the improvements vary in time and space capturing vegetation controls at different times of the year for different hydrometeorological regimes and physiographic settings specifically the nse of simulated streamflow for a valley basin i e ccb in the inner region of the southern appalachian mountains where persistent cloud and fog contamination strongly affect standard remotely sensed vegetation data is improved by two fold over a short term one month scale and increased by 10 over a long term four water years scale by using the adjusted data in addition we also found that et increases whereas streamflow decreases due to decreases in soil moisture in the simulations with the improved vegetation attributes although the magnitude of the basin integrated decrease in runoff about 139 mm per unit area is relatively small considering the large drainage area of 1778 km2 of the prb the results imply a large change in the water budget corresponding to about 247 142 m3 in four water years this change is a significant volume of freshwater supply from a water resources management perspective it represents roughly 21 days of freshwater demand for the population living in the basin enough to address water needs during the most severe phase of the 2007 drought besides surface radiative properties i e albedo and emissivity have strong impacts on the energy flux simulations the absolute effects on net total radiation combine the influence on net shortwave radiation caused by using constructed temporally and spatially varying albedo and on net longwave radiation caused by using adjusted emissivity relative to conventionally land cover dependent or standard modis emissivity without adjustment they are however dominated by the large diurnal differences in net shortwave radiation associated with the effects of albedo for instance the simulated basin average net shortwave radiation using land cover dependent albedo is much smaller up to 50 w m2 than using the new dynamic albedo in the three headwater basins persistent differences in the net total radiation over the whole prb translate into robust seasonal biases compared against the standard or conventional treatment for radiative properties impacting the simulations of top soil temperature and surface energy fluxes the results also demonstrate that using the time varying standard modis emissivity without post processing is already superior to using static land cover based emissivity nonetheless model simulations are inevitably influenced by hydrometeorological forcing uncertainty specifically rainfall uncertainty and thus the results presented here are still limited by residual uncertainties imperfect model structure and forcing uncertainty mainly attributed to rainfall as discussed in section 4 2 1 this could be addressed in the future by further improving and correcting rainfall data for example using data assimilation as proposed by tao et al 2016 even in the highly idealistic scenario of perfect quantitative precipitation estimates qpes and quantitative precipitation forecasts qpfs hydrological models cannot resolve the water and energy flux estimations accurately if the landscape attributes are biased or are not representative of the real conditions of the land surface due to cloud contamination or spurious calibration which is particularly handicapping for long term hydroclimate assessments thus regionally corrected spatially and temporally varying vegetation and radiative properties reflect the dynamic nature of the earth s surface should be routinely incorporated in modeling and forecast activities data availability all the data necessary to conduct such study are available from iphex pratt edu and duke university

appendix a abbreviated model description the duke coupled surface groundwater hydrology model dchm is a fully distributed and physically based land surface hydrologic model solving water and energy balance equations ap1 and ap9 with coupled surface subsurface interactions earlier studies using evolving versions of the model formerly known as lsebm 1d lshm and 3d lshm and dchm are described in various peer reviewed publications at spatial resolutions ranging from several kms to 100 s of meters including barros 1995 devonec and barros 2002 yildiz and barros 2005 2007 2009 garcia quijano and

et al 2016 in the dchm each pixel represents a vertical soil column containing three or more soil layers that also serve as root layers and a dynamic base layer overlying the regolith or the water table in the case of unconfined aquifers parsimonious description of key model equations can be found in devonec and barros 2002 yildiz 2001 the key model components relevant to this study are described below the energy balance equation is given by ap1 ap1 c h 0 t 0 t f r s h l h g h where the left hand term represents the change in heat storage in the superficial soil layer c is the

are estimated based on the monin obukhov similarity theory which has primary assumptions of homogeneity and quasi stationarity of the horizontal flow field and independence of turbulent fluxes from the height of the surface layer arya 1988 brutsaert 1982 the theory provides dimensionless variables expressing the buoyancy effects resulting from the vertical density gradients in the stable

properties was assessed systematically clearly illustrating improvements in simulated water and energy fluxes using the developed landscape attributes with a fully distributed uncalibrated hydrologic model new hydrological insights for the region through simulations in the southern appalachian mountains we found that the spatiotemporal variability of radiative properties significantly influences the diurnal cycle of the surface energy budget with marked differences in sensible heat fluxes up to 10 20 better performance of streamflow simulations achieved by using the improved vegetation attributes is tied to changes in rainfall interception and evapotranspiration reflecting the importance of se forests in the regional water cycle the largest improvements in streamflow simulations

et al 2000 park and cameron 2008 yildiz and barros 2005 2007 generally vegetation characteristics should vary both in space and time according to regional phenology along with changes in spatial

properties for instance lawrence and slingo 2004 found that the seasonality of latent heat fluxes and surface temperature are strongly affected by seasonally varying lai similarly kumar et al 2014 reported significant improvements in simulations of energy fluxes by replacing land cover dependent vegetation data and climatologically based vegetation data at low resolution 0 144 or approximately 15 km used in the noah model with the standard modis 8 day products at relatively high spatial resolution 1 km for a four day simulation regarding the impacts of dynamic vegetation characteristics on water flux simulations previous work showed that the joint space time distribution of fvc and lai are essential to capture the seasonality and inter annual variability of streamflow in hydrologic models yildiz and barros 2005 2007 2009 specifically yildiz and barros 2007 first implemented direct assimilation of time varying vegetation by deriving their own lai and fvc products from avhrr ndvi normalized difference vegetation index in the lshm for continuous 6 month simulations of spring summer conditions under dry and wet hydrometeorological regimes inter comparison studies also demonstrated that using time varying vegetation characteristics can improve the simulations of soil moisture ford and quiring 2013 and streamflow andersen et al 2002 tesemma et al 2015 by contrasting the results against conventionally static lai the impact on the coupled water carbon cycle was recently examined by lowman and barros 2018 who introduced prognostic phenology into an existing implementation of the lshm with dynamic vegetation garcia quijano and barros 2005 they showed that model vegetation develops adaptation water use strategies in response to seasonal and inter annual climate variations that feedback nonlinearly into soil moisture and gross primary productivity gpp despite the growing awareness of the need to use time varying vegetation characteristics few hydrologic models prescribe vegetation conditions using real time dynamic vegetation products with realistic inter and intra annual variability due to the lack of continuous gap free time varying vegetation products at a high temporal resolution a major challenge in addressing this impasse is the combination of retrieval uncertainty systematic errors and data gaps in optical remote sensing products e g avhrr modis etc caused by cloud fog and precipitation contamination as extensively documented in the literature gao et al 2008 lopez burgos et al 2013 román et al 2009 williamson et al 2013 yang et al 2007 yuan et al 2011 in mountainous regions in particular e g the southern appalachian mountains sam where persistent fog and low level clouds are strongly modulated by complex topography duan and barros 2017 wilson and barros 2014 2017 severe cloud contamination can significantly handicap the use of optical remote sensing products however to date most efforts in the remote sensing community that have been devoted to improving the accuracy of remote sensing products tend to focus on assessments of land use land cover lulc change impacts baret et al 2013 camacho et al 2013 liang et al 2014 liu et al 2013 masson et al 2003 myneni et al 2002 xiao et al 2014 and less so in systematically evaluating their fidelity in the context of the water cycle generally and watershed hydrology in particular previous studies that investigated hydrological impacts of time varying vegetation characteristics e g ford and quiring 2013 tesemma et al 2015 yildiz and barros 2007 did not discuss the impacts of cloud contamination on the quality of remote sensing products for instance parr et al 2015 replaced climatologically based lai with dynamic lai data directly using the modis standard product in the vic model to improve the estimation of evapotranspiration and streamflow without discussing the quality control for the modis lai product and its impact on vic calibration likewise the quality of avhrr data were taken at face value by yildiz and barros 2005 2007 and 2009 further it is difficult to detect and attribute error to vegetation parameters in many modeling studies due to the short time span of simulations e g days in kumar et al 2014 29 cloud free days in long et al 2011 the cumulative long term impacts of using high quality i e with cloud correction time variant vegetation characteristics products at high temporal resolution e g at least daily to sub daily on basin scale simulations of water fluxes e g evapotranspiration streamflow etc remain to be investigated similar challenges affect two other key land surface radiative parameters examined here the shortwave broadband albedo and longwave broadband emissivity broadband emissivity is required for hydrological modeling to quantify emitted longwave radiation over the full electromagnetic spectrum mainly longwave thermal infrared 8 12 μm and broadband albedo is used to quantify the fraction of incoming shortwave radiation 0 3 3 μm that is reflected which varies instantaneously with solar zenith angle and illumination geometry schaaf et al 2002 wang et al 2004 these two radiative properties are also important indicators of land cover change over long time scales e g deforestation and reforestation dickinson and kennedy 1992 dirmeyer and shukla 1994 garratt 1993 liu 2011 qu et al 2015 as well as indicators of land surface disturbances e g wildfires hydroclimate conditions e g wet or drought and irrigation practices at shorter time scales jin et al 2012 pryor et al 2016 and thus vary both in space and time especially the surface broadband albedo however there are no spatially and temporally varying surface shortwave broadband albedo and longwave broadband emissivity products available for direct use in hydrologic applications for instance modis products include daily or 16 day spectral reflectance under a given observation geometry spectral band and also broadband brdf bidirectional reflectance distribution function parameters black sky albedo directional hemispherical reflectance at a given solar zenith angle e g at local solar noon and white sky albedo bihemispherical reflectance for certain range of bands but continuous gap free products of actual land surface broadband albedo blue sky albedo a weighted average of black sky albedo and white sky albedo with dynamic weights depending on the fraction of diffuse skylight including diurnal variations as needed in high resolution energy flux modeling are not available in addition modis emissivity products only provide daily 8 day and monthly narrowband emissivity data note that previous research has shown that large biases in estimated longwave radiation based on the planck function and the stefan boltzmann law could be attributed to using spectral narrowband emissivity instead of broadband emissivity wang et al 2005 although detailed algorithms for mapping surface broadband albedo using satellite based brdf parameters schaaf et al 2002 and the narrowband to broadband conversion algorithms for generating surface broadband emissivity and albedo from spectral observations jin and liang 2006 liang et al 1999 have been widely used in the remote sensing community qu et al 2015 the importance of this work has not been well recognized and transferred to the hydrological modeling community indeed almost all currently used lsms and hydrological models still adopt either land cover dependent static albedo estimated by radiative transfer models e g the two stream approximation described in bonan 1996 zeng et al 2002 or the spatially varying but temporally semi invariant e g climatologically based seasonal or diurnal varying albedo derived from satellite observations e g modis and avhrr csiszar and gutman 1999 strugnell et al 2001 that are characterized by improved accuracy relative to the former oleson et al 2003 wei et al 2001 using static or semi static albedo influences the surface energy budget the land surface skin temperature and thus the energy exchange at the air ground interface for instance cedilnik et al 2012 found that using daily bihemispherical white sky albedo derived from satellite brdf parameters instead of climatologically based monthly albedo in nwp numerical weather prediction simulations significantly reduced the bias in modeled surface net radiation likewise even very small changes in emissivity have a strong impact in the radiation budget when integrated over time because of the fourth power dependence of emitted longwave radiation on the surface temperature in the application of the stefan boltzmann law see also forster et al 2007 for relevant climate sensitivity discussion to this end the specific scientific questions we aim to address in this study include 1 what is the impact of incorporating corrected spatially and temporally varying landscape attributes i e vegetation characteristics and surface radiative properties into a distributed hydrological model on the simulations of streamflow and evapotranspiration and 2 what is the quantitative impact of using corrected landscape attributes data on the hydrologic chain of interacting processes rainfall interception evapotranspiration soil moisture runoff streamflow net longwave and shortwave radiation net surface radiation sensible heat flux soil temperature etc and consequently on the basin integrated water and energy budgets in topographically complex regions we hypothesized that i large uncertainty and errors are present within remote sensing specifically modis standard products of landscape attributes especially over mountainous regions such as the sam where persistent clouds and lingering heavy fog handicap satellite based data acquisition and that such errors can be corrected at least in part by appropriate post processing methods ii vegetation attributes lai and fvc strongly impact the simulations of evapotranspiration and streamflow both at short and long time scales therefore the corrected vegetation parameters should improve the simulations of streamflow and regional water budget and iii using realistic temporally and spatially varying radiative properties albedo and emissivity will result in improved simulations of the diurnal cycle and sub seasonal and seasonal variability of the surface energy budget including the net total radiation and sensible heat fluxes compared to using the conventional treatment to albedo and emissivity i e land cover dependent values to test these hypotheses we first developed high quality radiative and vegetation properties datasets from modis standard products see table 1 over the iphex2014 domain integrated precipitation and hydrology experiment 2014 see section 2 and barros et al 2014 in the southeast se us at a spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km and hourly time step continuously for a seven year time period 2007 2013 these data sets were used for operational hydrological forecasting during iphex using the fully distributed duke coupled surface subsurface hydrology model dchm tao et al 2016 here five modeling experiments were designed to systematically evaluate the propagation of errors associated with standard modis products on dchm simulations of water and energy fluxes in three headwater basins and to characterize the integrated impact of using the improved landscape attributes on basin scale water and energy budgets the objective of this study is two fold i to present a straightforward framework for systematically developing high quality time varying vegetation characteristics and radiative properties that reflect realistic land surface variability e g land cover land use change caused by both natural and human activity factors for hydrologic applications in regions of complex terrain for the first time at hourly temporal resolution and then ii to examine both the long term years and short term one month impacts of using these realistic dynamic i e high quality spatially and temporally varying landscape attributes on water and energy budgets at basin scale using the dchm throughout the paper the term landscape attributes refers to both surface radiative properties and vegetation parameters where the surface radiative properties specifically refer to longwave broadband emissivity and shortwave broadband albedo and the vegetation parameters refer to lai and fvc the developed data over the iphex domain in the se us are publicly and freely available at duke university dois and links are provided at the end of this article moreover the framework presented here provides an easy to follow roadmap for hydrologists to generate quality and continuous gap free data for their modeling studies in different regions or different periods of interest the study region and iphex2014 are described in section 2 the hydrological model the methodology for deriving high quality hourly surface radiative properties and vegetation characteristics products as well as the experimental design to examine the research hypotheses enunciated above are described in section 3 section 4 presents the newly developed datasets focusing on the improvement with respect to modis standard products without post processing the value of the new datasets to improve the fidelity of multi year hydrologic simulations is assessed in section 4 along with an illustrative process analysis of simulated water and energy fluxes using a limited duration case study one month section 5 provides a summary of the work and further discussion 2 study area and evaluation data the iphex2014 was a ground validation gv field campaign in support of nasa s global precipitation measurement gpm satellite mission barros et al 2014 petersen and barros 2018 the iphex domain is centered on the southern appalachian mountains sam and spans the piedmont and coastal plain regions of the se us centered on the four river basins with headwaters in the southern appalachians upper tennessee river basin savannah river basin santee river basin and yadkin pee dee river basin as shown in fig 1 a key objective of iphex was to improve quantitative precipitation estimates qpes and quantitative precipitation forecasts qpfs with application to hydrologic forecasting activities in regions of topographically complex terrain e g the inner regions of the sam under the auspices of iphex an operational hydrological forecasting testbed was established during the intensive observing period iphex iop for 12 headwater basins in the inner region of sam tao et al 2016 in preparation for the forecasting testbed a benchmark project for generating high quality consistent data sets necessary including hydro geographic data soil hydraulic parameters atmospheric forcing landscape attributes etc to implement and operate hydrologic models for the major river basins in the se us was completed for a 7 year period 2007 2013 using high quality historical atmospheric forcing tao and barros 2018 and the landscape attributes data presented here and described in the data report tao and barros 2014b it was possible to conduct long term hydrological model spin up simulations to generate realistic initial conditions e g soil moisture and water tables for operational hydrological forecasting during the iphex iop tao et al 2016 and evaluate the qpes and qpfs products driving the dchm previously point evaluation of the developed atmospheric forcing fields was conducted at four ameriflux towers and the duke environmental physics laboratory dkepl tower at purchase knob in the sam marked in fig 1 tao and barros 2018 the ameriflux towers monitor key variables states affecting ecosystem carbon water and energy fluxes including atmospheric pressure atmospheric temperature upwelling and downward longwave radiation and shortwave radiation albedo can be estimated from the reflected global solar radiation divided by the incoming global solar radiation observations however the comparison of tower observations with the constructed albedo at 1 km resolution is limited by the spatial heterogeneity and the uncertainty associated with the spatial scale gap e g from the point scale to pixel scale that is its representativeness cescatti et al 2012 liu et al 2009 román et al 2011 2013 román et al 2009 to assess whether the tower based albedo estimates can represent the spatial variability of the surrounding landscape at the spatial scales of modis products román et al 2009 concluded in their study that the us chr tower fig 1 and table 2 is the only tower spatially representative of its surrounding landscape in the se us thus the albedo measurements at us chr are used here to validate our constructed albedo estimates from modis brdf parameters although there are no available observations of lai fvc and emissivity at the ameriflux towers the newly developed data are contrasted against standard modis products at three selected flux tower locations with different land cover types and very distinct topography table 2 in addition an indirect evaluation strategy was pursued through end to end hydrologic modeling to examine the fidelity of the developed landscape attributes data by comparing simulated streamflow against observations specifically three headwater catchments of the pigeon river basin prb in the sam that are equipped with usgs united states geological survey stream gauges but not affected by dam operations were selected to evaluate the hydrological simulation results the cataloochee creek basin in the inner mountain region ccb 128 km2 and the west fork pigeon river basin wfprb 71 km2 and the east fork pigeon river basin efprb 131 km2 on the eastern ridges of the sam fig 1 the prb features topographically complex terrain characterized by gentle to very steep slopes and dominated by very dense forest mix forest and deciduous broadleaf forest figure s1 in the supplementary file the three headwater basins exhibit very different hydro geomorphic features the wfprb has relatively shallower soils and limited aquifer storage while the ccb and efprb have deep alluvial deposits with large subsurface flow tao and barros 2013 and 2014a besides the ccb is at the lowest elevation among the three basins and wfprb and efprb sit at the highest elevation nested among the eastern ridgelines of the sam notably the hydrometeorology of the ccb is characterized by a strong diurnal cycle with persistent low level clouds fog and light rainfall in the inner valleys in addition to persistent cloudiness above the ridges for all three basins at midday consistent with the time of satellite overpass e g duan and barros 2017 wilson and barros 2014 therefore the original modis standard products are expected to have the lowest quality over ccb among the three basins and the larger hydrologic impacts should also be expected in simulations of ccb hydrology 3 methodology 3 1 duke coupled surface groundwater hydrology model dchm and the input data 3 1 1 brief introduction to dchm the dchm duke coupled surface subsurface hydrology model has evolved over the years from a column svat soil vegetation atmosphere implementation devonec and barros 2002 with dynamic vegetation garcia quijano and barros 2005 to a fully distributed hydrologic model yildiz and barros 2005 2007 and 2009 including progressively more detailed representation of surface groundwater interactions and flood propagation at a very high tempo spatial resolution e g 250 m and 5 min in tao and barros 2013 and 2014a tao et al 2016 the components processes in the dchm that are relevant to the developed data sets are described in the appendix a more detailed description can be found in tao 2015 the equations processes directly or indirectly influenced by the landscape attributes prescribed in the dchm are synthesized in table 3 the emissivity and albedo not only directly affect net longwave net shortwave and thus net total radiation but also the surface latent and sensible heat fluxes as indicated by table 3 and equation ap1 in the appendix specifically equation ap3 describes how albedo controls the magnitude of reflected solar radiation and thus affects the total net solar shortwave radiation while emissivity affects the outgoing longwave radiation together both directly impact the total net radiation eq ap3 which in turn affects the surface energy budget soil temperature and sensible latent and ground heat fluxes eq ap1 the lai and fvc modulate rainfall interception evapotranspiration and thus soil moisture and streamflow response lai directly influences the calculation of canopy resistance jarvis formulation eq ap8 and thus significantly impacts the estimations of transpiration ap7 besides it is also used for determining the storage capacity of the canopy skin reservoir and thus affects canopy skin evaporation and the interception capacity and thus controls rainfall interception as per eq ap11 that is rainfall partitioning the fvc i e the fractional vegetation coverage represents the ratio of the vegetated area within a grid cell to the total area of the grid and it modulates evapotranspiration by weighting the magnitude of canopy skin evaporation vegetation transpiration and bare soil evaporation eq ap6 note that the energy balance equations eq ap1 and water balance equation eq ap9 are fully coupled in the dchm relying on a semi implicit numerical scheme e g crank nicholson scheme following devonec and barros 2002 thus the changes in water fluxes caused by the vegetation attributes also influence the energy partitioning and the impacts of radiative properties on energy fluxes feedback into the water fluxes nevertheless relative to the impacts on water fluxes caused by vegetation attributes the influence of radiative properties on water fluxes is comparatively small the dchm has been used in previous hydrological studies in headwater basins of prb see section 2 to investigate the predictability of flash floods and debris flow initiation for particular short term storm events tao and barros 2013 2014a tao et al 2016 here the focus is on sensitivity analysis of long term hydrological simulations and thus the time integrated impacts of landscape attributes data we conducted all dchm simulations at the iphex nominal resolution 1 km 1 km and hourly time step see details about model simulation configurations in section 3 3 3 1 2 input data required by dchm the dchm and distributed hydrological models generally require two types of input the generic static time invariant parameters and dynamic time variant inputs including meteorological forcing and landscape attributes all the input data have to be consistently prepared at a unified spatiotemporal resolution under the same projected coordinate system i e utm17 n at wgs84 datum in this study note the spatial resolution and temporal resolution has to be closely related to assure computational stability of numerical modeling for the iphex nominal spatial resolution at 1 km 1 km an hourly temporal resolution is adequate to ensure numerical stability 3 1 2 1 static time invariant parameters the most fundamental hydro geographical static dataset required by dchm the digital elevation model dem data were extracted from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm data farr et al 2007 from which dchm calculates slopes and flow directions at model grid pixels soil hydraulic parameters including saturated hydraulic conductivity porosity field capacity and wilting point were extracted from the state soil geographic statsgo dataset miller and white 1998 also we extracted land cover data over the iphex domain from the modis terra and aqua combined land cover type yearly global product at 500 m 463 3 m resolution mcd12q1 v051 and generated yearly land cover for iphex at 1 km spatial resolution although mixed land cover types may be present it is assumed that the physical processes are dominated by the majority of the land cover type in each pixel 2 2 http iphex pratt duke edu datacenter time invariantdatasets landcover the resultant land cover data in 2009 for the pigeon river basin as well as over the se us in 2009 are shown in figure s1 in the supplementary file as an example with a googleearth image included for reference the landcover product is subsequently used in dchm to specify temporally invariant spatially distributed physical vegetation parameters including the minimum stomatal resistance roughness length and displacement height thus affecting the calculation of aerodynamic drag coefficients dickinson et al 1993 mahfouf et al 1995 as well as the vertical distribution of vegetation root zeng 2001 all these static data are

dchm as the most important meteorological forcing was generated from the national center for environmental prediction ncep stage iv data a mosaic precipitation analyses product derived from multi sensor next generation weather radar and rain gauges over the us baldwin and mitchell 1998 lin and mitchell 2005 we first downscaled the stage iv data from 4 km to 1 km using a transient multifractal downscaling method nogueira and barros 2015 and then used the ensemble mean of 50 hourly downscaled rainfall fields for the hydrological simulations presented here other atmospheric forcing fields e g air temperature air pressure specific humidity wind speed incoming shortwave and longwave radiation were downscaled from the 32 km 3 hourly north american regional reanalysis narr data to the iphex nominal resolution i e 1 km 1 km and hourly time step and were physically corrected for elevation topography and cloudiness effects as described in the companion paper tao and barros 2018 the developed atmospheric forcing fields are publicly and freely available at duke library 4 4 http dukespace lib duke edu dspace handle 10161 8958 doi 10 7924 g8rn35s6 3 1 2 3 dynamic time variant input landscape attributes the landscape attributes data specifically include lai fvc surface longwave broadband emissivity and shortwave broadband albedo as elaborated in the introduction current modis standard lai products have large severe errors caused by persistent cloud or cloud fog contamination also there are no standard longwave broadband emissivity and shortwave broadband albedo products here we develop continuous quality lai data by adjusting and then correcting cloud impacts within the modis lai product section 3 2 and then calculate fvc with the corrected lai data for emissivity we use a narrowband to broadband method section 3 2 to calculate the longwave broadband emissivity with the modis standard narrowband emissivity products first and then adjust the estimates further to correct potential errors regarding albedo we construct hourly shortwave broadband albedo with modis brdf broadband parameters see details in section 3 2 3 the new landscape attributes data with

surface radiative properties for distributed hydrologic modeling we developed continuous radiative properties i e emissivity and albedo and vegetation parameters i e lai and fvc over the se us at the iphex nominal resolution 1 km 1 km and hourly time step for seven years 2007 2013 fig 2 illustrates the workflow including the data model links i e how the landscape attributes data are used in the dchm as described in detail in section 3 1 1 and the appendix the detailed description of the methodology implemented to produce the high quality landscape attributes data are presented in the technical report by tao and barros 2014b here we describe the core methodology and algorithms only the focus is specifically on the correction of cloud fog contamination within modis land products listed in table 1 using temporal filtering method before any post processing the relevant standard modis products were first re projected to utm17 n wgs84 composited to the study area and then interpolated to the iphex domain grid system at 1 km 1 km resolution subsequently physically based checks e g seamless composition artifacts etc and temporal filtering were conducted to correct cloud and fog contamination toward reducing discontinuities and abnormal values in lai fvc and emissivity finally linear interpolation was applied to generate hourly products for the corrected vegetation data and emissivity as illustrated by fig 2a hourly albedo was constructed mainly relying on modis brdf parameters which differs from the methods applied for generating hourly emissivity lai and fvc 3 2 1 vegetation parameters lai and fvc the standard lai data were extracted from the combined terra and aqua modis 8 day lai product mcd15a2 collection 5 the mcd15a2 lai product was retrieved based on a look up table that represents the lai fpar reflectance relationship estimated by a three dimensional radiative transfer model myneni et al 2002 here we follow the method presented in yuan et al 2011 to improve modis lai to remove cloud impacts the core data processing algorithm is timesat a tool utilized for analyzing time series data has been widely applied for post processing satellite products eklundh et al 2009 heumann et al 2007 yuan et al 2011 the adaptive savitzky golay filter in timesat that fits the input time series data using a quadratic polynomial function was used to conduct the adaptive temporal filtering for modis products the method detects spikes outliers and assigns weights to the lai data relying on the seasonal trend decomposition using loess stl algorithm which first decomposes the time series into trends seasonality and remainder components and then assigns the weights accordingly important timesat parameters including the weights moving window size of polynomial fit and strength of the envelope adaptation etc were carefully investigated through sensitivity analysis in general high weights are assigned to good quality data e g clear sky conditions and low weights for the data with bad quality control flags e g cloudy conditions the moving window size 8 for the savitzky golay filter was determined iteratively to achieve the best fit to the upper envelope of the data and avoid negative bias other parameters were assigned according to the discussion and suggestions in the software manual by eklundh and jönssonb 2012 as indicated in fig 2a timesat was applied first to filter lai temporally and the gap free lai data were used to calculate fvc based on an empirical relationship choudhury 1987 choudhury et al 1994 french et al 2003a steven et al 1986 1 f v c 1 e x p k l a i where e x p k l a i represents the canopy transmittance and k is the attenuation coefficient or a leaf angle distribution term which is defined as 0 5 for the case of randomly oriented leaves choudhury et al 1994 french et al 2003b ross 1975 3 2 2 land surface longwave broadband emissivity the modis terra 8 day land surface temperature and emissivity product on a latitude longitude based 0 05 climate modeling grid system mod11c2 collection 5 consists of spectral emissivity for the various modis bands a linear relationship between the modis broadband emissivity and narrowband emissivity was established through regression analysis by jin and liang 2006 using the spectral emissivity at modis band 29 ε 29 8 400 8 700μm band 31 ε 31 10 780 11 280μm and band 32 ε 32 11 770 12 270μm as follows 2 ε b 0 0139 ε 29 0 4606 ε 31 0 5256 ε 32 this empirical relationship accounts for soil texture and mineral composition with the uncertainty of 0 005 jin and liang 2006 the broadband emissivity was calculated using equation 2 first followed by temporal filtering using timesat fig 2a as opposed to the stl decomposition method used for lai data sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the median filtering method was the most efficient approach to detect emissivity outliers resulting in very similar weights as the stl decomposition method thus the median filtering was selected for detecting spikes in the emissivity data while other parameters were derived using the same approach as for the lai data e g fitting method is savitzky golay seasonality parameter etc because emissivity data are governed by landcover soil moisture content and vegetation characteristics the upper envelope is not necessarily the true value the stl decomposition method is more favorable for fitting to the upper envelope of data such as in the case of lai 3 2 3 land surface shortwave broadband albedo currently there is no available standard albedo product at high temporal resolution i e hourly because it depends on the instantaneous solar zenith angle and illumination geometry at local scales liu et al 2009 schaaf et al 2002 here the modis brdf albedo model parameters product mcd43b1 that provides both spectral band and broadband brdf bidirectional reflectance distribution function model parameters every 8 days with 16 days acquisition interval was used to construct time varying albedo as a function of solar zenith angle and solar illumination geometry following schaaf et al 2002 given that the mcd43b1 was produced with 16 days acquisition intervals with fewer gaps compared to vegetation products we do not apply post processing to this product and use it to construct the surface albedo directly fig 2a the new hourly albedo product developed here is a function of the black sky albedo bsa or directional hemispherical albedo and white sky albedo wsa or bihemispherical albedo relying on the ross thick li sparse reciprocal rtlsr kernel driven brdf model the bsa α b s θ λ for any solar illumination geometry is derived by calculating the weighted sum of an isotropic parameter and kernels describing viewing and illumination geometry román et al 2009 schaaf et al 2002 as follows 3 α b s θ λ k f k λ g 0 k g 1 k θ 2 g 2 k θ 3 f i s o λ g 0 i s o g 1 i s o θ 2 g 2 i s o θ 3 f v o l λ g 0 v o l g 1 v o l θ 2 g 2

solar zenith angle g j k j 0 1 and 2 and k i s o v o l g e o are the coefficients provided in schaaf et al 2002 f i s o λ is the isotropic scattering component f v o l λ is the parameter for the ross thick volume scattering kernel and f g e o λ is the parameter for the li sparse reciprocal geometric scattering kernel these brdf model parameters including f i s o λ f v o l λ and f g e o λ are provided in the mcd43b1 8 day products note we only use the shortwave broadband 0 3 3 μm brdf parameters within mcd43b1 products to construct the hourly shortwave broadband albedo the wsa α w s λ can be directly calculated using these brdf parameters and the following empirical eq 4 4 α w s λ f i s o λ 0 189184 f v o l λ 1 377622 f g e o λ it is important to emphasize that the wsa α w s λ relies on the mcd43b1 brdf parameters and thus it is assumed constant over the 8 day period of the mcd43b1 product the bsa α b s θ λ in contrast is calculated at hourly time steps with the specific solar zenith angle at each pixel albeit using the same brdf parameters over the 8 day period finally the actual blue sky albedo α θ λ of the land surface is the weighted average of α b s θ λ and α w s λ where the weighting coefficient is the fraction of diffuse skylight s θ τ λ 5 α θ λ 1 s θ τ λ α b s θ λ s θ τ λ α w s λ the s θ τ λ was obtained from a lookup table 6 6 http www modis bu edu brdf userguide tools html relating solar zenith angle θ atmospheric optical depth τ λ and local aerosol types to diffuse skylight schaaf et al 2002 the aerosol optical depth a measurement of the extinction of solar radiation through the atmosphere due to absorbing or scattering by aerosol particles was obtained from the modis level 3 atmosphere daily product mod08 d3 the actual albedo α θ λ at hourly time scale was calculated by eq 5 with hourly s θ τ λ and hourly α b s θ λ assuming that α w s λ does not change over the 8 day period consistent with the mcd43b1 product 3 3 hydrologic simulations to investigate the hydrological impacts of the land attributes and demonstrate the value and utility of the corrected time varying landscape attributes datasets hydrological simulations at the iphex nominal resolution 1 km 1 km and hourly time step were conducted using dchm in three headwater sub basins of the pigeon river basin in the southern appalachian mountains see section 2 for four continuous water years from 2007 october to 2011 september encompassing an extreme drought 2007 2008 and a very wet hydrological year 2009 2010 brun and barros 2013 3 3 1 hydrologic simulation experiments design to examine the 2nd and 3rd hypotheses of the study we designed five modeling experiments as described in table 4 that includes the list of the subset of figures with results relevant for each experiment throughout the paper standard refers to modis standard products without any post processing i e correction adjustment specifically the standard lai was directly extracted from modis mcd15a2 product section 3 2 1 without any correction and the standard fvc was calculated using the standard lai in summary the terminology standard vegetation attributes refers to standard lai and fvc and the terminology adjusted vegetation attributes refers to corrected lai and the estimated fvc based on the corrected lai as described in section 3 2 1 regarding surface radiative properties since albedo and emissivity together impact the net total radiation in the energy balance equation ap1 that further affects hydrological processes along the heat exchange chain the two variables were examined in three categories conventional treatment standard treatment and constructed temporally and spatially varying data table 4 the conventional treatment of radiative properties follows the approach used in the noah model kumar et al 2011 by assigning static values for albedo and emissivity according to land cover type i e lc dependent as provided in table 5 there are no standard shortwave broadband albedo and longwave broadband emissivity products here we define the standard emissivity as the longwave broadband emissivity directly calculated from modis narrowband emissivity using the same method as described in section 3 2 2 thus it is also spatiotemporally varying but without corrections or adjustments therefore the standard radiative properties include the standard emissivity and lc dependent albedo finally the constructed radiative properties refer to the datasets developed in this work including the spatiotemporally varying emissivity with post processing adjustment section 3 2 2 and the constructed space time variant albedo reflecting realistic surface conditions atmospheric and environmental conditions and solar illumination geometry based on modis shortwave broadband brdf parameters section 3 2 3 as indicated in table 4 exp1 uses the most realistic landscape attributes data including the adjusted vegetation attributes i e lai and fvc and constructed temporally and spatially varying radiative properties e g emissivity and albedo produced in this study and thus is the reference or benchmark for all sensitivity experiments exp2 uses the standard vegetation attributes and the standard treatment for radiative properties representing the current standard configuration in hydrologic modeling practice with regard to the specification of land surface radiative properties the differences in simulated streamflow between exp1 and exp2 illustrate the integral impact of using more realistic vegetation attributes and radiative properties compared to using standard data or in other words the impact of the cloudiness correction applied to vegetation attributes and emissivity in addition to using the newly constructed spatiotemporally varying albedo as described in section 3 1 1 radiative properties mainly affect the simulations of energy fluxes and long term energy budget and vegetation characteristics primarily influence the simulations of water fluxes and long term water budget thus we also discuss the hydrological impacts of vegetation attributes and radiative properties separately to examine the impacts of vegetation attributes alone on the simulations of water fluxes exp3 is designed to use the newly constructed radiative properties as in exp1 and the standard vegetation attributes without correction comparing simulated water fluxes between exp1 and exp3 both at long and short time scales illuminates the propagation of errors from standard modis vegetation products in the hydrologic model and the translation of input errors into simulation bias to examine the impacts of radiative properties alone on the simulations of energy fluxes exp4 uses the adjusted vegetation attributes as in exp1 while prescribing the radiative properties with conventional treatment i e lc dependent albedo and emissivity we expect large diurnal and seasonal differences in the simulated energy fluxes between exp1 and exp4 given the contrasting differences between constructed radiative properties and the lc dependent values finally exp5 differs from exp4 only in the usage of standard emissivity comparing the differences between exp1 and exp4 with the differences between exp 1 and exp5 provides an alternative path for characterizing the value of using spatiotemporally varying emissivity directly estimated from modis standard products relative to the conventional lc dependent emissivity 3 3 2 analysis strategy 3 3 2 1 long term impacts errors and uncertainty in the initial soil water and groundwater storage severely impact streamflow predictability at the event scale by affecting the space time structure of rainfall runoff response across the watershed as well as long term water budgets in the case of continuous simulations thus spin up simulations similar to tao and barros 2018 and tao et al 2016 were conducted to redress uncertainty in initial conditions in all experiments in table 4 spin up simulations are repeated simulation cycles using the same forcing for a period of time with initial soil moisture and water table conditions equal to their values at the end of the preceding iteration until the differences between initial and end states are below a tolerance level note that unless the atmospheric forcing is precisely known the model structure is correct and model parameters are accurate it is not possible to completely eliminate uncertainty in the model initial conditions the purpose of model initialization by spin up is to achieve internal consistency among the unsaturated and saturated water stores in the model in synergy with the prevailing hydrometeorological regimes and regional conditions as described by the available atmospheric forcing topography and land cover attributes specifically the four year simulations were repeated 10 times for a total of 40 simulation years using the final states from the previous simulation as initial conditions for the next simulation with the same forcing until selected metrics see section 3 3 2 do not change within 1 tolerance note that the optimal number of spin up cycles depends on the basin and the efficiency metrics used for the sake of consistency we looped all the simulations 10 times the overall integrated effects emerging from using different landscape attributes are illustrated by the differences in streamflow estimates for the last 10th repetition between two experiments with different vegetation characteristics and radiative properties i e exp1 and exp2 in table 4 the long term simulation results are analyzed first in section 4 2 1 focusing on the overall impacts of landscape attributes data vegetation characteristics and radiative properties together on streamflow predictions over the four year continuous simulations by comparing exp1 with exp2 besides the long term impact of vegetation attributes on the regional water budget is also analyzed in section 4 2 2 by comparing four water year integrated water budget components between exp1 and exp3 3 3 2 2 short term impacts to facilitate linking cloud corrections of landscape attributes to changes in hydrological states and fluxes we first identify a representative short term period e g a month showing large contrast between standard modis data and the adjusted data we developed i e effective correction to the cloud contamination through detailed comparison in section 4 1 then the differences in simulated water and energy fluxes from different experiments are analyzed within the selected one month period consistent with the analysis in section 4 1 to evaluate day to day short term impacts of the landscape attributes data specifically the comparison combinations as mentioned in section 3 3 1 including exp1 vs exp3 exp1 vs exp4 and exp1 vs exp5 are all analyzed over this month as discussed in section 4 2 2 and 4 2 3 3 3 3 evaluation metrics we use three dimensionless efficiency indices to evaluate hydrologic modelling performance of the simulated hydrograph including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 and the modified kge kge mod kling et al 2012 the nse equation 6 measures how large the residual variance in the simulations relative to the observational variance and ranges from negative infinity to unity with nse 1 indicating optimal performance the model simulation generally is considered satisfactory if nse 0 50 moriasi et al 2007 6 n s e 1 1 n t 1 n q s t q o t 2 σ o 2 where t means time step i e hourly in this study n is the total number of time steps q t is streamflow at time step t with as s representing simulations o representing observations and σ o is the standard deviation of observations the kge and kge mod are expressed in eqs 7 and 8 respectively 7 k g e 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 α 1 2 8 k g e m o d 1 r 1 2 β 1 2 γ 1 2 where r is the correlation coefficient β is the bias ratio β μ s μ o where μ is the mean α is the variability ratio α σ s σ o where σ is the standard deviation in k g e m o d the variability ratio α was modified by kling et al 2012 by replacing σ with the coefficient of variation c v and thus the modified variability ratio is calculated as γ c v s c v o this simple modification ensures that the bias and variability ratios are not cross correlated that otherwise might occur when the input precipitation is biased kling et al 2012 the three components i e correlation coefficient bias ratio and variability ratio define a three dimensional 3d space both kge and kge mod measure the difference between unity and the euclidian distance in the 3d space from the ideal point i e r 1 β 1 and α 1 or γ 1 thus unity is also the optimum value for kge and kge mod the three efficiency metrics described above are used to evaluate the simulated streamflow time series over the four water years of simulation at an hourly time step for short term analysis of streamflow response we mainly rely on nse besides the efficiency metrics mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean bias error mbe are also used in the analysis 4 results 4 1 developed lai fvc emissivity and albedo systematic analysis regarding the spatial pattern of the developed datasets including mean median standard deviation and probability density function pdf for each landcover type can be found in the associated technical report tao and barros 2014b in this section we focus on demonstrating the removal of cloud impacts within the original modis vegetation and emissivity product and how this affects the seasonal and sub seasonal variations of lai fvc and emissivity and the accuracy and rationale of the constructed albedo product 4 1 1 lai and fvc time series of lai and fvc before and after temporal filtering at the three tower locations are shown in fig 3 the land cover classes for these towers are listed in table 2 although no field measurements of lai and fvc are available for evaluation proper at these tower locations we show the comparison of time series to illustrate how the adaptive filtering method can significantly reduce the discontinuity and errors in lai and thus cv improving the overall data quality it can be seen from fig 3 that the adjusted lai series preserves the inter and intra annual variability of the original modis product and captures well the timing of the growing season which in turn adds confidence to the fvc estimates the lai and fvc at the dkepl tower exhibit the largest change compared to other towers largest rmse between lai before and after filtering i e 1 40 at dkepl versus 1 11 and 0 82 for uschr and usdk1 respectively because the adaptive filter corrected the significant contamination of the diurnal cycle of fog and low level clouds in the smoky mountains e g duan and barros 2017 wilson and barros 2014 and at the dkepl location in particular for the two other towers the most frequent contamination dramatically reduced values occurred during the summer time from june to october especially in 2009 a very wet hydrological year with frequent storm events during the atlantic hurricane season brun and barros 2013 for example there are virtually no cloud free modis data within an 8 day period around sep 16 in 2009 in the iphex domain a period of persistent rainfall in the se us that resulted in severe cloud contamination of the lai product as illustrated in the top and middle row panels in fig 4 the spatial distributions of the adjusted lai and fvc 10 days before and after sep 16 exhibit reasonable values and distribution patterns after correction in contrast with the very low values i e lai around two shown in red color in the standard lai and fvc products two archived photographs fig 4c available in sep and oct from a webcam 7 7 http www2 nature nps gov air webcams parks grsmpkcam grsmpk arc cfm 8 https lpdaac usgs gov products modis products table installed at purchase knob in the pigeon river basin show the forest status with very large lai and fvc at the time the contamination is successfully removed by the timesat adaptive filter as demonstrated by the central panel in fig 4 these results illustrate the importance of targeted quality control of standard products to reduce the discontinuity and abnormal values in lai and thus fvc panels a and b in fig 5 illustrate the space time heterogeneity of lai and fvc over the region including large seasonal and intra seasonal variations the northeast to southwest patterns of alternating high and low values are attributed to the various vegetation zones see land cover map figure s1 in the supplementary file the mixed zones of woody savanna and croplands close to the coast show low lai all year round top panel fig 5a in contrast to the adjacent mixed forest with persistently higher lai seasonality is shown more clearly in fig 5b compared to the forests in the sam the northeast to southwest mixed forest zones in between the woody savanna zones and close to the coast exhibit large fvc all year round note the large inter annual variability depicted in the bottom panels in fig 5a b with large differences between lai and fvc on the same day in 2007 a dry year and 2009 a wet year the frequent severe storms in august september of 2009 produced massive rainfall amounts over the se us especially over the sam causing significant vegetation disturbance brun and barros 2013 which explains the lower lai and fvc values on october 1 in 2009 than in 2007 4 1 2 land surface longwave broadband emissivity fig 6 shows the land surface longwave broadband emissivity before and after temporal filtering at the selected tower locations in contrast to lai and fvc for which most contamination is negatively biased the land surface emissivity exhibits large up and down fluctuations that are successfully eliminated by filtering generally vegetated areas have larger emissivity than non vegetated or sparsely vegetated areas fig 5c except for waterbodies land margins and wetlands for different types of vegetation many factors including vegetation species canopy structure and density phenology growth stage etc affect the emissivity snyder et al 1998 the top panel in fig 5c highlights contrasts among the coastal plain the piedmont and the appalachian mountains with large spatial heterogeneity explained by land cover emissivity in urban areas e g atlanta the largest cluster of red pixels in the iphex domain remains low although it varies temporally in response to surface wetness conditions i e precipitation overall for the southeast us the top panel in fig 5c displays high emissivity in february over the southeast sector from the mountains to the piedmont and then decreases through august and october increasing thereafter in december a behavior that is not correlated with regional phenology this can be explained in large part by leaf dryness i e vegetation water stress during the dry season olioso et al 2007 high emissivity values in the southern appalachian mountains especially along the blue ridge escarpment are associated with the seasonal leaf color change reflecting changes in the chemical composition of the leaves other factors influencing emissivity include real time vegetation growth stage weather conditions fog interception rain or snow accumulation on the ground and leaves and hydrological conditions i e soil moisture conditions snyder et al 1998 the inter annual variability in emissivity the difference of emissivity on the same day of 2007 and 2009 illustrated in the bottom row of fig 5c includes both the effects of vegetation growth stage and antecedent soil moisture conditions 4 1 3 land surface shortwave broadband albedo fig 7 a compares the produced land surface shortwave broadband albedo at the local solar noon lsn every day against the available observations at ameriflux tower us chr see fig 1 for location the modis brdf parameters were derived for snow free and cloud free conditions and thus the produced albedo are also snow free and cloud free to alleviate the presence of clouds the mean of the observed albedo within a 3 hour window centered at the lsn was calculated and then compared with the newly constructed albedo estimates as suggested by román et al 2009 nevertheless it is not possible to completely filter out cloud conditions at short times scales even using the 3 hr mean values which may explain the underestimation of the albedo in may the snow conditions were identified by air temperature less than zero degrees celsius observed at the tower void symbols in fig 7a in general the estimated albedo shows a good agreement with observations with a small root mean square error rmse 0 017 a small mean absolute error mae 0 013 and a small mean bias error mbe 0 007 fig 7b shows the comparison of the monthly mean diurnal cycle of the newly constructed hourly albedo with the us chr observations there is generally a good agreement with the tower observations except for the late afternoon with underestimation mainly during the winter time october to january further the albedo estimates display a diurnal cycle consistent with the assumption of symmetry at lsn as indicated in the theoretical retrieval algorithm for modis brdf albedo model liu et al 2009 schaaf et al 2002 whereas the observed albedo exhibits asymmetry the diurnal asymmetry of observed albedo may be attributed to dew and frost formation precipitation evaporation and wind effects causing surfaces to look brighter early in the day minnis et al 1997 previous studies on the diurnal asymmetry of albedo in grassland or cropland land categories reported that albedo in the early morning is usually larger than in the afternoon minnis et al 1997 song 1998 as strong directional winds deform the vegetation canopy and turn the back of leaves upward thus creating a brightening effect at us chr where the deciduous broadleaf forest is the dominant vegetation type table 2 the observed albedo has larger values in the late afternoon than in the early morning as shown in fig 7b this can be explained at least in part by the diurnal cycle in mountain valley circulations as this tower is located on the foothills of the western slopes of the appalachians in the ridge valley region also albedo also has strong seasonal variability increasing during the growing and blooming seasons and then decreasing during the dormant season the spatial distributions of bsa wsa and the actual broadband albedo at lsn on september 2009 are presented in fig 7c note the correspondence of spatial albedo patterns to those of land cover shown in figure s1 the same albedos bsa wsa and actual albedo on june 1 and december 1 of 2009 are provided in figure s2 in the supplementary file in support of the discussion here wetlands along the margins of river networks exhibit very low albedo compared to other land cover types especially near the coast large spatial variability follows the complex terrain in the southern appalachian mountains with contrasting values along ridges and valleys bsa heavily depends on solar zenith angle thus the difference between albedo at lsn in different months june september and december is small due to the small differences in the solar zenith angle wsa depends on the observed intrinsic properties of the land surface as indicated by equation 4 and consequently wsa exhibits large seasonal variations compare middle panel in fig 7c and figure s2 inspection of the temporal evolution of the broadband albedo reveals that large seasonal albedo variations are linked directly to changes in wsa generally the albedo in winter december is larger than in the summer june due to the large contrast of black dull color in december grey branches dark soils etc versus the bright and green colors in june as shown in figure s2 in the supplementary file 4 2 hydrologic model simulations 4 2 1 impacts of developed datasets on long term streamflow simulation the nse kge and kgemod streamflow metrics calculated at hourly time step over the four water years from 2007 october to 2011 september for each spin up cycle in the three sub basins wfprb efprb and ccb are displayed in fig 8 a for exp1 and exp2 it can be seen from fig 8a that all skill scores from both experiments increase with repeated spin up for the three basins illustrating the impact of improved initial conditions on hydrologic simulation fidelity the skill scores do reach a plateau above which further improvements are negligible after sufficient spin up cycles indicating that the model reached internal equilibrium and the maximum achievable predictive skill alternatively viewed as a predictability barrier that is different for each basin this predictability barrier for each evaluation metric i e skill scores for the last spin up is determined by the accuracy of input data i e atmospheric forcing and landscape attributes model parameters and the specific basin geomorphology characteristics that affect the propagation of forcing errors through current model configuration the predictive skill barrier could be improved through calibration note dchm is uncalibrated and by improving precipitation forcing as we conducted in previous studies tao and barros 2014a 2013 tao et al 2016 this is out of the scope of this study rather here we analyze the differences in the evaluation metrics for the final 10th spin up simulation between exp1 and exp2 to illustrate the impacts of using different landscape attributes on streamflow simulations with known rainfall errors as discussed by nogueira and barros 2014 2015 and fixed hydrologic parameters the three efficiency indices nse kge and kgemod see details in section 3 3 2 along with the correlation coefficient r the bias ratio β the variability ratio α and the modified variability ratio γ for the last spin up are provided in table 6 for the three basins the skill score differences between exp1 and exp2 for wfprb are either quite small e g nse and correlation coefficient meaning equivalent performance or indicate worsen performance for exp1 than exp2 for efprb exp1 shows slightly better nse 0 58 vs 0 54 equivalent kge 0 69 vs 0 70 but worse kge mod 0 46 vs 0 55 than exp2 due to the lower modified variability ratio γ i e away from unity this reflects the increased topographic and geomorphic complexity of this basin as well as the fact that rainfall errors are expected to be larger due to lack of raingauge observations in the basin and ground clutter effects on the radar rainfall product the bias ratio β and variability ratio both α and γ for ccb are closest to unity especially for exp1 resulting in the shortest euclidian distance between the point r β α or r β γ and the ideal point 1 1 1 among the three basins and thus best kge and kge mod efficiencies 0 75 for both are attained yet the hourly nse for ccb is comparatively low mainly due to poor performance for low flows i e 3 m3 s as shown in figure s3 in the supplementary file this is attributed to stage iv rainfall uncertainty in this inner mountain basin below the scanning levels of regional operational radars that is low level rainfall is missed whereas larger rainfall events appear to be overcorrected in the ccb tao and barros 2013 tao et al 2016 nevertheless in contrast to wfprb all the efficiency indices for exp1 are better than exp2 for the ccb i e nse kge and kge mod increases by 10 3 and 4 respectively with significantly improved performance using the newly developed landscape attributes data as discussed in section 2 ccb is located in the inner sam region of the great smoky mountains and thus low level clouds heavy fog and light rainfall are persistent which results in severe cloud contamination to modis product consequently the larger improvement in simulated streamflow for ccb compared to the other two basins are attributed to the effectiveness of the cloudiness correction of landscape attributes over this basin fig 8b displays the streamflow time series from the last spin up iteration and the scatter plot of simulations against observations for the three basins the left panel of fig 8b shows that exp2 green overestimates streamflow for many large events using the standard modis vegetation products and the standard treatment for radiative properties while exp1 red shows comparatively better performance the middle panels of fig 8b exhibit overall good agreement between simulated and observed streamflow for the two experiments with better performance using the corrected adjusted vegetation and constructed radiative data sets for the larger flow events winter djf streamflow is overestimated in all basins likely reflecting the overestimation of radar rainfall due to bright band artifacts i e due to the presence of snow and ice lower in the atmosphere because of very different geomorphology and hydrometeorology the seasonal behavior is different among the three basins as highlighted in the scatter plot in fig 8b the wfprb simulations exhibit relatively worse performance for winter storms djf in contrast with very good agreement for summer flows jja associated with heavy convective storm systems on the eastern slopes of the sam this is because summertime convective storms can be captured by the nearby national weather service operational radar in greenville south carolina and thus are well represented in stage iv precipitation data by contrast most large flow events in the ccb occurred in the winter associated with westerly frontal storms further the rainfall runoff response is directly tied to basin geomorphologic characteristics and complex topography wfprb is located on the highest mountain ridges in the eastern slopes of the appalachians and the rainfall runoff response is very fast due to steep slopes and shallow soils tao and barros 2013 for heavy rainfall events such as tropical storm fay the large peak in aug in 2008 differences in streamflow estimates are as large as 16 m3 s 10 of peak discharge between exp1 and exp2 in the wfprb with improved performance for exp1 in all basins resulting in peak discharge improvements up to 20 in the efprb and ccb similar behavior is seen for the ccb throughout the year though peak flows are lower since deep valley soils and active surface groundwater interactions provide more storage for individual events tao and barros 2014a in the cold season fog and persistence of low level cloudiness in the inner region valleys wilson and barros 2014 2017 duan and barros 2017 maintain the upper soil layers wet which favors runoff response even if the rainfall intensities are lower e g winter of 2009 in the efprb and ccb but these are not adequately observed by the operational network used to produce the merged radar raingauge stage iv precipitation product in summary we demonstrated a significant improvement in simulated streamflow over four water years by using the newly developed landscape attributes data i e adjusted corrected vegetation products and constructed radiative properties compared to the results using standard modis vegetation products and standard treatment to radiative properties over the ccb e g the nse calculated at an hourly time step was improved by 10 a basin that have most severe cloud contamination to modis standard products among the three basins the performance of exp1 for efprb is comparable to exp2 for efprb and is even worse for wfprb which is not unexpected under the context of current predictability barrier for each tested basin i e know rainfall errors the results substantiate the fidelity and utility of the developed landscape attributes data in simulating streamflow with distributed hydrologic models in mountainous regions 4 2 2 impacts of lai and fvc on water flux simulations the integrated impacts of landscape attributes data on streamflow estimation demonstrated in the previous section lump together the changes caused by using both adjusted vegetation characteristics and constructed radiative properties in this section we compare the results from exp3 with exp1 to illustrate the impacts of adjusted vegetation attributes lai and fvc on the simulated water fluxes at both short term and long term scales as indicated in table 4 all other parameters inputs for the dchm are the same between the two experiments thus any discrepancies between the two simulations are solely attributed to the difference in lai and fvc between standard exp3 and adjusted exp1 data sets to follow up the discussion initiated in section 4 1 1 about the correction to the persistent cloud and precipitation contamination in modis vegetation product in september of 2009 here we first focus on the simulated water fluxes for the same month then we analyze the cumulative difference in simulated water budget components between the two experiments over the whole simulating period i e four water years to illustrate the integrated impact of corrected vegetation attributes data on regional water budget the long term impact fig 9 shows the difference between the basin averaged vegetation parameters and water fluxes simulated by the dchm including rainfall interception transpiration evaporation and discharge simulated for the ccb wfprb and efprb in september of 2009 as described in the appendix dchm evaporation comprises the components from the bare soil area 1 fvc and also from the skin reservoir including canopy retention since cloud contamination generally reduces the magnitude of lai and fvc in the standard products the lai and fvc average adjustment mainly consisted of removing the downward peaks in the first half of september as pointed out earlier in fig 3 and also shown in the top two rows of fig 9 the corrections of lai and fvc translate into increases in intercepted rainfall amount and transpiration in all three basins up to sep 25 at which time lai and fvc before and after post processing are very similar the underestimated lai and fvc in the standard modis products results in lower canopy interception capacity in the model which is quite critical for both light rainfall and moderate to heavy rainstorm events for instance long duration light rainfall accumulations can rapidly exceed the underestimated interception capacity with the standard modis products leading to larger rainfall depths reaching the ground surface leading to overestimation of surface runoff response and eventually streamflow light rainfall retained in the canopy can be used by plants via foliar uptake especially under dry conditions and or evaporated later when a realistic canopy interception capacity is used that is when vegetation is prescribed with the adjusted lai and fvc for moderate or heavy rainfall scenarios more rainfall is retained in the canopy contributing to evaporation at a later time using the corrected lai and fvc exp1 as illustrated by the large evaporation during heavy rainfall periods shown in the 5th row of fig 9 and less rainfall infiltrates into the ground reducing soil moisture which in turn affects transpiration and discharge the magnitude of the corrected fvc is substantially larger than the standard product implying therefore a similarly large change decrease in the bare soil areal fraction 1 fvc changes in fvc lead to evaporation decreases and transpiration increases as illustrated by the large transpiration for exp1 using adjusted vegetation attributes shown in the 4th row of fig 9 and lower soil moisture in the active root layers specifically also considering the coupled land atmosphere system the differences in latent heat fluxes due to changes in evaporation and transpiration in september are significant to impact atmospheric boundary layer entropy and ultimately enhance convective activity and rainfall in mountainous regions e g sun and barros 2014 the integrated impact of using corrected vegetation parameters for the same month is examined by comparing simulated streamflow and observations in the bottom row of fig 9 both streamflow simulations using the standard and adjusted vegetation attributes agree well with observed discharge with regard to peak times although the peak values are overestimated and more so for exp3 than exp1 as expected based on the above analysis compared to exp3 the skill of streamflow predictions in exp1 is substantially better by using the adjusted vegetation attributes with nses at hourly time step for the month of september of 2009 increasing from 0 21 to 0 48 i e more than two fold increase for the ccb basin in the inner mountain region largely due to improvements in the simulation of low flows in the efprb nse changes are small improved from 0 64 to 0 71 and they are negligible for the wfprb i e 0 92 and 0 90 for exp3 and exp1 respectively demonstrating comparable or equivalent performance this negligible difference in nse about 2 for wfprb might be attributed to interactions among different sources of error mediated by the model physics errors in precipitation forcing compensate for using uncorrected vegetation data in exp3 thus resulting in higher skill at the basin outlet the large nse gains for the ccb are attributed to the nonlinear relationship between hydrometeorological regime persistent low level clouds and fog and light rainfall geomorphology extensive alluvial deposits and deep valley soils and water use by vegetation mixed forest with deciduous broad leaf trees the cloudiness corrections of lai and fvc result in better estimates of interception and evapotranspiration and consequently soil moisture more accurate soil moisture conditions result in more accurate runoff response to rainfall and consequently improved streamflow estimation this is also the case for the efprb which also features a wide alluvial valley though the overall performance is dominated by rainfall errors in this case as shown by the large discharge error on september 20th due overestimation of rainfall for late summer convective activity fig 10 a b shows the simulated spatial distributions of intercepted rainfall evaporation and transpiration in the prb using lai and fvc before exp3 and after the adjustment exp1 accumulated over the entire four water years to assess the impact on the regional water budget whereas the magnitude of the cumulative differences is small evapotranspiration et using the adjusted vegetation attributes is always larger than the et using the standard data and the difference is much larger in summer than in winter the increase in et results from large differences in transpiration in the forested areas of the ccb figure s1 in the supplementary file the cumulative evaporation in exp1 is less than that in exp3 using standard data as shown in the 2nd column of fig 10a b indicating that the decrease in evaporation due to reduced bare soil area exceeds the increase in canopy retention over the four water years period higher fvc leads to an overall increase in transpiration as shown by the 3rd column in fig 10a b fig 10c shows the time series of cumulative transpiration evaporation et and runoff averaged over the prb for exp1 and exp3 given the same rainfall input again note the nonlinear trade offs between exp1 and exp3 over the 2007 2011 period among transpiration dark blue 25 overall increase et 6 increase and runoff exiting the prb as streamflow 10 decrease nevertheless the changes in intercepted rainfall evaporation and transpiration also depend on vegetation type for instance transpiration is always very small in urban areas and in mixed use areas of cropland and woody savannahs in the northern section of the basin as indicated in figure s1 in the supplementary file large changes normally occur in mixed and deciduous forests in the inner mountain region where fog forms on a daily basis and thus the standard modis vegetation attributes are more likely to suffer from cloud fog contamination explaining the spatial patterns on the right panels in fig 10a b in summary the accuracy of vegetation attributes lai and fvc directly affects flood response i e high flow scenarios water partitioning at the basin scale and the overall water budget in a nonlinearly complex manner with corrected vegetation attributes the nse of simulated streamflow for ccb is improved by two fold although the improvement for efprb is small and the performance in weprb is comparable or equivalent in addition using corrected and thus realistic lai and fvc leads to increased et by 6 and decreased streamflow by 10 for the whole prb over four water years which imposes complex constraints in water availability from the point of view of regional resilience to drought the simulations presented here provide a first estimate of the error budget that can be attributed to vegetation characteristics in an uncalibrated model these errors and uncertainties can be masked by model calibration which has implications for the fidelity of the hydrological physics simulated by the model potentially leading to misinterpretation of cause effect mechanisms as illustrated for the wfprb previously yildiz and barros 2007 demonstrated that lai and fvc are as important as hydraulic conductivity to capture rainfall runoff response in long term hydrologic simulations using a distributed model with time varying vegetation in the central appalachians the present study explains the chain of interacting processes rainfall interception evapotranspiration soil moisture runoff that leads to improving streamflow prediction from improved vegetation parameters which effectively function as scaling metrics of evapotranspiration 4 2 3 impacts of albedo and emissivity on energy flux simulations in this section the simulations from exp4 conventional treatment and exp5 standard treatment are compared with exp1 constructed realistic data to illustrate the impacts of surface radiative properties i e shortwave broadband albedo and longwave broadband emissivity on simulations of energy fluxes the resultant time series of basin averaged values over the three headwater basins are presented in fig 11 with a focus on the comparison between exp1 and exp4 constructed vs conventional treatment and figure s4 in the supplementary file emphasizing the difference between constructed vs standard treatment of radiative properties see section 3 3 1 the amplitude range of the differences is better captured by the spatial maps in fig 12 a and b over the whole pigeon river basin the constructed hourly albedo values in the early morning or late afternoon are much larger than at lsn and exhibit large diurnal variability with a convex opening up u shape shown in the top row of fig 11 see also fig 7b which is opposite of the diurnal shape for the incoming solar radiation an opening down u shape consequently the net shortwave radiation shows larger diurnal amplitudes when using the constructed hourly albedo exp1 than using the lc dependent static albedo exp4 3rd row in fig 11 during september of 2009 the maximum difference in basin averaged net shortwave radiation is up to 50 w m2 for the three headwater basins the static lc dependent emissivity is lower 0 93 for deciduous broadleaf forest and 0 95 for the mixed forest compared to the adjusted emissivity product around 0 984 0 985 2nd row in fig 11 the lower emissivity in exp4 results in lower outgoing longwave radiation and thus larger net longwave radiation fluxes compared to exp1 this explains the negative difference 13 w m2 to 15 w m2 4th row in fig 11 between the net longwave radiation using adjusted time varying emissivity in exp1 and the fixed static lc dependent emissivity in exp4 overall the negative difference in net longwave radiation explains the negative baseline 13 w m2 to 15 w m2 in the net total radiation difference the 5th row in fig 11 between exp1 and exp4 while the variation in net total radiation difference is still dominated by the large diurnal difference in net shortwave radiation associated with the effects of albedo as a result the basin averaged top soil temperature estimates from exp1 and exp4 are within 0 2 c to 0 1 c in the three headwater basins with diurnal differences following the variations in total net radiation besides examining the impacts of lc dependent emissivity the standard emissivity data directly calculated from modis narrowband emissivity without correction or adjustment was utilized in exp5 for comparison against results using the adjusted emissivity in exp1 as shown in the top row in figure s4 the standard emissivity varies widely due to the cloud contamination of modis observations while the adjusted emissivity is slowly varying with time the differences between the adjusted and standard modis emissivity are much smaller than those between time varying and static lc dependent emissivity thus the differences in net longwave radiation between the two simulations are very small in contrast to their counterparts in fig 11 demonstrating that despite uncertainty the standard time varying modis emissivity leads already to more realistic net radiation simulations than using the static lc dependent emissivity that is conventionally used in hydrologic modeling the complex spatial patterns of differences in net total radiation δnetr between exp1 and exp4 fig 12a and between exp1 and exp5 fig 12b are transferred to sensible heat flux δsh with spatial variability matching the land cover patterns in the prb basin figure s1 in the supplementary file as pointed out earlier lower values of lc dependent emissivity result in larger net longwave radiation in exp4 contributing to larger net total radiation than in exp1 over the three headwater basins thus causing negative differences depicted by the blue tones in δnetr in fig 12a as also shown in some other areas over the prb the positive δnetr brown tones between exp1 and exp4 result from the increase of net shortwave radiation due to the lower albedo in exp1 as compared to the lc dependent albedo used in exp4 e g over ccb since differences between the adjusted exp1 and standard exp5 emissivity are very small and thus the changes in albedo are dominant the δnetr differences between exp1 and exp5 are positive nearly everywhere across the prb basin fig 12b the differences in net radiation are on the order of 5 10 and translate into 10 20 differences in sensible heat flux mirroring the changes in top soil temperature δt0 the dynamic range of the differences between exp1 and exp4 or exp5 in top soil temperature over the whole prb is 1 c 0 5 to 0 5 as indicated by fig 12a b left most panels note that the top soil temperature in the dchm is not the skin temperature proper e g devonec and barros 2002 see also appendix and thus the differences are smaller than what should be expected for the land surface skin temperature even if the difference in the soil temperature estimates in the top layer 5 10 cm depth generally remains 0 5 c at the pixel scale its impacts on regional energy budget and other processes e g photosynthesis are significant especially for long term hydro climatologic studies there is a strong seasonal signature in the time series of prb basin averaged energy fluxes shown in fig 12c for the entire 4 year simulation period because of the seasonal variability of albedo fig 7a and b with larger values from may to september consequently in the spring or winter seasons especially at noon when albedo is low as shown in fig 7 and also top panel in fig 11 and the net solar radiation is large the differences in net solar radiation between exp1 new hourly albedo and exp4 lc dependent albedo are large enough to exceed the negative differences in net longwave radiation due to using lc dependent emissivity as discussed above leading to positive δnetr in fig 12c resulting in a sign switch positive to negative from late spring to early fall see fig 11 for september however when the standard temporally varying modis emissivity was used in exp5 the δnetr sign switch is not observed fig 12d further shows that the positive δnetr pink lines is balanced by increases in sensible heat fluxes thus negative δsh up to 50 w m2 and higher over the four year simulation period in addition the absolute magnitude of δnetr and δsh between exp1 and exp5 is larger than that between exp1 and exp4 because the negative net longwave radiation is much smaller in exp5 when using the standard modis emissivity note exp4 and exp5 have the same vegetation attributes as exp1 and thus differences in latent heat fluxes are very low green lines in fig 12c and 12d compared to other energy balance terms in summary the diurnal variation of the constructed hourly albedo leads to large diurnal amplitudes of differences in the simulated net shortwave radiation and then net total radiation further the seasonal variability of the constructed albedo results in robust seasonality in the differences of simulated energy fluxes e g net total radiation and sensible heat flux over the 4 years simulated the impact of radiative properties on total net radiation includes both the influences on net shortwave radiation and net longwave radiation whereas the absolute magnitude of the sensitivity of total net radiation to albedo is larger than to emissivity e g 50 w m2 vs 15 w m2 in the three headwater basins the changes however significantly vary case by case at pixel scale depending on the differences between the prescribed static and constructed realistic i e temporally and spatially dynamic radiative properties these experiments illustrate the nonlinearity of the interactions among the various terms in the surface energy budget equation both in space and in time and the importance of using time varying radiative properties to capture seasonality 5 conclusions we present an end to end and easy to follow framework to produce continuous quality controlled and gap free landscape attributes datasets including lai fvc surface longwave broadband emissivity and shortwave broadband albedo for hydrologic modeling at a consistent spatiotemporal resolution 1 km 1 km hourly from the modis land products over the iphex domain barros et al 2014 in the se us from 2007 to 2013 the lai and fvc with adjustment i e quality control and adaptive temporal filtering to correct cloud or fog contamination effects exhibit improved space time variability especially for mountainous regions where low level cloud and fog are persistent both the broadband emissivity and albedo show realistic seasonal variability and dependence on land cover the newly constructed hourly broadband albedo exhibits large diurnal variability and shows an overall good agreement with tower observations except in the late afternoon with small underestimation during the winter time further analysis of hydrologic simulations using the uncalibrated dchm demonstrates that quality vegetation attributes lai and fvc result in overall better streamflow simulations at both short and long time scales and that the improvements vary in time and space capturing vegetation controls at different times of the year for different hydrometeorological regimes and physiographic settings specifically the nse of simulated streamflow for a valley basin i e ccb in the inner region of the southern appalachian mountains where persistent cloud and fog contamination strongly affect standard remotely sensed vegetation data is improved by two fold over a short term one month scale and increased by 10 over a long term four water years scale by using the adjusted data in addition we also found that et increases whereas streamflow decreases due to decreases in soil moisture in the simulations with the improved vegetation attributes although the magnitude of the basin integrated decrease in runoff about 139 mm per unit area is relatively small considering the large drainage area of 1778 km2 of the prb the results imply a large change in the water budget corresponding to about 247 142 m3 in four water years this change is a significant volume of freshwater supply from a water resources management perspective it represents roughly 21 days of freshwater demand for the population living in the basin enough to address water needs during the most severe phase of the 2007 drought besides surface radiative properties i e albedo and emissivity have strong impacts on the energy flux simulations the absolute effects on net total radiation combine the influence on net shortwave radiation caused by using constructed temporally and spatially varying albedo and on net longwave radiation caused by using adjusted emissivity relative to conventionally land cover dependent or standard modis emissivity without adjustment they are however dominated by the large diurnal differences in net shortwave radiation associated with the effects of albedo for instance the simulated basin average net shortwave radiation using land cover dependent albedo is much smaller up to 50 w m2 than using the new dynamic albedo in the three headwater basins persistent differences in the net total radiation over the whole prb translate into robust seasonal biases compared against the standard or conventional treatment for radiative properties impacting the simulations of top soil temperature and surface energy fluxes the results also demonstrate that using the time varying standard modis emissivity without post processing is already superior to using static land cover based emissivity nonetheless model simulations are inevitably influenced by hydrometeorological forcing uncertainty specifically rainfall uncertainty and thus the results presented here are still limited by residual uncertainties imperfect model structure and forcing uncertainty mainly attributed to rainfall as discussed in section 4 2 1 this could be addressed in the future by further improving and correcting rainfall data for example using data assimilation as proposed by tao et al 2016 even in the highly idealistic scenario of perfect quantitative precipitation estimates qpes and quantitative precipitation forecasts qpfs hydrological models cannot resolve the water and energy flux estimations accurately if the landscape attributes are biased or are not representative of the real conditions of the land surface due to cloud contamination or spurious calibration which is particularly handicapping for long term hydroclimate assessments thus regionally corrected spatially and temporally varying vegetation and radiative properties reflect the dynamic nature of the earth s surface should be routinely incorporated in modeling and forecast activities data availability all the data necessary to conduct such study are available from iphex pratt edu and duke university

appendix a abbreviated model description the duke coupled surface groundwater hydrology model dchm is a fully distributed and physically based land surface hydrologic model solving water and energy

rate generally evapotranspiration occurs at much slower rates due to resistances of soil vegetation and snow cover therefore correction factors are applied to the equation in order to convert the potential estimates of latent heat fluxes to actual values given the total evapotranspiration rate lh can be written as ap5 l h l v e t where the total evapotranspiration e t is expressed as a
